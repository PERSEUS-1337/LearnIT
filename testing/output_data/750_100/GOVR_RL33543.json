    "content": "The report discusses the modernization of U.S. military tactical aircraft, including fighter aircraft, strike fighters, and attack planes. These aircraft are crucial for U.S. military capability and represent a significant portion of defense spending. The current focus is on three aircraft acquisition programs: the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program, the Air Force F-22 fighter program, and the Navy F/A-18E/F strike fighter program. Program-specific issues for Congress in FY2010 include the F-35, F-22, and F/A-18E/F. In FY2010, Congress faces decisions on the F-35, F-22, and F/A-18E/F programs, including whether to terminate the alternate engine for the F-35, continue F-22 procurement, and approve Navy's funding request for F/A-18E/Fs. The FY2010-FY2014 MYP arrangement includes procurement of F/A-18E/Fs and EA-18Gs. Legislative activity for F-35, F-22, and F/A-18E/F programs is covered in CRS reports. The central issue is the affordability of DOD's modernization plans for tactical aircraft. The key issues regarding the Department of Defense's plans for modernizing tactical aircraft include affordability and the future of the U.S. industrial base. Tactical aircraft are shorter-ranged combat aircraft that operate within regional theaters of operations. Strategic aircraft, on the other hand, are larger and longer-ranged aircraft like the Air Force B-52, B-1, and B-2. Tactical aircraft, such as fighters and attack planes, are designed for shorter-ranged missions within regional theaters of operations. They are distinct from strategic aircraft like the Air Force B-52, B-1, and B-2 bombers, which are used for long-range missions, including intercontinental flights. Tactical aircraft, like fighters and attack planes, are designed for air-to-air and air-to-ground combat. They can have designations like \"F\" for air-to-air, \"F/A\" for dual-role, or \"A\" for air-to-ground operations. Air Force tactical aircraft operate from land bases, while Navy tactical aircraft are conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) aircraft. Marine Corps tactical aircraft are operated from Navy ships and land bases, including short runways. Some are VSTOL or STOVL aircraft used for various missions like air-to-air combat and air-to-ground operations, including close air support for ground forces. The Air Force conducts combat operations such as close air support, battlefield air interdiction, and deep interdiction. They operate F-22 fighters, F-15 fighters, F-15E strike fighters, F-16 fighters, and A-10 aircraft for various missions including air-to-air and air-to-ground operations. The Navy and Marine Corps operate F/A-18 strike fighters and AV-8B attack planes. The Department of Defense had approximately 3,500 tactical aircraft in early 2009, with the Air Force having about 2,375 and the Navy and Marine Corps having about 1,125. Current efforts for modernizing U.S. tactical aircraft focus on three programs - the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), the Air Force F-22 fighter, and the Navy F/A-18E/F strike fighter. The F-35, known as the Lighting II, is being procured in different versions for the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy to provide a cost-effective fifth-generation strike fighter solution. The F-35 program is the DOD's largest weapon procurement program, with plans to acquire 2,456 JSFs for the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy at an estimated cost of $246 billion. The Air Force is procuring the F-35A as a replacement for the F-16s and A-10s, aiming for a more affordable solution. The F-35 program is the DOD's largest weapon procurement program, with plans to acquire 2,456 JSFs for the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy at an estimated cost of $246 billion. The Air Force is procuring the F-35A as a replacement for the F-16s and A-10s, aiming for a more affordable solution. The Marine Corps is getting the F-35B to replace F/A-18A-D and AV-8B Harrier VSTOL planes, while the Navy is getting the F-35C for carrier operations. The FY2010 budget includes funding for 30 F-35s across the branches. The F-22 fighter, also known as the Raptor, is a fifth-generation aircraft with advanced capabilities like stealth, supercruise, and thrust-vectoring. A total of 187 F-22s have been procured through FY2009, with no additional procurement planned in FY2010. The F/A-18E/F, also known as the Super Hornet, is a Navy strike fighter that is larger, more modern, and more capable than earlier F/A-18A-D Hornets. Supporters aim to procure additional F-22s in FY2010 to reach a goal of 243 to 250 aircraft. The Navy's aircraft carrier air wings consist of more than 40 Hornets and Super Hornets out of 70 aircraft. The Navy has been acquiring F/A-18E/F Super Hornets since FY1997, with a total of 449 purchased by FY2009. The proposed FY2010 budget included funding for nine F/A-18E/Fs. Air Force officials projected a fighter shortfall of up to 800 aircraft by 2024, while Navy officials anticipated a peak shortfall of over 100 aircraft by 2018. Some have questioned the Air Force's projection of an 800-aircraft shortfall. Observers have questioned the Air Force's projection of an 800-aircraft shortfall, suggesting that assumptions about military threats and organizational constraints drive the demand for more fighter aircraft. The Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall depends on service life extensions for Hornets and procurement rates of F-35Cs and F-35Bs. The Air Force announced a combat air forces restructuring plan to retire 249 older tactical aircraft, including F-15s, F-16s, and A-10s, to generate savings for other program needs. This plan does not include the retirement of five fighters proposed in the FY2010 budget submission. Briefing slides on the plan are available in the Appendix. In the year 2010 budget proposal, the Air Force announced plans to retire legacy fighters, including F-15 Eagles, F-16 Fighting Falcons, and A-10 Thunderbolt IIs, to fund a smaller and more capable force. This restructuring plan aims to redistribute personnel for higher priority missions and accelerate the retirement of approximately 250 aircraft. The Air Force's plan involves retiring legacy fighters like F-15 Eagles and F-16 Fighting Falcons to fund a more flexible and lethal force with cost savings of $355 million in FY10 and $3.5 billion over the next five years. The funds will be used for advanced capability modifications to remaining fighters and bombers, as well as procuring munitions for joint warfighters. The Air Force plans to retire legacy fighters like F-15 Eagles and F-16 Fighting Falcons to fund a more flexible and lethal force. This includes advanced capability modifications to remaining fighters and bombers, as well as procuring munitions for joint warfighters. A portion of the funds will be dedicated to critical intelligence capabilities and enabling technologies for tactical air controllers and special operations forces. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Norton Schwartz emphasized the importance of modernizing the fighter force due to the erosion of the Air Force's advantage over potential adversaries.

Norton Schwartz emphasized the importance of modernizing the fighter force due to the erosion of the Air Force's advantage over potential adversaries. The CAF restructuring plan aims to move manpower authorizations to emerging missions like surveillance and nuclear deterrence, expanding aircrews and squadrons for improved capabilities. The Air Force is planning to retire legacy fighters like F-15 Eagles and F-16 Fighting Falcons to fund a more flexible and lethal force. This includes advanced capability modifications to remaining fighters and bombers, as well as procuring munitions for joint warfighters. Secretary Donley and General Schwartz are committed to initiatives to reinvigorate the Air Force's nuclear enterprise and field 50 unmanned combat air patrols by FY11. They aim to meet current mission requirements while preparing for future challenges. The overall affordability of DOD's plans for modernizing tactical aircraft is a key concern for Congress. Observers predict a budget \"train wreck\" as funding may not be sufficient for acquisition plans. Affordability was previously focused on F-35, F-22, and F/A-18E/F programs, but as production winds down, the issue persists. The affordability of DOD's plans for modernizing tactical aircraft, particularly the F-35 program, is a key concern for Congress as production of the F-22 and F/A-18E/F winds down. DOD aims to increase F-35 procurement rates, but past plans have been adjusted to lower costs by acquiring fewer new aircraft. The reduction in planned aircraft acquisitions is due to post-Cold War cuts in Air Force and Navy air wings. The Navy-Marine Corps Tactical Air Integration Plan also contributed to fewer new aircraft purchases. The F-35 program is a major initiative to lower costs for tactical aircraft modernization. The Department of Defense's tactical aircraft modernization plan may not be affordable due to uncertain future defense budgets. The Air Force and Navy-Marine Corps face projected fighter shortfalls, indicating ongoing challenges with affordability. The affordability of DOD's tactical aircraft modernization plans may lead to funding tradeoffs with non-aircraft systems that can perform similar missions. Examples include surface-to-air missile systems, surface-to-surface missiles, rockets, artillery, ship-based guns, and land-attack cruise missiles. Funding for tactical aircraft acquisition programs may face tradeoffs with other aircraft like long-range bombers or helicopters for air-to-ground missions. Some suggest shifting funding towards long-range aircraft due to improving regional anti-access capabilities. The affordability of DOD's plans for procuring new aircraft of all types, including tactical aircraft, is a concern for some observers. There is a debate over funding for aircraft intended for different missions, such as airlift, aerial refueling, electronic attack, airborne warning, surveillance, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs). UAVs have become increasingly important in surveillance and reconnaissance operations. UCAVs have gained importance in ground-attack operations, especially for precision strikes on terrorist targets. DOD plans to prioritize UAVs and UCAVs for irregular warfare capabilities. There is a debate over funding for Air Force and Navy tactical aircraft acquisition programs. The administration's proposal to end F-22 procurement at 187 aircraft and focus on F-35A procurement is seen as a tradeoff between land-based and sea-based tactical aircraft funding. Funding for F-35s, F-22s, and F/A-18E/Fs is being debated. The DOD is considering tradeoffs between funding for procurement of F-35s, F-22s, and F/A-18E/Fs versus service life extensions or procurement of upgraded models of older-design tactical aircraft like upgraded F-15s, F-16s, and additional F/A-18E/Fs. These tradeoffs raise questions about costs, capabilities, and technical feasibility. The U.S. military is reviewing its goals and objectives in the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), with a focus on preparing for irregular warfare operations and conventional interstate conflict. One key issue is how force elements like tactical aircraft relate to these planning areas. In the post-Cold War era, there is a debate over the need for high-capability tactical aircraft in favor of investing in UAVs, UCAVs, special operations helicopters, and other equipment for counterinsurgency and anti-terrorism operations. Some argue that high-capability tactical aircraft are still necessary due to potential adversaries having Russian aircraft and SAMs. Concerns arise from China and India acquiring advanced fighter aircraft and SAMs, potentially challenging U.S. airpower in the future. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) examined DOD's investment planning for acquiring new tactical aircraft and modernizing existing ones, with a planned expenditure of $109.3 billion over the next 7 years. This is in response to concerns about potential adversaries like China and India acquiring advanced fighter aircraft and SAMs that could challenge U.S. airpower in the future. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) examined DOD's investment planning for acquiring new tactical aircraft and modernizing existing ones, with a planned expenditure of $109.3 billion over the next 7 years. Significant cost increases, schedule delays, and changes in requirements have reduced procurement quantities of new aircraft, with the F-22A development period doubling and unit costs more than doubling. Similar challenges are emerging for the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), which is crucial for future modernization efforts. The JSF is essential for future modernization efforts, but its development costs have increased by $31.6 billion since 2004, with procurement and delivery schedules slipping. Funding needs for new and legacy aircraft are interdependent, requiring sustained support for legacy systems until new ones are ready. If new aircraft quantities are reduced or deliveries delayed further, additional unplanned funds will be needed to maintain and modernize legacy systems. The services are investing about $1.7 billion per year on legacy modifications over the next seven years. There are large pent up demands for unfunded requirements and potential life extension programs. Hard decisions on retiring or extending the life of legacy aircraft must be made soon. DOD does not have a single plan for modernization efforts. The Department of Defense lacks a comprehensive investment plan for modernizing fighter and attack aircraft. Each military service operates independently to fill its force structure needs, such as the Air Force's air and space expeditionary wings, the Navy's carrier strike forces, and the Marines' expeditionary forces. The military services have underperformed in delivering aircraft within desired costs and quantities. Future plans may be unaffordable within projected funding levels, as they rely on unrealistic assumptions about cost, quantity, and delivery schedules for new acquisitions. Future federal discretionary spending is projected to decline, making it challenging to increase and sustain funding levels substantially above current levels. The military services are struggling to deliver aircraft within desired costs and quantities, with future plans potentially becoming unaffordable due to unrealistic assumptions. The Department of Defense is facing competing demands for funds, including for strategic tanker aircraft and long-range strike systems. GAO recommends DOD take decisive actions to shorten development cycle times and ensure the sustainability of tactical air forces. GAO recommends that DOD shorten cycle times for developing new tactical aircraft and create an integrated investment strategy for tactical air forces. The Congressional Budget Office conducted a study on fighter force capabilities and costs under DOD's fiscal year 2009 plans, highlighting potential budget and inventory implications if planned aircraft purchases are insufficient to maintain required inventory levels. The Congressional Budget Office conducted a study on modernizing fighter forces, comparing seven alternative approaches. The report highlights the advantages, disadvantages, and costs of these approaches to meet current service requirements and increase capability over time. The Congressional Budget Office studied modernizing fighter forces, comparing seven approaches to increase capability. Modernized fleets would have advanced aircraft with increased payload capacity and stealth capabilities, but unrefueled ranges may not increase significantly. Fighter inventories may fall below service goals under DoD's fiscal year 2009 procurement plans. The Congressional Budget Office studied modernizing fighter forces, comparing seven approaches to increase capability. Despite potential inventory shortfalls in the coming years, enhanced lethality and survivability from new fighters could maintain or improve aggregate capabilities. Alternative approaches like purchasing additional F/A-18E/F Super Hornets or upgraded versions of legacy aircraft could provide short-term relief and long-term cost benefits. Replacing some fighters with subsonic attack aircraft could offer short-term inventory relief and long-term cost savings, with improved basing flexibility and persistence during air-to-ground missions. This approach may not provide as significant capability improvements in survivability compared to purchasing JSFs. Fighters with smaller numbers of attack aircraft could provide air-to-ground weapons capacities comparable to current forces at costs similar to DoD's plans. However, these forces would have fewer aircraft capable of air-to-air combat. Congress also needs to consider the impact of tactical aircraft acquisition decisions on the U.S. military aircraft manufacturing industry, which employs thousands of workers. Decisions on tactical aircraft acquisition programs can impact the aircraft manufacturing industry, with concerns about potential reduction to one prime contractor. The potential impact of reducing the number of tactical aircraft prime contractors on competition, innovation, prices, schedule adherence, and production quality in future U.S. aircraft development and procurement is a key concern for Congress. Questions include the need for multiple prime contractors, the value of competition at the prime contractor level, and the potential for firms like Boeing to leverage their experience in designing and building other aircraft to maintain essential skills for effective competition. The curr_chunk discusses legislative activity for FY2010 related to tactical aircraft modernization. It mentions the requirement for DOD to submit a report to Congress. The House passed H.R. 2647, which includes a provision requiring the Department of Defense to report to Congress on the procurement of \"4.5\"-generation aircraft, specifically F-15s, F-16s, and F/A-18s with upgrades. The report must detail the number of these aircraft needed for fiscal years 2011 through 2025 to meet Air Force requirements. The Department of Defense is required to report to Congress on the procurement of \"4.5\"-generation aircraft, detailing the number needed for fiscal years 2011 through 2025 to meet Air Force requirements, including estimated procurement costs and potential savings from multiyear contracts. The Secretary will provide recommendations to Congress on authorizing a multiyear procurement contract for 4.5 generation fighter aircraft, along with necessary certifications. The Secretary will recommend a \nmultiyear procurement contract for 4.5 generation fighter aircraft to Congress, including certifications required by section 2306b of title 10, United States Code for fiscal year 2011. The term '4.5 generation fighter aircraft' refers to current fighter aircraft with advanced capabilities and the ability to deploy advanced armaments. Section 1032 mandates a report on force structure findings from the 2009 Quadrennial Defense Review. The committee's report on the force structure findings of the 2009 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) expects detailed analyses on all elements of the force structure, including factors influencing decisions on fighter force structure for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. This includes threat capabilities, modeling simulations, and unmanned aerial capabilities. The committee's report on force structure findings of the 2009 Quadrennial Defense Review expects detailed analyses on fighter force structure for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps, including unmanned aerial capabilities. Section 1047 prohibits the Air Force from retiring fighter aircraft until a report is submitted to Congress. SEC. 1047 prohibits the retirement of fighter aircraft by the Air Force until a report is submitted to Congress. Personnel associated with the restructuring plan cannot be reassigned during this period. The Air Force is prohibited from retiring fighter aircraft until a report is submitted to Congress. Funds are allocated for the continued operation and maintenance of 249 fighter aircraft scheduled for retirement in fiscal year 2010. Additionally, funds are set aside for any necessary modifications to sustain these aircraft. The report must detail plans to address force structure and capability gaps resulting from fighter aircraft retirement, assess current threat environment and capabilities, outline follow-on mission assignments for affected bases, explain criteria for base and fighter selection, describe ongoing environmental analyses, and identify affected bases. The curr_chunk discusses the funding needed for operation and maintenance costs, personnel, and aircraft procurement from 2010 to 2015 if the restructuring plan is not implemented. It also includes an estimate of cost avoidance and how the funds would be invested to ensure the remaining fighter force's desired service life. The curr_chunk discusses the defense plan for modernizing the fighter force and exceptions for certain aircraft, while Section 1051 expresses Congress's sense on Navy carrier air wing force structure. The Navy must maintain at least 11 operational aircraft carriers, which includes 10 carrier air wings with a minimum of 44 strike fighter aircraft each. Despite the potential benefits of fifth-generation aircraft, most of the carrier air wing's strike fighters will not be fifth-generation assets. Congress acknowledges the importance of these forces in the defense plan for modernizing the fighter force. The House Armed Services Committee report summarizes that the Navy should maintain at least 10 carrier air wings with a minimum of 44 strike fighter aircraft each, even if the number of aircraft carriers is temporarily reduced. The Secretary of the Navy is required to ensure resources are available for this purpose. The report highlights concerns about the Air Force's plans to retire 249 legacy fighter aircraft in fiscal year 2010, including 112 F-15s, 134 F-16s, and 3 A-10s. This could result in gaps in force structure and capability as replacement aircraft are still being tested and not yet available for fielding. The committee is concerned about gaps in force structure and capability due to the Air Force's plans to retire legacy fighter aircraft. They have identified $344.6 million in unjustified program growth and unexecutable peacetime operations in the Air Force budget. The committee recommends using $344.6 million for the operation and maintenance of 249 legacy fighters slated for retirement in 2010. An additional $10.5 million is recommended for aircraft modifications. The Air Force projects a shortfall in its fighter aircraft inventory. The committee recommends funding for legacy fighters slated for retirement in 2010 and aircraft modifications. A projected shortfall in fighter aircraft inventory will impact active duty and reserve forces' ability to meet future requirements. The Secretary of the Air Force is directed to provide a report to congressional defense committees by March 1, 2010. The report due by March 1, 2010, should address the \"fighter gap\" issue with solutions like accelerated procurement of fifth generation fighters, interim procurement of \"4.5 generation\" fighters, and fleet management options. It must analyze the impact of any shortfalls on the Air National Guard and the air sovereignty alert mission. The report expresses concerns about the projected Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall, with a fiscal year 2009 shortfall of 110 aircraft and a predicted fiscal year 2010 shortfall of 152 aircraft. This could result in the loss of Air National Guard flying missions and pilot and maintenance capability. The committee predicts a fiscal year 2010 shortfall of 152 aircraft, with a potential peak strike-fighter shortfall of 312 aircraft by fiscal year 2018. Factors contributing to the shortfall include decisions to reduce F/A-18A through D inventory and delays in the F-35B/C program. The committee finds these naval strike-fighter shortfalls unacceptable. The committee remains unconvinced that naval strike-fighter shortfalls should be viewed against the totality of Department of Defense strike-fighter inventory. The capabilities of the naval strike-fighter force are inherent in the capability of the aircraft carrier as a strike platform. The committee supports procurement of additional F/A-18E/F aircraft to mitigate the naval strike-fighter inventory shortfall. The committee supports the procurement of additional F/A-18E/F aircraft through a multi-year contract to address naval strike-fighter inventory shortfalls and maintain carrier air wings. The Senate Armed Services Committee directs the Department of the Navy to maintain at least ten carrier air wings with 44 strike-fighters each. A report is requested to evaluate extending the service-life of F/A-18A through D aircraft versus procuring additional F/A-18E/F aircraft. The Senate Armed Services Committee is concerned about the Navy facing a significant gap in aircraft inventory as older F/A-18A-D Hornets retire before the F-35C variant is available. This issue has been raised in previous committee reports on defense authorization bills. The Senate Armed Services Committee is concerned about the Navy's aircraft inventory gap as older F/A-18A-D Hornets retire before the F-35C variant is available. The committee is disappointed in the Navy's failure to provide a report comparing single versus multiyear procurement costs as mandated. Last year, the Navy projected a shortfall of 69 tactical aircraft in 2017, which increases to 125 when including Marine Corps requirements. The committee questions the validity of the Navy's shortfall projection due to questionable assumptions. The Chief of Naval Operations stated that the projected aircraft gap for the Department of the Navy could reach 250. The Senate Armed Services Committee is concerned about the Navy's failure to address this increased shortfall in its tactical air fleet, which poses a potential risk to national security. The shortfall projection is based on the F-35C achieving initial operational capability in 2015, but many observers consider this timeline optimistic. The Navy's delay in addressing the projected aircraft gap for the Department of the Navy is causing concern as it continues to accept security risks and relies on costly measures to mitigate the shortfall until the F-35C achieves full operational capability. The committee is worried about the lack of realistic and fiscally responsible long-term procurement plans to address the carrier strike aircraft shortfall. The Navy is considering extending the life of select legacy F/A-18 aircraft to 10,000 flight hours through a costly SLEP, raising concerns about cost uncertainties and the feasibility of reaching this goal. The committee is concerned about the cost uncertainties of a SLEP to achieve an additional 1,400 flight hours for legacy F/A-18 aircraft. They believe that procuring new F/A-18E/F's may be more cost-efficient, costing less than $50.0 million each in 2009 constant dollars. A SLEP for the additional 1,400 hours would cost approximately $18,571 per flight hour gained, while a new F/A-18E/F would cost $8,333 per flight hour provided. The committee believes the Navy should carefully evaluate costs and benefits of new F/A-18E/F procurements compared to investing in a SLEP of legacy aircraft. New F/A-18E/F models offer improved technological capabilities such as active electronically scanned array radar, modernized avionics, advanced aerial refueling system capability, and added weapon hard points. The Navy projects that the F/A-18E/F will remain in the fleet until at least 2040, with the Department of Defense intending to review tactical aircraft forces in the pending Quadrennial Defense Review. The committee expects the Department to analyze multiyear procurement for the F/A-18 as directed in the committee report last year. The committee expects the Department to analyze multiyear procurement for the F/A-18E/F, considering cost differentials and tradeoffs with SLEP. Tactical aviation procurement strategies should be informed by the Quadrennial Defense Review, with actions to address the strike-fighter shortfall not delayed. The committee expects prompt action to address the strike-fighter shortfall, with a provision in H.R. 2647 requiring a report on 4.5-generation fighter aircraft procurement. Additionally, a report on force structure findings from the 2009 Quadrennial Defense Review is also mandated. The committee expects action on the strike-fighter shortfall, with a report on 4.5-generation fighter aircraft procurement required by H.R. 2647. Additionally, a report on force structure findings from the 2009 Quadrennial Defense Review is mandated. The report includes details on decisions regarding fighter force structure for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps, with specific sections addressing Air Force fighter aircraft retirement, Navy carrier air wing force structure, and procurement of 4.5 generation fighter aircraft. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report to Congress on the procurement of 4.5 generation fighter aircraft, including the number needed to maintain 2,200 tactical fighter aircraft, estimated procurement costs through annual and multiyear contracts, and potential savings from procurement. The report to Congress on the procurement of 4.5 generation fighter aircraft includes estimated savings from multiyear contracts, cost comparisons between annual and multiyear contracts, and the feasibility of procuring F-35 aircraft for the Air National Guard. The term \"4.5 generation fighter aircraft\" refers to advanced fighter aircraft like the F-15, F-16, and F-18 with AESA radar, data-link, and enhanced avionics capabilities, able to deploy advanced armaments. The Secretary of Defense is required to submit a report on force structure findings alongside the 2009 quadrennial defense review to Congress. The Secretary of Defense must provide a report to Congress with analyses supporting force structure findings and changes in major military capabilities from the previous quadrennial defense review. The term \"major military capabilities\" includes capabilities determined by the Secretary, discussed in the 2006 quadrennial defense review, and described in specific sections of title 10, United States Code. Section 1075 of title 10, United States Code prohibits the retirement of fighter aircraft and reassignment of Air Force personnel until the Secretary of the Air Force submits a report as per subsection (b). This is in relation to the Combat Air Forces restructuring plan announced on May 18, 2009. The Air Force is prohibited from reassigning personnel associated with the Combat Air Forces restructuring plan until a report is submitted. The report must include a detailed plan to address force structure and capability gaps, an assessment of the current threat environment and capabilities, descriptions of follow-on mission assignments for affected bases, and criteria used for selecting affected personnel. The report must include a plan for addressing force structure gaps, criteria for selecting affected personnel, environmental analyses, manpower authorizations, and funding estimates for the restructuring plan. The report must include a plan for addressing force structure gaps, criteria for selecting affected personnel, environmental analyses, manpower authorizations, and funding estimates for the restructuring plan. Cost avoidance and investment of funds for the future defense plan to modernize the fighter force are also discussed. The prohibition on retiring five fighter aircraft in fiscal year 2010 is exempted. Congress expresses its findings on carrier air wing force structure in Section 1076. The Department of the Navy is required to maintain at least 11 operational aircraft carriers, with a commitment to 10 carrier air wings consisting of 44 strike-fighter aircraft per wing. Congress believes the Navy should meet the requirement for 10 carrier air wings even if the number of aircraft carriers is temporarily reduced. The Department of the Navy must maintain 11 operational aircraft carriers with 10 carrier air wings, each consisting of at least 44 strike-fighter aircraft. Congress and the Secretary of the Navy should ensure the current requirement for carrier air wings is met, even if the number of carriers is temporarily reduced. The Secretary of the Navy must provide Congress with a justification for any proposed modifications to the carrier air wing force structure. The Department of the Air Force plans to transition to a smaller, more flexible, and capable strike fighter force, which will be challenging. The Air Force may consider procuring additional 4.5 generation fighter aircraft under a multiyear contract if necessary conditions are met. The conferees intend for the Air Force to analyze the potential for a multiyear purchase of additional 4.5 generation fighter aircraft, including the F-15, F-16, and F-18 with advanced capabilities, without modifying existing requirements under Section 2306b of title 10, United States Code. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about the lack of detail and analysis provided to Congress regarding the Air Force's proposed combat forces restructuring plan to retire 248 legacy F-15, F-16, and A-10 aircraft. The House Appropriations Committee raised concerns about the Air Force's plan to retire F-15, F-16, and A-10 aircraft, citing lack of detail and analysis. They are worried about the potential costs and timing of the restructuring, especially with pending reports and the upcoming Quadrennial Defense Review. The Committee is concerned about the Air Force proposal to remove F-15 pilot training from Tyndall Air Force Base and directs the Department to provide a cost benefit analysis within 180 days. The analysis will include factors impacting training quantity and quality at Tyndall Air Force Base and Kingsley Field in Oregon. The Committee requests the establishment and maintenance of Basic Crew Chief Training, Air Control Squadron Training, and Intelligence Formal Training. The report should analyze simulator and ancillary training access, impact on instructor base quality, future military construction requirements, and costs due to varying training environments. Additionally, the Department is asked to identify airfields sharing runways for Air Force and commercial operations in the continental United States and provide analysis on training and operational mission impacts at bases. The Committee directs an independent review by a Federally Funded Research and Development Center on the impact of the restructure on the Nation's combat air forces. The Secretary of the Air Force is required to provide reports on the training and operational mission impacts at bases with shared runways. No funds may be obligated on executing the Combat Air Force restructure until all directed reports are submitted to the congressional defense committees. The report highlights the Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall due to high operational tempo in overseas contingencies, causing F-18 aircraft to age faster than planned. This has led to critical shortages in the strike fighter inventory, with delays in the introduction of the F-35 aircraft. The Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter inventory faces critical shortages due to high operational tempo, causing F-18 aircraft to age faster than planned. Delays in the F-35 introduction have worsened the shortfall, now estimated to be over 200 aircraft, exceeding last year's prediction of 125. Challenges with life extension of older F-18 variants and reduced F-18 purchases in fiscal year 2010 contribute to the growing shortfall. The Navy faces critical shortages in its F-18 aircraft inventory due to high operational tempo and delays in the F-35 introduction. The reduction in F-18 purchases in fiscal year 2010 adds to the growing shortfall, despite the production line for F/A-18E/F variant aircraft still being open. The unit price difference between annual and multi-year procurement is substantial.
