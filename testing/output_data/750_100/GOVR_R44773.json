    "content": "The process of appointing a Justice to the Supreme Court of the United States is outlined in the Constitution's \"Appointments Clause.\" The President nominates a candidate, who must then be confirmed by the Senate to receive a lifetime appointment. This process has remained unchanged for over two centuries. The most recent vacancy on the Court was due to the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. President Obama nominated Merrick Garland to replace Justice Scalia on the Supreme Court, but Senate Republicans, led by Mitch McConnell and Chuck Grassley, refused to consider the nomination until after the next presidential election. Senator Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, believes the next Supreme Court Justice should be chosen by the American people through the upcoming presidential election. Minority Leader Harry Reid disagrees, urging President Obama to nominate someone immediately. President Obama asks for a fair hearing and vote for his nominee, Merrick Garland. President Obama nominated Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court, urging the Senate to give him a fair hearing and vote. However, the nomination was not acted upon by the Senate and was ultimately returned to President Obama. In February 2017, President Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch to fill the vacancy. Neil M. Gorsuch, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, has been nominated to fill the Scalia vacancy on the Supreme Court. The nomination is currently pending before the Senate. This report analyzes the frequency of vacancies on the Court, the length of past vacancies, and the history of nominations before the Senate. Since President George Washington's initial six appointments to the Supreme Court in 1789 and 1790, a vacancy on the Court has occurred, on average, every two years. During the post-War period (1946 to the present), a vacancy on the Court has occurred. Since President George Washington's initial six appointments to the Supreme Court in 1789 and 1790, vacancies have occurred on average every 2.4 years. In recent years, vacancies have occurred slightly less frequently, every 3.1 years. The time between the vacancies created by the retirement of Justice John Paul Stevens in 2010 and Justice Scalia's death in 2016 is the fifth longest period ever on the Court, specifically 2,054 days or 5.6 years. Justices on the Supreme Court typically hold lifetime appointments. Justices on the Supreme Court typically hold lifetime appointments, often choosing to serve until death. Historically, 42% of vacancies have occurred due to a sitting Justice's death. Since 1791, 58% of vacancies on the Supreme Court have occurred for reasons other than a sitting Justice's death, such as retirement or new judgeships created by Congress. In the past 60 years, only 8% of vacancies were due to a Justice's death, with the passing of Justice Scalia being the second instance during this period. Vacancies on the Supreme Court have historically been caused by various reasons, with only a small percentage attributed to a sitting Justice's death. Prior to recent years, it was more common for vacancies to arise from a Justice's death. Between 1791 and 1899, 59% of vacancies occurred this way, and from 1900 to 1955, 43% of vacancies were due to a Justice's death. Vacancies on the Supreme Court have varied in duration, with the average vacancy lasting 121 days. The shortest vacancy lasted 1 day, while the longest lasted 835 days. Vacancies historically lasted longer before the 20th century compared to the 20th and 21st centuries. Since the 20th century, vacancies on the Supreme Court have lasted an average of 77 days, with the Scalia vacancy currently at 382 days, making it the seventh longest in history. Figure 3 displays the 10 longest vacancies, with 7 occurring in the 1800s or earlier. The Scalia vacancy on the Supreme Court is currently the longest at 382 days, making it the seventh longest in history. Since 1791, the average time from nomination to final Senate action for Court nominations has been 28 days. Since 1791, the average time from nomination to final Senate action for Court nominations has been 28 days, with variations over time. For example, prior to 1900, nominations waited an average of 18 days, while since 1956, nominations have waited an average of 67 days. Figure 3 displays the 10 longest nominations pending for a Supreme Court vacancy. The Scalia vacancy is currently the seventh longest vacancy on the Court. Judge Garland's nomination was pending for 293 days, the longest for any Supreme Court vacancy since 1791. Judge Gorsuch's nomination has been pending for 28 days. Six out of the 10 nominations were not approved by the Senate. The Senate had 10 nominations pending, with 6 not approved. The longest-pending nomination was Louis Brandeis in 1916. A vacancy can last a long time without a nomination pending. For example, Justice John McLean's vacancy lasted 295 days, but Noah H. Swayne's nomination was confirmed in just 3 days. The Senate had 10 nominations pending, with 6 not approved. The longest-pending nomination was Louis Brandeis in 1916. Vacancies on the Supreme Court during presidential election years are rare, with a total of 16 out of 111 vacancies arising during such years. For example, Justice Smith Thompson's vacancy lasted 424 days, but the cumulative time for the six nominations for that vacancy was 190 days. Since 1791, there have been a total of 9 vacancies on the Supreme Court during a presidential election year where the vacancy occurred before the general election and the President nominated someone to fill the position. The Scalia vacancy is one of three vacancies on the Supreme Court that occurred during a presidential election year before the general election, where the President nominated someone to fill the position. Since the first vacancy in 1791, there have been nine vacancies on the Court during presidential election years, with eight of them being confirmed by the Senate in the election year itself. One recent example is the vacancy in 1987, filled by Anthony M. Kennedy. In 1968, President Johnson nominated Abe Fortas to be Chief Justice and Homer Thornberry to be an Associate Justice in anticipation of vacancies on the Supreme Court. However, after the Senate failed to confirm Fortas, both nominations were withdrawn. Chief Justice Warren did not retire until 1969. Prior to the Scalia vacancy, there have been seven vacancies on the Supreme Court that arose during one presidency and were filled during a different administration, representing approximately 6% of all vacancies filled on the Court since 1791. The last time this occurred was in 1881 when Justice Nathan Clifford's death created a vacancy on the Court. Nathan Clifford created a vacancy on the Court in 1881, which was eventually filled by President Arthur. Prior to the Scalia vacancy, the last time a Supreme Court vacancy arose during one presidency and was filled during a different administration was in 1862. The vacancy created by Justice Peter Daniel in 1860 was not filled until the second year of Lincoln's presidency in 1862, during the onset of the Civil War. Vacancies during the \"Second Party System\" occurred from 1828 to 1854, while those during the \"Modern Party System\" occurred from 1854 to the present. The Scalia vacancy, which occurred during the presidency of Obama, lasted 342 days until he left office. This was the longest vacancy among Supreme Court vacancies that arose during one presidency and were filled during a different presidency. Most departing Presidents listed in the figure nominated a replacement for the vacancy during their term. During their presidencies, six out of eight Presidents, including Obama, nominated a replacement for Supreme Court vacancies before leaving office. The number of days reported for each vacancy does not reflect the total duration it remained unfilled. For example, the Baldwin vacancy during Tyler's presidency lasted 317 days before he left office, although the total vacancy duration was 835 days. Similarly, the Scalia vacancy during Obama's presidency lasted 342 days. Since 1791, vacancies on the Supreme Court may not be filled after just one nomination, sometimes requiring multiple nominations before a new Justice is appointed. The Scalia vacancy during Obama's presidency lasted 342 days, and as of March 1, 2017, the vacancy will have lasted 382 days. Since 1791, there have been 20 vacancies on the Supreme Court that required multiple nominations before being filled. The Scalia vacancy is the most recent example of this, lasting 342 days during Obama's presidency. Figure 6 displays 12 vacancies since 1860 that needed more than one nomination before a new Justice was appointed. Six of the vacancies on the Supreme Court occurred between 1860 and 1899, one between 1900 and 1955, and five between 1956 and 2016. Six vacancies involved the Senate rejecting nominations, four involved the President withdrawing nominations, and one nominee died before taking office. The Scalia vacancy is unique as the only one with a nomination returned to the Senate. The vacancy on the Supreme Court with a nomination returned to the President at the end of a congress lasted longer than the median length of a vacancy on the Court. Out of 11 vacancies, 8 lasted longer than 61 days and 7 lasted at least 100 days. Six vacancies lasted longer than the average length of a vacancy on the court. The nominee approved by the Senate for vacancies requiring multiple nominations usually receives unanimous or nearly unanimous support. Most approved nominees had minimal nay votes, except for Samuel Alito in 2006, who received 42 nay votes."
