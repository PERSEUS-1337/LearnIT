    "content": "The Transition toward Excellence, Achievement, and Mobility through Empowerment Act of 2011, also known as the TEAM-Empowerment Act of 2011, includes provisions for individualized transition plans and transition planning services administrative units. Congress finds that youth with significant disabilities benefit from inclusive education, work experience, and paid work while in school, leading to better postsecondary outcomes and sustainable employment. Higher rates of self-determination for individuals with disabilities and their families result in improved outcomes. Transition strategies and flexible blending of government funds lead to better outcomes for individuals with significant disabilities. Agency officials providing supports during transition need additional training to address individual needs effectively. The Act aims to create a holistic system for successful transition of youth with significant disabilities into adulthood, focusing on high expectations, equality of opportunity, self-determination, and post-secondary options leading to competitive employment and self-sufficiency. Promoting innovative strategies to foster academic success is also a key goal. Promote innovative strategies for academic, professional, and social inclusion, solidify long-term supports for community integration, define and coordinate transition services for youth with disabilities, eliminate barriers, and incentivize collaboration for improved transition opportunities.
