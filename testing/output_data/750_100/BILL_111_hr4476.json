    "content": "The Act titled \"Equity in Government Compensation Act of 2010\" is cited in Section 1. Congressional findings are outlined in Section 2. The Congress finds that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, privately owned but publicly chartered government-sponsored enterprises, were central to the 2008 financial crisis, leading to the deepest economic decline since World War II and the loss of 7,500,000 jobs. In September 2008, the Treasury Department, Federal Reserve Board, and Federal Housing Finance Agency were involved. In 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placed in conservatorship by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, with the government taking control of their operations. The Obama Administration provided financial support by purchasing senior preferred stock in the enterprises, increasing the commitment to $400 billion in 2009. By Christmas Eve 2009, all limits on the use of Federal funds to cover losses were removed. The government's actions have led to taxpayers owning at least 80% of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with the Administration using them for Federal housing policy. The Congressional Budget Office has concluded on the matter. The Congressional Budget Office has determined that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are now effectively government entities and should be included in the Federal budget. Despite being expected to be a long-term burden on taxpayers due to market conditions and political mandates, the Treasury Department and FHFA approved $6,000,000 compensation packages for the CEOs of both entities in 2010. The Treasury Department and FHFA approved $6,000,000 compensation packages for the CEOs of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2010, including $2,000,000 in incentive pay. This amount is significantly higher than the annual compensation of the President and a Cabinet Secretary. Additionally, multi-million dollar compensation packages were approved for other top executives of the GSEs, paid in cash instead of stock options. FHFA determined that no executive officer of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac would receive cash bonuses or long-term incentives for 2008. The agency's Strategic Plan includes a commitment for the GSEs to operate safely and soundly. Section 1318(c) of the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act allows the Director of FHFA to withhold payments. The FHFA can withhold executive officer compensation for review of reasonableness and comparability. The FHFA can withhold executive officer compensation for review of reasonableness and comparability, ensuring reasonable compensation. The Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency will suspend 2010 compensation packages for executive officers of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Instead, a new compensation system will be established based on federal government pay rates. In 2009, executive officers of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should return any excess compensation to the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary of the Treasury must transfer any excess compensation returned by executive officers of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to a special account to reduce the national debt."
