    "content": "Residential energy efficiency can benefit consumers by reducing utility bills and supporting national environmental policy objectives. Various policies, including tax incentives, have been implemented since the 1970s to increase conservation and energy efficiency. The federal government faces uncertainty in determining the best policy tools to achieve energy-efficiency goals. In 2016, one-fifth of total energy consumed in the United States was used for residential purposes. In 2016, one-fifth of US energy was consumed by residential sector. Over time, residential energy use has increased but recently slightly decreased. Per capita energy use has been constant since the 1970s, with a downward trend starting in the mid-2000s. Despite modest declines in per capita residential energy use, efficiency gains have kept aggregate residential energy use relatively flat or slightly declining. Experts believe there is still significant potential for increased energy efficiency in the residential sector, but there are concerns that consumers may not invest in optimal levels of energy efficiency. Debate exists about the ideal level of investment in energy efficiency, which could potentially change residential energy use trends. Increasing energy efficiency through tax credits could reduce residential energy use per capita over time, despite population growth leading to overall increases. This report explores the economic rationale for these incentives, addressing market failures and barriers that hinder optimal energy efficiency investments. The report discusses market failures and barriers in the residential energy sector and how tax incentives can correct them. Tax credits are available for residential energy-efficiency and renewable-energy technologies in the 2017 tax year. The nonbusiness energy property tax credit (IRC \u00a725C) allows taxpayers to claim a tax credit for energy-efficiency improvements to their primary residence, including building envelope upgrades and high-efficiency appliances. The credit is 10% of expenditures on improvements plus the cost of energy-efficient property, capped at a specific amount. Taxpayers often claim the maximum credit due to the high cost of these appliances. The Section 25C tax credit allows taxpayers to claim a maximum credit of $500 for energy-efficient property, including appliances. This cap applies to claims made in the current and prior tax years. The credit expired at the end of 2017. Another credit, the Section 25D credit, allows for tax credits on properties generating renewable energy like solar. The Section 25D tax credit allows taxpayers to claim a credit for renewable energy properties installed on their residence, such as solar panels. The credit rate is 30% for 2017, decreasing to 26% in 2020 and 22% in 2021, with the credit expiring after 2021. The maximum value of the credit is not capped. A rational consumer would invest in energy-efficient technology if the savings from using the property exceeded the cost. For example, insulation that lowers heating costs enough to recover the investment would be a wise purchase. The \"energy-efficiency paradox\" explains why some consumers do not invest in residential energy efficiency despite potential savings on heating bills. Market failures and barriers contribute to consumers not making optimal investments in energy-efficient technologies. Market failures and barriers, such as externalities and informational issues, hinder optimal investment in residential energy efficiency. Energy consumption externalities may lead to underallocation of resources. Energy consumption externalities, like pollution costs, can lead to underinvestment in residential energy efficiency as market prices do not reflect the full cost of electricity consumption. This results in consumers consuming more electricity than optimal. The adoption of energy-efficient technologies can lead to positive externalities through knowledge spillover effects, benefiting society as a whole. Markets fail to consider these benefits, resulting in underinvestment in energy efficiency. Market failures in energy efficiency can occur due to various reasons. One type is when the technology is not adopted as much as it should be under market forces. Another issue is the principal-agent problem, where there is a disconnect between those making energy-efficient decisions and the ultimate energy consumer. For example, landlords may not invest in energy efficiency in non-owner-occupied housing, and builders may opt for lower-cost, less efficient technologies in new homes. Investments in energy efficiency may be hindered by market imperfections and capital constraints, leading to suboptimal decisions by landlords and builders. Low-income households, in particular, may settle for less energy-efficient options due to financial constraints. Low-income households may settle for less energy-efficient options due to financial constraints and lack of information about energy-saving technologies. Government policies, such as tax incentives, can help overcome market failures and barriers. Government policies, like tax incentives, can address energy market failures by providing grants, rebates, or credit enhancements. Regulations, mandates, and informational programs such as Energy Star can also support investments in energy efficiency and correct negative externalities. Policymakers can use tax credits like Section 25C and Section 25D to lower the cost of energy-efficient investments, encouraging additional investment in technologies. Other tax incentives, such as the expired IRC \u00a745M credit, reduce the cost of producing energy-efficient products and certain technologies. Tax credits can lower the cost of energy-efficient investments and encourage additional investment in technologies. However, they may not be the most economically efficient policy option if markets underinvest in energy efficiency due to artificially low electricity prices. Increasing electricity prices to reflect full costs can boost investment in energy efficiency by removing federal financial support or taxing electricity production with external costs. Current tax incentives for residential energy efficiency do not effectively address the principal-agent problem. Tax incentives for residential energy efficiency do not directly address the principal-agent problem. Section 25C and Section 25D credits do not benefit renters or landlords, unlike other incentives like the tax credit for energy-efficient new homes (IRC \u00a745L). Tax credits for residential energy efficiency may not effectively address market imperfections for homeowners unable to secure credit for upfront costs. While they reduce investment costs, they may not provide immediate savings for credit-constrained consumers. Subsidies for efficiency may be necessary in cases where consumers lack information about energy-efficient technologies. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency may not fully alleviate market failure. Policies that subsidize efficiency, like tax credits, may increase technology adoption and societal welfare. Recent research suggests that tax credits may decrease total welfare for well-informed consumers. Tax credits are most beneficial when targeting consumers with the largest energy inefficiencies. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency, like Section 25C and Section 25D, aim to increase investment in energy-efficient property. However, they may not address all market failures, limiting their effectiveness in promoting optimal usage of energy-efficient technologies. An economic analysis evaluates their impact on investment, fairness, and administrative issues. Tax incentives are effective if they influence desired behavior. Residential energy-efficiency tax credits aim to encourage desired behavior but may not effectively increase investment. These tax benefits tend to benefit higher-income taxpayers and face administrative issues, as highlighted by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. Residential energy-efficiency tax credits aim to encourage individuals to increase investments in energy efficiency. The success of these tax policies is measured by whether they lead to additional investments, rather than just rewarding consumers for investments they would have made anyway. If tax credits only reward existing investments, they do not achieve the policy goal of increasing energy efficiency. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency may not lead to additional investment or reduced energy consumption, as seen in concerns raised in the 1970s. Representative Bill Frenzel expressed reservations about these tax credits during House hearings on expanding residential energy benefits in 1979. The tax credit bill passed last year has not provided a significant incentive in the marketplace. It tends to be a reward for economic actions forced by other factors and does not effectively stimulate investment. Empirical evidence on residential energy tax credits from the late 1970s and early 1980s is mixed. The late 1970s and early 1980s saw mixed results in additional investment in energy-efficient property due to tax incentives. Some researchers found that tax credits led to more investment, while others believed they resulted in windfall gains for recipients. The effectiveness of tax credits in promoting energy-efficiency investment remains a topic for policymakers to consider. Residential energy tax credits may not significantly impact consumer purchasing decisions. Consumers may already be motivated by market incentives like high energy prices. Federal revenue losses from tax credits can be seen as windfall gains for consumers who would have invested in energy-efficiency improvements regardless. Additionally, the delayed realization of savings until tax returns are filed reduces the incentive power of the credit. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency only benefit taxpayers with income tax liability, excluding 44% of U.S. households in 2017. Higher-income taxpayers are more likely to benefit from these incentives. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency primarily benefit higher-income taxpayers with tax liability, motivating them to invest in energy-efficient equipment. These incentives aim to increase investment in energy efficiency among consumers. Residential energy-efficiency tax incentives target homeowners, who are typically higher-income taxpayers, to encourage investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy properties. Data shows that middle- and upper-income taxpayers predominantly claim these tax credits. In 2015, over three-quarters of residential energy tax credits were claimed by taxpayers with incomes above $50,000, who also claimed 89.0% of the total value of these credits. Tax units with incomes below $50,000 made up 61.4% of all units but only claimed 22.4% of residential energy tax credits, accounting for 11.0% of the total value. The average residential energy tax credit amount increases with income level, with the highest income tax units receiving seven times more than the lowest income units. Nonrefundable tax credits like Section 25C and Section 25D may limit who can claim them, as the credit value cannot exceed tax liability. Section 25D credit can be carried forward, but Section 25C cannot, disadvantaging taxpayers with low current tax liability. Taxpayers with low tax liability may not fully benefit from residential energy-efficiency tax incentives, which are often limited to higher-income households. This limitation may hinder the goal of using tax credits to promote energy-efficient investments, especially for credit-constrained households facing high upfront costs. Tax credits reducing costs may encourage investment for credit-constrained households. However, if only available to higher-income households, tax incentives may not effectively address market barriers. An ideal tax code should be simple for taxpayers to comply with and for the government to administer, with low compliance costs to encourage claiming tax benefits. In April 2011, the Treasury Department's Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) reported on residential energy tax credits, highlighting opportunities for fraud due to the IRS's inability to verify qualifying energy modifications claimed under Section 25C or Section 25D credits. The IRS was unable to confirm the eligibility of claimants for residential energy tax credits due to lack of required information and verification. Prior to 2011, taxpayers were not asked to provide proof of eligibility on IRS Form 5695. As a result, TIGTA could not verify 30% of taxpayers in their sample. The TIGTA report found that 30% of taxpayers claiming residential energy tax credits could not be confirmed as homeowners. Additionally, 5% of tax returns claiming these credits did not show any indication of homeownership. The IRS updated Form 5695 in 2011 to request more information about the taxpayer's home. In a recent report, TIGTA discovered that the IRS may have incorrectly denied nearly 800 eligible taxpayers $1.5 million in energy tax credits. The TIGTA report highlighted errors in applying tax credits, specifically the $500 limit on the 25C credit being wrongly applied to the 25D credit. Congress has the option to let these temporary tax credits expire, with the 25C credit already expired in 2017 and the 25D credit set to expire in 2021. The 25D credit expires at the end of 2021. Congress may consider options for future incentives for residential energy efficiency, such as modifying or replacing the credits with a grant program. Letting the credits expire as scheduled could result in taxpayers not making eligible purchases, but it would eliminate a windfall tax benefit without incurring revenue loss. The current tax credits for residential energy efficiency, set to expire in 2021, have undergone changes since 2005. Extending the credit with a $500-per-taxpayer cap may provide limited incentives for homeowners who have already claimed credits. Policymakers may choose to modify or expand these incentives to encourage further investment. Expanding residential energy efficiency tax credits by using a more generous formula, broadening eligible technologies, and removing caps can significantly increase incentives for taxpayers. The value of these credits grew substantially after expansions in 2009. Policymakers have the option to scale back these provisions if needed. Policymakers have the option to scale back residential energy efficiency tax credits by reinstating technology-specific caps for Section 25D credit, introducing an overall cap for Section 25D credit, reducing technology-specific caps of Section 25C, or reducing the overall cap on Section 25C. These changes may increase confusion among taxpayers estimating their credits, and credits could be phased out for upper-income taxpayers to reduce budgetary costs. Policymakers may consider replacing tax credits with a rebate program or alternative mechanism to provide direct cash payments to consumers for energy-efficient purchases, especially for those with limited funds. This could be a more effective way to incentivize the adoption of renewable energy technologies. In 2010, legislation was introduced to create a rebate program for energy-efficient property installations. The Home Star Energy Retrofit Act aimed to provide rebates to contractors but was not passed by the Senate. The appendix provides technical standards for property to qualify for residential energy-efficiency tax credits. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency were first introduced in the late 1970s and were similar to present-day incentives introduced in 2005. The Energy Tax Act of 1978 introduced the first tax credit for conservation and renewable-energy generation. The Energy Tax Act of 1978 (P.L. 95-618) introduced the first tax credit for conservation and renewable-energy generation. It had two components: a 15% credit for energy-conservation expenditures and a 30% credit for solar, wind, and geothermal energy expenditures. In 1980, the Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act of 1980 (P.L. 96-223) increased the maximum credit value to $2,500. The Tax Act of 1980 (P.L. 96-223) increased the renewable energy generation credit to 40% of the first $10,000 of expenditures, with a maximum value of $4,000. This credit expired in 1985 and was not reinstated until 2005 with the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT05; P.L. 109-58), which introduced new temporary tax credits for energy-efficiency improvements for homeowners. Under EPACT05, homeowners could receive nonrefundable tax credits for energy-efficiency improvements to their homes in 2006 and 2007. The nonbusiness energy property credit (IRC \u00a725C) allowed for a 10% credit on qualified expenditures, with specific limits for different types of property. For example, credits ranged from $50 to $300 for items like advanced main air circulating fans, furnaces, heat pumps, and water heaters meeting efficiency standards. The Section 25C credit for energy-efficient improvements in 2006 and 2007 had a maximum cap of $200 for windows and a lifetime cap of $500. This credit could only be used for improvements on the taxpayer's main residence. Another credit established was the residential energy-efficient property credit (IRC \u00a725D) for expenditures on qualified photovoltaic, solar water-heating, and fuel-cell properties. The Section 25C credit for energy-efficient improvements in 2006 and 2007 had a maximum cap of $200 for windows and a lifetime cap of $500. The credit for photovoltaic and solar water-heating properties was limited to $2,000 per year, while the credit for fuel cells was limited to $500 per year. Qualifying expenditures included those made on any of the taxpayer's residences. Section 25C expired at the end of 2007, but Section 25D was extended for the 2008 tax year. The Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 clarified that all solar energy properties could qualify for the Section 25D credit. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 reinstated and modified the Section 25C credit, adding biomass fuel stoves and removing geothermal heat pumps from eligibility. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 extended the Section 25D tax credit for eight years, through 2016, and expanded it to include qualified small wind-energy property and geothermal heat pump property. The credit for small wind energy was set at 30% of expenditures up to a cap of $500 for each half kilowatt of electric capacity generated. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extended and modified tax credits for small wind-energy and geothermal properties, with a cap of $4,000 annually for wind turbines and $2,000 for geothermal heat pumps. Taxpayers could claim credits for both types of properties on their residential properties. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extended the energy-efficiency tax credit for two years, increasing the credit to 30% of qualified expenditures and raising the aggregate cap to $1,500. The $200 cap for windows was eliminated, allowing taxpayers to claim up to $1,500 in tax credits for qualified windows in 2009 and 2010. Under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), the efficiency standards for energy improvements and property were reduced, expanding the tax credit availability. The Section 25D tax credit was modified to remove maximum credit caps for most technologies. These changes were effective from 2009 to 2016, resulting in an increase in the number and total amount of credits claimed. Average credit amounts were also higher under ARRA compared to 2006. Under ARRA, the Section 25C credit was extended through 2011 with lower credit limits compared to ARRA. The general lifetime limit and window lifetime limit were reinstated at $500 and $200, respectively. The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) reinstated the general lifetime limit of $500 and window lifetime limit of $200 for Section 25C credits. Efficiency standards were restored to prior levels, and technology-specific credit limits for energy-efficiency property were also reinstated. The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) extended the Section 25C credit for 2012 and 2013. The Tax Increase Prevention Act (TIPA) extended it for 2014, and the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act (PATH Act) extended and modified the credit for 2015 and 2016. The PATH Act introduced more stringent Energy Star 6.0 standards for windows and doors starting in 2016. The 25D credit for solar technologies was extended through 2021 and the credit formula was modified. The 25D credit for solar technologies will be extended through 2021, with the credit calculated as 30% of qualifying expenditures from 2017 to 2019, 26% in 2020, and 22% in 2021. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 also extended the 25C credit retroactively for 2017 and extended the 25D credit for nonsolar technologies. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 extended the 25D credit for nonsolar technologies through 2021, with credit rates of 30% for property placed in service before 2019, decreasing to 26% in 2020 and 22% in 2021, aligning with the credit rates for solar technologies."
