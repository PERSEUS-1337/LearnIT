The Act aims to prevent catastrophic wildfires. The \"Catastrophic Wildfire Prevention Act of 2012\" aims to expedite wildfire prevention projects on Federal lands, reduce threats to endangered species, and provide efficiency tools to streamline projects for wildfire prevention. The \"Catastrophic Wildfire Prevention Act of 2012\" defines terms like \"at-risk community\" and \"at-risk forest\" to address high wildfire risk on Federal lands. The \"Catastrophic Wildfire Prevention Act of 2012\" defines terms like \"at-risk community\" and \"at-risk forest\" to address high wildfire risk on Federal lands. Federal land in condition class II or III, as defined by the Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station, is eligible for authorized wildfire prevention projects. The \"Catastrophic Wildfire Prevention Act of 2012\" defines terms like \"at-risk community\" and \"at-risk forest\" to address high wildfire risk on Federal lands. Authorized wildfire prevention projects on Federal land may include activities such as livestock grazing and timber harvest for purposes like hazardous fuels reduction, forest health, and habitat protection for threatened and endangered species. Federal land is defined as land of the National Forest System. The term \"Secretary concerned\" is defined in the Catastrophic Wildfire Prevention Act of 2012 as the Secretary responsible for managing National Forest System lands or public lands as defined by specific federal acts. Excluded land refers to areas where vegetation removal is prohibited by federal law unless it is in an inventoried roadless area or wilderness study area. The term \"Secretary concerned\" is defined as the Secretary of Agriculture for National Forest System land and the Secretary of the Interior for public lands. \"Threatened and endangered species habitat\" refers to Federal land where natural fire regimes are crucial for endangered or threatened species. Endangered or threatened species can be identified in a species recovery plan or a notice published in the Federal Register. SEC. 4. AUTHORIZED WILDFIRE PREVENTION PROJECTS. Authorized wildfire prevention projects will be implemented in at-risk forests and endangered species habitats to reduce surface, ladder, and canopy fuels. Projects aim to enhance protection from wildfires, including catastrophic events, for endangered species. Authorized wildfire prevention projects in at-risk forests aim to move Federal land towards better condition classes to reduce wildfire risks for endangered species and their habitats. Compliance with guidelines from the species recovery plan is required. Authorized wildfire prevention projects in at-risk forests aim to improve land condition classes to reduce wildfire risks for endangered species and their habitats. Grazing and timber harvesting can be used to reduce fuel loads and prevent catastrophic wildfires, with no utilization standards applying in these projects. The Secretary is not required to revise land management plans for wildfire prevention projects. Public petitions for land designation must be reviewed and determined within 60 days. SEC. 5. PUBLIC REVIEW AND ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS. The Secretary must publish a notice of proposed wildfire prevention projects in the Federal Register for public comment. Specific written comments related to the project can be submitted within 30 days. Within 60 days of the notice, the final project will be designated after considering any received comments. The Secretary will designate the final project and publish a notice in the Federal Register. Only those who commented on the proposed project can submit specific written comments on the final designated project within 30 days. The Secretary must comply with the National Environmental Policy Act for environmental analysis. The Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and other laws must be followed for authorized wildfire prevention projects. Interagency cooperation is required for projects under the Endangered Species Act. Special rules apply to projects involving timber harvesting or grazing. The Secretary must prepare an environmental assessment within 30 days of notice for proposed agency actions under the National Environmental Policy Act. Failure to meet the deadline deems the wildfire prevention project compliant with all NEPA requirements. In the case of a livestock grazing project, the environmental assessment is sufficient for a minimum of 10 years, and for a timber harvest project, it is sufficient for a minimum of 20 years. The Secretary is not required to study alternatives to the proposed agency action in the environmental assessment. Compliance with this section satisfies the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. The curr_chunk states that the project meets the requirements of various environmental acts. SEC. 6. ADMINISTRATIVE AND JUDICIAL REVIEW. Administrative review follows the process under the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003. Judicial review is conducted according to the same Act. Before listing any species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, the Secretary must assess the impact on forest fuel loads and include wildfire risk analysis in recovery plans and habitat determinations."
