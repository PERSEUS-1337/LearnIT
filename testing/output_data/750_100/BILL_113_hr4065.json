    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Smartphone Theft Prevention Act\". Congress finds that mobile device theft costs consumers $30 billion annually, with 1 in 3 robberies involving mobile device theft. Efforts have been made by carriers, manufacturers, law enforcement, and the FCC to address this issue, but more action is needed. Consumers deserve the most secure technology to protect their information, as technological protections continue to advance and benefit the economy. The wireless industry should collaborate with law enforcement to educate consumers on security tools and promote safety. The mobile device industry, law enforcement, and consumer advocates should proactively develop solutions to protect consumers, drive innovation, and deter theft. SEC. 3.
