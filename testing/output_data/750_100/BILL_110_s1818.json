    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Missing Mercury in Manufacturing Monitoring and Mitigation Act\". It includes findings related to mercury in manufacturing. Congress finds that mercury and mercury compounds are highly toxic to humans, ecosystems, and wildlife. Approximately 10 percent of women of childbearing age in the United States have mercury in their bloodstreams at levels that could harm their unborn babies. Additionally, around 630,000 children born annually in the United States are at risk of neurological issues due to mercury exposure in utero, with ingestion of mercury-contaminated fish being the main source of exposure. The long-term solution to mercury pollution is crucial. Mercury pollution is a significant issue globally, with contaminated fish being a major source of exposure. The long-term solution involves reducing global mercury use and releases to lower contamination levels in the environment. An estimated 24,000 to 30,000 tons of mercury are used at mercury cell chlor-alkali plants worldwide, contributing to the transboundary nature of mercury pollution. Mercury pollution from chlor-alkali plants affects bodies of water locally, regionally, and globally. In the United States, only 8 out of 30 plants use the outdated mercury cell process, with 5 plants yet to phase out mercury use. Only 10% of chlorine and caustic soda in the US comes from these plants. The chlor-alkali industry acknowledges that mercury contamination can occur in products manufactured at mercury cell facilities, leading to direct and indirect release of mercury. Cost-effective alternatives are available for 90% of chlorine and caustic soda production, and other countries like Japan have already banned the mercury cell chlor-alkali process. Despite the known use of mercury in the chlor-alkali industry, there is a lack of accountability for its disposition and accurate estimation of current emissions. It is crucial for the United States to aggressively minimize the supply, demand, and releases of mercury both domestically and internationally. Congress declares the need to develop policies to reduce mercury use and emissions in the United States, including reducing exposures to mercury for women of childbearing age and young children. Additionally, there is a call to amend the Toxic Substances Control Act to address the use of mercury in chlorine and caustic soda manufacturing. Congress calls for policies to reduce mercury use and emissions in the US, specifically targeting mercury exposure for women of childbearing age and young children. An amendment to the Toxic Substances Control Act is proposed to address the use of mercury in chlorine and caustic soda manufacturing. Effective January 1, 2012, the manufacture of chlorine or caustic soda using mercury cells is prohibited in the United States. Reporting requirements are set for April 1, 2008. Reporting requirements mandate chlor-alkali facilities to submit annual reports on mercury-containing hazardous and nonhazardous waste generated, including waste type, quantity, mercury content, and waste management methods. The annual reports from chlor-alkali facilities must include details on waste management, offsite locations, mercury release into air or water, and mercury accumulation in plant equipment. The annual reports from chlor-alkali facilities must include details on waste management, offsite locations, mercury release into air or water, mercury accumulation in plant equipment, and the quantity and forms of mercury found in products produced for sale. The Administrator may allow combining this report with others to avoid duplication. For chlor-alkali facilities ceasing operations after July 1, 2008, the Administrator must conduct a comprehensive mercury inventory within 1 year, in consultation with the State. This inventory covers mercury purchased throughout the facility's life and closure. The comprehensive mercury inventory for chlor-alkali facilities closing after July 1, 2008 includes: total mercury purchased, remaining mercury in equipment at closure, estimated mercury in waste generated, and aggregate mercury releases into the environment. The EPA will obtain mercury purchase records and other necessary information from chlor-alkali facilities to determine the magnitude and nature of mercury releases into the environment. An advisory committee called the Mercury Storage Advisory Committee will be established. The Mercury Storage Advisory Committee, composed of 9 members, will be established with 2 members jointly appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the majority leader of the Senate. One member will serve as the Chairperson of the Committee. The Mercury Storage Advisory Committee will consist of members designated as Vice-Chairperson, Administrator, Secretary of Defense, State environmental agencies representative, State attorneys general representative, and chlorine industry representative. The Mercury Storage Advisory Committee will include members representing the mercury waste treatment industry and a nonprofit environmental organization. The Administrator will appoint these members within 45 days of the enactment of this section. The Committee, once all members are appointed, will hold an initial meeting within 30 days. Meetings will be called by the Chairperson, and a majority of members will constitute a quorum. A report with findings and recommendations must be submitted to Congress within 1 year of the section's enactment. The Committee will report on environmental, health, and safety requirements to prevent mercury release and worker exposure, estimated annual storage costs, and optimal characteristics of Federal facilities for a 40-year period. The curr_chunk discusses the estimated quantity of elemental mercury resulting from the discontinuance of mercury cells at chlor-alkali facilities in the United States and other supplies that may require storage for a 40-year period. The curr_chunk discusses the estimated quantity of elemental mercury generated from recycling and other sources that will require storage to comply with export prohibitions, as well as barriers preventing the private sector from storing elemental mercury. The curr_chunk discusses measures to address barriers, advantages and disadvantages of consolidating mercury storage, the optimal plan for storing excess mercury, and additional research needed for long-term disposal options. The curr_chunk discusses compensation for non-federal members of the Committee involved in addressing excess mercury storage. The curr_chunk outlines that members of the Committee, including federal employees, will not receive additional compensation for their duties but will be reimbursed for travel expenses. The Committee members will receive travel expenses and per diem for subsistence while performing duties, with funding and personnel provided by the Administrator. The Committee will terminate after 180 days. The Committee will terminate 180 days after submitting the report. The Administrator will establish regulations for the transfer and storage of mercury at chlor-alkali facilities by July 1, 2008. Beginning on July 1, 2008, elemental mercury at closed or closing chlor-alkali facilities must be transferred to a storage facility established by the Administrator. By July 1, 2009, a health assessment of employees at operating chlor-alkali facilities must be conducted. Regulations for the transfer and storage of mercury will be established. The Administrator may promulgate regulations, including a reporting form, to carry out this section of the Toxic Substances Control Act. A conforming amendment is made to the table of contents. Sec. 6A addresses the use of mercury in chlorine and caustic soda manufacturing."
