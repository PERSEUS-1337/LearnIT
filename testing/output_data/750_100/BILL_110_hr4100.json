    "content": "The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section on Instructional Level Assessment Pilot Program. This program aims to assess students' instructional levels. The Secretary will award grants to up to ten State educational agencies for pilot programs to assess students with disabilities below grade-level proficiency and provide quality instruction. Grants will be for a 3-year period, and States must submit an application for the grant. To be eligible for a grant under this section, a State must not need intervention in implementing requirements of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, have implemented alternate assessments, and provide assurances in their application. The agency applying for the grant must identify at least 5 local education agencies for the pilot program, ensuring geographic diversity and a mix of rural and urban districts. They must also provide guidance on selecting students, using valid assessment tools, and data collection and reporting. The grant application must include tools for data collection and reporting, assurance of implementing a response to intervention approach, and monitoring of participating local education agencies. The pilot program requires the IEP Team to identify students for participation and limits participation to 0.5% of the total student population in each local educational agency. The pilot program requires the IEP Team to ensure that the alternate assessment to modified achievement standards is appropriate for the student, provide quality instruction, and examine the student's testing data. The IEP Team must examine the student's testing data, formative assessments, student work, IEP progress notes, response to intervention data, teacher recommendations, and other relevant data to determine the student's instructional level. They should also assess if the student is performing significantly below their current grade level in reading or math and administer scientifically-valid and reliable assessments. The IEP Team must use various data sources to determine the student's instructional level in reading and math. They should administer reliable assessments and develop targeted interventions to address identified gaps in the student's knowledge. The data from these assessments should not be used to determine if a student meets certain criteria. The pilot program's instructional level assessments should not be used to determine student achievement levels or school progress. Each local education agency will compile reports on student proficiency and progress. The pilot program assesses student's instructional level proficiency and progress towards grade level proficiency using alternate or regular academic achievement standards and a valid assessment. States must report on student participation and progress in closing the gap between current grade level and instructional level proficiency. The Secretary will use data collected to inform a report to Congress on student participation in the pilot program and changes in their proficiency levels. $5,000,000 is authorized for grants under this section for fiscal year 2008."
