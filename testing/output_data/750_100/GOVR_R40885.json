    "content": "H.R. 3962, Affordable Health Care for America Act, passed by the House of Representatives on November 7, 2009, is based on H.R. 3200. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would reduce federal deficits by $109. The Affordable Health Care for America Act, passed in 2009, is projected to reduce federal deficits by $109 billion over 10 years. It aims to insure 96% of the non-elderly, legally present U.S. population by 2019. The total cost of coverage provisions, including Exchange subsidies, federal Medicaid expenditures, and tax credits, would be $1.052 trillion over the same period. The net cost of coverage expansions would be $891 billion, offset by tax penalties and other factors. The Affordable Health Care for America Act, passed in 2009, aims to reduce the number of uninsured by insuring 96% of the non-elderly population. The net cost of coverage expansions would be offset by spending changes and increased federal revenues, resulting in a reduction of federal deficits by $109 billion over 10 years. H.R. 3962 aims to regulate the private health insurance market by setting minimum standards for health benefits, providing financial assistance to certain individuals, and imposing requirements on individuals and employers to maintain health insurance coverage. Market reforms such as modified community rating and guaranteed issue and renewal would also be implemented. The bill aims to regulate the private health insurance market by setting minimum standards for health benefits and incorporating market reforms. Acceptable coverage would include plans under a qualified health benefits plan, offered through the Exchange or employer plans, grandfathered plans, and other coverage like Medicare and Medicaid. The Exchange would be established under a new federal agency and offer private plans alongside a public option, with subsidies available for certain individuals. Individuals with incomes below 400% of the federal poverty level could qualify for subsidies towards premium costs and cost-sharing through the Exchange. Plans in the individual market could be grandfathered indefinitely if no changes were made to the plan's terms and conditions, with premiums only allowed to increase as per statute. The bill also establishes a CO-OP program to encourage the creation of not-for-profit health insurance cooperatives operating in the Exchange. This bill would establish cooperatives in the Exchange, affecting private health insurance with provisions effective from 2013. Revenues would be raised by limiting employer deductions and modifying tax-advantaged accounts. The report provides background on the private insurance market and how H.R. 3962 would reform it. The report summarizes key provisions affecting private health insurance in H.R. 3962, passed by the House of Representatives on November 7, 2009. The provisions would be effective beginning in 2013, with a timeline for implementing provisions prior to 2013. H.R. 3962 includes provisions to alter how private health insurance markets function, primarily for individuals purchasing coverage directly from an insurer or through a small employer. H.R. 3962 would prevent insurers from excluding or charging higher premiums based on pre-existing conditions, aiming to address adverse selection in the health insurance market. Insurers may adopt policies like excluding preexisting conditions to guard against adverse selection. If reform eliminates these tools, it could impact how insurers manage risk. America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) advocates for the requirement of individuals to purchase health insurance to prevent adverse selection. Premium subsidies may be necessary to make the individual mandate practical and market reforms possible. Private health insurance provisions under Division A of H.R. 3962 include individual and employer mandates, private health insurance market reforms, immediate reforms, and the Health Insurance Exchange. Removing one provision from the bill could negatively impact the implementation of the others. Immediate Reforms in the Health Insurance Exchange include offering a public health insurance option, premium and cost-sharing subsidies, CO-OP Program, selected revenue provisions, and other provisions related to abortion, medical malpractice, and end-of-life care. Americans obtain health insurance through various methods, such as employment-based coverage, private sector options, or publicly funded programs like Medicare or Medicaid. In 2008, 60% of the U.S. population had employment-based health insurance, with employers choosing to purchase insurance or self-fund health benefits for their employees. In 2008, approximately 46 million Americans were uninsured as there is no federal law mandating health insurance. Individuals and employers can purchase health insurance in the large group, small group, or nongroup market segments. Over 95% of large employers offer coverage, with large employers able to secure lower premiums. Large employers can obtain lower premiums for health insurance due to economies of scale and a larger risk pool of enrollees. They offer subsidies towards health insurance, attracting both healthier and sicker workers. States have tried creating a single site for comparing insurance plans and obtaining coverage. Private-sector companies like eHealthInsurance help individuals and small employers compare health insurance plans. Past experiments in states like California (PacAdvantage) failed, but states like Massachusetts (Connector) have developed more sustainable models. Less than half of small employers offer health insurance, citing cost as the main barrier. Small employers often do not offer health insurance coverage due to cost constraints. The limited ability to spread risk across a small group is a key reason for this. Insurers view small firms as less stable than larger ones, as any changes in the pool can have a significant impact on risk. Other factors include small firms facing disadvantages in negotiating benefits and rates compared to larger counterparts. Small employers face challenges in offering health insurance due to cost constraints, limited market power, and lack of economies of scale. Purchasing insurance through a larger pool could lower premiums for high-cost employees. State laws may allow rejection or higher premiums based on health status in the nongroup market. Reforms affecting premium ratings could increase costs for some individuals. Reforms affecting premiums ratings could increase costs for some individuals based on age, health, behaviors, and other factors. States regulate the private health insurance market, with federal regulations mostly impacting employer-sponsored health insurance. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) mandates guaranteed issue coverage for small groups (2-50 employees). All states require issuers to offer policies to firms with 2-50 workers on a guaranteed issue basis in compliance with HIPAA. In the small group market, 13 states also require issuers to offer policies on a guaranteed issue basis to self-employed \"groups of one.\" In the individual market, 15 states require issuers to offer some or all insurance products on a guaranteed issue basis to non-HIPAA eligible individuals. Most states impose premium rating rules on insurance carriers in small group and individual markets, ranging from pure community rating to no restrictions. In the small group and individual markets, states impose premium rating rules on insurance carriers, ranging from pure community rating to no restrictions. Only New Jersey and New York use pure community rating in their nongroup markets, with New York also applying it in the small group market. Adjusted community rating prohibits pricing based on health factors but allows for age or gender, while rate bands limit premium variation based on health within a specified range. Federal law requires group health plans and insurance issuers to limit the exclusion period for preexisting health conditions. In the small group market, 21 states have rules exceeding federal standards, while in the individual market, 42 states limit exclusion periods for preexisting conditions. Some proponents argue for a publicly sponsored health insurance plan as part of market reform, potentially offering lower costs without the need for profits or broker fees. Some proponents argue that a public health insurance plan could offer lower costs and increased competition by requiring lower provider payments and charging lower premiums. However, opponents question if this would give the government an unfair advantage and drive private plans out of the market. The performance of health insurance organizations based on profit status has also been a topic of discussion. Non-profit health insurance organizations, including health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and health insurance co-operatives, have been shown to perform better in terms of quality compared to for-profit organizations. Studies have indicated that non-profits scored higher on quality measures, as evidenced by research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) in 1999 and a study conducted in 2006 by researchers at the University of California at Berkeley and the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA). Non-profit health insurance organizations, including health insurance co-operatives, have shown better quality performance compared to for-profit organizations. Recent case studies of Group Health Cooperative of Seattle (GHC) and HealthPartners of Minnesota highlight the success of non-profit plans. In 2008, 47% of private health plan enrollment was in non-profit organizations. Congressional attention is focused on incentivizing the creation of new health insurance co-operatives to reinvest earnings into lower premiums and cost-sharing for enrollees. Non-profit health insurance organizations, including health insurance co-operatives, have shown better quality performance compared to for-profit organizations. Recent case studies of Group Health Cooperative of Seattle (GHC) and HealthPartners of Minnesota highlight the success of non-profit plans. Congressional attention is focused on incentivizing the creation of new health insurance co-operatives to reinvest earnings into lower premiums, lower cost-sharing, expanded benefits, and innovations such as wellness programs, chronic disease management, and integrated care. Opponents argue that co-operatives may not make health insurance more affordable. Several provisions of the bill would take effect before full implementation on January 1, 2013, including administrative requirements necessary for the transition. Some provisions of the bill would take effect before January 1, 2013, including prohibiting postretirement reductions in retiree health benefits, allowing individuals to keep COBRA coverage until the Exchange is operational, establishing a temporary national high-risk pool program, and requiring health insurance issuers to provide rebates for low medical loss ratios. See the Appendix for more details. The bill includes provisions for health insurance issuers to provide rebates for low medical loss ratios, with a minimum ratio of 85%. Plans offered via the Exchange would be exempt from this provision. Issuers must justify any premium increases to the Secretary and states before implementation. Individuals up to age 26 can stay on their parents' plans. The bill aims to reduce the look-back period for pre-existing conditions from 6 months to 30 days and shorten coverage exclusions for certain benefits. It prohibits domestic violence from being considered a pre-existing condition and mandates coverage for a dependent child's congenital or developmental deformity. Lifetime limits on benefits are prohibited, and the Secretary will issue guidance on implementation. The bill prohibits lifetime limits on benefits and mandates coverage for certain conditions. It also includes a mandate for individuals to have health insurance with penalties for noncompliance. The Secretary will issue guidance on implementing the prohibition on rescission in insurance policies. Additionally, a temporary reinsurance program will assist employment-based plans with providing health benefits to retirees and their eligible family members. Individuals would be required to maintain acceptable health insurance coverage, including coverage under various plans such as QHBP, Medicare, Medicaid, military coverage, and services for members of Indian tribes. Failure to maintain coverage could result in an additional tax penalty. Individuals without coverage may face a penalty equal to 2.5% of their income or the national average premium. Some may receive subsidies, while others are exempt from the mandate. H.R. 3962 mandates employers to provide health insurance or pay into the Exchange, with exceptions for certain individuals. Employers include private-sector, churches, and government entities. Rules apply for offering coverage through employment-based plans or small business options. Employers must provide health insurance or contribute to the Exchange, with exceptions for certain individuals. Current employment-based health plans would be grandfathered for five years, after which they must meet the requirements of the essential benefits package. Employers must contribute at least 72.5% of the lowest-cost QHBP or current plan offered, prorated for part-time employees. Salary reductions used to offset contributions would not count as amounts paid by the employer. Employers would automatically enroll their employees. Employers would automatically enroll their employees into the plan for individual coverage with the lowest associated employee premium, unless the employee selected a different plan or opted out of employer coverage. Employers must provide written notice detailing the employee's rights and obligations relating to auto enrollment and show compliance with health participation requirements. Employers must provide information such as the name, address, and other details of each full-time employee enrolled in the employment-based plan, along with monthly premiums. The Secretary of HHS, in coordination with the Commissioner, could terminate an employer's election to provide health insurance for noncompliance. Employers with aggregate wages over $750,000 not offering coverage would face an 8% excise tax. Smaller employers have varying payroll assessment requirements. Beginning in 2014, employers with aggregate wages above $750,000 would be assessed 8% of average wages for employees who decline qualifying coverage, with adjustments for small employers. This assessment does not apply to employees covered as spouses or dependents in an Exchange plan. In 2014, employers with aggregate wages over $750,000 would be assessed 8% of average wages for employees who decline qualifying coverage. This assessment does not apply to employees covered as spouses or dependents in an Exchange plan. Full-time employees offered qualifying coverage by their employer would not be eligible for premium or cost-sharing credits. If they opt for Exchange coverage instead, they would be responsible for 100% of the premium. Certain small businesses may be eligible for a 50% credit towards the cost of qualified employee health coverage. The proposed credit for qualified employee health coverage would be phased out based on employee compensation and number of employees. Employees with compensation over $80,000 would not be eligible. Adjustments for inflation would be made starting in 2013. The credit would be part of the general business credit and not refundable. The proposed small business credit for qualified employee health coverage would be part of the general business credit and not refundable. It would only be available to businesses with a tax liability, excluding non-profit organizations. H.R. 3962 would establish new federal health insurance standards for qualified health benefits plans (QHBPs), including prohibiting coverage exclusions for pre-existing conditions. The proposed federal health insurance standards under H.R. 3962 would prohibit coverage exclusions for pre-existing health conditions, ensuring coverage on a guaranteed issue and guaranteed renewal basis. The proposed federal health insurance standards under H.R. 3962 would require premiums to be determined using adjusted community rating rules, ensuring coverage on a guaranteed issue and guaranteed renewal basis for all individual and group health plans. Under H.R. 3962, premiums would be allowed to vary based only on age, premium rating area, and family enrollment, with new non-discrimination and adequacy standards for insurers' networks. H.R. 3962 builds on non-discrimination rules and adequacy standards for insurers' networks, applies mental health parity rules, allows dependent children under 27 to stay on family policies, requires notification of coverage changes, mandates coverage of certain benefits by QHBPs, prohibits cost-sharing on preventive services, limits annual out-of-pocket spending, and bans annual and lifetime benefit limits. The new health care legislation mandates that insurance plans must comply with network adequacy standards, offer an essential benefits package, and have benefits equivalent to average employer health plans. Individual policies issued after 2013 can only be offered as Exchange plans, while existing group plans must meet new standards by 2018. Existing nongroup policies can be grandfathered if there are no changes to coverage terms, benefits, or cost-sharing. H.R. 3962 allows states to form Health Care Choice Compacts for selling individual health insurance plans across state lines, subjecting coverage to one primary state's laws while preserving secondary states' authority to enforce specific rules. The Secretary would work with the NAIC to develop model guidelines for these compacts. The Secretary would make grants available to states for activities related to regulating health insurance coverage sold in secondary states. QHBPs would be required to cover the \"essential benefits package\" but could offer additional benefits, comply with network adequacy standards, and be equivalent in scope to the average employer health plan in 2013. The essential benefits package required for QHBPs would cover hospitalization, outpatient services, physician services, prescription drugs, rehabilitative services, mental health, and substance use disorder services. The essential benefits package for QHBPs includes coverage for hospitalization, outpatient services, physician services, prescription drugs, rehabilitative services, mental health and substance use disorder services, preventive services, vaccines, maternity care, well baby and well child care, oral health, vision, and hearing services, equipment, and supplies for those under age 21, and durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and related supplies. The annual out-of-pocket limit in 2013 would be no more than $5,000 for an individual and $10,000 for a family, adjusted annually for inflation. Cost-sharing levels would be established using copayments. The essential benefits package for QHBPs covers various healthcare services with cost-sharing determined by the Health Benefits Advisory Committee and the HHS Secretary. Plans offered through the Exchange can have richer benefits than the Basic plan, with employer plans having flexibility in cost-sharing options. The Health Benefits Advisory Committee (HBAC) recommends cost-sharing levels for plans offered through the Health Insurance Exchange, ensuring consistency with actuarial values for different plan tiers. The Health Benefits Advisory Committee (HBAC) recommends benefit standards for plans offered in the Exchange, incorporating innovation in healthcare and reducing health disparities. The Secretary must adopt the standards within 18 months, with the option to provide feedback and revisions. H.R. 3962 would federalize private health insurance standards and create a Health Insurance Exchange to facilitate the purchase of Qualified Health Benefit Plans (QHBPs) by individuals and small businesses. The Exchange would provide access to insurers' plans similar to online travel booking platforms like Travelocity or Expedia. The Exchange under H.R. 3962 would be established as a federal agency, responsible for negotiating with plans, enforcing requirements, and administering premium and cost-sharing credits. Startup and operating costs would be covered by a new Health Insurance Exchange Trust Fund. The Health Insurance Exchange Trust Fund would be funded by taxes on individuals without coverage, penalties for non-compliant employers, and payroll assessments. Only one Exchange per state would be allowed, with approval required by the Commissioner. Additional funding could be appropriated as needed. State-based Exchanges would be funded through a federal matching grant to states, with the Commissioner presuming compliance for existing Exchanges. New nongroup coverage could only be obtained through the Exchange starting in 2013, excluding grandfathered plans. The public health insurance option, income-based premium and cost-sharing credits, and coverage through the Exchange would be available only through the Exchange. By 2019, 30 million people would obtain Exchange coverage, with 6 million enrolling in the public health insurance option. Individuals would be eligible for Exchange coverage unless enrolled in a group plan through a full-time employee. Individuals can obtain coverage through a group plan, Medicare, or Medicaid. Eligibility for Exchange coverage ends when eligible for Medicare Part A or Medicaid. Enrollment in an Exchange plan remains until discontinued. Annual open-enrollment period in September to November for at least 30 days, with special enrollment periods available. Employers with 25 or fewer employees would be Exchange-eligible in 2013, and in 2014, employers with 50 or fewer employees would also be eligible. They can offer and contribute towards employees' enrollment through the Exchange, allowing employees to choose from available plans. Once enrolled through the Exchange, employers would remain Exchange-eligible unless they offer their own Qualified Health Benefit Plans (QHBPs). In 2015, employers with 100 or fewer employees could be Exchange-eligible. The Commissioner could allow larger employers to participate in the Exchange, with plans meeting federal requirements and standardized cost-sharing options. The Exchange-participating entity must offer a Basic plan with minimum essential benefits and a 70% actuarial value. They can also offer an Enhanced plan with lower cost-sharing (85% actuarial value) and a Premium plan with even lower cost-sharing. The entity can offer Premium-Plus plans in a service area with additional benefits like adult oral health and vision care. Plans must adhere to specified cost-sharing levels for each benefit category in the essential benefits package, with a 10% variation allowed. The Secretary of HHS would establish a public health insurance option through the Exchange under H.R. 3962. Individuals eligible for insurance through the Exchange can enroll in the public option and may qualify for income-based premium and cost-sharing credits. The public option must meet all requirements. The public option under H.R. 3962 must meet Exchange plan requirements, offer Basic, Enhanced, and Premium plans, and could offer Premium-Plus plans. Geographically adjusted premiums would be set by the Secretary to cover costs, with limited start-up funding to be repaid within 10 years. Federal funds would be prohibited for the public option. The public option under H.R. 3962 must meet Exchange plan requirements, offer various plans, and have geographically adjusted premiums. Payment rates for health care providers would be negotiated by the Secretary, with limits set to ensure rates are not too low or too high. Medicare-participating providers would also serve the public option, unless they choose to opt out. The public option under H.R. 3962 would allow physicians to participate as preferred or non-preferred providers, with preferred physicians prohibited from balance-billing. Non-physician providers would also be prohibited from balance-billing. The Secretary would have the authority to use innovative payment methods under the public option, and implement payment and delivery system reforms. The Secretary would implement payment and delivery system reforms for the public option, using successful methods from other parts of the Act. No-risk contracts could be used for administration, similar to those for Medicare. Administrative functions include payment determination, beneficiary education, provider services, and communication. A memorandum of understanding with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs is required. Members of Congress and other employees could choose to enroll in health insurance through any Exchange plan, including public and private options. They would be responsible for 100% of the premium in the Exchange if they reject employer-sponsored insurance. A memorandum of understanding with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs is required for the collection of costs associated with nonservice-connected care provided in VA facilities to public health insurance enrollees. The bill would establish a Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan (CO-OP) program with $5 billion in funding for not-for-profit health insurance cooperatives in the Exchange. Grants and loans would be provided for start-up costs and solvency requirements, with conditions including being a not-for-profit, member organization. The bill establishes a CO-OP program with $5 billion in funding for not-for-profit health insurance cooperatives in the Exchange, with conditions including being a not-for-profit, member organization under state law, not offering insurance before July 16, 2009, and having ethical standards to protect against insurance industry interference. The cooperative, not sponsored by a state government, issues QHBPs through health insurance exchanges in multiple states. Governance is based on member majority vote, with a strong consumer focus on timeliness, responsiveness, and accountability. Profits are used to lower premiums, enhance benefits, or improve quality. Cooperatives aim to lower premiums, improve benefits, and enhance healthcare quality for members. The Commissioner prioritizes statewide operations, integrated delivery systems, and financial support from non-governmental sources when granting loans. Violations of program terms require repayment of funds with interest. Cross-state integration is allowed, and some individuals may qualify for premium assistance. Individuals eligible for premium credits under H.R. 3962 may also qualify for cost-sharing credits starting in 2013 and 2014 for Basic plans sold through the Exchange. Subsidies may be necessary to help individuals afford the cost-sharing required for health care. Individuals eligible for credits under H.R. 3962 can receive a credit in the Exchange if they meet certain criteria, including being lawfully present in the United States, having a modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) below 400% of the federal poverty level, and not being enrolled in an Exchange plan through an employer. Individuals eligible for premium credits under H.R. 3962 must have a modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) below 400% of the federal poverty level, not be enrolled in certain health plans, and not be a full-time employee with employer-sponsored health insurance. The premium credit is based on an \"affordable premium amount\" tied to individuals' income relative to the poverty level. For more details, refer to CRS. Beginning in 2014, the Commissioner would adjust the percentages in the table to maintain the same government versus enrollees premium payment ratio as in 2013. The \"reference premium\" for calculating credits would be based on the three lowest premium Basic plans in the area. The \"affordability premium credit\" would be the lesser of how much the enrollee's premium exceeds the affordable amount or a set limit. The Commissioner would establish premium percentage limits based on income tiers, with increasing limits on a sliding scale. Affordable premium credit would be calculated monthly, and assistance would be provided for cost-sharing. The Commissioner would establish premium percentage limits based on income tiers, with increasing limits on a sliding scale. Affordable premium credit would be calculated monthly, and assistance would be provided for cost-sharing. specify reductions in cost-sharing amounts and the annual limitation (out-of-pocket maximum) on cost-sharing under a Basic plan so that the average percentage of covered benefits paid by the plan is equal to the percentages in Table 3 for each income tier. The out-of-pocket limits in the table would be doubled for family coverage and increased in future years based on actuarial values. The House bill includes provisions to raise revenues for expanded health insurance coverage, such as limiting employer deductions for certain health insurance plans and modifying tax-advantaged accounts for health care spending. The Commissioner would pay insurers additional amounts to cover reduced cost-sharing for credit-eligible individuals. The House bill includes provisions to raise revenues for expanded health insurance coverage, such as limiting employer deductions for certain health insurance plans and modifying tax-advantaged accounts for health care spending. Employers providing prescription drug coverage to retirees meeting federal standards are eligible for subsidy payments from the federal government, which are excludable from the employer's gross income for tax purposes. H.R. 3962 would require employers to coordinate the subsidy and the deduction for retiree prescription drug coverage, reducing the deduction by the amount of the federal subsidy received, raising $2.2 billion over a 10-year period. Under current law, various health care spending accounts like FSAs, HSAs, HRAs, and MSAs allow workers to exclude qualified medical expenses from income taxes. FSAs are funded through employee salary reduction and reimburse for health care expenses. About one-third of workers had access to an FSA in 2007. H.R. 3962 proposes to limit annual FSA contributions to $2,500 per person starting in 2013, indexed to inflation. This change is estimated to generate $13.3 billion over 10 years. HSAs are also tax-advantaged accounts for unreimbursed medical expenses with specific eligibility criteria. HSAs, unlike FSAs, allow rollover of funds and are for individuals with high deductible health plans. Distributions for qualified medical expenses are tax-free, while non-qualified distributions are subject to income tax and a penalty. H.R. 3962 proposes increasing the penalty on non-qualified distributions to 20%. This provision is estimated to raise $1.3 billion over 10 years. The House proposal in H.R. 3962 would modify tax-advantaged plans like FSAs, HSAs, and HRAs by restricting coverage of over-the-counter medications without a physician's prescription. This change is estimated to increase revenues by $5.0 billion over 10 years. Additionally, the bill addresses state laws regarding abortion coverage or funding. H.R. 3962 would not preempt state laws on abortion coverage or procedural requirements. It would also protect federal conscience laws and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. The bill prohibits discrimination against healthcare entities that do not provide or fund abortions. H.R. 3962 does not preempt state laws on abortion coverage or procedural requirements. It protects federal conscience laws and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, prohibiting discrimination against healthcare entities that do not provide or fund abortions. The bill restricts the recommendation and adoption of abortion-related standards in the essential benefits package for QHBPs, but does not prohibit coverage for elective abortions or those permitted by federal funds in cases of rape, incest, or physical health risks. The Stupak Amendment, part of H.R. 3962, imposes restrictions on the use of funds for abortion coverage, except in cases of rape, incest, or physical health risks that endanger the woman's life. The Stupak Amendment in H.R. 3962 allows for separate supplemental coverage for elective abortions, but it must be paid for with nonfederal funds and cannot be purchased with premium payments eligible for affordability credits. The Stupak Amendment in H.R. 3962 allows for separate supplemental coverage for elective abortions, which must be paid for with nonfederal funds and cannot be purchased with premium payments eligible for affordability credits. H.R. 3962 requires plans covering elective abortions to offer an identical plan without such coverage. Exchange plans cannot discriminate against healthcare providers unwilling to provide, pay for, or refer for abortions. States can receive incentive payments for implementing alternative medical liability laws compliant with the bill. The law must meet certain requirements to be considered effective, including making the medical liability system more reliable, encouraging disclosure of errors, and maintaining access to affordable insurance. State laws must include an \"early offer\" system or a \"certificate of merit\" program, without limiting attorneys' fees or imposing damage caps. An early offer system allows a defendant to offer periodic payments for a claimant's economic losses within 180 days of a claim being filed. If the offer is declined and litigation proceeds, the standards of misconduct and proof are raised. The bill proposes a certificate of merit program for medical malpractice suits, requiring testimony from a medical expert to establish claim merit. States receiving incentive payments must use them to improve healthcare. The bill authorizes appropriation for incentive payments but does not provide funds. It clarifies that state laws on legal standards in malpractice cases are not affected. QHBPs must disseminate information. QHBPs must provide information on end-of-life planning, including advance directives and physician's orders for life-sustaining treatment, while not promoting suicide or hastening death."
