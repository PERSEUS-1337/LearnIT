The Cherry Valley area in northeastern Pennsylvania is home to over 80 special-concern animal and plant species and natural habitats. Six endangered or threatened species, including the bog turtle and dwarf wedge mussel, have been documented in or near Cherry Valley. Cherry Valley provides habitat for 79 species of national or regional concern, including neotropical migratory birds like the Cerulean Warbler, Worm-eating Warbler, and Wood Thrush. Efforts are being made to reestablish favorable conditions for the Indiana bat, a historic resident in the area. Cherry Valley is home to various bird species, rare plants like the spreading globeflower, and anadromous fish. The area is part of the Kittatinny Ridge, a crucial migration route for birds of prey in the northeastern United States, including the bald eagle and golden eagle. The Kittatinny Ridge in Cherry Valley is a significant migration route for birds of prey, including the bald eagle and golden eagle. The area also features rare calcareous wetlands and high water quality in Cherry Creek. Additionally, there are federally-owned parcels of land adjacent to the study area for potential acquisition. The area to be studied under this Act includes the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area and a 700-acre segment of the Appalachian Trail owned by the National Park Service. Public meetings have shown strong local support for a Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge. Leaders, media, and elected officials have shown enthusiasm for a Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge. Local communities, conservation entities, and state agencies are actively working to protect Cherry Valley's wildlife habitat and farmland, making them potential partners for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Several local landowners have already placed their land into conservation easements or other arrangements. Monroe County, Pennsylvania, and Stroud Township, Pennsylvania, have voter-approved funds for open space and municipal land conservation. The Pennsylvania municipal land conservation fund has contributed to various projects. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
