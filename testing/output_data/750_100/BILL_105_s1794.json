The United States Commission is authorized to receive and determine claims by U.S. nationals against Iraq, applying applicable law and principles of justice. Priority is given to non-commercial claims before others are decided. The United States Commission decides non-commercial claims of active, retired, or reserve members of the US Armed Forces and other individuals related to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait or the 1987 USS Stark attack. The International Claims Settlement Act applies to these claims. SEC. 3. CLAIMS FUNDS. The Secretary of the Treasury can establish the Iraq Claims Fund for paying claims under section 2(a). Proceeds from Iraqi asset liquidation will be allocated by the President between the Iraq Claims Fund and other appropriate accounts.

The term \"certified claims of the United States Government\" is defined in this context.

Any remaining funds are transferred to the general fund of the Treasury of the United States. Payment of awards under this Act does not eliminate any unsatisfied claims or rights against the Government of Iraq.
