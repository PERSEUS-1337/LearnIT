    "title": "SB 1179",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 9002 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to include definitions related to active militia, armed services, board of trustees, and district in public cemetery districts. The definition of \"domestic partner\" and \"family member\" is provided in accordance with the Family Code. Additionally, the definition of \"firefighter\" is also included in the section. An interment right within a cemetery allows the owner to control the use of a plot for human remains, including determining who can be interred and managing memorial markers. This property interest is transferable and governed by specific regulations. Chapter 5.5 (9069.10) of the Health and Safety Code defines terms like \"nonresident,\" \"peace officer,\" \"principal county,\" and \"voter.\" This chapter pertains to interment rights within cemeteries, allowing owners to control plot use for human remains. Interment rights in cemeteries do not include the right for disinterment of human remains without consent. The chapter allows for the removal of remains within the same cemetery under certain circumstances. The cemetery district must keep a duplicate of an order for removal of remains and maintain a record including the date of removal, the name and age of the deceased, the original cemetery and plot, and details of reinterment or alternate disposition if remains are not reinterred. The person making the removal must provide a complete record to the cemetery district, including the date of reinterment if remains are reburied at the cemetery. An interment right grants a transferable property interest to the listed owner in the cemetery district records. The owner can designate who may be interred in the plot. The owner of an interment right must designate a successor owner in writing at the time of purchase. The use of a transferred interment right must comply with state and local laws and district policies. If the owner of an interment right dies without a valid disposition, the right passes according to intestate succession laws. If there are no heirs, the district follows abandonment procedures. When a public cemetery district transfers ownership rights based on an affidavit, they are not liable for any claims unless they had actual knowledge of false information provided. A successor owner of an interment right must sign an affidavit declaring their entitlement, efforts to find other claimants, and lack of opposition. Upon the sale of a cemetery plot, the district must inform the buyer in writing about interment rights, ownership succession, and district policies. The act does not require reimbursement for costs incurred by local agencies or school districts related to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions. The Commission on State Mandates will provide reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for costs mandated by the state, as outlined in the Government Code."
