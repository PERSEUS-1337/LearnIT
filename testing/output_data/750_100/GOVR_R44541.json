    "content": "Trade-based money laundering (TBML) is the exploitation of the international trade system to transfer value and hide the origins of illicit wealth. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) defines TBML as disguising crime proceeds through trade transactions by misrepresenting prices, quantities, or quality of imports/exports. This process is used by terrorist groups to finance activities and disguise money sources and beneficiaries. TBML schemes involve disguising the source and beneficiaries of funds to finance activities. Financial institutions can be implicated in TBML schemes through international trade transactions. The U.S. Department of the Treasury issued reports on money laundering in June 2015, identifying TBML as a significant challenge. The National Money Laundering Risk Assessment highlighted trade-based money laundering (TBML) as a major challenge to investigate, with TBML schemes capable of laundering billions annually. A 2010 advisory from the Treasury Department's FinCEN reported over 17,000 Suspicious Activity Reports on potential TBML activities totaling more than $276 billion. Criminal organizations and terrorist financiers also exploit the international financial system. Criminal organizations and terrorist financiers utilize the international financial system and cash couriers to conceal their activities through trade-based money laundering (TBML). They exploit the complexities of foreign exchange transactions, trade financing arrangements, and the co-mingling of legitimate and illicit funds. Limited resources in customs agencies hinder the detection of suspicious trade transactions. Money launderers also take advantage of vulnerabilities in the use of letters of credit. Trade-based money laundering (TBML) involves exploiting vulnerabilities in financial arrangements for cross-border trade to launder funds. TBML techniques vary in complexity and are often combined with other money laundering methods to obscure the money trail. Activities include misrepresenting goods' price, quality, or quantity during transit. Basic TBML techniques include over- and under-invoicing of goods and services. According to the FATF, money laundering through over- and under-invoicing goods and services is a common method for laundering funds across borders. This involves invoicing goods or services below or above market value to transfer funds between parties. These transactions require collusion and can be used to shift value between importers and exporters. Money laundering through over- and under-invoicing involves collusion between parties to transfer funds by invoicing goods or services below or above market value. Complex products and those in supply chains are more likely to be used in these activities to complicate customs officials' ability to determine true market value. Multiple invoicing for the same transaction allows money launderers to justify multiple payments, while using multiple financial institutions can further obscure the transactions. Money launderers can increase transaction complexity by making multiple payments through different financial institutions. They can manipulate prices and quantities of goods and services, even colluding to not ship any goods while falsifying shipping documents. This complicates detection efforts and allows for plausible explanations to evade officials. Money launderers use various techniques like falsifying goods and services descriptions to create discrepancies in value on shipping and customs forms. The Black Market Peso Exchange (BMPE) is a common scheme for laundering drug proceeds from Latin America. Colombian drug traffickers used sophisticated trade-based schemes to disguise up to $4 billion in annual narcotics profits in the 1980s, known as trade-based money laundering (TBML). TBML is a common form of international money laundering and is utilized by terrorist organizations. Despite being less understood by academics and policymakers compared to traditional money laundering methods, TBML can have significant consequences for global commerce due to the volume and value of transactions involved. Trade-based money laundering (TBML) can have destructive effects on international commerce and government revenue. Criminal organizations may sell imported goods bought with illicit funds at discounted prices to expedite the money laundering process, putting legitimate businesses at a disadvantage and hindering entrepreneurship. TBML poses a significant risk to legitimate economic activity. Trade-based money laundering (TBML) undermines international commerce by crowding out legitimate economic activity and depriving governments of tax revenue. Global trends in trade facilitation have been exploited by criminal organizations to conceal the proceeds of illegal activities, taking advantage of advances in communication, lower transportation costs, and interconnected economies. Global trends in trade facilitation have allowed criminal organizations to expand their activities into new markets, reducing risks by diversifying into profitable but hard-to-detect activities. Criminal groups have adapted to the interconnected economies and societies, exploiting advances in communication and lower transportation costs. Criminal groups have adapted to global trade trends by diversifying into new illicit markets, creating economies of scale and efficiencies. The OECD warns that illegal trade and financial flows pose challenges for law enforcement and could have wide-ranging economic consequences, especially in developing countries. The international trade system is vulnerable to exploitation by criminal organizations and terrorist groups due to its vast potential and low risk of detection. Key vulnerabilities identified by FATF include the enormous volume of trade flows, complexity of foreign exchange transactions, diverse financing arrangements, and the practice of comingling illicit funds. According to FinCEN, trade-based money laundering (TBML) activity is increasing globally, with Mexico and China being the most frequently identified countries involved. Panama, Dominican Republic, and Venezuela were also noted for TBML activity, potentially linked to specific trade zones. Limited resources in customs agencies hinder the detection of illegal trade transactions. According to the U.S. Department of State's 2016 annual report on money laundering and financial crimes, concerns about trade-based money laundering (TBML) have been identified in various countries including Afghanistan, Australia, Belize, Brazil, Cambodia, Canada, China, Colombia, Greece, Guatemala, Hong Kong, India, Iran, Iraq, Japan, Kenya, Lebanon, Mexico, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, the Philippines, Singapore, Saint Maarten, Switzerland, Taiwan, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Uruguay, Venezuela, and the West Bank and Gaza. The State Department's Country Reports on Terrorism 2015 highlighted trade-based money laundering (TBML) in Trinidad and Tobago, leading to customs and tax revenue losses, corruption, and exploitation of free trade zones. Known terrorist groups like Hezbollah have been linked to TBML activities. The Treasury Department's June 2015 National Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment found that while terrorist groups like Hezbollah have used trade-based money laundering (TBML), it is not the primary method for terrorist financing. Instead, the main methods identified since 2001 have been the physical movement of cash and the movement of funds through the banking system. The Treasury Department's National Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment found that cash accounted for 28 percent of cases, movement through banks 22 percent, licensed MSBs 17 percent, and unlicensed money transmitters 18 percent. The remaining 15 percent involved checks, wire transfers, and TBML. TBML is a concern in Tunisia and Syria, used by hawala brokers with corrupt officials. Hawala is an informal fund transfer method used in regions with limited banking services. It involves trusted money brokers who transfer funds for clients. Settlements among brokers are done outside traditional financial institutions. Hawala is preferred for its speed, reliability, and lower costs, but unregulated systems can be associated with corruption. Unregulated hawala systems are seen as lacking transparency and vulnerable to abuse by terrorist groups. The State Department's 2016 report identified countries at risk for TBML/FT schemes, such as Afghanistan and Pakistan. Lebanon is also mentioned for individuals involved in TBML. In Lebanon, individuals are involved in a TBML scheme with trade in vehicles, sometimes with weapons, to launder drug proceeds linked to Hezbollah. U.S. law enforcement traced money wires from Jordanian and Lebanese entities to domestic vehicle dealerships in the United States. The purchased vehicles are exported to Lebanon and Jordan, with weapons hidden in some cases. The transactions in the U.S. seem legitimate, but the final destination of the vehicles is unknown. TBML schemes involving vehicle trade are prevalent in Paraguay's Tri-Border Area with Brazil and Argentina, where a lucrative cross-border cigarette smuggling market is used for money laundering, benefiting criminal organizations and potentially terrorist groups. In the United Arab Emirates, TBML schemes may support sanctions-evasion networks and terrorist groups in various countries. In February 2011, the Department of the Treasury designated the Lebanese Canadian Bank (LCB) as a financial institution of primary money-laundering concern, stating that Hezbollah \"derived financial support\" from drug and money laundering schemes involving TBML. An international narcotics trafficking and money laundering network moved illegal drugs from South America to Europe and the Middle East via West Africa, laundering hundreds of millions of dollars monthly through accounts at LCB and trade-based money laundering with consumer goods worldwide. Hezbollah-linked schemes involved money laundering through used car dealerships in the US and consumer goods trade globally. Funds were transferred to buy cars in the US, which were then sold in West Africa. Another scheme involved Asian goods sent to Latin America, with proceeds laundered through a BMPE-styled scheme. In the late 2000s, funds from illicit schemes involving Hezbollah were laundered through a BMPE-styled scheme. Lebanon's central bank revoked LCB's banking license in 2011, leading to the sale of its assets. Individuals and entities linked to this network faced financial sanctions and investigations in the US. In the late 2000s, owners of Los Angeles-based toy wholesaler Woody Toys, Inc. received cash payments from Colombian and Mexican narcotics trafficking, which were laundered through a BMPE scheme. The cash deposits were kept under $10,000 to avoid reporting requirements, used to buy toys from China, exported to Colombia, and the profits in Colombian pesos were used to reimburse the drug traffickers. Colombian drug traffickers used a BMPE scheme involving employees of Woody Toys, who had ties to Angel Toy Company. The investigation benefited from information sharing between the US and Colombia through Trade Transparency Units. Another money laundering scheme in the early 2000s involved cash from international drug traffickers. In the early 2000s, funds from major international drug traffickers were managed by an Indian national in Dubai through various financial channels. The individual operated businesses in Dubai and affiliates worldwide, opening letters of credit for importers to benefit affiliated exporters in India and other locations. The Indian national in Dubai used his businesses' connections with banks to transmit LCs with inflated export values to affiliated exporters in India, along with drug trafficking funds, disguising money movement as trade financing. The exporters then distributed drug proceeds to affiliates and sold exports at market value. The Indian national in Dubai facilitated trade in banned goods by falsifying trade documents through his network of businesses in India. He used hawala operators to move funds offshore and settle the difference between the true and fraudulent value of the goods. U.S. government policy responses to address trade-based money laundering include participation in the Financial Action Task Force and Treasury Department regulatory measures. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) was established to develop AML/CFT guidelines and comprises 34 member countries. FATF relies on self-assessments and mutual evaluations to ensure compliance with its guidelines and can suspend non-compliant members. Since 1989, FATF has been examining money laundering techniques and trends. In 1989, FATF was tasked with examining money laundering techniques and trends. In 1990, FATF issued 40 recommendations to combat money laundering. The U.S. leads the interagency delegation to FATF, supporting global efforts against money laundering and terrorist financing. The United States strongly supports the FATF in combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The U.S. delegation, led by Treasury staff members, includes representatives from various government departments. In 2012, FATF adopted revised recommendations integrating CFT guidelines. The FATF adopted revised recommendations in 2012, integrating CFT guidelines. In October 2015, the mandate was expanded to include the financing of weapons of mass destruction. The new standards aim to enhance global surveillance of criminal and terrorist threats, strengthen partnerships with the private sector, and improve standards in low capacity countries. The updated recommendations address new threats and reinforce existing obligations, with a focus on higher-risk situations. The FATF's revised recommendations in 2012 integrated CFT guidelines and expanded in 2015 to include financing of weapons of mass destruction. The new standards aim to enhance global surveillance of criminal and terrorist threats, strengthen partnerships with the private sector, and improve standards in low capacity countries. The current set of FATF 40 Recommendations address transparency requirements related to beneficial ownership, control of legal persons, and various criminal activities, but do not include specific recommendations to counter TBML despite recognizing the increased opportunities for abuse in the international trade and financing system. The FATF has identified a lack of comprehensive data on trade-based money laundering (TBML) due to most jurisdictions not recognizing TBML as a separate activity under money laundering. This results in a lack of specific training related to TBML activities. The FATF recommended jurisdictions develop specific training programs for detecting TBML, focusing on financial and trade data analysis. The Treasury Department's FinCEN issues advisories and special measures to combat TBML. FinCEN issues advisories to combat trade-based money laundering (TBML), providing red flags for financial institutions to detect suspicious activities. Previous advisories in 1997, 1999, and 2010 highlighted TBML schemes and offered specific indicators for reporting. In May 2014, FinCEN issued an updated advisory on trade-based money laundering (TBML) involving funnel accounts, citing delays in reporting and requesting financial institutions to include TBML or BMPE on SARs. Funnel accounts receive multiple cash deposits below reporting thresholds and withdraw funds in different areas quickly. The advisory from FinCEN highlights red flags of suspicious activity by Mexican criminal organizations, including trade-based money laundering through funnel accounts. FinCEN also utilizes Geographic Targeting Orders (GTOs) to impose recordkeeping requirements on financial institutions in specific areas for identifying criminal activity. GTOs are time-limited and can only last for a maximum of 180 days. In April 2015, FinCEN issued a GTO targeting Miami-based electronics exporters, requiring them to report cash transactions over $3,000 to combat trade-based money laundering. Violators may face civil or criminal liability. FinCEN imposed a $10,000 filing threshold for cash transactions under BSA to combat TBML schemes by drug and crime organizations. In October 2015, FinCEN renewed the GTO for 180 days and issued another GTO lowering cash reporting to $3,000 for businesses in the Los Angeles Fashion District to target drug traffickers. FinCEN, under the BSA and USA PATRIOT Act, can require U.S. financial institutions to take regulatory special measures against entities involved in money laundering. These measures range from enhanced due diligence to prohibiting certain accounts. Treasury Department may also take administrative actions in conjunction with FinCEN's directives. In April 2013, FinCEN designated two Lebanese exchange houses, Halawi Exchange and Rmeiti Exchange, for their involvement in a large-scale TBML scheme, facilitating transactions related to the purchase of used cars in the United States for export. The U.S. authorities claim that two Lebanese exchange houses were involved in a TBML scheme linked to Hezbollah and international narcotics trafficking. The Trade Transparency Unit in Washington, DC, established by ICE/HSI, uses a specialized computer system to identify instances of TBML through trade anomalies and financial irregularities. The U.S. authorities, with funding support from the Department of State, have established Trade Transparency Units (TTUs) in various countries to combat trade-based money laundering (TBML) and other financial crimes. These TTUs are part of a broader plan to create an international network similar to the Egmont Group of FIUs, as outlined in the 2007 National Money Laundering Strategy. The U.S. has established Trade Transparency Units (TTUs) to combat trade-based money laundering (TBML) as a national goal. The State Department reports an increase in TBML investigations from TTU activity, with over $1 billion seized. The 114th Congress has addressed TBML in hearings focusing on specific terrorist groups like Hezbollah and regional security priorities, particularly in Latin America. The 114th Congress has addressed trade-based money laundering (TBML) in hearings focusing on policy responses to anti-money laundering and terrorist financing in Latin America. Witnesses have questioned the effectiveness of U.S. and international efforts to combat TBML, including the role of Trade Transparency Units (TTUs) and the potential link between U.S. trade policy and commitments to combat TBML. The 114th Congress has shown interest in the connection between trade-based money laundering (TBML) and terrorist financing. Despite the Treasury Department downplaying this relationship in a 2015 report, policymakers are still concerned about links, citing examples involving Hezbollah. In response, the Congress passed the Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015 to impose additional financial restrictions on Hezbollah-linked foreign financial institutions. The Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015 imposed financial restrictions on Hezbollah-linked foreign financial institutions with U.S. accounts. OFAC issued a final rule for its implementation in 2016. President Obama's Administration is committed to taking strong action against Hezbollah's financing activities. The Administration is committed to countering Hizballah activities through sanctions. Congress may monitor the implementation of the Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015. The list includes hearings in the 114th Congress where trade-based money laundering (TBML) was discussed. One hearing focused on TBML titled \"Trading with the Enemy: Trade-Based Money Laundering is the Growth Industry in Terror Finance.\" The House Financial Services Committee and House Homeland Security Committee held hearings on investigating terrorism financing and current terrorist financing trends in South America.
