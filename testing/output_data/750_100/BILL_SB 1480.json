    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 254.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to require claims for welfare and veterans' organization exemptions to be filed by February 15th each year with the assessor. Approval of property tax exemptions is contingent upon the claimant obtaining an organizational clearance certificate. Financial statements are to be provided only upon request by the assessor. The assessor reviews claims for welfare and veterans' organization exemptions to ensure property meets requirements. Assessors consider if capital investment for plant expansion is justified and serves community interests. The assessor may audit the operations of property owners to verify eligibility for welfare exemption, even if an organizational clearance certificate has been granted. If property is found ineligible for exemption, claimant will be notified in writing. Claimant can seek refund of property taxes by filing a claim with the county, and if denied, can file a refund action in superior court. An applicant granted a welfare exemption for exempted property does not need to reapply if there are no changes and the property is used by a governmental entity or nonprofit corporation. Notification must be given if the applicant becomes ineligible or no longer owns the property by February 15. On or before the lien date, the property was no longer owned by the applicant or failed to meet requirements for the welfare exemption. The assessor must annually send a notice to applicants exempt from filing an annual application, detailing circumstances that may make the property ineligible for exemption. The applicant is reminded to inform the assessor if the property no longer qualifies. The notice informs applicants how to maintain eligibility for the welfare exemption under Section 214.15 or Section 231 for the next fiscal year. Failure to reaffirm eligibility may result in additional contact by the assessor to verify exempt activity. Upon indication of incorrect granting of welfare or veterans' organization exemption, the assessor will reassess eligibility and cancel the exemption on ineligible property immediately. If a welfare or veterans' organization exemption is incorrectly allowed on the property, an escape assessment will be made for the amount of the exemption, with interest and a penalty of 10% of the escape assessment, not exceeding $250, for failure to notify the assessor. The board reviews the assessor's administration of welfare and veterans' organization exemptions to ensure proper implementation. Section 1840 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended. Section 1840 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to allow counties, cities, and municipal corporations to request a review, equalization, or adjustment of property assessments by the board. Applications must be submitted in writing by November 30 or within 60 days of receiving a tax bill for assessments made outside the regular period. Every application for property assessment review must be filed with the assessor and include the necessary facts. The board will provide notice and a hearing for timely applications, as per their rules. Failure to file on time will result in the applicant being ineligible for relief under Section 11 of Article XIII. Section 4674 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended. Any excess proceeds from a delinquent tax sale trust fund, not claimed by parties of interest, may be transferred to the county general fund after a specified period. County may deduct costs before transfer. The excess proceeds from a delinquent tax sale trust fund, not claimed by parties of interest, may be transferred to the county general fund after a specified period. County may deduct costs of administering and processing the claims for excess proceeds before transfer."
