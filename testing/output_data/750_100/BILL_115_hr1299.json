Congress finds that the Honduran police are corrupt and commit human rights abuses, including torture, rape, illegal detention, and murder with impunity. The New York Times revealed documents showing top officials ordered the killings of drug-crime investigators in 2009 and 2011, with knowledge of high-ranking government officials. The President of Honduras is accused of manipulating revelations for corrupt purposes. Individuals in the police with a history of human rights abuses are promoted to high positions. International human rights bodies report abuses by the military and police, including death squad activity. The national police in Honduras face chronic issues with the use of lethal force, inefficiency, corruption, and impunity. Efforts to clean up the police force have largely failed, with little progress made in prosecuting officials for human rights violations. Efforts to clean up the police force in Honduras have largely failed, with minimal progress in prosecuting corrupt officials. The reported separations of police involved in corruption and human rights abuses have not been independently verified. Fundamental reform of the police is still needed. Rights Action documented the Fifteenth Battalion of the Honduran Armed Forces allegedly participating in killings alongside police and private security forces. Private security forces were involved in the killings of small-farmer activists in the Aguan Valley since 2000, with no consequences. Only one private actor has been convicted so far. Key activists continue to be assassinated, such as Jose Angel Flores and Silmer Dionisio George in 2016. Military members have also been involved in human rights abuses, such as shooting civilians in July 2013. In July 2013, members of the Armed Forces shot and killed Tomas Garcia, a Lenca Indigenous activist, and injured his son during a peaceful protest against a dam project. In May 2014, nine members of the Ninth Infantry reportedly tortured and killed Amado Maradiaga Quiroz and tortured his son, Milton Noe Maradiaga Varela. Another incident involved the Honduran Navy killing Joel Palacios Lino and Elvis Armando Garcia, two Garifuna Afro-Indigenous men, while they were digging a car out of the sand on a beach in December 2015. These cases remain unresolved and in impunity. The current Government of Honduras has expanded the military's reach into domestic policing, creating a 3,000-member Military Police in violation of the constitution. This has led to disastrous results, including the killings of unarmed individuals at checkpoints. Allegations of human rights abuses by the military have notably increased since the creation of the Military Police. Abuses by the military have increased notably, with the creation of two new battalions of the Military Police in 2016. The Honduran judicial system is plagued by corruption, with officials connected to organized crime and drug traffickers, leading to widespread impunity. The Department of State's 2015 Human Rights Report for Honduras highlights corruption, intimidation, and institutional weakness in the justice system. The justice system in Honduras is plagued by institutional weakness, corruption, and impunity, as highlighted by Human Rights Watch in 2016. Efforts to reform public security institutions have been ineffective, with the judiciary and police marred by corruption and abuse. The assassination of activist Berta Caceres in 2016 further underscores the challenges faced in the country. Berta Caceres, a renowned activist and recipient of the 2015 Goldman Environmental Prize, was killed in Honduras while defending Indigenous land rights against a hydroelectric dam project. Despite reporting 33 threats to authorities, no investigations were conducted, and the government failed to provide adequate protection as mandated by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. Honduras' justice system is plagued by corruption and impunity, as highlighted by Human Rights Watch in 2016. As of February 2017, eight suspects, including individuals with ties to the Honduran military, have been arrested in connection with the killing of activist Berta Caceres. This raises concerns about the military's involvement in her assassination and the need for transparency in the investigation. The Government of Honduras is restricting access to the case for Caceres' family, hindering justice. Despite calls from various entities, the Honduran government has not allowed an independent investigation into the case of activist Berta Caceres. The original case file was stolen, hindering access for her family and others. Activists in Honduras, including trade unionists, journalists, lawyers, Afro-Indigenous activists, Indigenous activists, small-farmer activists, LGBTI activists, human rights defenders, and government critics, are at severe risk with previous abuses largely unpunished. The shooting of journalist Felix Molina on May 2, 2016, highlighted the ongoing danger activists face, as he had posted information linking Caceres's killing to government officials and elite families. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 allocated $18,000,000 to the Honduran police and military, with additional funding authorized in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016. The Inter-American Development Bank lent $59,800,000 to the Honduran police in 2012 with US approval. Funding requests for fiscal year 2017 also call for increased security funding for Honduras. SEC. 3. Suspension of security assistance to Honduras, including funds for police and military equipment and training. The Secretary of the Treasury to vote against any loans for Honduran police or military at multilateral development banks. SEC. 4. Conditions for lifting suspensions and restrictions. The Act will end when the Secretary of State certifies that Honduras has pursued legal action for various murders, including that of Berta Caceres. The Honduran government investigated and prosecuted military and police members for human rights violations, withdrew the military from domestic policing, and ensured civilian authority over police functions. The Honduran government has effectively protected the rights of various groups, including trade unionists, journalists, human rights defenders, Indigenous, Afro-Indigenous, small-farmer, and LGBTI activists, as well as critics of the government and other civil society activists. They have also taken steps to establish the rule of law and ensure a capable judicial system to prosecute members of the police and military for human rights abuses."
