    "content": "Airline passenger screening in the United States has evolved significantly post-9/11 with new technologies and policy changes overseen by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) created under the Aviation Transportation and Security Act (ATSA). The Aviation Transportation and Security Act (ATSA; P.L. 107-71) mandated TSA to provide comprehensive security screening for all airline passengers and property. Congress also allowed TSA to implement trusted traveler programs and use technology to expedite screening, focusing on passengers needing more extensive checks. Subsequently, Congress directed TSA to check all passengers against terrorist watchlists. The TSA has primarily relied on a uniform risk assumption for airport checkpoint screening, unlike its risk-based strategies for other aspects of aviation security. This approach has led to challenges in improving screening capabilities, with a focus on technology such as whole-body imagers and advanced X-ray equipment. The TSA has focused on technology such as whole-body imagers and advanced X-ray equipment to improve detection of threat objects at airport checkpoints. However, constraints like technology limitations, budgetary considerations, and limited resources have hindered a solely technology-driven approach. TSA personnel face challenges in screening passengers efficiently due to time and resource constraints, as well as limitations on screener hiring and space at airports. The TSA has focused on improving airport security by adding screening lanes and personnel, but passengers still face cumbersome procedures like removing shoes and separating laptops for X-ray screening. This has led to unpredictable wait times and criticism from experts, including former TSA Administrator Kip Hawley. The TSA has shifted to a risk-based screening approach in response to criticisms about the security system being brittle. This shift has sparked controversy over how to assess and mitigate security risks, with differing views on where security efforts should be focused. The focus of security efforts should be on the main point to mitigate risks, as advised by Frederick the Great and echoed by Michael Chertoff. In a free society, perfect security is impossible, but security can still be configured in an informed manner. In a free society, perfect security is impossible, but it can be configured to minimize risk by understanding the nature of security risks in aviation, which involve threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences. The aviation security context relies on risk-based practices using categorical techniques and scoring methods to quantify threats, vulnerabilities, and security risk. A comprehensive strategy aims to mitigate all three elements of risk, with a focus on detecting and managing threats through passenger screening initiatives. Detection technologies are utilized to screen for potential threats such as weapons and explosives. The aviation security strategy focuses on detecting and managing threats through passenger screening initiatives using technologies to screen for weapons, explosives, and other threat objects. Vulnerabilities are identified through assessment techniques and addressed through multiple layers of security measures. Consequences are assessed in terms of severity to derive risk valuation and are primarily mitigated by emergency management and response activities. The aviation security strategy focuses on detecting and managing threats through passenger screening initiatives using technologies to screen for weapons, explosives, and other threat objects. Recovery activities are primarily the responsibility of airports, airlines, and state and federal emergency management agencies, not TSA. Establishing an effective risk-based strategy for aviation security involves defining the risk environment and specifying acceptable levels of risk. TSA uses risk scoring for air cargo security but not for commercial passenger aviation due to complexity and controversy. Risk assessment of airline passengers is primarily done through categorical processes, including assigning passengers to different threat categories based on biographical data and behavioral indicators. The validity of behavioral-based risk scores has been questioned, and there is a lack of agreement on specific risks to mitigate in a risk-based security strategy. Following TSA's March 2013 proposal to allow passengers to carry small knives and certain sports equipment onboard aircraft, the agency claimed that the threat posed by these items had decreased. They argued that security measures like armed air marshals, armed pilots, and reinforced cockpit doors were sufficient to mitigate the risk of a hijacking or terrorist attack. Critics, including flight attendants and pilots' organizations, disagreed with this assessment. Critics, including flight attendants, pilots, and airlines, argued against TSA's proposal to lift the ban on small knives and sports equipment due to concerns about risks posed by unruly passengers. Legislation was introduced to prevent TSA from implementing the proposal, leading TSA to announce that they would not proceed with it. This decision marked a shift towards risk-based passenger screening instead of focusing solely on prohibiting certain items onboard aircraft. Former TSA administrator Hawley also raised concerns about this approach. Former TSA administrator Hawley and Israeli expert Ron raise concerns about the security system's reliance on prohibited items lists and detection technology, which may hinder the ability to respond to evolving threats. Ron highlights that the box cutters used in the 9/11 attacks were not prohibited items at the time, emphasizing the limitations of current detection technology. Ron and Hawley criticize the reliance on detection technology and prohibited items lists in security systems. They advocate for integrating detection capabilities with other measures to assess threats effectively. This approach would move away from TSA's traditional rigid screening methods. Advocates of risk-based security suggest moving away from rigid screening methods towards proactive measures like demographic profiling, intelligence databases, and security interviews, as seen in Israel's security system. This approach aims to identify high-risk passengers and subject them to heightened screening to prevent potential threats. Israel has successfully avoided major terrorist attacks on its airlines and airports for over 40 years. The effectiveness of its security methods in deterring attacks is uncertain. Implementing a similar approach in the United States is seen as problematic due to legal and practical concerns. Research suggests that a risk-based approach tailored to the US aviation security framework would be more effective, politically feasible, socially acceptable, and legally defensible than extensive interviewing and targeted screening. Table 1 outlines key attributes of a risk-based aviation security framework, which is considered more effective and legally defensible than extensive interviewing and targeted screening. Risk-based programs work alongside physical screening measures to focus resources on unknown and elevated risk passengers, allowing for security posture adjustments based on perceived threats. Risk-based programs influence decisions on security measures like behavioral detection officers and air marshals based on perceived threats. These approaches have been used in airline passenger screening since the 1970s, allowing for adjustments in security postures. In the late 1970s, risk-based profiling techniques using passenger profiles were used for screening passengers and carry-on items at airports. However, with the deployment of metal detectors and X-ray scanners, these techniques were largely abandoned. The FAA continued to use profiling tools to examine passenger name records for potential threats. In the late 1980s, FAA required airlines to ask passengers security questions to address concerns over aircraft bombings. The security questions asked by airlines in the late 1980s were used to target elevated-risk checked baggage and raise passenger awareness of potential security threats. Despite criticism for their obvious intent, the questions aimed to prevent bombers from tricking individuals into carrying devices aboard aircraft. The TSA eliminated security questions used by airlines in 2006, which were part of the Computer-Assisted Passenger Pre-Screening (CAPPS) system developed after the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing. CAPPS identifies potential security threats based on flight reservation data patterns. After the 9/11 attacks, TSA was directed to establish trusted traveler programs and expedite screening for participants using available technologies. The CAPPS system, now overseen by TSA, uses security-sensitive algorithms that may flag indicators like purchasing one-way tickets or paying with cash. Additionally, the FAA, in coordination with the FBI, created the \"no-fly\" list of known terrorists to be denied boarding, but on 9/11 only 12 names were on the list, none of them the hijackers. After the 9/11 attacks, TSA was directed to establish trusted traveler programs and expedite screening for participants using available technologies. The CAPPS system, overseen by TSA, uses security-sensitive algorithms to evaluate all passengers prior to boarding, focusing on risk-based screening as recommended by the Department of Transportation Airport Security Rapid Response Team formed after 9/11. The Security Rapid Response Team, formed after 9/11, recommended a nationwide program for vetting passengers to expedite processing and focus aviation security resources more effectively. TSA initiated work on CAPPS II, a system for identity authentication, watch list checks, and risk-based assessments of passengers. CAPPS II was a system for identity authentication, watch list checks, and risk-based assessments of passengers. It was scrapped in 2004 due to controversy over privacy and data protection concerns. The TSA then focused on screening all passengers against terrorist watchlists. The 9/11 Commission recommended improving the \"no fly\" and \"automatic selectee\" lists in 2004. They advised screening air passengers against federal government watchlists, with TSA taking over the screening function from air carriers as per the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. TSA assumed passenger watchlist screening function from air carriers, utilizing Terrorist Screening Database. TSA implemented \"Secure Flight\" program in 2009 for domestic flights and 2010 for international flights, fully operational since 2011. The \"Secure Flight\" program, implemented in 2009 for domestic flights and 2010 for international flights, has been fully operational since 2011. The Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) is used to screen passenger biographic information against terrorist watchlists, including the \"no fly\" and \"selectee\" lists. The TSDB contains fewer than 400,000 names, with about 50,000 identities included in the subsets. The Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE) has grown to include about 875,000 foreign identities in the TSDB. The expansion of TIDE, a principal data source for foreign terrorist identities in the TSDB, was largely due to increased reliance post the failed bombing attempt on Northwest Flight 253 in 2009. The TSDB has also grown to over 500,000 identities by September 2012, with a focus on improving watchlist practices for timeliness and accuracy. The intelligence community has focused on improving timeliness, accuracy, and completeness since the attempted bombing. Secure Flight compares passenger data against watchlists to determine access at airport checkpoints. It also checks against CDC lists for boarding restrictions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determines who should be denied boarding for public health reasons. TSA destroys records within seven days if no watchlist match is found, but potential matches are kept for 7 years. Confirmed matches can be retained for up to 99 years. Known traveler lists are kept until updated, and Secure Flight was developed based on experience with the Advance Passenger Information System. Passenger Information System (APIS) managed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) collects manifest data from airlines for international flights to the United States. CBP uses Automated Targeting System-Passenger (ATS-P) for risk assessments on travelers and cross-checks data against law enforcement databases and watchlists. ATS-P helps CBP make advance assessments on individuals for inbound flights. The Automated Targeting System-Passenger (ATS-P) is used by CBP to assess travelers before their arrival in the United States. It compares passenger data against terrorist and law enforcement databases to identify potential threats, without using a risk scoring methodology. The system retains data for up to 15 years and focuses on identifying red flags such as the use of lost or stolen passports. Passenger data in the Automated Targeting System may be retained for up to 15 years. Passenger name record data are depersonalized within six months as per an agreement between the US and EU. Travelers from Visa Waiver Program countries must submit biographical information through ESTA before boarding a US-bound flight, which is checked against law enforcement databases. Secure Flight and Screening Passengers by Observational Techniques (SPOT) are programs used by CBP and TSA to identify potential threats among passengers. Secure Flight checks passenger information against various databases to determine threat levels, while SPOT observes passenger behavior at airports. SPOT was initiated in 2003 and by FY2012, almost 3,000 BDOs were deployed at 176 airports at a cost of $200 million annually. The TSA's Screening Passengers by Observational Techniques (SPOT) program, initiated in 2003, deploys almost 3,000 BDOs at 176 airports at a cost of $200 million annually. The program has faced controversy due to concerns over its scientific validity and operational utility. TSA claims SPOT is based on scientifically validated behaviors to identify potential threats, utilizing law enforcement techniques like criminal profiling and behavioral observation. The SPOT program by TSA utilizes detection techniques from law enforcement, customs, defense, and security. It differs from law enforcement behavior analysis tools by focusing on large groups of individuals and interpretation of behaviors rather than specific crimes. The TSA SPOT program focuses on behavioral detection using non-verbal cues to rate suspicion, unlike law enforcement which combines these techniques with other interrogation practices. The TSA SPOT program focuses on behavioral detection using non-verbal cues to rate suspicion. Despite TSA's claims of effectiveness, the Government Accountability Office reported that known terrorists passed through checkpoints where Behavior Detection Officers were stationed without being identified. The TSA SPOT program, focusing on behavioral detection, was implemented without full validation or cost-benefit analysis. TSA conducted validation studies showing behavior detection techniques were more effective than random selection but did not release the study for independent analysis. The TSA SPOT program, focusing on behavioral detection, was implemented without full validation or cost-benefit analysis. Despite impressive validation study results, doubts remain about behavior detection in the program. TSA has taken steps to address recommendations for improvement and has partnered with international counterparts to refine the SPOT program. The TSA SPOT program, focusing on behavioral detection, lacks evidence supporting its validity and utility according to a 2013 GAO report. Concerns include the metrics used to evaluate the program not directly relating to TSA's mission of deterring terrorism and criminal acts targeting aviation assets. Suitable metrics to assess the impact of the SPOT program are needed due to the low occurrence of terrorist acts. Developing suitable metrics to evaluate the impact of the SPOT program on mission objectives has proven difficult due to low occurrence of terrorist acts. GAO and DHS audits found discrepancies in BDOs' referrals to law enforcement and questioned the effectiveness of behavioral indicators training. Metrics used to support SPOT's effectiveness, such as detection of prohibited items, undeclared currency, and illegal aliens, were not directly related to aviation security objectives. Significant lapses in records-keeping were also noted, suggesting incomplete and inaccurate data had been presented to TSA. The Inspector General found incomplete and inaccurate data presented to TSA's senior leadership regarding the SPOT program. TSA did not consistently provide refresher training for behavior detection officers, raising questions about the program's efficacy and the quality of training. Members of Congress have raised concerns about the program's effectiveness. Despite concerns raised by the GAO and DHS Office of Inspector General, Congress has not taken specific action to revamp the TSA's behavior detection program. Efforts to implement Pre-Check, a trusted traveler program for low-risk passengers, have received more positive feedback. Pre-Check began in October 2011 and became fully operational in 2012. The Pre-Check program, launched in 2011 and fully operational in 2012, has been expanding its scope and availability. It is available at no cost to select frequent flyers and members of trusted traveler programs. Eligible travelers can also apply for Pre-Check at a TSA enrollment center for a fee. The program is similar to the former Registered Traveler program, which was discontinued in 2009. The Registered Traveler program, implemented in 2007 under a public-private partnership model, allowed expedited screening for travelers at multiple airports. Initially, extensive background checks were conducted, but in 2008, TSA eliminated this process and the associated fee. In 2008, TSA eliminated background checks and fees for the Registered Traveler program, stating they were not essential for threat determination. The program was later dismantled. Under Pre-Check, TSA now conducts biographic-based background checks, contrary to their previous stance. Approved individuals receive a known traveler number for flight reservations, without a biometric credential. The known traveler number is used for Pre-Check members to access expedited screening lanes, but random selections for thorough screening can still occur. TSA's reliance on boarding passes for authentication raises concerns due to limited ability to verify them. TSA has deployed Credential Authentication Technology/Boarding Pass Scanning Systems for inspection and authentication. The deployment of Credential Authentication Technology/Boarding Pass Scanning Systems by TSA has been delayed due to technical and managerial challenges. Without proper authentication of boarding pass information, TSA may not be able to ensure limited access to Pre-Check screening lanes for cleared individuals at all airports. Applicants for the Pre-Check program are required to submit biographic and biometric data for identity verification. Applicants for the Pre-Check program must submit biographic and biometric data to TSA for security threat assessments, including fingerprint-based criminal history checks. TSA accepts applications from U.S. citizens, nationals, and legal permanent residents, but individuals may be deemed ineligible if they have certain criminal convictions within specified time periods. Applicants for the Pre-Check program must submit biographic and biometric data to TSA for security threat assessments, including fingerprint-based criminal history checks. TSA may reject applicants with certain criminal convictions or if they are on government watchlists. A non-refundable processing fee of $85 is required, and approved travelers receive a Pre-Check Known Traveler Number valid for five years. Applicants with a Pre-Check Known Traveler Number must notify TSA within 30 days to appeal or correct inaccurate information. The $85 processing fee is non-refundable, so individuals with concerns about disqualification based on criminal record or eligibility may choose not to apply. TSA opened the first Pre-Check in December 2013. TSA opened the first Pre-Check enrollment center for the general public in December 2013 at the Indianapolis, IN, airport. There will eventually be 300 enrollment centers nationwide with an online application process. Applicants can pre-enroll online but must visit a physical site for identification and fingerprints. Early feedback shows frequent travelers are satisfied with Pre-Check, with a 2012 survey indicating high satisfaction rates. The Pre-Check program has received positive feedback from frequent travelers, with high satisfaction rates reported. However, the rapid expansion of the program may lead to increased wait times in Pre-Check lanes as more travelers join, potentially benefiting non-participating travelers as well. The Pre-Check program is experiencing rapid growth as more travelers join, leading to potential benefits for non-participating travelers through managed inclusion. This initiative involves real-time threat assessments to identify low-risk individuals eligible for expedited screening. New passenger screening canine teams and behavioral detection officers are also being utilized for enhanced security measures. The scent of explosives is detected by canine teams and behavioral detection officers who screen passengers for potential threats. If no elevated risk is identified, passengers may be randomly selected for Pre-Check screening. A lighted arrow directs passengers to either regular or expedited screening lanes based on random selection. Military servicemembers, including active duty, reservists, and National Guard members, can use Pre-Check screening lanes for official and personal travel. Family members under 12 can also use Pre-Check when traveling with cleared military personnel. Family members over 12 must go through standard screening or obtain Pre-Check eligibility independently. Civilian employees of the Department of Defense and the Coast Guard may also be eligible for Pre-Check. Civilian employees of the Department of Defense and the Coast Guard can participate in expedited screening without enrolling in Pre-Check or a CBP trusted traveler program. Pre-Check lanes are used for uniformed airline crewmembers, who undergo TSA-managed criminal history record checks for eligibility. Airline crews undergo TSA-managed criminal history record checks and security threat assessments for expedited screening. The Known Crew Member database verifies crew credentials. Background screening for these individuals is equivalent to Pre-Check applicants, with some cases requiring even more extensive investigations. TSA considers these individuals for expedited screening. The TSA considers individuals in specific sub-populations, such as military servicemembers, defense personnel, and airline crews, to be lower risk and eligible for expedited screening. Despite this, random selection for standard screening is still used for some members of these groups. The TSA conducts risk-based screening programs, collecting biographic and biometric data, as well as intelligence sources, to identify potential threats. Each program has specific data collection and retention rules, with a policy to delete unnecessary data. TSA retains data on individuals matching terrorist or criminal databases for extended periods, while other records are deleted after travel completion. Voluntarily submitted data, like Pre-Check applications, are kept unless updated. Commercial databases and consumer reports may also be used by TSA. TSA uses commercial databases and consumer reports for identity validation and risk assessments but does not share information with consumer reporting agencies. Personal data collected may be shared among DHS agencies for counterterrorism and homeland security purposes, as well as with intelligence, law enforcement, and judicial agencies for investigating potential violations. The Privacy Act of 1974 and other legislation require federal agencies and contractors to protect data. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 mandated TSA and DHS to establish appeals procedures for individuals identified as security threats. The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 required DHS to take certain actions. The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 mandated DHS to establish an Office of Appeals and Redress for individuals wrongly identified as a threat when boarding a commercial aircraft. DHS created the DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (DHS TRIP) to address misidentification issues and maintain accurate passenger records. The DHS TRIP program allows passengers to file complaints online or by mail for redress if they have been wrongly identified. DHS requests supporting information within 30 days and provides a control number for tracking. If a traveler was delayed due to misidentification, steps to resolve the issue are described, such as presenting a DHS response letter during check-in for flights. The TSA allows passengers to appeal decisions made by DHS during the check-in process for airline flights. TSA decisions based on Secure Flight program records are mostly not subject to judicial review. In 2013, TSA sought information to expand expedited screening by using third-party prescreening of passengers. The TSA is considering using large commercial databases to assess the risk posed by individuals in the aviation transportation system. Concerns have been raised about privacy and data accuracy in this process. The TSA is considering using commercial databases for passenger risk assessments, raising concerns about privacy and data accuracy. Non-federal government and private databases may already be used for passenger prescreening, including CBP's ATS and other programs like Secure Flight and Pre-Check. The TSA is considering using commercial data for passenger risk assessments in systems like Secure Flight and Pre-Check, where personal information may be used for purposes other than counterterrorism. Congress had previously restricted the use of commercial data in airline passenger prescreening. The TSA is exploring the use of commercial data for passenger risk assessments in systems like Secure Flight and Pre-Check, raising concerns about privacy and potential legislative action by Congress. Congressional oversight plays a crucial role in reviewing TSA's risk-based approach to airline passenger screening to ensure effectiveness, efficiency, and data security. Experts in aviation security emphasize that risk-based screening should be part of a comprehensive security strategy, not a standalone technique. Experts in aviation security emphasize that risk-based screening should be part of a comprehensive security strategy, not a standalone technique. It is important to assess the adaptability and evolution of the risk-based approach to address shifting threats and incorporate new methods and capabilities. The risk-based approach to passenger screening is evolving, with elements like the Pre-Check program being relatively new. Details on terrorist watchlists and behavioral profiling techniques are not publicly disclosed. The consolidation and dissemination of terrorist watchlist information have been a key issue since the attempted bombing of Northwest Flight 253 in 2009, but specific changes made in response have not been publicly acknowledged. Information on the evolution of behavioral detection methods by TSA is also not publicly available. The evolution of behavioral detection methods by TSA has not been publicly disclosed. Congressional oversight may be interested in how TSA's risk-based strategy and intelligence practices have adapted to changing threat landscapes and new technologies. Identifying suitable metrics for assessing the effectiveness of TSA's risk-based strategies has been challenging due to necessary security secrecy. The limited encounters with individuals tied to terrorism make defining suitable metrics for security effectiveness challenging. TSA's choice of metrics for behavioral detection programs has been questioned, with emphasis on efficiency rather than security. Concerns arise over false alarms singling out individuals as potential threats when they pose no actual threat. Efforts to reduce false alarms in threat detection may lead to gaps in capabilities. High false alarm rates can misdirect screening resources and complicate the lives of individuals mistakenly targeted as potential threats. Initiatives to minimize false alarms in Secure Flight have focused on refining terrorist databases for accurate information. Efforts to reduce false alarms in threat detection have focused on refining terrorist databases and implementing a redress process for falsely targeted individuals. The effectiveness of these steps in reducing false alarm rates in aviation passenger pre-screening has not been publicly disclosed. Assessing anticipated efficiency gains related to risk-based screening initiatives is crucial for oversight of TSA operations and appropriations, with an expected savings of about $120 million. Efforts to reduce false alarms in threat detection have focused on refining terrorist databases and implementing a redress process for falsely targeted individuals. The anticipated risk-based security efficiencies are expected to save about $120 million and lead to staffing reductions. Congressional oversight may examine the balance between security effectiveness and efficiency gains. Privacy and data protections are also of interest, with DHS implementing practices to protect personal data and comply with Privacy Act requirements. The implementation of privacy protections and data security measures may be a concern for Congress. As TSA implements a risk-based approach to passenger screening, concerns persist about integrating various programs effectively, adapting to changes in threats and resources, and assessing program effectiveness. Despite elaborate security measures post-9/11, the potential for large-scale aviation attacks remains. Balancing security and privacy while effectively assessing risk-based programs against mission goals is crucial. Debate continues on balancing privacy with effective security strategies in aviation to combat terrorism, a key issue for policy and potential congressional oversight."
