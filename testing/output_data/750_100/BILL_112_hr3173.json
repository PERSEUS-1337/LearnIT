    "content": "No information provided. Congress finds that nearly 2,600 marine facilities and 13,000 US-flag vessels require workers to carry a Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) under the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002. Department of Homeland Security regulations mandate TWIC for merchant mariners with a Coast Guard-issued Merchant Mariner Credential and individuals needing unescorted access to secure areas. Over two million transportation workers have obtained TWIC to date. Nearly two million transportation workers have obtained a Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) by paying $132.50 and making multiple trips to an enrollment center. The TWIC is valid for five years, after which workers must go through the process again, paying the fee and making additional trips. This process can be time-consuming and costly for workers. The TWIC enrollment process requires multiple time-consuming trips to a center, not mandated by law but driven by DHS policy aligning with PIV standards for Federal employees. The TWIC enrollment process aligns with FIPS-201 standards, but DHS may deviate if needed. Unlike other credentials, TWIC is a work permit for a mobile private sector workforce and does not grant unescorted access to secure areas. The DHS has the authority to develop an alternative process for TWIC enrollment that doesn't require multiple trips to an enrollment center. Secure government-issued identity documents can be mailed to applicants, including passports. Congress mandated a final rule for TWIC issuance. Congress mandated a final rule for TWIC issuance, including requirements for biometric readers, to be issued no later than August 2010, but as of now, the final rule has not been issued. SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. Congress believes urgent reform is needed for the TWIC application process by the end of 2012 to avoid burdens on US workers and businesses. The Secretary of Homeland Security should mandate TWIC reader deployment for security, and allocated funds for Port Security should be utilized. Funds awarded for TWIC projects under the Port Security Grant Program will not expire before the final TWIC reader rule is issued. The Secretary of Homeland Security is required to reform the TWIC application process to minimize in-person visits to enrollment centers, with exceptions for extenuating circumstances. This reform must be implemented within 90 days of the enactment of the Act."
