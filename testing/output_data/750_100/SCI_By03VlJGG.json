    "content": "In a well-studied approach for machine learning on relational data, entities and relations are represented in an embedding space. Our approach proposes a multimodal embedding using different neural encoders to incorporate various data types like text, images, and numerical values. We introduce two new benchmarks, YAGO-10-plus and MovieLens-100k-plus, with additional relations such as textual descriptions and images. Our model utilizes additional information effectively to improve accuracy and predict missing multimodal attributes. Knowledge bases are crucial in various computational systems but often suffer from incompleteness and noise. Learning relational knowledge representation is a key focus of research. The focus of active research is on relational knowledge representation, which involves estimating low-dimensional representations for entities and relations to encode uncertainty and infer missing facts accurately. Real-world knowledge bases contain various data types beyond fixed entities, making relations rich with different attributes. Relations in knowledge bases often include numerical, textual, and image attributes, which are crucial for knowledge base completion. These attributes, like names and descriptions, can provide evidence for various facts such as a person's age or profession. However, they also face similar limitations as conventional link data, such as being missing or noisy. In this paper, a multimodal embedding approach is introduced for modeling knowledge bases with various data types. The approach aims to address the limitations of link data by utilizing all observed information and representing uncertainty in relational evidence. The method can be applied to extend existing relational modeling approaches, with a primary focus on the DistMult model. Our method extends the DistMult approach by incorporating neural encoders for different evidence data types, such as images and textual attributes. The scoring module remains the same, producing a score indicating the probability of a triple being correct. This unified model allows for information flow across different data types. The unified model introduced in the previous paragraphs incorporates neural encoders for various data types to improve link-prediction accuracy in relational databases. The evaluation of this approach on two databases shows that the model effectively utilizes additional information like textual descriptions, numerical attributes, and images to enhance accuracy in link prediction. The text discusses how multimodal embeddings improve link-prediction accuracy in relational databases by utilizing various types of information about entities. It introduces existing approaches to embedded relational modeling and describes a model that extends these approaches to incorporate different data types. The text discusses relational modeling in a multimodal setting, aiming to score the truth value of factual statements using a triplet format. Training data consists of observed facts for the knowledge base, which may be incomplete or noisy. The text discusses relational modeling in a multimodal setting, aiming to score the truth value of factual statements using a triplet format. The proposed framework can be used with existing relational models, with a focus on the DistMult approach for its simplicity, popularity, and high accuracy. In DistMult, entities are mapped to dense vectors and relations to diagonal matrices. The DistMult approach in relational modeling maps entities to vectors and relations to matrices, scoring triples based on the embeddings. Negative samples are generated for training triplets to learn entity and relation embeddings. DistMult learns entity and relation representations for knowledge bases, allowing for completion, queries, or cleaning. Unlike existing approaches, it can handle objects of any data type. To incorporate diverse object types into relational models like DistMult, embeddings are proposed for numerical, categorical, image, and text data. The proposed work introduces domain-specific encoders to embed attributes like title, poster, genre, or release year of a movie. These embeddings are used to score the truth value of triples using the DistMult operation. Deep learning techniques are utilized to construct encoders for object values, ensuring representation for all observed subjects, objects, and relations in the data. The model utilizes observed subjects, objects, and relations across different data types to estimate the truth value of a fact. An example instantiation for a knowledge base with movie details is presented. Encoders are used for each data type, such as CNNs for images and LSTMs for text, to compute embeddings for objects. These embeddings are then used to compute the score of the triple. The model uses encoders for different data types to compute embeddings for objects in a knowledge base. These embeddings are then used to calculate the score of a triple. Training the model is similar to DistMult, with the object entity replaced by a random entity from the same domain for negative sampling. Encoders for multimodal objects are described, including using dense layers for subject entity and relation embeddings, and a selu activation for categorical object entities. The model uses encoders to compute embeddings for objects in a knowledge base, including categorical entities through a dense layer with selu activation. Numerical objects are embedded using a feed forward layer after basic normalization, projecting them into a higher-dimensional space. This contrasts with existing methods that treat numbers as distinct entities. The model uses different encoders for encoding categorical entities and numerical objects in a knowledge base. For short attributes like names, character-based stacked, bidirectional LSTM is used, while for longer strings like detailed descriptions, a CNN over word embeddings is employed.

Images can also provide useful evidence for modeling entities, extracting details such as gender, age, job, etc., or location information from map images. Various models compactly represent semantic information in images for successful applications.

Various models compactly represent semantic information in images for successful applications, such as image classification, captioning, and question-answering. The framework is adaptable to different data types as long as an appropriate encoder can be designed. The modeling of knowledge bases using different types of neural networks and scoring functions is discussed. Various approaches use matrix multiplication, euclidean distance, circular correlation, or Hermitian dot product as scoring functions. The focus is on embedding a fixed set of entities in structured data. In the context of modeling knowledge bases with neural networks and scoring functions, different methods incorporate various types of information such as text, numerical values, and images in the encoding component to compute entity embeddings. These approaches go beyond just structured links between entities and consider additional features like numerical values, images, and text to enhance the embedding process. Our model aims to create a universal schema by using matrix factorization to embed knowledge base and textual relations. Unlike other approaches, we incorporate different types of information (numerical, text, image) as relational triples in a unified model. Our model represents uncertainty in structured knowledge, treating them as first-class citizens of the data. We provide new benchmarks by extending existing datasets with additional information such as posters for MovieLens 100k and image/textual data for YAGO-10 from DBpedia. The MovieLens-100k dataset from YAGO-3 database contains 100,000 ratings from 1000 users on 1700 movies. It includes rich relational data about users and movies, with genre represented as a binary vector. Movie posters are also collected for each movie. The MovieLens-100k dataset from YAGO-3 database contains 100,000 ratings from 1000 users on 1700 movies. Movie posters are collected for each movie. The dataset includes various data types and is considered small but specialized. Another dataset, YAGO3-10 knowledge graph, is more suitable for knowledge graph completion and link prediction, with around 120,000 entities like people, locations, and organizations. The YAGO3-10 knowledge graph consists of 120,000 entities and 37 relations, including textual descriptions and images for half of the entities. Additional relations like wasBornOnDate and happenedOnDate are identified, with dates as values. The model's ability to utilize multimodal information is evaluated by comparing it to the DistMult method in link prediction tasks. The study evaluates the model's performance in genre and date prediction tasks using multimodal data on MovieLens and YAGO datasets. Hyperparameters are tuned using grid search for fair comparison with other methods. Regularization parameter \u03bb and embedding dimensionality d are varied for evaluation using MRR, Hits@K, and RMSE metrics in the link prediction task. The goal is to rank entities in the test dataset and calculate MRR and Hits@ metric. The results are presented in a filtered setting, focusing on ranking triples in the test data against those that never appeared before. In a filtered setting, the model is trained on MovieLens using Rating as the relation. Different encoding methods are used for various relations, such as a character-level LSTM for movie titles and a VGG network for posters. Evaluation on MovieLens dataset is done by ranking rating triples. The study evaluates different models using various relations like rating, movie-attribute, user-attribute, movie titles, and poster encoding. The model incorporating all these factors outperforms others, highlighting the importance of additional information. Results show that adding movie titles has a greater impact than poster information on recommendation system accuracy. The study shows that incorporating various types of information improves model performance. Models using structured, entity-description, numerical, and entity-image information outperform others. The model encoding all types of information performs the best, while the model using only text performs the second best. Model S is outperformed by all other models, emphasizing the importance of utilizing different types of information. The study demonstrates that Model S is outperformed by other models, highlighting the significance of utilizing diverse data types for higher accuracy. Additionally, the performance of ConvE BID4, a state-of-the-art approach on the dataset, is compared to models based on DistMult. Despite achieving better results, ConvE primarily differs in how it scores triples, suggesting potential incorporation of approaches in the future. Further analysis on the YAGO dataset reveals insights into model performance, particularly on the top five most frequent relations. The model benefits from textual description for certain relations like isAffiliatedTo and isLocatedIn, while images are useful for detecting genders. Numerical data is more effective for the playsFor relation. Evaluation on multimodal attributes prediction is presented, showing that approaches using this information as features cannot predict missing relations. Link prediction evaluation on MovieLens is shown when test data consists only of movies' genre. The evaluation metrics for link prediction on MovieLens with test data consisting only of movies' genre show that models utilizing all information outperform other methods, indicating the ability to predict movie genres using posters and titles. TAB6 presents link prediction evaluation on YAGO-10-plus with test data consisting only of numerical triples. The test dataset holds out 10% of numerical information in the training dataset, focusing on numerical values larger than 1000 for a denser distribution. Predictions are made by dividing the numerical interval [1000, 2017] into 1000 bins, finding the mid-point of the bin with the highest model score for each triple in the test data to compute RMSE. S+N+D+I outperforms other methods, showcasing the model's utilization of additional information. S+N+D+I outperforms other methods by utilizing multimodal values for modeling numerical information. The model can query for multimodal attributes and rank existing values to observe the highest rankings. The model in TAB7 ranks existing posters, titles, and genres based on visual and semantic similarity to the original content. The selected values show similarities in background, appearance, genre, and title structure.
