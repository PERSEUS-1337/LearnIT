    "content": "The FMLA requires covered employers to grant eligible employees up to 12 workweeks of leave for reasons such as caring for a newborn or adopted child, a family member with a serious health condition, or for the employee's own health condition. Military exigencies are also covered under the FMLA. The FMLA provides up to 26 workweeks of leave for eligible employees to care for a covered military servicemember with a serious injury or illness sustained in the line of duty. To be eligible, an employee must work for a covered employer, have 1,250 hours of service in the past 12 months, work at a location with 50 or more employees within 75 miles, and have worked for the employer for 12 months. The FMLA covers private-sector employers with 50 or more employees for 20 weeks in the current or last calendar year, as well as public agencies. Public-sector employees must have 50 employees within 75 miles of the worksite to be eligible for FMLA leave. The FMLA has been amended four times since 1993. The FMLA has been amended four times since 1993 to cover legislative branch employees, create new entitlements for military family leave, and modify eligibility requirements for airline flight crew. Several bills in the 114th Congress proposed amendments to expand leave time, create new qualifying uses of leave, and modify employee eligibility requirements. Some proposals in the 114th Congress aimed to expand FMLA leave time, create new qualifying uses of leave, and modify employee eligibility requirements. One bill, H.R. 5518, would have entitled eligible employees to up to four hours of leave during any 30-day period, with a maximum of 24 hours during any 12-month period for Parental Involvement and Family Wellness Leave. H.R. 5535 proposed Parental Involvement Leave, allowing eligible employees up to eight hours of leave in a 30-day period to attend school conferences or activities. Employees can use Parental Involvement Leave to attend school conferences or activities sponsored by a school or community organization for their child or grandchild. They must notify their employer at least seven days in advance. This notice requirement is shorter than the 30-day notice for other FMLA leave reasons. Eligible employees can also use FMLA leave for caring for a new child or a serious health condition. The 114th Congress considered proposals to expand qualifying uses of FMLA leave, including creating new leave categories and broadening existing ones. Bills introduced would have allowed FMLA leave for bereavement, domestic violence, family involvement, and medical needs. The 114th Congress considered proposals to expand FMLA leave, including for bereavement, domestic violence, family involvement, and medical needs related to service-connected disabilities for veterans. Proposed bills would have allowed employees to use their 12-week entitlements for the death of a son or daughter, parent, or sibling, but not for the death of a spouse. S. 473 proposed expanding FMLA leave entitlement to address domestic violence, family involvement in school activities, and providing transportation to medical appointments for a spouse or child. Employees would be able to use family involvement leave for up to 24 hours in a 12-month period, including providing transportation to medical appointments for family members. H.R. 5165 would have allowed employees to use FMLA leave for hospital care or medical services related to a service-connected disability for veterans rated at 30% or higher. The FMLA currently allows employees to use leave for family care, including for the arrival of a new child. Proposals aim to expand FMLA-qualifying uses of leave by broadening the set of relationships eligible for family leave. The FMLA allows leave for family care for a child under 18 or over 18 with a disability. Leave can also be taken for a family member's serious health condition or military exigency or caregiver leave for a covered military member. The FMLA allows leave for family care for a child under 18 or over 18 with a disability, a family member's serious health condition, military exigency, or caregiver leave for a covered military member.

H.R. 5701 and S. 473 proposed expanding FMLA leave to include adult children, domestic partners, and other family members for caregiving purposes. H.R. 5701 and S. 473 proposed expanding FMLA leave to include adult children, domestic partners, and other family members for caregiving purposes. H.R. 5519 proposed adding additional family members such as grandchild, sibling, and grandparent for military exigency leave.

Proposed amendments would broaden the definition of son or daughter to include children of any age, effectively expanding current FMLA-qualifying uses of leave. The 114th Congress considered expanding FMLA-qualifying uses of leave to include adult children and domestic partners. S. 473 and H.R. 5519 aimed to broaden the definition of serious health condition, but did not provide an exhaustive list of conditions. S. 2584 and H.R. 4616 proposed amendments to the FMLA. S. 2584 and H.R. 4616 proposed amending the FMLA to include recovery from surgery related to organ donation as a \"serious health condition,\" but it would not automatically qualify as such without meeting other statutory tests for inpatient care or continuing treatment by a healthcare provider. The 114th Congress considered various proposals to amend FMLA eligibility requirements for employees and specific worker groups. Two proposals were considered by the 114th Congress to amend FMLA eligibility requirements. H.R. 5518 aimed to reduce the minimum number of employees within 75 miles of an employee's worksite from 50 to 15, while H.R. 5496 proposed other changes. H.R. 5496 proposed changes to FMLA eligibility requirements, including removing the reference to \"1,250 hours of service\" and expanding eligibility to part-time and full-time employees. Additionally, the bill introduced new eligibility requirements for certain veterans with service-connected disabilities and education support professionals. The bill proposed changes to FMLA eligibility requirements for veterans with service-connected disabilities rated at 30% or higher, allowing them to access FMLA-protected leave with reduced employment requirements. Veterans with a service-connected disability rated at 30%-50% would be eligible for leave after 8 months of employment and at least 833 hours worked in the previous 8 months. Employees with a service-connected disability rated at 60% or higher can use leave for medical care related to their disability if employed for 6 months and at least 625 hours in the previous 6-month period. Certification from a VA medical provider or approved non-VA facility is required for leave related to a service-connected disability rated at 30% or higher. The bill proposed eligibility for veterans with service-connected disabilities rated at 30%-50% to use leave for medical care related to their disability if employed for 8 months and at least 833 hours in the previous 8-month period. The bill proposed eligibility for veterans with service-connected disabilities rated at 30%-50% to use leave for medical care related to their disability if employed for 8 months and at least 833 hours in the previous 8-month period. Veterans with disabilities rated at 60% or higher at retirement could use leave if employed for 6 months and at least 625 hours in the previous 6-month period, with certification required for disabilities rated at 30% or higher. The bill aimed to create separate eligibility requirements for veterans and educational support professionals (ESP) to access FMLA leave for medical needs sooner. It also adjusted the hours-of-service requirement to facilitate veterans' use of this leave. The proposal under S. 3444 aimed to adjust the hours-of-service requirement for ESPs to qualify for FMLA leave, allowing them to meet eligibility by working an average of 60 hours per month or 60% of their total monthly hours expected for their job description. The Secretary of Labor would have the authority to establish separate rules for calculating leave entitlement for ESPs. The proposal under S. 3444 aimed to adjust the hours-of-service requirement for ESPs to qualify for FMLA leave, allowing them to meet eligibility by working an average of 60 hours per month or 60% of their total monthly hours expected for their job description. The Secretary of Labor would have the authority to establish separate rules for calculating the leave entitlement of ESPs, without changing the size of the entitlement available to them."
