The Medicare Drug Formulary Protection Act prohibits a prescription drug plan from removing covered Part D drugs or imposing coverage restrictions, except at the start of each plan year, with some exceptions for new therapeutic uses and newly covered drugs for newly enrolled individuals. The PDP sponsor cannot remove a covered Part D drug from the plan formulary or impose restrictions on drug coverage during the enrollment period. The PDP sponsor cannot remove a covered Part D drug from the plan formulary or impose restrictions on drug coverage during the enrollment period, except for new therapeutic uses and newly covered drugs. During the enrollment period, a generic drug approved under section 505(j) of the Food and Drug Cosmetic Act or a brand name drug that goes off-patent can be placed on the market with limitations on formulary changes. During the enrollment period, a drug may be restricted or deemed ineffective by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, leading to its removal from the formulary of a prescription drug plan. Each PDP sponsor offering a prescription drug plan must provide appropriate notice of any removal or change in formulary to the Secretary, affected enrollees, physicians, pharmacies, and pharmacists. Each PDP sponsor offering a prescription drug plan must provide notice of any changes in the formulary or coverage restrictions to enrollees during the annual coordinated election period. The amendment applies to election periods after the enactment of the Act."
