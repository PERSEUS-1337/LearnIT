Congress finds that there are millions of cases of waterborne diseases in the United States each year due to inadequately treated sewage, leading to various gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses. Between 1.8 to 3.5 million Americans get sick annually from swimming in contaminated waters, leading to economic losses estimated at $28 billion. Sewer systems often fail to monitor or report overflows, impacting swimming opportunities and public health. Improved monitoring, reporting, and notification are needed. Better monitoring, reporting, and public notification of sewer overflows are necessary to prevent millions of Americans from getting sick annually. Public health authorities are not routinely informed of sewer overflows that pose a threat to public health. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to define \"sanitary sewer overflow\" as an overflow of wastewater from a sanitary sewer system, excluding combined sewer overflows and wastewater backups caused by blockages in privately owned building laterals. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act defines \"sanitary sewer overflow\" as wastewater overflows or releases that reach or do not reach waters of the United States, and wastewater backups into buildings caused by blockages in a sanitary sewer. SEC. 4. MONITORING, REPORTING, AND PUBLIC NOTIFICATION OF SEWER OVERFLOWS. Section 402 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include requirements for publicly owned treatment works to implement a system to detect sanitary sewer overflows promptly. Publicly owned treatment works must promptly detect and notify the public of sanitary sewer overflows that may endanger human health. Notification must be made within 24 hours of becoming aware of the overflow, and public health authorities and other affected entities must be immediately informed. Publicly owned treatment works must promptly detect and notify the public of sanitary sewer overflows that may endanger human health. Notification must be made within 24 hours of becoming aware of the overflow, and written reports describing the overflow must be provided to the Administrator or State within 5 days. Publicly owned treatment works must report all sanitary sewer overflows to waters of the United States on its monthly discharge monitoring report to the Administrator or the State. The report must include details on the magnitude, duration, suspected cause of the overflow, steps taken to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence, as well as steps taken to mitigate the impact of the overflow. Publicly owned treatment works must report all sanitary sewer overflows to waters of the United States on its monthly discharge monitoring report to the Administrator or the State. The report must include details on the magnitude, duration, suspected cause of the overflow, steps taken to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence, as well as steps taken to mitigate the impact of the overflow. Additionally, they must report the total number of overflows in a calendar year, including details of wastewater released per incident, overflow duration, location, affected receiving waters, cleanup responses, and actions to prevent future overflows. Publicly owned treatment works must report all sanitary sewer overflows to waters of the United States. If a State receives a report on overflows, they must annually summarize the details to the Administrator. SEC. 5 amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act regarding the monitoring and reporting of sanitary sewer overflows. SEC. 6 authorizes $2.2 billion for fiscal years 2006 through 2012 for this purpose."
