    "content": "The Bush Administration released The Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2008 on February 5, 2007, in compliance with the statutory requirement. The budget documents include detailed information such as historical data, budget authority, outlay and receipt data, and the Administration's economic forecast. The budget documents provide descriptions of the Administration's policy proposals and expectations from FY2007 through FY2012, as well as historical data on appropriations, outlays, and revenues. The congressional budget process begins once the Administration submits its budget to Congress, with revisions often made during deliberations. Congress revises budget proposals as economic conditions change. FY2008 budget resolution adopted on May 17, 2007. House and Senate committees consider appropriation bills. By August 5, House passed all twelve bills. Senate passed Homeland Security bill in July. In FY2007, the Senate passed four appropriations bills by September 30. A continuing resolution was passed to fund the government until November 16. Congress approved the Defense bill providing $459 billion. The President vetoed the Defense bill (H.R. 3222, P.L. 110-116) providing $459 billion in non-emergency budget authority, citing funding levels and policy disagreements. This veto threat complicated the appropriations process. Congress passed funding extensions until December 21, including an omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 2764) incorporating 10. On December 19, Congress passed an omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 2764) that combined 10 regular appropriations bills into the State-Foreign Operations appropriations bill and a fourth continuing resolution (H.J.Res. 72). The President signed a fourth continuing resolution (P.L. 110-149) funding government operations through the end of the year. On December 26, the President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of FY2008 (P.L. 110-161), providing $555 billion in discretionary budget authority. Table 1 shows budget estimates for FY2008 from CBO and the Administration. Budget estimates for FY2008 from CBO, the Administration (OMB), and Congress can vary due to different assumptions and techniques. Estimates are expected to change with new data or economic conditions. CBO's first budget report for FY2008 included baseline and economic projections for FY2007 through FY2017. The CBO's first budget report for FY2008 projected a baseline deficit of $98 billion, down from $172 billion in FY2007. The report also forecasted a surplus of $170 billion in FY2012 and $249 billion in FY2017, based on assumptions set by law. Key assumptions include constant discretionary spending in inflation-adjusted terms and the full expiration of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts. After 2010, tax cuts from 2001 and 2003 will expire, leading to substantial revenue growth. The baseline projections show declining deficits and surpluses due to the expiration of tax cuts and zero growth in discretionary spending. Without major policy changes, federal deficits are expected to increase rapidly beyond the 10-year forecast window. The CBO's report projects future deficits due to the retirement of the baby boom generation and rising healthcare costs. It includes estimated budgetary effects of various policies, such as making the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent, indexing the AMT for inflation, and freezing discretionary appropriations at FY2007 levels. These policies would impact revenues and outlays. In FY2007, CBO analyzed the President's budget proposals, forecasting higher revenues and smaller outlays. The projections showed a FY2008 deficit of $226 billion, decreasing to $31 billion by FY2012, contrasting with the Administration's expected surplus. The difference in forecasts is attributed to medium-term projection uncertainties. President Bush's FY2008 budget proposed extending and making permanent most of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, reducing estimated receipts by almost $600 billion between FY2008 and FY2012. CBO's cumulative deficit estimate based on the President's proposals for 2008-2012 was $790 billion, while the President's budget had a net deficit estimate of $514 billion for the same period. The FY2008 budget proposed reducing estimated receipts by almost $600 billion between FY2008 and FY2012. Administration proposals aim to reduce mandatory spending by $96 billion over five years and $309 billion over 10 years, including proposed personal accounts for Social Security costing $637 billion over 10 years. The Administration's budget proposed reducing estimated receipts by almost $600 billion between FY2008 and FY2012. Mandatory spending changes, including the introduction of personal Social Security accounts, would result in five-year savings of $59 billion and 10-year increases of $359 billion. However, limited information was provided for years beyond FY2012, with projections omitting data for individual years after that. The President proposed eliminating, reducing, or reforming about 141 programs, affecting discretionary and mandatory spending. Administration estimates show $22 billion in budget cuts for FY2008 compared to FY2007. The Mid-Session Review in July mirrored the President's FY2008 budget, with a $19 billion higher deficit estimate than in February. The MSR FY2008 deficit estimate was $19 billion higher than the February estimate, with changes attributed to technical reestimates, economic changes, and minor policy differences. Over half of the increase in the five-year deficit estimate was due to fast growth in Medicare and Medicaid spending, driven by rising health care prices and hospital patient volumes. CBO scores discretionary appropriations legislation based on budget legislation specifications. The CBO analyzed FY2008 appropriations according to budget legislation specifications, estimating new budget authority and outlays for non-emergency and emergency spending. The legislation provided $932.8 million in non-emergency discretionary budget authority, aligning with the President's request. The Senate Budget Committee reported the Senate budget resolution for FY2008, specifying expenditures and revenues to yield a deficit estimated at $249 billion, $10 billion more than the President's proposal. The McConnell Amendment included an additional $70 billion in emergency funding for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Senate budget resolution for FY2008 projected a $249 billion deficit, $10 billion higher than the President's proposal. The resolution included higher discretionary spending levels and extended expiring tax cuts with offsetting revenue measures. The FY2008 totals in the resolution were similar to versions passed by the Senate on March 23. The Senate budget resolution for FY2008 projected a $249 billion deficit, $10 billion higher than the President's proposal. The House Budget resolution (H.Con.Res. 99) expected a FY2008 deficit of $213 billion and a FY2012 surplus of $153 billion, with all proposals aiming for a balanced budget in FY2012. The Administration, House, and Senate assume minimal funding for military operations post FY2008 for budget scoring. Increased AMT coverage and discontinuation of fixes boost tax revenues. President's budget projects stagnant discretionary spending over five years. The House and Senate budget resolutions assume that the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts will expire unless the cost of extending them is offset through other revenue gains or spending reductions, leading to a large jump in tax revenues after 2010. Budget projections are uncertain, with measures of forecast quality including statistical unbiasedness and accuracy. Budget forecasts are constructed to estimate the costs of policy changes consistently. Actual budget outcomes may differ from baseline estimates due to policy changes, technical factors, and economic conditions. OMB and CBO provide measures of forecast accuracy. Projections depend on economic models, assumptions about tax and program changes, and other factors affecting the budget. Economic conditions, such as growth, inflation, and spending policies, impact budget estimates. Changes in budget models and demographics also play a role, like the upcoming retirement of baby boomers affecting Medicare and Social Security spending. The federal budget estimates are influenced by various factors, including economic conditions like GDP growth. Small changes in these conditions can have a significant impact on the budget, with a 0.1% decrease in real GDP growth rate leading to a $61 billion increase in the deficit over five years. Conversely, faster GDP growth can decrease the deficit or create a surplus. New government policies also play a role in shaping the budget. The President's FY2008 budget includes an analysis of previous forecasts' accuracy and statistical bias. OMB analyzed a quarter century of deficit estimates, showing that forecast accuracy declines as the forecast window extends due to policy and economic changes. The OMB analyzed a quarter-century of deficit estimates, showing forecast accuracy declines as the window extends due to policy and economic changes. The standard deviation for the current fiscal year was $71 billion, while the five-years-ahead forecast was $289 billion, indicating imprecise projections. The gap between upper and lower bounds for deficit projections at the end of five years was over $1.1 trillion, highlighting the uncertainty in fiscal balance forecasts. The CBO tracks budget estimates accuracy and explains differences from OMB projections. The Senate and House passed their versions of the FY2008 budget resolution after debates and amendments. The House debated and passed the resolution on March 29, focusing on additional domestic spending and accommodating the Administration's war funding request. Rules were put in place to require offsets for new tax cuts or mandatory spending increases to maintain deficit neutrality. Conferees were appointed in early May to reconcile differences between the House and Senate versions of the budget resolution. An agreement was reached on May 16 and adopted by both the House and Senate on May 17, 2007. The House and Senate adopted the conference agreement on the budget resolution for FY2008 on May 17, 2007, setting discretionary spending at $954 billion. The Appropriations Committees then worked on drafting the FY2008 appropriations bills, with most bills approved by mid-July. At the end of FY2007, most of the 12 regular appropriations bills were approved by the Committees on Appropriations. The House passed all 12 bills, while the Senate passed four initially and three more in October. Congress approved the Labor-HHS-Education and Defense bills, which the President vetoed and signed, respectively. The President planned to veto most remaining bills due to disagreements on policy and spending levels. A continuing resolution was passed to fund government operations until November 16. Congress passed a series of bills to fund government operations, including a continuing resolution until November 16 (P.L. 110-92), a Defense bill (H.R. 3222, P.L. 110-116), and another continuing resolution until December 14. Additionally, an omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 2764) was passed on December 19. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of FY2008 (P.L. 110-161) provided $555 billion in discretionary budget authority, with the Administration proposing FY2008 outlays of $2,902 billion. Both the Administration and CBO issued projections of future federal outlays. The Administration and CBO have projected future federal outlays, with budget resolutions from House and Senate Budget Committees outlining spending and revenue paths. The Administration's FY2008 budget proposed increasing outlays from $2,902 billion to $3,246 billion by FY2012. The proposals aim to boost defense and homeland security funding, limit non-defense discretionary spending growth to 1% annually, and slow the growth of mandatory programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Total mandatory spending is also addressed. The Administration's FY2008 budget proposed increasing outlays to fund personal accounts for Social Security, raising total outlays by $118 billion above the FY2007 estimate. This would result in a 16.6% increase in total outlays between FY2007 and FY2012, exceeding the FY2008 baseline by $150 billion. The Administration's proposed additional funding for security activities, including defense, homeland security, and foreign affairs, accounts for most of the increase in outlays from FY2007 to FY2008. This includes significant funding for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Additionally, there is a $8 billion increase in non-security discretionary spending and a $10 billion reduction in mandatory spending compared to baseline levels. The budget also shows a $7 billion increase in net interest payments due to increased federal borrowing. The overall $118 billion increase in outlays from FY2007 to FY2008 is due to various factors such as cost-of-living adjustments, population growth, policy changes, and inflation. The Administration's proposals aim to reduce outlays as a percentage of GDP. Projections show a decrease in outlays to 18.3% of GDP by FY2012, with a 0.7% decrease in non-defense discretionary spending over five years. Defense spending is also projected to decrease. The President's budget proposes an increase in defense spending by 6.0% from FY2007 to FY2008, with a projected decrease in defense spending by FY2012. Mandatory programs are expected to increase their share of GDP, while net interest falls slightly. Medicare and Medicaid are projected to grow as percentages of GDP despite proposed cuts. Defense spending is projected to decrease to $546 billion by FY2012. Non-defense discretionary spending in the Administration's proposed budget falls from $511 billion in FY2007 to $493 billion in FY2012. As a percentage of GDP, non-defense discretionary spending drops from 3.7% in FY2007 to 2.8% in FY2012. The Administration planned to achieve reductions in non-defense discretionary spending, with mandatory spending growing by 4.2% from FY2007 to FY2008. Proposals included reducing mandatory outlays by $10 billion in FY2008 through slowing the growth of activities like Medicare and Medicaid. Total mandatory spending would be reduced over five years. The budget proposed reducing total mandatory spending by almost $60 billion over five years, with mandatory spending projected to reach $1,923 billion in FY2012. Federal debt is growing rapidly, and under the Administration's proposals, it will continue to increase. Proposed net interest outlays in FY2008 exceed the Administration's baseline estimate by $7.8 billion and would raise FY2012 net interest outlays almost $30 billion above its estimate. Net interest payments as a percentage of GDP will show little change, ranging between 1.6% and 1.8% throughout the five years. CBO's projections show outlays rising from 19.9% of GDP in FY2007 to 20.8% in FY2008, before easing back to 20.0%. The CBO projections show federal outlays rising from 19.9% of GDP in FY2007 to 20.8% in FY2008, before easing back to 20.0% in FY2012. Analysts believe the baseline estimates may understate future growth in discretionary spending. If discretionary spending grew at the same rate as the economy, federal outlays would increase by $1.55 trillion over the FY2008-FY2017 period. Conversely, if discretionary spending remained at FY2007 levels, federal outlays would decrease by $1.65 trillion. Defense spending is projected to increase from $547 billion in FY2007 to $773 billion in FY2017 according to CBO baseline estimates. It is expected to account for 4.0% of GDP in FY2007 and 4.2% in FY2008, gradually decreasing to 3.9% in FY2012. Defense spending is projected to increase from $547 billion in FY2007 to $773 billion in FY2017, accounting for 4.0% of GDP in FY2007 and 4.2% in FY2008. Alternative scenarios suggest lower spending trajectories if troops are withdrawn from Iraq and Afghanistan. Withdrawing troops by 2010 could save about $1.25 trillion, while withdrawing by 2013 could save about $750 billion in projected discretionary spending and interest costs over the period FY2008-FY2017. Non-defense discretionary spending is projected to increase from $495 billion in FY2007 to $619 billion in FY2017, with a decrease in percentage of GDP from 3.6% in FY2007 to 2.9% in FY2017 according to CBO baseline projections. This decrease is due to the assumption that discretionary spending does not grow in real terms while the economy continues to grow. The CBO and Administration projections indicate a decrease in discretionary spending's relative size over time. Mandatory spending is projected to increase from $1,457 billion in FY2007 to $2,598 billion by FY2017, with a slight change in share of GDP from 10.6% to 12.1% over the same period. Net interest is expected to grow from $235 billion in FY2007 to $253 billion in FY2008. The CBO projects net interest to increase from $235 billion in FY2007 to $253 billion in FY2008, with projected surpluses in FY2012 and beyond reducing federal debt and lowering net interest payments. Net interest payments peak at $292 billion in FY2012 before easing back to $278 billion in FY2017. Net interest as a share of GDP is expected to remain around 1.7% until FY2012, gradually falling to 1.3% of GDP by FY2017. The Senate Budget Committee's FY2008 budget resolution proposed outlays of $2,927 billion for FY2008. The Senate Budget Committee proposed outlays of $2,927 billion for FY2008, rising to $3,229 billion in FY2012. The House Budget Committee reported its version of the FY2008 budget resolution, passing with no changes on March 29, providing $2,933 billion in outlays for FY2008, increasing to $3,252 billion in FY2012. The budget proposal for FY2008 includes $2,933 billion in outlays, rising to $3,252 billion in FY2012. The spending by category as percentages of GDP is shown in Figure 1, with data from the Administration's July 2007 Mid-Session Review. Defense, non-defense, mandatory, and net interest spending are included in the projections from FY2007 through FY2012. The budget proposal for FY2008 includes $2,933 billion in outlays, rising to $3,252 billion in FY2012. Defense and non-defense spending as a share of GDP will decline over the five-year period FY2007-FY2012, while mandatory spending is projected to increase. The downturn in discretionary spending after FY2008 depends on assumptions about non-defense discretionary spending falling and no additional spending for military operations overseas after FY2008. Limited reductions in mandatory spending keep it stable as a share of GDP. The FY2012 introduction of private Social Security accounts proposed by the President would increase mandatory spending relative to GDP. Figure 2 displays four different paths for outlays as a percentage of GDP through FY2017, including the President's FY2008 budget proposal, a CBO outlook, and actual outlays for FY2000. The President's proposed outlays for FY2017 include reductions in discretionary spending and moderate growth in mandatory programs, leading to spending levels below those in FY2000 as a percentage of GDP. The Mid-Session Review shows slightly higher outlays compared to the February budget, mainly due to reestimation rather than policy changes. The alternative estimate is based on CBO-estimated policy alternatives to the current-law baseline. The alternative estimate, based on CBO-estimated policy alternatives to the current-law baseline, assumes discretionary appropriations grow with the economy and troop deployment in Iraq and Afghanistan decreases. These assumptions increase outlays, leading to a higher deficit, federal debt, and net interest payments. The alternative estimate projects higher net interest payments and outlays as a percentage of GDP rising to 21.1% in FY2017. Forecasts of federal receipts are influenced by economic conditions. The last few fiscal years have seen unexpectedly rapid growth in federal receipts, with increases from FY2003 to FY2006. Receipts rose from 16.3% of GDP in FY2004 to 18.4% in FY2006. OMB's MSR showed little variation in receipts as a share of GDP over the five-year window FY2008-FY2012. The CBO's baseline projected an increase in receipts to 19.8% of GDP by FY2012, with a $767 billion rise over five years. The President's proposals aimed to extend and make permanent expiring tax cuts, leading to stable receipts as a percentage of GDP until FY2011, when they rose to 18.6%. The Administration predicted an increase in receipts to 18.6% of GDP by FY2012, with a reduction in cumulative receipts due to making the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent. The budget also included proposed relief from the Alternative Minimum Tax through FY2008. The Administration projected an increase in receipts to 18.6% of GDP by FY2012, with a reduction in cumulative receipts due to making the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent. Receipts from the President's July 2007 Mid-Session Review by type for FY2007 through FY2012 were close to estimates in the February budget documents. Actual receipts as a percentage of GDP for FY2000 through FY2006 were shown, with corporate income taxes stabilizing near 2% of GDP under the Administration's projection. Individual income taxes fell from over 10% of GDP in FY2000 to 7% of GDP. Individual income taxes fell from over 10% of GDP in FY2000 to 7% of GDP in FY2004, but regained some lost share under the Administration's proposals. The proposals included extending relief from the alternative minimum tax (AMT) for FY2007 and FY2008. Middle-class taxpayers face increasing AMT exposure without fixes, costing $9.1 billion in FY2007 and $47.9 billion in FY2008. Indexing AMT thresholds for inflation would cost about $55 billion on average. The President's budget aims to limit the reach of the alternative minimum tax (AMT) but lacks estimates for the cost of this fix. This omission increases federal receipts by $50-60 billion annually. Total receipts in the budget are expected to remain around 18.3% of GDP over the next five years. CBO's baseline revenue estimates exclude the extension of certain tax cuts. The CBO's revenue estimates, revised in March 2007, project an increase to over 19.8% of GDP in FY2012 and 20.1% in FY2017, excluding the extension of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts. Extending these tax cuts would reduce revenues by $418 billion over five years and $1,937 billion over 10 years. Extending all expiring tax cuts over 10 years would reduce revenues by $870 billion in the first five years and $3,178 billion over the full 10 years. Limiting the AMT coverage alone would also reduce revenues. CBO estimated that limiting the expanding coverage of the AMT alone would reduce revenues by $280 billion over five years and by $570 billion over 10 years. Differences in economic assumptions between the Administration and CBO estimates produced most of the revenue variances, particularly in the last three years. Technical components balanced the effect of economic changes in the first two years, resulting in only small revenue changes. The CBO's estimates of the President's revenue policy proposals were $479 billion smaller than the cumulative revenue baseline estimates over five years. The President's budget projected revenues of $14,826 billion over five years, while CBO's reestimates put revenues at $14,524 billion, 2% less. CBO's March report showed revised revenue baseline estimates that differed slightly from January estimates, with slower growth in receipts using alternative policy estimates. The alternative revenue estimates show slower growth in receipts compared to CBO's baseline, with receipts falling to 17.5% of GDP by FY2012. This would result in $70 billion less revenue in FY2008 and interactions between AMT reform and tax cut extensions would lead to greater revenue losses. The alternative revenue projection falls short of baseline revenues by $70 billion in FY2008, $389 billion in FY2012, and $560 billion in FY2017. The House and Senate budget resolutions require revenue changes to be offset to prevent deficit growth or surplus reduction. The conference agreement allows for the extension of some expiring tax provisions. The agreement allows for extending expiring tax cuts under certain conditions to offset revenue losses relative to baseline levels. Historical and projected federal receipts as a percentage of GDP are shown in Figure 4, with estimates remaining close through FY2010. The CBO's revenue reestimate and the President's revenue estimates are similar through FY2012, with receipts rising to slightly above 19% of GDP in FY2017. The Administration's revenue estimates show little variation over five years, with a slight rise in the last year. OMB's MSR projects slightly larger receipts than the February budget over the same period. Both sets of estimates assume tax cuts are extended and an adjustment to the AMT expansion occurs only through FY2008. Deficits occur when federal spending exceeds receipts, increasing government debt held by the public. Surpluses happen when receipts exceed outlays, reducing public debt and interest payments. Running surpluses during strong economic growth is favored by many economists. The federal government last ran a surplus in FY2001, amounting to $128 billion or 1.3% of GDP. In FY2007, the total deficit was $163 billion, slightly below CBO's estimate. The on-budget deficit, excluding Social Security and Postal Service surpluses, was $344 billion. The President's budget proposed a deficit of $239 billion for FY2008 and a small surplus of $61 billion in FY2012. The Administration's budget proposed a deficit of $239 billion for FY2008 and a small surplus of $61 billion in FY2012. The current service baseline estimates showed surpluses appearing in FY2010, two years earlier than the budget reaches a surplus. The deficit outlook in the Administration's July 2007 Mid-Session Review differed minimally from that in the February budget, with deficits slightly changing in subsequent years. The MSR projected a small surplus in FY2012. The Administration's budget projected a small surplus in FY2012, requiring strict limits on discretionary spending growth and slower entitlement spending growth. Some proposals would increase spending or reduce receipts, necessitating larger spending reductions in other areas of the budget. The federal deficit is projected to fall according to CBO's January 2007 baseline estimates. According to CBO's January 2007 baseline estimates, the federal deficit is projected to decrease in dollar terms and as a percentage of GDP through FY2011. Surpluses are expected from FY2012 to FY2017, with assumptions for baseline projections considered optimistic. Revenue assumptions include the lack of a fix for the AMT and the expiration of tax cuts in 2010, leading to increased revenues. Discretionary spending is projected to grow at the rate of inflation on the spending side. The CBO baseline projections show that spending is assumed to grow at the rate of inflation, while mandatory spending increases with eligible populations and cost-of-living adjustments. Alternative scenarios suggest a less optimistic fiscal outlook, with growing deficits projected from FY2007 to FY2017 due to alternative policies such as limiting AMT coverage, extending tax cuts, and increasing discretionary spending at the rate of GDP growth. The CBO projects deficits increasing from 1.7% of GDP in FY2008 to 3.6% in FY2017 under alternative policies. CBO's analysis differed from the Administration's projections, showing larger deficits in subsequent years. The House and Senate budget resolutions for FY2008 included deficits similar to the President's budget. The Senate resolution projected a surplus of nearly $1 billion by FY2012, while the House resolution projected a surplus of $153 billion. The conference agreement on the budget resolution had a deficit of $252 billion in FY2008, turning into a surplus of $41 billion by FY2012. Figure 5 illustrates deficit or surplus estimates as shares of GDP for FY2007 through FY2017. The data from FY2000 to FY2006 shows surpluses and deficits as a percentage of GDP. Estimates and projections from CBO and OMB for FY2008 onwards are included. The average deficit from FY1966 to FY2006 was 2.3% of GDP. The President's policy proposals included increased defense spending, tight controls on domestic discretionary spending, slower growth in Medicare and Medicaid, no additional AMT relief after FY2008, and personal accounts for Social Security in FY2012. The proposed defense budget only had minimal funding for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in FY2009. The FY2009 budget proposal includes minimal placeholder funding for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, with projections showing a rapid decline in the deficit as a share of GDP. CBO and OMB deficit projections extend to FY2017, with both showing an improving federal fiscal situation. However, an alternative CBO projection based on different policy assumptions indicates a steady deterioration in the government's fiscal conditions. The alternative CBO deficit projection shows a rapid growth in deficits from FY2012 to FY2017, reaching 3.6% of GDP. This outlook is less optimistic than OMB and CBO baseline projections, indicating a steady deterioration in the federal government's fiscal conditions. OMB, CBO, and GAO all agree that current federal fiscal policies are unsustainable due to the aging population and rising healthcare costs. The nation's aging population and increasing healthcare costs are leading to rising deficits and a federal debt burden that is spiraling out of control. Maintaining federal outlays at 20% of GDP would require significant cuts in all spending except for Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid. The current fiscal path is unsustainable according to CBO projections. By 2030, spending on Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid is projected to reach roughly 15% of GDP. To maintain overall spending close to 20% of GDP, the rest of the budget would need to be cut by more than half. The aging population and rising healthcare costs will challenge the United States' fiscal policy over the next half-century. The aging population and rising healthcare costs will lead to a growing demand for resources to finance federal spending on mandatory programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Achieving fiscal stability in the future may require significant reductions in spending growth and potentially higher taxes. The current structure of major entitlement programs will place an unsustainable burden on the budget by 2050. By 2050, spending on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid is projected to exceed 15% of GDP, more than twice the spending on all other programs combined. The long-term fiscal gap between Medicare outlays and revenues is larger than that of Social Security. The fiscal gap between Medicare outlays and revenues is sensitive to changes in assumptions about productivity growth and interest rates. Spending projections for Medicare and Medicaid are affected by changes in medical inflation, with past projections of slowing medical inflation being overly optimistic. Unexpected events like natural disasters or economic downturns can alter the short-term budget outlook. The retirement of the baby boom generation and rising healthcare costs will heavily impact the federal budget in the long term, potentially overwhelming it. Without policy changes, these programs could strain the budget, limit government flexibility, and strain the economy's resources."
