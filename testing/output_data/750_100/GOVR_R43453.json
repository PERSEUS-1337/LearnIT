    "content": "The renewable electricity PTC is a tax credit for electricity generated using qualified energy resources, sold to an unrelated person. The credit can be claimed for 10 years once a qualifying facility is in service. The maximum credit amount varies by year and technology, with the maximum credit rate adjusted annually for inflation. Wind, closed-loop biomass, and geothermal energy qualify for the maximum credit amount. Under current law, nonwind facilities for which construction began before January 1, 2018, may qualify for the Production Tax Credit (PTC). For wind facilities, the credit is available for facilities for which construction begins before January 1, 2020. The credit amount varies by technology, with some technologies qualifying for a reduced credit amount. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) is reduced by 20% and varies for facilities starting construction in 2018 or 2019. The PTC may phase out once electricity market prices exceed threshold levels, but this has not happened yet. The PTC is not likely to be phased out under current law. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was previously limited by the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) before 2018. The corporate AMT was eliminated in the 2017 tax revision. Taxpayers could carry forward unused credits to offset future tax liability. Additionally, from 2009 to 2017, PTC-eligible taxpayers had the option to claim the 30% energy investment tax credit (ITC) instead of the PTC. The 30% energy investment tax credit (ITC) could be claimed instead of the Production Tax Credit (PTC) from 2009 to 2017. Property placed in service during 2009-2011 had the option of an American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) Section 1603 grant. Production tax credits are available for Indian coal and refined coal, with specific requirements for eligibility. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) for coal expires after 2017. Indian coal has a base rate of $2.00 per ton, with a 2017 credit of $2.4 per ton. Refined coal has a base credit of $4.375 per ton, with a 2018 credit of $7.307 per ton. Facilities for refined coal must be in service before January 1, 2012, to qualify for credits, which can be received over a 10-year period. The PTC was first enacted in 1992 and has been extended 11 times since 1999. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was first enacted in 1992 as part of the Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT92; P.L. 102-486) and has been extended 11 times since 1999. The PTC has lapsed before being reinstated multiple times and has been extended to include new qualifying technologies such as poultry waste. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was first enacted in 1992 and has been extended multiple times. The PTC was modified in the 108th Congress to include new qualifying resources such as open-loop biomass, geothermal energy, solar energy, small irrigation power, and municipal solid waste. These new resources were limited to a five-year PTC period instead of the previous 10 years. The AJCA introduced a PTC for refined coal at a rate of $4.375 per ton, available for qualifying facilities placed in service before January 1, 2009. The PTC was extended twice during the 109th Congress, with EPACT05 extending it for most facilities except solar energy and refined coal for two years. Hydropower and Indian coal were added as new qualifying resources. The PTC for Indian coal was extended over a 7-year period, with a credit amount of $1.50 per ton for the first 4 years and $2.00 per ton for the last 3 years. EPACT05 extended the credit period to 10 years for qualifying facilities placed in service after August 8, 2005. The PTC was further extended through 2008 for all qualifying facilities except solar, refined coal, and Indian coal. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 extended the Production Tax Credit (PTC) for wind, refined coal, closed-loop biomass, open-loop biomass, geothermal energy, small irrigation power, municipal solid waste, and qualified hydropower. It also added marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy as qualifying resources and introduced a new credit for steel industry fuel at $2.00 per barrel-of-oil equivalent. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was extended for various renewable energy technologies by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 further extended the PTC for wind through 2012 and for other renewable energy technologies through 2013. Additionally, ARRA introduced the option for PTC-eligible taxpayers to receive a 30% investment tax credit (ITC) instead of the PTC. The Section 1603 grant program, introduced under ARRA, allowed PTC- and ITC-eligible taxpayers to receive a one-time payment from the Treasury in lieu of tax credits. It was available for property placed in service or under construction in 2009 or 2010. The program was extended through 2011 by the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. The PTC for wind was extended through 2013 by the American Taxpayer Relief Act, along with other changes. The PTC for wind was extended through 2013 by the American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA; P.L. 112-240). ATRA changed the credit expiration date to a construction start date for all qualifying electricity-producing technologies. The PTC and ITC were retroactively extended through 2014 by the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-295). The PATH Act of 2015 extended the PTC expiration date for nonwind facilities through 2016, along with the ITC option. The production credit for Indian coal facilities was extended through 2016, with the placed-in-service limitation removed. The PTC for wind was extended through 2019, with reduced credits for facilities beginning construction in 2017, 2018, and 2019. The PTCs for nonwind technologies and Indian coal were extended through 2016, with reduced credits for facilities starting construction in 2017 and 2018. The PTCs will not be available for facilities starting construction after December 31, 2017, unless further legislative action is taken. Cost estimates can be found in the Joint Committee on Taxation's annual tax expenditure tables. Between 2018 and 2022, estimated revenue losses associated with the Production Tax Credit (PTC) amount to $25.8 billion, with the majority ($24.0 billion) attributed to wind energy. Other PTCs include $0.8 billion for geothermal, $0.5 billion for open-loop biomass, $0.3 billion for municipal solid waste, and $0.1 billion for qualified hydropower. Additionally, estimated revenue losses for production credits for refined coal and Indian coal over the same period are $0.1 billion. The revenue losses for refined coal and Indian coal production credits are $0.1 billion each. JCT's tax expenditure estimates are based on current law, and extending the PTC policy would increase these estimates. In 2013, 230 corporate taxpayers claimed PTCs totaling $2.8 billion, mostly for renewable electricity production. In 2010, nearly $1.2 billion in PTCs were carried forward from previous tax years, highlighting the impact of policy actions on renewable energy tax credit claims. The number of taxpayers claiming the PTC increased between 2008 and 2009 but decreased after 2009, with the availability of the Section 1603 grant option leading to fewer taxpayers claiming the credit. The availability of the Section 1603 grant option led to fewer taxpayers claiming the PTC after 2009. $15.5 billion in grants was claimed for technologies that would have been PTC-eligible. The economic downturn also increased the amount of PTCs being carried forward between 2008 and 2010. During the economic downturn in 2009 and 2010, taxpayers had less income to offset with tax credits. Weakness in tax equity markets made it difficult for renewable energy developers to establish partnerships for tax credit monetization. Estimates show that a permanent PTC for nonwind technologies would reduce revenues by $1.4 billion between 2019 and 2028. Extending the Indian Coal Production Credit would reduce revenues by $0.4 billion during the same period. Extending the wind construction start date beyond 2019 would also have financial implications. Extending the wind construction start date beyond 2019 would reduce federal revenues by an estimated $6.9 billion between 2018 and 2027. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was enacted in 1992 to promote renewable energy sources, and its extensions reflect a belief in the importance of tax incentives for further development of wind and other resources. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) incentivizes renewable energy infrastructure development, particularly in the wind industry. While extensions of the PTC drive investment and growth in wind infrastructure, short-term extensions have limitations. Retroactive extensions are seen as windfall benefits, rewarding taxpayers for investments made without tax incentives. The PTC has increased the use of renewable electricity resources, but its impact on reducing emissions is still under research. Research on the impact of renewable electricity on reducing greenhouse gas emissions is mixed. Removing tax credits for renewable electricity could lead to a small increase in power-sector emissions. Recent tax credit extensions for wind and solar have been found to contribute to reduced emissions, especially when natural gas prices are low. Government intervention in energy markets is often justified by the presence of externalities and market failures due to pollution. The presence of externalities in the energy sector leads to market failures, particularly with pollution from energy production. This results in an economically inefficient outcome as the costs are not fully borne by producers and consumers. Tax subsidies for clean energy are one policy option to address these inefficiencies, although it may not be the most efficient approach. Tax subsidies in the energy sector may not be the most efficient way to achieve policy objectives as they encourage energy consumption, counter conservation efforts, and offset emissions reductions. They may not provide equal incentives for all emissions reduction alternatives and can favor costly reductions over cheaper ones. Additionally, tax subsidies reduce tax revenues and economic efficiency, especially if financed by distortionary taxes on other activities. A more direct and economically efficient approach to addressing pollution and environmental concerns in the energy sector is needed. A direct and economically efficient approach to addressing pollution and environmental concerns in the energy sector is through a carbon tax. This option would generate revenues to offset other taxes, achieve distributional goals, and reduce the deficit. Tax incentives are not the most efficient way to support renewable energy projects, as stand-alone projects often have limited tax liability, leading developers to seek outside investors for financial support. Tax equity financing arrangements involve outside investors monetizing tax benefits, reducing federal financial support for renewable energy. Production-based tax incentives may result in more renewable electricity per federal subsidy dollar. Interaction of the PTC with state RPS policies is a key consideration for renewable energy development at the federal level. The PTC is a federal subsidy for renewable energy projects that can help reduce the cost of complying with state-level RPS mandates. Options for the PTC include allowing it to expire as scheduled or providing a temporary extension with an extended construction start date deadline. The PTC for nonwind technologies may be extended, potentially retroactively for 2018, with the option to remove the phaseout for wind technologies. This would align all PTC-eligible technologies to qualify at the same rate. In 2014, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp proposed a PTC phaseout as part of his tax reform proposal. The proposal aimed to reduce the value of the PTC for renewable electricity to 1.5 cents per kWh for all eligible properties within the 10-year window. This would have affected facilities that received a 2.3 cent per kWh PTC in 2014, reducing the value to 1.5 cents per kWh for 2015 and beyond. Chairman Camp proposed reducing the PTC value to 1.5 cents per kWh for all eligible properties, with a full repeal after 2024. The JCT estimated this would raise $9.6 billion in additional federal revenues between 2014 and 2023. President Obama's FY2017 budget suggested a permanent extension of the PTC, making it refundable and including solar facilities as qualifying property. The proposed changes include modifying the credit for renewable electricity consumed by producers to qualify for tax credits, allowing solar property to be eligible for the PTC, and making the ITC for renewable energy permanent. The estimated cost of these changes is $19.8 billion between 2016 and 2026."
