    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Children's Bicycle Helmet Safety Act of 1993\". The Congress finds that millions of Americans ride bicycles regularly, leading to numerous head injuries and deaths, especially among children. The cost of deaths and injuries from bicycle accidents amounts to $7.6 billion annually. Injuries from bicycle accidents cost society $4.5 million over a child's lifetime. Universal helmet use could have prevented 2,600 deaths and 757,000 injuries in the US. Only 5% of children who ride bicycles wear helmets. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration can provide grants to promote bicycle helmet use among individuals under 16. Grantees have flexibility in designing effective programs. Grants can be used to enforce helmet laws, provide helmets, educate on helmet importance, or a combination of these activities. Bicycle helmets manufactured 9 months after this Act must conform to interim standards like the ANSI standard \"Z90.4-1984\" and the Snell Memorial Foundation standard \"B-90\". The Consumer Product Safety Commission will establish a final standard for bicycle helmets within 60 days of the Act's enactment, including provisions to prevent helmets from coming off riders' heads. The final standard for bicycle helmets will include provisions to prevent helmets from coming off riders' heads, address the risk of injury to children, and include additional provisions as needed. Sections 7 and 9 of the Consumer Product Safety Act will not apply to this proceeding, and the final standard will take effect one year after issuance. If a bicycle helmet does not conform to the interim standard, it will be considered a failure to meet standards. The final standard for bicycle helmets, developed under subsection (c), will be considered a consumer product safety standard under the Consumer Product Safety Act. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is authorized to receive appropriations of $2,000,000 for fiscal year 1994, $3,000,000 for fiscal year 1995, and $4,000,000 for fiscal year 1996 for a grant program. An approved bicycle helmet is defined as one that meets interim and final standards outlined in the Act."
