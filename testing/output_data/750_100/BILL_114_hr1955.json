    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Great Lakes Nutrient Removal Assistance Act\". Congress acknowledges that ineffective wastewater treatment is a common source of water pollution, with nutrient pollution, especially phosphorus loading, being a significant issue in the Great Lakes System. It emphasizes the importance of limiting phosphorus loads to control algal growth and calls for a coordinated strategy to change how nutrients are discharged. Nutrient removal technology is highlighted as a reliable and cost-effective method for reducing harmful nutrients from point sources. The curr_chunk focuses on the flow of phosphorus and other harmful nutrients from point sources in the Great Lakes System. The curr_chunk introduces the Nutrient Removal Technology Grant Program. The Nutrient Removal Technology Grant Program is established under Section 118 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to provide grants for Great Lakes States and municipalities to install nutrient removal technologies in wastewater facilities. The Nutrient Removal Technology Grant Program provides grants for Great Lakes States and municipalities to install nutrient removal technologies in wastewater facilities, prioritizing facilities that would produce the greatest nutrient load reductions at discharge points for environmental benefits. The Nutrient Removal Technology Grant Program offers grants for Great Lakes States and municipalities to implement nutrient removal technologies in wastewater facilities, focusing on facilities that can achieve significant nutrient load reductions at discharge points for environmental benefits. Great Lakes States or municipalities can apply for grants by submitting an application to the Administrator. The Administrator may grant up to 55 percent of the cost for installing nutrient removal technologies at eligible facilities. The term 'Great Lakes Water Quality Protocol of 2012' is defined in this subsection. The term 'Great Lakes Water Quality Protocol of 2012' refers to the agreement signed in Washington on September 7, 2012, amending the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. An 'eligible facility' is a municipal wastewater treatment plant with a design capacity to treat at least 500,000 gallons of wastewater per day. The Administrator can provide up to 55 percent of the cost for installing nutrient removal technologies at these facilities. The Great Lakes Water Quality Protocol of 2012 pertains to eligible facilities, which are municipal wastewater treatment plants with a capacity of at least 500,000 gallons per day. An authorization of $100,000,000 for fiscal years 2016 through 2020 is provided for this purpose. The Great Lakes Water Quality Protocol of 2012 authorizes the use of up to 4 percent of allocated funds for administrative costs."
