    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Citizens' Self-Defense Act of 2011\". The Congress finds that police are not legally liable for failing to protect individual citizens, as courts have ruled that they only have an obligation to protect the public in general. Citizens frequently use firearms to defend themselves, as police are not legally liable for failing to protect individual citizens, only having an obligation to protect the public at large. Former Florida Attorney General Jim Smith highlighted that police responded to only a fraction of calls for help, and the Department of Justice found a significant number of violent crimes went unanswered by police in 1989. Every year, over 2.4 million people in the United States use guns to defend themselves, with more than 192,000 cases involving women defending against sexual abuse. In 92 percent of these self-defense incidents, firearms are used to protect lives rather than take them. In self-defense incidents, 92 percent of people brandish their gun or fire a warning shot to scare off attackers, with less than 8 percent resulting in the attacker being killed or wounded. Law-abiding citizens using firearms for defense can face prosecution, as seen in a 2001 case where two brothers protected themselves and their livelihood with firearms. The grand jury decided not to press criminal charges against two brothers who shot and killed a burglar and injured two others at their concrete business in Reisterstown, Maryland. The brothers had encountered several burglaries and spent the night armed with shotguns in their warehouse. In a previous month, others were charged with burglary in connection to break-ins at a warehouse. The brothers were concerned when they discovered their gun was stolen in a previous burglary. In 2008, a store clerk in Waukegan, Illinois, shot and injured a robber, potentially facing criminal charges despite acting in self-defense and lacking a firearm owner's identification card. In September 2009, a Lithonia homeowner from Dekalb County, Georgia, was charged with aggravated assault for shooting someone attempting to break into his home. The homeowner did not have a firearm owner's identification card and would face a State firearms violation. Illinois law prohibits employees from carrying guns in a place of business unless they are the owner or have proprietary interest. In January 2004, a homeowner in Wilmette, Illinois, was charged with misdemeanors for owning 2 handguns and violating the village handgun ban ordinance. In Wilmette, Illinois, a homeowner faced charges for violating a handgun ban ordinance and not renewing his firearm owner's identification card after shooting a home intruder. The resident had a loaded firearm as a backup plan and confronted the intruder who entered the house twice. The homeowner in Illinois shot an intruder who set off the security system. The intruder stole the family's car to go to the hospital and was charged with burglary and possession of a stolen vehicle. Police officers and law-abiding citizens using firearms for self-defense are granted immunity from prosecution. Individuals defending themselves, families, and homes from violent felons should not face lawsuits from the felons they protected themselves against. Individuals have the right to obtain firearms for security and to use them in defense of self, family, or home. Individuals not prohibited from owning firearms have the right to obtain firearms for security and use them in self-defense, defense of family against imminent threats, and defense of home during the commission of a felony by another person. The right to own firearms for security and self-defense is protected. A firearm is defined as a shotgun, rifle, or handgun. If this right is violated, legal action can be taken for damages and relief in court. The court may award relief as deemed appropriate, including attorney's fees to the prevailing plaintiff. An action under this provision must be brought within 5 years of discovering the violation."
