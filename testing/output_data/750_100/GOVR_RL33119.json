    "content": "Prior to the passage of SAFETEA, the most recent authorization for federal highway, highway safety, and transit programs was the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21, P.L. 105-278), which provided funds for FY1998-FY2003. After October 1, 2003, federal surface transportation programs operated on short-term extension acts. Long-term reauthorizations, like TEA-21, are preferred for better long-term planning and construction needs in the surface transportation community. The passage of SAFETEA addressed the uncertainty in funding for highway and transit infrastructure. It converted from a six-year bill to just over a four-year bill expiring in FY2009. Federal funding for surface transportation is closely tied to the revenue stream from the highway trust fund, which has separate accounts for highways and mass transit. The highway trust fund consists of separate accounts for highways and mass transit, funded primarily by gasoline and diesel fuel taxes. These fuel taxes contribute about 90% of the income to the funds, with the transit account receiving 2.86 cents per gallon. There have been several tax increases over the fund's almost 50-year lifespan, with the last one occurring in 1993. The highway trust fund, funded by fuel taxes, saw a tax increase in 1993. Initially, funds were deposited into the Treasury general funds for deficit reduction until FY1998. In FY2004, the highway account received $31 billion in tax revenues, while the mass transit account received $5 billion. The trust funds have historically collected more than spent, but this trend has been changing in recent years. The FY2004 obligation limit was $33.6 billion with a total FHWA appropriation of $34.5 billion. The highway trust fund's unexpended balance is substantial but declining, leading to uncertainty about its long-term financial health. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 provided the trust fund with additional future income through changes in federal gasohol taxation, potentially adding $4 billion. The House and Senate passed reauthorization legislation in the 2nd Session of the 108th Congress, but were unable to reach agreement on total program funding for the next reauthorization period due to disagreements over project funding levels. The Bush Administration objected to larger project funding supported by some Members of Congress, leading to uncertainty about the future health of the trust funds. The Administration objected to raising fuel taxes for future trust fund health. Some Members of Congress proposed gasohol and tax changes to support a larger program, but additional measures were needed. Conferees considered various revenue-increasing provisions for the trust fund and highway/transit spending. The revenue increases in the finance title of the act are modest, mainly from cutting tax fraud and transferring Treasury general fund revenues to the trust fund. SAFETEA and gasohol legislation changes were expected to finance the $286.4 billion program created by the act. (CRS contacts: John Fischer and Robert Kirk) TEA-21 altered the highway trust fund's relationship with the Federal Unified. TEA-21 amended the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 by creating new budget categories for highway and mass transit, setting limitations on obligations from FY1999 to FY2003. It also introduced Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA) to adjust highway account amounts. The TEA-21 amendment created new budget categories for highway and mass transit, setting limitations on obligations from FY1999 to FY2003. It also introduced Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA) to adjust highway account amounts, aligning them with generated revenues. Annual revenues and expenditures affecting trust fund balances are included in the federal deficit calculation. The changes established a predetermined level of funding for core highway and transit programs, ensuring a discretionary spending guarantee. SAFETEA-21 introduced \"firewalls\" to protect highway and transit funds, ensuring guaranteed levels of funding. The debate around SAFETEA focused on money distribution, providing $286.4 billion in spending authority over six years. SAFETEA-21 provided $286.4 billion in guaranteed spending authority for the six-year period FY2004-FY2009, representing a significant increase over the previous TEA-21 bill. The funding increase was not as much as some had hoped for, but it still boosted federal surface transportation programs. SAFETEA-21 provided $244 billion in guaranteed spending authority between FY2005-FY2009, with significant funding increases for all major programs. Total annual spending increased each year, with FY2009 seeing a 23% rise compared to FY2005. Detailed programmatic information is available in the report's Appendix. The House version of SAFETEA contained a \"re-opener\" provision that was objected to by the Bush Administration and not included in the final act. TEA-21 created a spending mechanism to adjust highway program obligations based on revenue changes in the highway trust fund. This was intended to increase obligational authority. More detailed programmatic information can be found at the provided website. The RABA provision in SAFETEA aimed to adjust highway program obligations based on trust fund revenue changes. Initially, RABA provided increased spending authority, but in FY2003, a program reduction was called for. Congress chose to increase spending instead of reducing it. This led to a push to change RABA calculations to minimize revenue swings, resulting in SAFETEA using a two-year calculation method. The SAFETEA legislation extends the RABA calculations to FY2007 and prevents spending reductions as long as the highway trust fund balance is over $6 billion. Transportation policy debates often revolve around regional, not partisan, issues, particularly regarding the distribution of federal highway aid among states. Congress has addressed funding distribution concerns in every surface transportation reauthorization act since 1982. Some states have complained about receiving less federal highway aid than they contribute in taxes, pushing for a higher share rate-of-return, most recently 95%. Donor states seek equity provisions to remedy this issue, while donee states oppose any reduction in their current funding levels. Donor states advocate for equity in federal highway funding, arguing they have been subsidizing infrastructure repairs in donee states for too long. They claim to be more road-dependent and not benefiting from federal transit spending like some donee states. Southern and western donor states argue their fast growth requires equal or greater funding. Donee state advocates argue that fairness should not be separated from needs, citing the age of their highway infrastructure, high costs of urban road maintenance, and limited financial resources in western states. They also emphasize the importance of federal funding for national highway networks based on needs rather than state boundaries. The debate over equity remedies in federal highway funding has implications for overarching issues. An equity guarantee of a 95% rate of return could limit addressing other transportation needs, such as the Federal Lands Highway program. The role of the federal government versus states is questioned as the minimum guarantee nears 100%. The debate over federal highway funding equity guarantees raises questions about the federal role vis-\u00e0-vis states as the minimum guarantee approaches 100%. The 109th Congress faced challenges in balancing donor and donee state demands with limited Highway Trust Fund revenue. The 109th Congress struggled to balance donor and donee state demands due to limited Highway Trust Fund revenue. A bill to adjust shares faced filibuster challenges in the Senate, leading to the inclusion of \"hold harmless\" provisions in previous reauthorization bills. Increasing donor state shares to meet the minimum guarantee required expanding the federal highway program size significantly. Providing equity remedies in surface transportation legislation has been achieved by giving more money to all states, with donor states receiving even more to reach a designated percentage share. This approach, costly in dollar terms, led to the largest highway program under TEA21. Despite limited funding availability, SAFETEA brought a modest and gradual increase in the guaranteed rate-of-return to states. SAFETEA replaces TEA-21 MG program with an \"Equity Bonus\" program, ensuring states receive a guaranteed rate-of-return. Funding is allocated for fiscal years 2005-2009 to bring donor states up to their designated levels. The SAFETEA Act replaces the TEA-21 MG program with an \"Equity Bonus\" program, guaranteeing states a certain rate of return on payments to the highway account of the HTF. The act includes various programs subject to the equity provision, as well as new formula programs and hold harmless provisions for certain states. The SAFETEA Act introduces an \"Equity Bonus\" program to replace the TEA-21 MG program, ensuring states a specific rate of return on payments to the highway account of the HTF. States must meet specific criteria to be held harmless, such as population density, total acreage under federal jurisdiction, population size, median household income, fatality rate on Interstate Highways, or state motor fuel excise tax rate. Twenty-seven states qualify under these criteria. The Equity Bonus program under the SAFETEA Act guarantees a specific rate of return for states on payments to the highway account of the HTF. Twenty-seven states qualify based on specific criteria such as population density, total acreage under federal jurisdiction, and median household income. The EB program also ensures that no state receives less than a set percentage of its average annual TEA-21 apportionments, with annual percentage floors set at 117% for FY2005, 118% for FY2006, 119% for FY2007, and 120% for... The Equity Bonus Program guarantees a specific rate of return for states on payments to the highway account of the HTF. The percentage floors for FY2005 to FY2009 are 117% to 121%. Funds are distributed to the STP first, with set-asides for certain programs. Any funds above $2.639 billion are distributed to core programs based on apportionment ratios. FHWA analysis shows the distribution among programs for each state. The Equity Bonus Program guarantees a specific rate of return for states on payments to the highway account of the HTF. Funds are distributed to the STP first, with set-asides for certain programs. Any funds above $2.639 billion are distributed to core programs based on apportionment ratios. FHWA analysis indicates that over the five-year life of SAFETEA the EB program distributions will cost $40.9 billion. Funds for all programs are apportioned to states annually using formulas in SAFETEA, sometimes referred to as \"apportioned\" or formula programs. Under TEA-21, most highway funding was reserved for five major apportioned programs, along with the minimum guarantee, accounting for 86% of highway spending. SAFETEA increases core highway programs from five to six, including interstate maintenance, national highway system, surface transportation, highway bridge maintenance, congestion mitigation, air quality, and highway safety improvement. The majority of funding in the surface transportation bill goes to these core programs, with the Equity Bonus Program sometimes considered a core program. SAFETEA expands core highway programs, adding new programs like the Coordinated Border Infrastructure Program and Safe Routes to School Program. Most highway funding goes to core programs, with only a few new programs included in SAFETEA. Under TEA-21, funds from the Federal-Aid Highway program were distributed to states based on specific formula factors. These factors include lane miles, vehicle miles traveled, and estimated tax payments to the highway account. SAFETEA did not make major changes to these formulas but introduced new programs like the Coordinated Border Infrastructure Program and Safe Routes to School Program. SAFETEA made adjustments to existing program formulas, including eliminating the 10% safety STP set-aside and creating a $20 million NHS set-aside for ferry construction in Alaska, New Jersey, and Washington. Adjustments were also made to the CMAQ calculation for non-attainment areas under new ozone standards. The National Highway System set-aside for the Territorial Highway Program is set at $40 million for FY2005-FY2006 and at $50 million annually for FY2007-FY2009. The off-system bridge program set-aside minimum is maintained at 15% but the 35% ceiling is removed. The formula distribution is weighted based on federal lane miles, vehicle miles traveled, and annual fatalities on federal-aid highways in each state. The Railway-Highway Crossings program is funded through a takedown from HSIP and distributed based on the number of public railway-highway grade crossings in each state. Additionally, $90 million annually from HSIP is set aside by states starting in FY2006. Beginning in FY2006, $90 million annually is set aside by states for construction and operational improvements on high-risk rural roads. Funds are apportioned to states along the Canada-U.S. and Mexico-U.S. borders based on specific formulas. In FY2006, $90 million annually is allocated for construction and operational improvements on high-risk rural roads along the Canada-U.S. and Mexico-U.S. borders. Funds are apportioned to states based on specific formulas involving vehicle and cargo crossings, ports-of-entry, and student enrollment. No state receives less than $1 million. In SAFETEA, non-apportioned highway programs are subject to allocations based on criteria in highway laws and may be earmarked by Congress. The largest allocated program is for high priority projects designated by Congress, along with other significant programs like the federal lands program and interstate maintenance discretionary program. SAFETEA includes new allocated programs such as a transportation improvement program, a national corridor infrastructure program, and a program for projects of national or regional significance, all subject to 100% earmarking. The act also outlines project selection criteria for the latter program. In the 1990s, highway legislation introduced innovative financing mechanisms like GARVEEs, TIFIA credit assistance, and SIBs to expedite project completion and attract additional funds for highway projects. Each mechanism has specific strengths and weaknesses. SAFETEA makes changes to federal innovative finance programs like TIFIA and SIBs, providing three types of financial assistance for transportation projects. It reduces project size thresholds and allocates $122 million. SAFETEA reduces funding for intelligent transportation system projects from $30 million to $15 million and provides $122 million annually for TIFIA's leveraging activities. It expands the SIB program to allow any state to establish SIBs with federal funds. Additionally, SAFETEA consolidates tolling provisions and authorizes four tolling programs, including tolling of HOV lanes. The act authorizes $11 million for FY2005 and $12 million annually for FY2006-FY2009 with $3 million allocated for non-tolling congestion pricing pilot projects. House and Senate bill provisions that would have changed the tolling program were dropped during Conference. The new program directs the Secretary of Transportation. The new program authorizes $11 million for FY2005 and $12 million annually for FY2006-FY2009. It directs the Secretary of Transportation to carry out 15 demonstration projects for toll collection to manage congestion, reduce emissions, or finance highway expansion. Funding will mainly go towards high occupancy toll lanes. The new program authorizes funding for toll collection projects to manage congestion, reduce emissions, or finance highway expansion, mainly focusing on high occupancy toll lanes. Revenues from toll facilities can be used for debt service, private financing, operating costs, and excess funds may be allocated to federal-aid highway or transit projects. Toll prices can vary based on time of day or congestion levels to improve air quality and manage traffic. The act establishes a pilot toll program allowing toll collection on Interstate System highways, bridges, or tunnels for construction purposes. Fees on express lanes are collected through noncash electronic technology and can vary based on time of day or traffic levels. The pilot toll program allows toll collection on Interstate System highways, bridges, or tunnels for construction purposes. States cannot enter agreements preventing improvements to public roads near toll facilities due to traffic diversion. Revenues can only be used for debt service, investor returns, and operating costs. The Interstate Maintenance program allows toll collection for resurfacing, restoring, and rehabilitating toll facilities. State departments of transportation can permit vehicles to pay a toll to use HOV lanes, with requirements for enrollment, toll collection, and managing traffic demand. The Interstate Maintenance program allows toll collection for managing traffic demand by varying toll amounts and enforcing violations. It also permits preferential rates for low emission vehicles for HOV use and allows tax-exempt bonds to finance highway projects and rail-truck transfer facilities. The act allows tax-exempt bonds for certain infrastructure projects, including highways, international tunnels/bridges, and truck-train transfer facilities. There is a $15 billion limit on the bonds that can be issued. The impact of this provision on infrastructure creation is not estimated in the conference report. The SAFETEA bonding provision allows for tax-exempt bonds to be used for infrastructure projects, with a $15 billion limit. This provision could have a substantial impact, especially for California. It is considered one of the most important tolling provisions in SAFETEA. Projects using private activity bonds are likely to be supported by tolls or other revenue mechanisms. The ADHP aims to improve infrastructure in Appalachia and promote economic development. The Appalachian Development Highway Program (ADHP) aims to improve infrastructure in Appalachia and promote economic development. It is funded through the highway trust fund and administered by the Appalachian Regional Commission. Member states receive funds based on cost estimates to complete the approved Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS). As of 2004, 85% of ADHS roads are either completed or under construction, with an estimated additional $4.47 billion needed to complete the system. The ADHP received $450 million annually under TEA-21 and $470 million under SAFETEA, with an 80% federal share. SAFETEA prohibits toll revenues as credits for non-federal matching funds. It includes over 5,092 earmarks for high priority projects, a significant increase from TEA-21. SAFETEA includes over 5,092 earmarks for congressional high priority projects worth $14.8 billion, compared to TEA-21's 1,849 earmarks worth $9.4 billion. Additionally, SAFETEA introduces new earmarked categories, such as projects of national and regional significance, allocating almost $1.8 billion for 25 projects. The SAFETEA program includes earmarks for national corridor infrastructure improvements and transportation projects totaling over $4.4 billion. The corridor infrastructure program is not new, while the transportation improvements program is a new initiative with 465 projects receiving funding. Individual projects may appear in multiple earmarking lists. In addition to the earmarks for national corridor infrastructure improvements and transportation projects totaling over $4.4 billion, there are 32 earmarks in the highway title, 25 in the research title, and 662 projects in the bus and bus facilities program, with a total value of almost $1.6 billion. The transit title of the bill includes 39 stand-alone earmarks worth $191 million, contributing to a total earmarking amount estimated to exceed $24 billion. Discussion post-passage has focused on how earmarks impact the Equity Bonus calculation, with distinctions made between \"below the line\" and \"above the line\" projects. This calculation significantly affects state shares. The Equity Bonus calculation significantly affects state shares due to the distribution of earmarked funds. Highway title earmarks are categorized as below or above the line, with transit earmarks not included in the calculation. The Transportation Enhancements program funds various project categories. The Transportation Enhancements program funds various project categories including bicycle safety, historic preservation, scenic beautification, and environmental mitigation. Funding mechanisms support activities such as acquisition of scenic easements, landscaping, rehabilitation of historic structures, and establishment of transportation museums. The funding mechanism for Transportation Enhancements (TE) program activities has been modified under SAFETEA. Funding for TE projects is now the greater of 10% of funds apportioned to a state under the Surface Transportation Program (STP) or the amount apportioned in FY2005. This ensures additional funding for enhancement projects as STP funding increases under P.L. 109-59. The Transportation, Community, and System Preservation (TCSP) program, established under TEA-21 and reauthorized under SAFETEA, is designed to promote wildlife connectivity and establish transportation museums. The TCSP program, established under TEA-21 and reauthorized under SAFETEA, aims to integrate transportation, community, and system preservation plans. It funds projects to improve transportation efficiency, reduce environmental impacts, and encourage compatible private sector development patterns. The TCSP program, funded under P.L. 109-59, provides grants to state, tribal, regional, and local governments for transportation, community, and system preservation plans. A total funding authorization of $270 million over six years was allocated, with $25 million authorized for FY2005 and $61.25 million for FY2006-FY2009. This is more than TEA-21's authorization but less than the total funds appropriated during TEA-21's lifespan. Under TEA-21, TCSP funding was authorized at $20 million for FY1999 and $25 million per year for FY2000 through FY2003. Funding amounts varied each year, with $13.5 million in FY1999, $31.1 million in FY2000, $46.9 million in FY2001, $273 million in FY2002, and $89.5 million in FY2003. SAFETEA continued to provide significant funding for bicycle and pedestrian programs promoting non-motorized trips, safety, health, and education. The Transportation Enhancements (TE) program has supported pedestrian and bicycle mobility since the passage of ISTEA. States can allocate TE funds for pedestrian and bicycle facilities, safety and educational activities, and preservation of abandoned railway corridors for pedestrian or bicycle trails. Between FY1992 and FY2004, 55% of TE funds were used for these activities, with pedestrian and bicycle facilities accounting for 46.3% of the funds. The Safe Routes to School Program, a new program under SAFETEA, aims to promote walking and biking to school for children, including those with disabilities, to encourage a healthy lifestyle from an early age. It also focuses on making biking and walking safer and more appealing transportation options. The Safe Routes to School Program, funded at $612 million for FY2004-FY2009, aims to promote a healthy lifestyle by encouraging walking and biking to school for children. Funding is apportioned among states based on student enrollment ratios, with each state receiving a minimum of $1 million per year. The Safe Routes to School Program is funded at $612 million for FY2004-FY2009 to promote walking and biking to school. Each state's apportionment is administered by the state's department of transportation. The federal share of project costs is 100%, and funds are available until expended. Eligible agencies include state, local, and regional agencies, as well as nonprofit organizations. Funds can be used for infrastructure projects to improve safety. The Safe Routes to School Program funds infrastructure projects to improve walking and biking to school, including sidewalk improvements, traffic calming measures, bicycle facilities, and pedestrian crossing improvements. Funds can also be used for noninfrastructure activities like public awareness campaigns. The Safe Routes to School Program requires states to allocate funding for various activities such as public awareness campaigns, traffic education, student sessions on safety, and funding for coordinators. Non-infrastructure spending should be between 10% and 30% of the total amount allocated. Each state must fund a full-time coordinator for their safe routes to school program. The Secretary is required to make grants to a national nonprofit organization for a safe routes to school program, including operating a clearinghouse, developing educational programs, and providing technical assistance. A task force is established to study and develop a strategy for advancing safe routes to school programs nationwide, with results to be transmitted to Congress by March 31, 2006. Funding for the clearinghouse would come from the Secretary's administrative expenses. SAFETEA provides $45.3 billion in guaranteed funding for transit for the five-year authorization period (FY2005-FY2009), totaling $52.6 billion over six years, a 46% increase from TEA-21. Congress adjusted funding shares, with Urbanized Area Formula Program receiving 44.0% and Non-Urbanized Formula Program receiving 5.2%. The SAFETEA Act increased funding for transit programs, with the Non-Urbanized Formula Program receiving 5.2% of the total funding. The act also made minor changes to the federal transit program, adding new programs and funding categories while adjusting funding shares among states. The SAFETEA Act increased funding for transit programs, with provisions for federal agencies in the National Capital Region to offer transit passes to employees. It also made alternatives analysis eligible for FTA grants and earmarked funding for the Bus and Bus Facilities Program, totaling $1.7 billion in additional funding. The SAFETEA Act increased funding for transit programs, including $1.7 billion in additional funding for the Urbanized Area Formula and Non-Urbanized Area Formula programs. Funds are apportioned to states based on population forecasts and distributed to urbanized and non-urbanized areas accordingly. Urbanized areas with population densities exceeding 370 persons per mile also receive funding to increase transportation services availability. The SAFETEA Act increased funding for transit programs, including a formula program to increase transportation services for persons with disabilities. This program is authorized at $339 million over FY2006-FY2009 and is not subject to labor protection provisions. Another discretionary grant program aims to provide transportation alternatives in national parks and public lands, with a total authorization of $97 million. A new formula program within the Urbanized Area Formula Program provides additional funding for small urbanized areas with populations under 200,000 that offer transit services comparable to larger urbanized areas. This program has a total authorization of $150 million over the FY2006-FY2009 period. The new formula program provides additional funding for small urbanized areas with populations under 200,000 that offer transit services comparable to larger urbanized areas. This program measures transit service areas based on various performance factors and aims to relieve small transit providers from reporting extensive data required for larger areas. The Urbanized Areas Formula Program aims to reward small areas providing high levels of transit service by shifting 1% of funding from urbanized areas over 200,000 in population to those under 200,000. This change addresses the disparity in funding recognition for transit-intensive areas. The Urbanized Areas Formula Program is shifting 1% of funding from urbanized areas over 200,000 in population to those under 200,000. This new program within the New Starts program funds transit systems or extensions. Projects seeking less than $75 million in federal funding will have a streamlined evaluation process. The program is authorized at $200 million annually for FY2007-FY2009. The exemption from evaluation for projects seeking less than $25 million in federal funding is eliminated. The Urbanized Areas Formula Program is reallocating funding to benefit areas under 200,000 in population. Projects seeking less than $25 million in federal funding will no longer be exempt from evaluation. $45 million is allocated for grants to Indian tribes for public transportation on reservations. 20% of the Non-Urbanized Area Formula program funding will be based on a state's non-urbanized land area, while 80% will be based on population. $90 million is authorized for magnetic levitation train deployment. The act authorizes $90 million for magnetic levitation train deployment for FY2005-FY2009, with 50% allocated for a project between Las Vegas and Primm, Nevada, and 50% for a project east of the Mississippi River. Pennsylvania and Maryland were selected to compete for funding under the TEA-21 deployment program. The SAFETEA conference committee report reauthorizes the Swift Rail Act, allocating $70 million annually for corridor development and $30 million for high-speed rail technology improvements. It also authorizes $50 million for rail-highway grade crossing hazard elimination in high-speed rail corridors. The SAFETEA conference committee report reauthorizes the Swift Rail Act, allocating funds for corridor development, high-speed rail technology improvements, and rail-highway grade crossing hazard elimination in high-speed rail corridors. The act also directs grants to the Alaska Railroad for passenger transportation improvements, with no specific authorized amounts mentioned. Additionally, funds apportioned to the Anchorage urbanized area can be used by the Alaska Railroad for passenger operations costs. The Federal Railroad Administration is required to establish a program for reviewing continuous welded rail joint bars. The SAFETEA conference committee report reauthorizes the Swift Rail Act, allocating funds for corridor development, high-speed rail technology improvements, and rail-highway grade crossing hazard elimination in high-speed rail corridors. It also directs grants to the Alaska Railroad for passenger transportation improvements. The Federal Railroad Administration is required to establish a program for reviewing continuous welded rail joint bars and develop regulations for pressurized tank cars. Additionally, a new Highway Safety Improvement Program is authorized. The Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) under TEA-21 subsumed existing programs for roadway hazard elimination and rail-highway grade crossing hazard elimination. This program funded projects like installing barriers, guard rails, warning lights, and gates. States were required to spend at least $317 million annually for hazard elimination, with a $560 million set-aside in FY2005. The new HSIP Program, authorized at $1.2 billion in FY2006 and rising to $1.3 billion by FY2009, allocates funding based on a formula using three ratios: total lane-miles of federal-aid highways, total vehicle miles traveled on federal-aid highways, and fatalities on the federal-aid highway. States must spend at least $317 million annually on hazard elimination, with $155 million for rail-highway hazard elimination and $162 million for general roadway hazard elimination. Any remaining funds can be used for other highway projects if not needed for safety improvements. The Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) allocates funding based on federal-aid highway lane-miles, vehicle miles traveled, and fatalities. States must spend a minimum amount on hazard elimination, with set-asides for rail-highway grade crossings and high-risk rural roads. States can use remaining funds for other highway projects if safety needs are met. The Safe Routes to Schools program allocates funds for infrastructure projects near schools to promote walking or biking. The program funding is based on student enrollment, with a minimum of $1 million for each state. At least 10% of the funds are designated for safety programs. The overall program authorization is $1.2 billion in FY2006, increasing to $1.3 billion by FY2009. The program funds are allocated for behavior and non-infrastructure projects, with a budget starting at $54 million in FY2005 and increasing to $183 million in FY2009. A new grant program is created to promote seat belt use, with states enacting primary seat belt laws eligible for grants. Grant funds can be used for various highway safety purposes. The grant funds for highway safety purposes are 100% federally funded, with an annual authorization of $125 million for FY2006-FY2009. The program also includes a grant program to reduce alcohol-impaired driving rates. States must meet certain criteria or implement specific programs to qualify for grants. States must carry out specific programs to qualify for grant funds for highway safety purposes. The programs include checkpoints, prosecution programs, increasing blood alcohol testing, harsher penalties for high BAC levels, effective rehabilitation programs, prevention strategies for underage drinking, and specialized courts for impaired driving cases. The program aims to prevent impaired driving by implementing strategies for high-risk offenders and underage drinkers, along with an administrative license revocation system. Grants totaling $555 million are available for various programs, including returning fines collected for DUI to communities for prevention efforts. Additionally, there is a set-aside of up to 15% of funds for states with the highest rates of impaired driving-related fatalities. The act includes new programs such as a motorcyclist safety grant program and an incentive grant program for states requiring child restraints. It also directs the DOT to establish standards to reduce vehicle rollover crashes and enhance passenger vehicle occupant protection. The Transportation Act includes provisions to reduce vehicle rollover crashes and enhance passenger vehicle occupant protection. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) use communication systems, sensors, and computers to improve highway and transit performance and safety by providing real-time traffic information for traffic management centers. The Transportation Act includes provisions to reduce vehicle rollover crashes and enhance passenger vehicle occupant protection. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) improve highway and transit performance and safety by providing real-time traffic information. Federal investment in ITS during TEA-21 was about $230 million per year, with $100 million for research and $120 million for deployment. SAFETEA provides $110 million annually for ITS research, and the ITS deployment program ended after FY2005. New technologies are being advanced and tested to improve ITS standards. The Transportation Act includes provisions for advancing and testing new technologies in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) to improve highway and transit performance and safety. It also emphasizes the importance of reducing challenges such as congestion, security issues, traffic crashes, environmental degradation, and infrastructure rehabilitation. The federal role in Research and Development (RD) and Technological Development (TD) aims to advance technologies, processes, and infrastructure to address challenges like congestion and infrastructure rehabilitation. The FHWA, FTA, NHTSA, and RITA oversee transportation initiatives, with a focus on ITS and FHWA's RD and TD program. Funding supports FHWA-administered programs for transportation improvements. Title V of SAFETEA authorizes approximately $295 million annually to support FHWA-administered programs for transportation research and education. This includes funding for surface transportation research, training, education, the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, and the University Transportation Research Program. Title IX of SAFETEA authorizes research, development, and testing funds for transit and motor carrier activities, as well as for various technological objectives. Research funds are used to advance technologies for highway improvement and safety, with some funds earmarked for specific projects and institutions. State and industry experts emphasize the importance of FHWA's RD and TD funds for maximizing the effective use of federal aid funds. Title IX of SAFETEA, \"Rail Transportation,\" focuses on infrastructure capacity, rail-to-rail competition, and grade crossing conflicts in freight rail transportation. Congress is considering the freight railroads' ability to expand infrastructure to handle increasing trade volumes and highway congestion. Freight railroads mainly self-finance infrastructure, prompting Congress to explore federal assistance possibilities. The federal government may assist railroads in expanding networks and address issues like increased freight train traffic in towns. Railroads are intensifying track usage for efficiency, despite reducing total miles. Congressional concerns include the captive shipper question since rail industry deregulation in 1980. In 1980, the captive shipper question arose concerning high rail rates and poor service for shippers served by only one railroad. Congressional debates and legislation, such as SAFETEA, address these issues. Section 9007 of the act requests a report on the rail system's performance, projected demand, and public policy effectiveness. SAFETEA addresses high rail rates and poor service for captive shippers by expanding the RRIF Program to $35 billion, with $7 billion reserved for smaller railroads. SAFETEA expands the RRIF Program to $35 billion, with $7 billion for smaller railroads, and amends program language to expedite loan availability. Section 9003 requires the Secretary of Transportation to provide loans without collateral, approve or disapprove within 90 days, and allows loans for constructing rail connections for captive shippers. SAFETEA expands the RRIF Program to $35 billion, with $7 billion for smaller railroads, and amends program language to expedite loan availability. It also creates a new federal grants program for relocating or grade separating rail tracks interfering with a community's traffic flow, quality of life, or economic development, authorizing $350 million annually from 2006 to 2009. The SAFETEA program authorizes $350 million annually from 2006 to 2009 for grants, with at least half not exceeding $20 million each. Funding includes enhancing rail infrastructure capacity, eliminating grade crossings, and specific projects like improving rail connections in Chicago and a rail line connecting Virginia seaports and Ohio. The SAFETEA program authorizes annual grants for rail infrastructure projects, including eliminating grade crossings in Chicago and other areas. Funding also supports a study on relocating rail yards in El Paso and improving rail connections to the Port of Portsmouth, Virginia. The SAFETEA program includes a new grant program for improving freight mobility around U.S. ports and intermodal facilities, with $6 million in grants for each fiscal year from 2005 to 2009. Six projects in Oregon, Georgia, California, Alaska, and North Carolina are designated to carry out the program. Additionally, SAFETEA continues the Recreational Trails Program. The Recreational Trails Program (RTP) is a state-administered, federal-aid program that helps states develop and maintain recreational trails for various activities. RTP funds can be used for hiking, biking, horseback riding, snowmobiling, and other off-road activities, but not for property condemnation or constructing new motorized trails on certain federal lands. The Recreational Trails Program (RTP) receives $370 million in contract authority for FY2005-2009 under SAFETEA. Funds are allocated to states based on a legislative formula, with 50% equally distributed and 50% based on off-road recreational fuel use. Administrative expenses are set at $840,000 annually. States must adhere to the same annual obligation limitation as other federal-aid highway programs. SAFETEA requires states to allocate 30% of RTP funds for motorized trail uses, 30% for non-motorized trail uses, and 40% for diverse trail uses. The discretionary waiver for the 30% provisions is eliminated, but the small state exemption remains for states with less than 3.5 million acres. The \"sliding scale\" provision allows for additional federal share in states with large federal lands. SAFETEA amends the RTP program by changing the federal share for projects to a sliding scale, encouraging states to use youth conservation corps, expanding permissible uses for funding, and allowing funding for trail condition assessment. SAFETEA amends the RTP program by changing the federal share for projects to a sliding scale, encouraging states to use youth conservation corps, expanding permissible uses for funding, and allowing funding for trail condition assessment. A new provision permits funding for trail condition assessment for accessibility and maintenance. Before final design, property acquisition, or construction on a highway or transit project can proceed, DOT must comply with certain environmental review requirements. NEPA requires federal agencies to consider environmental impacts of proposed actions. DOT must prepare an EIS for federally funded projects that significantly affect the environment. Projects with unclear impacts require an EA, and if impacts are significant, an EIS is necessary. The NEPA process requires an EIS to be prepared for projects with significant impacts. Projects with no significant impact are processed as categorical exclusions. Compliance with Section 4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act of 1966 is also required within the NEPA process. Section 4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act of 1966 applies to the use of publicly owned parks, wildlife refuges, and historic sites. It prohibits using these resources for transportation projects unless there is no feasible alternative and all efforts are made to minimize harm. Concerns have been raised about the inefficiency of the environmental review process for large projects, causing delays in completion. Environmental Streamlining provisions were included in TEA-21 to address delays in completion of transportation projects. FHWA defines it as timely project delivery while protecting the environment. Improved interagency cooperation was identified as crucial for success. DOT was required to develop and implement coordinated efforts. The TEA-21 legislation mandated the Department of Transportation to establish a coordinated environmental review process for highway projects with significant environmental impacts. This process aimed to involve relevant federal and state agencies early on in the project. Despite efforts to streamline administrative activities, some Members of Congress called for additional legislation to expedite the environmental review process for highway construction and transit projects. SAFETEA includes provisions to streamline the environmental review process for highway construction and transit projects, focusing on NEPA and Section 4(f) requirements. The term \"streamlining\" is not used in SAFETEA, but the goal remains to expedite compliance with environmental regulations. SAFETEA aims to expedite compliance with environmental regulations, particularly NEPA and Section 4(f) requirements. Key provisions include designating DOT as the lead agency, specifying roles of lead and cooperating agencies, and allowing decision-making deadlines to be set. A new entity called a \"participating agency\" is established in the NEPA process. The NEPA process includes participating agencies for submitting comments on NEPA documentation. Procedures are established for collaborative development of project statements and alternatives, with deadlines set. A 180-day statute of limitation on judicial claims for final agency actions is implemented. Transportation funds can be used to expedite environmental reviews, and a dispute resolution mechanism is established. The SAFETEA Act includes provisions to expedite the environmental review process, establish a dispute resolution process for agency disagreements, allow states to determine certain project classifications, and create state pilot programs for federal compliance with environmental laws. Additionally, under Section 4(f), publicly owned parks and recreation areas can be used if impacts are deemed minimal. The SAFETEA Act allows for the use of publicly or privately owned historic sites or parks if impacts are minimal. DOT is required to issue regulations clarifying factors for determining alternatives under Section 4(f) requirements. The SAFETEA Act allows for the use of historic sites or parks with minimal impacts, and DOT must clarify factors for determining alternatives under Section 4(f) requirements. The Interstate System cannot be considered a \"historic site\" under Section 4(f) provisions, but individual elements may have historic significance. ISTEA directed the Secretary of DOT to take action following the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) established the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ) program to reduce emissions from highway travel and help states comply with air quality standards. The CMAQ program funds projects to reduce carbon monoxide and ozone, including transportation control measures and alternative fuel vehicles. The CMAQ program, established by ISTEA, funds projects for auto emission controls, alternative fuel vehicles, traffic flow improvements, and pedestrian/bicycle facilities. Funds are apportioned based on population and pollution reduction needs, with a minimum guarantee for states without nonattainment areas. TEA-21 expanded the program's use of funds for projects and programs. SAFETEA expanded CMAQ funding eligibility requirements and amended the apportionment formula, increasing total funding to $8.6 billion for FY2005-FY2009 compared to $8.1 billion under TEA-21. SAFETEA expands CMAQ funding eligibility to include projects like advanced truck stop electrification systems, transportation system improvements, emergency communications equipment, and diesel retrofits. States receiving minimum apportionment can now use CMAQ funds for eligible projects. SAFETEA also prioritizes diesel retrofit projects for funding. SAFETEA directs DOT to evaluate CMAQ projects' impacts on air quality and congestion levels. A database describing project impacts is maintained and disseminated, with no direct funding provided for the evaluation or the database. Under the Clean Air Act, areas not meeting air quality standards must develop State Implementation Plans (SIPs). As of May 2005, 124 areas with 159 million people were subject to SIP requirements. Federal agencies are prohibited from funding projects in these areas unless they conform to SIPs to avoid causing new violations or delaying attainment of standards. The Clean Air Act requires areas to develop State Implementation Plans (SIPs) to meet air quality standards. Federal funding for highway and transit projects is contingent on conformity with SIPs to prevent violations or delays in meeting standards. Conformity is crucial for projects to receive federal funds and is expected to have a growing impact due to increasing emissions from vehicles like SUVs and light trucks. The Clean Air Act requires areas to develop State Implementation Plans (SIPs) to meet air quality standards. Federal funding for highway and transit projects is contingent on conformity with SIPs to prevent violations or delays in meeting standards. Recent court decisions and more stringent air quality standards will lead to temporary suspension of funds in metropolitan areas unless emissions are sharply reduced. The Clean Air Act mandates areas to create State Implementation Plans (SIPs) to meet air quality standards, with federal funding for transportation projects dependent on conformity with SIPs. A 2003 survey by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) revealed that only 5 metropolitan areas had to adjust transportation plans due to conformity issues in the past six years. However, one-third of local transportation planners anticipated challenges in demonstrating conformity in the future. The Clean Air Act does not allow waivers of conformity, with only a one-year grace period granted after an area is designated as nonattainment. The rules for federal funding of transportation projects in nonattainment areas are strict, with only limited exempt projects allowed. Concerns include restrictions on funding new projects that could reduce emissions and a need for better coordination between SIPs, TIPs, and long-range transportation planning cycles. The GAO recommended extending the three-year time frame between required long-range planning. The GAO recommended extending the three-year time frame between required long-range transportation plan updates and amending the Clean Air Act to change conformity rules. This was supported by transportation planners and highway builders but opposed by environmental groups and air quality planning officials. P.L. 109-59 now requires conformity demonstrations every four years instead of every two years, shortening the planning horizon to 10 years in many cases. Local air pollution control agencies will need to be consulted. The law requires conformity demonstrations every four years instead of every two years, shortening the planning horizon to 10 years in many cases. The local air pollution control agency must be consulted, and a 12-month grace period is allowed after a failure to demonstrate conformity."
