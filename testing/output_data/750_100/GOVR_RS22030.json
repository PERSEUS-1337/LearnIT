    "content": "The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the discovery of Al Qaeda cells in Europe spurred EU efforts to combat terrorism and enhance cooperation in police, judicial, and intelligence fields. The EU, a unique partnership among 28 member states, aims to promote peace and economic prosperity through European integration. As part of this integration process, the EU has worked to harmonize policies in \"justice and home affairs\" to further enhance cooperation among its members. Efforts in the area of \"justice and home affairs\" (JHA) within the EU focus on common internal security measures, protecting citizens' rights, and promoting free movement. This includes countering terrorism, cross-border crimes, police and judicial cooperation, migration and asylum issues, as well as border control policies for the Schengen area. EU attempts to establish common JHA policies were initially hindered by member state concerns about potential infringements on national legal systems. The 2001 terrorist attacks prompted EU leaders to address challenges in the JHA area, overcoming obstacles like member state concerns and lack of resources. Law enforcement efforts post-attacks led to arrests in several European countries, with Germany and Spain identified as key bases for the attacks. European leaders recognized that the EU's open borders and different legal systems facilitated terrorists and criminals to move around easily and evade arrest. Most EU member states lacked anti-terrorist legislation at the time of the 2001 attacks, allowing suspects to escape apprehension by fleeing to countries with different laws. The EU recognized the need to harmonize national laws against terrorism and improve information sharing among member states' law enforcement authorities to combat cross-border terrorist threats efficiently. The EU took steps to combat terrorism by establishing common definitions, enhancing extradition processes, and strengthening border controls. This included bolstering Europol and Eurojust to improve intelligence and prosecutorial coordination. The urgency to enhance counterterrorism capabilities was heightened by subsequent incidents in Europe, such as the 2004 bombings in Madrid. The March 2004 bombings in Madrid by an Al Qaeda-inspired group led to EU initiatives to improve travel document security and establish a Counterterrorism Coordinator. The July 2005 bombings in London highlighted the issue of \"homegrown\" Islamist extremism in Europe. The London attacks in July 2005 brought the issue of \"homegrown\" Islamist extremism to the forefront of European political debate. The EU adopted its first plan in December 2005 to combat radicalization and terrorist recruitment, focusing on disrupting networks, promoting mainstream opinions, and enhancing security and justice. In 2008, the EU expanded its definition of terrorism to include new criminal offenses such as terrorist recruitment, providing training, and public provocation to commit terrorism, including online. This decision aimed to facilitate prosecution of individuals involved in terrorist activities and counter the spread of terrorist propaganda and training tactics. The EU established a Radicalisation Awareness Network (RAN) in 2011 to connect key groups involved in countering radicalization and violent extremism. Despite political commitment to enhancing EU-wide cooperation against terrorism, forging common EU policies remains a work in progress due to national sovereignty concerns and differing views on sensitive issues like data privacy and intelligence sharing. EU institutions face challenges in harmonizing laws and policies in the JHA field, especially on sensitive issues like data privacy and intelligence sharing. National police and intelligence services are often hesitant to share information with each other or with EU bodies like Europol. These challenges have been evident in recent efforts to address the threat posed by the Islamic State terrorist organization and the \"foreign fighter phenomenon.\" EU policymakers are increasingly concerned about European citizens and residents training and fighting with the Islamist State. The European Union faces challenges in harmonizing laws and policies in the JHA field, especially regarding data privacy and intelligence sharing. Security services are concerned about the growing number of European citizens and residents training and fighting with terrorist groups in the Middle East and North Africa. Up to 5,000 EU citizens may have traveled to conflict zones like Syria and Iraq. There are fears of potential danger from trained militants returning to Europe and lone wolf attacks inspired by Islamist extremist propaganda. Recent terrorist attacks in Europe have heightened these concerns. Recent terrorist attacks in Europe, such as the 2014 Brussels Jewish Museum shooting and the 2015 Paris attacks, have raised fears due to possible links to Islamic extremist groups. The perpetrators were French-born Muslims with connections to Al Qaeda. The perpetrators of recent terrorist attacks in Europe were French-born Muslims with possible ties to Al Qaeda or the Islamic State. These attacks include the February 2015 shootings in Copenhagen, Denmark, the attempted August 2015 attack on a train from Amsterdam to Paris, and the coordinated November 2015 attacks in Paris. The November 13, 2015, coordinated attacks in Paris left 130 dead and over 350 injured. Seven of the nine assailants were identified as French or Belgian citizens with ties to the Islamic State. European governments are struggling with monitoring potential assailants and addressing weaknesses in domestic security and border controls. Authorities are facing challenges in monitoring a growing number of potential assailants due to insufficient information sharing among EU countries' law enforcement and intelligence services. Some attackers have exploited the Schengen system and the chaos caused by the influx of migrants and refugees. Perpetrators have traveled between European countries before attacks, and a suspected ringleader of the Paris attacks traveled between Europe and Syria despite being known to security services. Two perpetrators of the November attacks in Paris entered Europe through Greece with fake Syrian passports. Another suspect entered Belgium from France the morning after the attacks but remains at large. The EU is taking measures to address the foreign fighter phenomenon, but implementing common policies remains a challenge. Implementing common EU policies to counter terrorism and the foreign fighter threat has been challenging due to issues related to sovereignty and balancing security with human rights. The EU has made progress in enhancing information sharing to address the evolving threat, but some analysts are skeptical about the effectiveness of these efforts. EU officials are encouraging national authorities to share information on suspected foreign fighters and utilize common EU databases like the Schengen Information System and Europol's Focal Point Travellers database for monitoring and investigating foreign terrorist fighters. Europol launched the European Counter Terrorism Centre in January 2016 for information sharing and operational cooperation among member states. The EU is working on initiatives to monitor and investigate foreign terrorist fighters, illegal firearms trafficking, and terrorist financing. Success depends on receiving information from national authorities. Despite an increase in alerts and information shared with Europol, EU-wide information sharing on terrorism is still lacking. Finalizing the EU-wide System for the Collection of Airline Passenger Name Record Data is a priority. An EU PNR system proposal has been stalled in the European Parliament since 2013 due to data privacy concerns. Pressure to adopt the system increased after the 2015 Paris attacks. EU officials argue that it would aid in tracking foreign fighters and identifying terrorist suspects. The EU PNR proposal aims to harmonize PNR collection practices across EU member states. A provisional agreement was reached in December 2015, obliging airlines to provide PNR data for flights into and out of EU territory. Member states can also collect PNR data from intra-EU flights and non-carrier operators. The EU PNR proposal aims to harmonize PNR collection practices across member states. Critics argue it infringes on data privacy rights, while others believe it doesn't go far enough in sharing PNR data. The agreement does not establish a centralized EU PNR database, and once adopted, governments have two years to implement its provisions. EU officials urged national authorities to strengthen external border controls in response to the foreign fighter threat. The EU urged national authorities to utilize security tools in the Schengen Borders Code to address the foreign fighter threat. Resistance to amending the code for more extensive checks stemmed from concerns about potential reimposition of internal border controls due to the surge of migrants and refugees in 2015 and the Paris attacks. The European Commission proposed modifications to the Schengen Borders Code in response to security concerns following the Paris attacks in November 2015. This included mandatory checks of EU citizens against law enforcement databases at external borders and the establishment of a new European Border and Coast Guard to strengthen border security. The EU has established measures to strengthen border security, including the creation of a European Border and Coast Guard. Efforts are also being made to detect and remove online content promoting terrorism through the Internet Referral Unit and Internet Forum. The EU launched an Internet Forum to counter terrorist propaganda online and called on member states to address societal factors contributing to radicalization. They are revising the Framework Decision on Combating Terrorism to criminalize traveling for terrorist purposes throughout the EU. EU member states are revising criminal laws to combat terrorist activities, including traveling for terrorist purposes and receiving terrorist training. Efforts to harmonize laws have faced challenges due to varying national policies and concerns about infringing on national legal systems. Updating the common terrorism definition is necessary to comply with U.N. Security Council Resolution 2178. Resolution 2178 of September 2014 urges U.N. member countries to prosecute foreign fighter-related offenses. The EU is revising its terrorism definition to address the foreign fighter threat. Cooperation with the United States in combating terrorism has been a top priority for the EU since 9/11. The EU has largely welcomed the initiative to root out terrorist cells in Europe and beyond, aiming to prevent attacks against the United States. U.S.-EU cooperation on counterterrorism has strengthened dialogue on law enforcement and homeland security issues. Despite some tensions, most U.S. policymakers view the partnership positively. The Obama Administration has supported collaboration with the EU on counterterrorism, border controls, and transport security. The EU has been a key partner for the US in counterterrorism efforts, including border controls and transport security. President Obama's National Strategy for Counterterrorism emphasized the importance of working with European allies and the EU to enhance mutual security while upholding individual rights. Additionally, the EU is a member of the Global Counterterrorism Forum, which aims to mobilize resources and expertise to counter violent extremism and enhance international cooperation. U.S.-EU counterterrorism cooperation has focused on combating the foreign fighter phenomenon, with concerns about European and American Muslims joining Islamist groups in Syria and Iraq. Worries exist about European foreign fighters due to visa-free travel arrangements between the U.S. and most EU countries. Attorney General Eric Holder emphasized the need for shared strategies to address these challenges. Eric Holder emphasized the need for shared strategies to address the influx of U.S. and European-born violent extremists in Syria. U.S. officials are working closely with EU counterparts on measures to enhance counter-radicalization, border security, aviation security, and information sharing to combat the foreign fighter threat. EU countries strongly support U.N. Security Council efforts. EU countries are supporting U.N. Security Council Resolution 2178 to combat the foreign fighter threat. After the Paris attacks in January 2015, U.S. and European officials met to discuss terrorist threats and foreign fighters. European and EU officials also participated in a conference on countering violent extremism in February 2015 hosted by the United States. At a conference on countering violent extremism in Washington, DC, U.S. officials urged European governments and the EU to enhance information sharing and utilize existing databases like the SIS and Europol. President Obama called on the EU to implement an EU PNR system and require airlines to share passenger information to prevent foreign terrorist fighters from entering countries. The U.S. officials and analysts emphasize the importance of close law enforcement ties with European allies and existing U.S.-EU information-sharing arrangements to combat foreign terrorist fighters. Challenges in the U.S.-EU counterterrorism relationship include data privacy and protection concerns, which have complicated negotiations on information-sharing agreements. The U.S. and EU have had challenges in their counterterrorism relationship, including data privacy concerns and negotiations on information-sharing agreements. Renewed attention was brought to these issues after unauthorized disclosures of NSA surveillance activities in 2013. Other tensions include detainee policies, differences in terrorist designation lists, and balancing border security with facilitating transatlantic travel and commerce. U.S. legislation passed in 2015 to strengthen the Visa Waiver Program has raised concerns in the EU. Contacts between U.S. and EU officials on police, judicial, and border control policy matters have increased since 2001, strengthening U.S.-EU ties. The U.S. Departments of State, Justice, Homeland Security, and the Treasury are actively engaged in this process, with high-level meetings between U.S. and EU counterparts occurring regularly. A group of senior officials meets every six months to discuss police and judicial cooperation against terrorism. The United States and the EU have established dialogues on terrorist financing, border security, and transport security. U.S. and EU officials also engage in dialogues on critical infrastructure protection, resilience, and preventing violent extremism. Europol has liaison officers in Washington, DC, and reciprocal liaison relationships have been established between U.S. and EU agencies. Europol and the United States have established liaison relationships to work on counterterrorism, counterfeiting, and cybercrime. The U.S. has stationed 14 officers at Europol headquarters in The Hague, representing 11 different federal law enforcement agencies. These collaborations have led to successful operations against transnational crimes, including online \"dark net\" marketplaces selling illicit products. Since 2006, a U.S. liaison has worked at Eurojust headquarters in The Hague to facilitate cooperation between European and U.S. prosecutors on terrorism and other cross-border criminal cases. U.S.-EU efforts against terrorism have resulted in agreements to improve police and judicial cooperation, including sharing strategic and personal information between U.S. law enforcement authorities and Europol. Negotiations between the U.S. and EU on personal information accord were challenging due to concerns about data protection standards. EU regulations prioritize privacy rights and limit access to personal data by law enforcement. Data protection concerns also affected negotiations on the 2006 U.S.-Eurojust cooperation agreement. In 2007, a common agreement was signed to enhance security standards for classified information. In 2010, new U.S.-EU treaties on extradition and mutual legal assistance entered into force to harmonize existing bilateral accords, simplify extradition, and enhance information-sharing and prosecutorial cooperation in combating terrorism and other threats. The U.S.-EU treaties on extradition and mutual legal assistance aim to combat terrorism and transnational crimes like financial fraud and organized crime. Challenges included the U.S. agreeing not to extradite suspects to the EU if they face the death penalty, as per EU law, and not guaranteeing the extradition of any EU national. The agreements modernize existing bilateral accords, streamline information exchange, and enhance cooperation. The MLA treaty between the United States and EU members streamlines information exchange, allows access to European financial information, speeds up request processing, permits video conferencing for evidence acquisition, and enables U.S. participation in joint EU investigations. Despite some critics doubting collaboration with EU bodies, the treaty enhances law enforcement cooperation. Some critics question the utility of collaborating with EU-wide bodies due to existing bilateral relations between the FBI, CIA, national police, and intelligence services in EU member states. Europol lacks enforcement capabilities and relies on national services for information. European officials criticize the US for expecting intelligence sharing without reciprocating. European opposition to the US death penalty and reluctance to extradite their nationals may hinder cooperation. Most U.S. and European officials are committed to enhancing cooperation with EU law enforcement entities like Europol, despite potential obstacles like resistance to extradition and the death penalty. New agreements in 2015 aimed at improving U.S.-Europol cooperation against foreign fighters and illegal immigration. The United States and the EU collaborate on tracking and stopping terrorist financing, participating in global forums like the United Nations. The United States and the EU cooperate in global forums to suppress terrorist financing and improve financial investigative tools. They benefit from an agreement allowing U.S. access to financial data through SWIFT for the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program, generating leads for EU governments. The US and EU cooperate to combat terrorist financing through the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program, sharing SWIFT data to generate leads for EU governments. This collaboration has helped prevent terrorist attacks in Europe, but ongoing data privacy concerns make the agreement controversial. The EU maintains two lists of terrorist organizations and individuals, one focusing on Al Qaeda and Taliban affiliates and the other on non-affiliated entities. The lists are used to enforce post-9/11 U.N. Security Council sanctions and have been updated to include groups like Jabhat al Nusra, Boko Haram, and ISIS. The EU's \"common terrorist list\" includes over 80 individuals or entities, with law enforcement measures varying based on whether they are considered \"external\" or \"internal\" to the EU. This list has been a subject of controversy and U.S.-EU debate. The EU's \"common terrorist list\" includes over 80 individuals or entities, with law enforcement measures varying based on whether they are considered \"external\" or \"internal\" to the EU. Member states are legally obligated to freeze assets, prevent financial resources, and provide law enforcement assistance for listed individuals and groups. National governments also apply their own sanctions to cut off financing for these entities. The EU's common terrorist list requires unanimous agreement among member states to add or remove individuals or entities. The US and other countries have influenced the EU to include organizations like PKK, FARC, Hamas, and Hezbollah. The US has also added members of ETA based on EU's actions. The EU's common terrorist list requires unanimous agreement among member states to add or remove individuals or entities. The US and other countries have influenced the EU to include organizations like PKK, FARC, Hamas, and Hezbollah. However, there are frictions in fully harmonizing the U.S. and EU terrorist designation lists, with the EU hesitant to add suspected Hamas-related charities due to differing views among member states. Several charities designated by the US as fronts for Hamas, like Interpal, have been investigated by European authorities and cleared of funding terrorist activities. The EU member states have been divided on whether to blacklist charities funding Hamas terrorist activities. The US considers Hezbollah a foreign terrorist organization, but some EU countries, like the UK and the Netherlands, support adding it to the EU's common list, while others, like France, oppose it. Some EU member states, including France, opposed adding Hezbollah to the EU's common list due to concerns about managing relations with Lebanon and Hezbollah's social services in poor communities. However, in 2012-2013, there was a renewed debate within the EU on Hezbollah's terrorist designation, prompted by events and calls from the US and Israel. Calls from the US and Israel prompted renewed debate within the EU to add Hezbollah to its terrorist list, citing events like the 2012 Burgas bombing and Hezbollah's involvement in Syria. EU member states were divided on the issue, with concerns about managing relations with Lebanon and Hezbollah's social services. In late July 2013, the EU added Hezbollah's military wing to its terrorist list, not the entire organization, in a compromise decision. This move aimed to avoid destabilizing Lebanon and maintain dialogue with political parties in the region. The EU added Hezbollah's military wing to its terrorist list in 2013, sending a symbolic message against terrorist attacks. This decision aimed to make Europe a less attractive base for Hezbollah's activities. The EU added Hezbollah's military wing to its terrorist list in 2013 to make Europe less attractive for Hezbollah. Critics argued that only listing the military wing was insufficient as it allowed Hezbollah to fundraise in Europe. The US urged the EU to include Hezbollah on its common terrorist list, especially after Bulgaria implicated Hezbollah in the Burgas bombing in 2013. The Obama Administration called on Europe to uncover Hezbollah's infrastructure and disrupt its financing schemes to prevent future attacks. In response to the Burgas bombing, US officials and Congress urged the EU to designate Hezbollah as a terrorist organization and impose sanctions. The EU eventually added Hezbollah's military wing to its terrorist list, a move welcomed by the US and many Members of Congress. The EU and US view sharing information to disrupt terrorist activity positively, but data privacy remains a key sticking point. EU emphasizes privacy as a human right and has regulations for data protection. EU officials are concerned about US legal protections in information-sharing accords. Some EU officials are worried about the US guaranteeing sufficient protection for European citizens' personal data due to concerns about privacy violations in information-sharing agreements. Unauthorized disclosures of NSA surveillance programs and allegations of US collection activities in Europe have fueled these concerns. The NSA surveillance programs and US collection activities in Europe have raised concerns about data protection and privacy violations. This has strained transatlantic trust and heightened EU worries about U.S. safeguards. Analysts fear for the future of U.S.-EU information-sharing agreements, especially with opposition from MEPs. The European Parliament has previously opposed or demanded changes to accords like SWIFT and the U.S.-EU Passenger Name Record agreement. In July 2013, the European Parliament expressed concerns about U.S. surveillance programs and set up a special working group to investigate. Chaired by Claude Moraes, the group criticized NSA's mass surveillance in the \"Moraes report\" adopted in March 2014. The \"Moraes report\" criticized alleged mass surveillance programs and made recommendations on U.S.-EU security and economic issues, including concerns about the U.S.-EU PNR accord and calls to suspend the SWIFT agreement. It urged the timely conclusion of negotiations on the U.S.-EU Data Privacy and Protection Agreement and called for the U.S. to recognize the privacy rights of EU citizens. The Parliament's resolution on the report is not binding. The European Parliament's resolution on the \"Moraes report\" criticized NSA programs and U.S. spying activities, leading to demands for stronger data protection reforms. The resolution is not binding but carries political weight. In December 2015, political agreement was reached on new data safeguards. In December 2015, the EU reached a political agreement on new data protection rules, expected to be finalized in early 2016. Some U.S. officials and business leaders are concerned about potential obstacles to U.S.-European law enforcement cooperation and burdens on U.S. companies. U.S. officials have reassured EU leaders about surveillance activities operating within U.S. law and oversight. The U.S. aims to address EU concerns and improve transparency to maintain European support for the SWIFT. The EU and US are working to address concerns about NSA surveillance, particularly the PRISM program. A high-level working group was established to assess the proportionality of such programs and their impact on the privacy rights of EU citizens. The European Commission issued a report with recommendations to restore transatlantic trust. In June 2014, U.S. Attorney General Holder announced efforts to conclude the DPPA and work with Congress on legislation to provide EU citizens with redress in U.S. courts for data privacy violations. The Judicial Redress Act was passed in the 114th Congress to address U.S.-EU data flows and restore transatlantic trust. Controversy over Europe's role in the U.S. Terrorist Finance Tracking Program emerged in 2006 after reports of secret access to SWIFT financial data. U.S. officials assured data protection for counterterrorism purposes, obtained data through administrative subpoena, and denied data mining in the program. In 2007, the US and EU agreed to allow US access to SWIFT data for counterterrorism, sparking concerns about EU rights. Changes in SWIFT's systems in 2009 led to a new US-EU agreement for data sharing. In November 2009, the European Parliament rejected the new U.S.-EU SWIFT agreement due to concerns about data privacy rights of EU citizens. In May 2010, MEPs asserted the Parliament's new powers and halted U.S. access to SWIFT data until data privacy and civil liberties concerns were addressed. Negotiations began for a revised U.S.-EU SWIFT agreement to address EP concerns about judicial remedy for European citizens and bulk data transfers. In June 2010, a new draft SWIFT agreement was concluded between U.S. and EU officials. The draft included provisions for legal redress for EU citizens in the U.S. and gave Europol authority over U.S. Treasury Department requests for SWIFT data. Some MEPs were still dissatisfied with certain provisions in the draft. EU and U.S. officials made two additional changes to the draft SWIFT agreement to address concerns raised by some MEPs. The first change involved appointing an independent observer from the European Commission to oversee the extraction of SWIFT data in Washington, DC. The second change required the European Commission to develop plans for a European equivalent to the U.S. TFTP within a year. This \"European TFTP\" would allow the EU to extract SWIFT data on European soil and share targeted results with U.S. authorities, avoiding bulk data transfers. The European Parliament approved the U.S.-EU SWIFT accord on July 8, 2010, allowing targeted results to be sent to U.S. authorities instead of bulk data transfers. The agreement entered into force on August 1, 2010, for five years, with automatic extensions unless notified otherwise. Despite concerns, some MEPs questioned the EU's role in the U.S. TFTP under the SWIFT accord. The European Parliament approved the U.S.-EU SWIFT accord in July 2010, allowing targeted data transfers to U.S. authorities. Concerns were raised about the EU's role in the U.S. TFTP and the implementation of the SWIFT agreement. The European Commission recommended measures to increase transparency in the TFTP, including providing more information to Europol. A second review in December 2012 found that the TFTP had benefits in fighting terrorism and that safeguards were being properly implemented. The European Parliament approved the U.S.-EU SWIFT accord in July 2010, allowing targeted data transfers to U.S. authorities. Concerns were raised about the EU's role in the U.S. TFTP and the implementation of the SWIFT agreement. A second review in December 2012 found that the TFTP had benefits in fighting terrorism and that safeguards were being properly implemented. Unauthorized disclosures since June 2013 of alleged U.S. surveillance activities in Europe have renewed European concerns about how the United States handles the personal data of EU citizens. In October 2013, the European Parliament passed a nonbinding resolution following reports of NSA monitoring activities in EU countries. The European Parliament passed nonbinding resolutions in 2014 calling for the suspension of the U.S.-EU SWIFT accord, but actual suspension would require action from the European Commission and member states. Reviews of the SWIFT data in 2013 and 2014 showed it was valuable in combating terrorism, including during the 2012 London Olympics. The United States and EU reached an agreement in May 2004 allowing airlines to provide passenger data to U.S. authorities within 15 minutes of a flight's departure, to aid in investigating terrorist threats. This PNR accord was controversial in Europe due to privacy concerns. In May 2006, the European Parliament annulled the PNR agreement with the US due to privacy concerns. In July 2007, a new seven-year agreement was reached to transfer PNR data, with US officials pleased with certain provisions. The new PNR agreement between the US and EU included provisions for sharing data with US agencies, extending data storage time, accessing sensitive passenger information, and requiring airlines to send data 72 hours before a flight. The US reduced the number of data fields collected from 34 to 19. The 2007 U.S.-EU PNR agreement faced objections from MEPs over data transfer amounts, data retention periods, and lack of redress for data misuse concerns. Some MEPs feared U.S. authorities could use PNR data for data mining or profiling. Rejection of the agreement would create legal uncertainties. In May 2010, the European Parliament postponed its vote on the 2007 U.S.-EU PNR agreement, calling for a \"global external PNR strategy\" from the European Commission. In September 2010, the Commission issued the strategy, urging renegotiation of PNR agreements with the United States, Australia, and Canada. The strategy emphasized using PNR data exclusively for specific purposes. The Commission's \"external PNR strategy\" emphasizes using PNR data for combating terrorism and serious crimes, providing clear information to passengers, limiting data exchange categories, and retaining data for the shortest time necessary. The European Parliament endorsed this strategy in November 2010. The European Parliament endorsed the Commission's PNR strategy and supported new negotiations with the United States. They stressed the need for PNR data exchange to be necessary and proportional, without data mining or profiling. The Obama Administration agreed to discuss adjustments to the PNR accord in recognition of the EP's concerns. U.S.-EU negotiations for a revised PNR accord began in December 2010. U.S.-EU negotiations for a revised PNR accord began in December 2010, with U.S. officials emphasizing the need to protect data and privacy rights. They insisted on maintaining operational effectiveness and not invalidating existing bilateral PNR deals with EU member states. In mid-May 2011, resolutions supporting the existing 2007 U.S.-EU PNR accord were passed in the House and Senate, urging DHS to reject any EU efforts to modify the agreement. In late May 2011, the U.S. and European Commission concluded negotiations on a revised PNR agreement with new provisions to enhance passenger data protection. The May 2011 agreement introduced new provisions to enhance passenger data protection, including depersonalizing and masking portions of a passenger's record after six months, decreasing storage time of PNR data, and restricting access to authorized personnel. It provided legal certainty on passenger rights to redress and ensured that the US would not deny boarding based solely on automated processing of PNR data. It also allowed for consultation if the EU developed its own PNR system in the future. Despite revisions to the U.S.-EU PNR agreement in May 2011, some MEPs were still unsatisfied. They raised concerns about the United States retaining passenger data for up to 15 years, no reduction in data transferred, and an increased requirement for airlines to transmit data to U.S. authorities 96 hours before a flight. Some MEPs raised concerns about the new U.S.-EU PNR agreement, worrying that it broadened the use of PNR data for more criminal offenses than before. In October 2011, the House Homeland Security Committee's Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence discussed the negotiations on the agreement, with U.S. officials stating that the May 2011 draft was stronger and addressed all EU concerns. In November 2011, a new draft PNR agreement was concluded between the United States and the EU, addressing concerns raised by the EU regarding data security, offenses covered, and passenger rights. The European Commission stated that the new agreement contained \"real improvements\" over the previous version leaked in May. Additional changes were made to limit the use of PNR data to terrorist or serious transnational crimes, in response to EU demands. The new U.S.-EU PNR agreement, approved in December 2011, limits the use of PNR data to terrorist or serious transnational crimes. Data retention time varies based on the type of crime, with up to 15 years for terrorist investigations and 10 years for other crimes. Germany and Austria abstained from approval due to concerns about data retention and redress provisions. Some MEPs also criticized the changes as largely cosmetic. The November 2011 PNR accord faced criticism for being largely cosmetic, but some MEPs supported it for stronger data protection guarantees compared to the 2007 version. Despite concerns about data privacy safeguards, MEPs voted for the agreement to provide airlines with legal certainty. The full Parliament approved the U.S.-EU PNR agreement on April 19, 2012. The U.S.-EU PNR agreement was approved by the full Parliament on April 19, 2012, with strong support. It reaffirmed the commitment to countering terrorism while protecting privacy and civil rights. The agreement was officially adopted by the EU on April 26, 2012, and entered into force on August 8, 2012, valid for seven years with the option to renew for another seven years. In November 2013, the European Commission published the results of a U.S.-EU joint review of the PNR program, affirming its effectiveness in fighting terrorism and serious crimes. However, concerns about U.S. data protection safeguards have been raised by some MEPs following allegations of surveillance activities. The Parliament's March 2014 resolution called for further scrutiny of the PNR program. The Parliament's March 2014 resolution urged the European Commission to address concerns about the protection of PNR data in cloud systems on U.S. soil. U.S. and EU leaders see information-sharing agreements like SWIFT and PNR as crucial in combating terrorism. Washington has sought an umbrella agreement with the EU to streamline negotiations on data privacy. The EU and U.S. aimed to establish an umbrella agreement to simplify future data-sharing accords in law enforcement. In 2009, the European Parliament called for a framework agreement to protect personal data in counterterrorism efforts. The European Commission proposed a draft mandate in 2010 for negotiating such an accord to apply to all U.S.-EU data-sharing agreements in law enforcement. The Commission hoped this deal would bridge differences in privacy application between the U.S. and EU. The EU and U.S. aimed to establish an umbrella agreement to simplify future data-sharing accords in law enforcement. In 2010, the European Commission proposed a mandate for negotiating a Data Privacy and Protection Agreement (DPPA) to bridge privacy differences between the U.S. and EU. This agreement would not provide the legal basis for data transfer but would ensure high standards of protection on both sides of the Atlantic. The U.S. and EU aimed to establish a Data Privacy and Protection Agreement (DPPA) to protect personal information in law enforcement. U.S. officials hoped for mutual recognition of data protection systems, leading to an EU finding of \"adequacy\" for U.S. data protection standards. The DPPA would likely build on common data protection principles adopted in 2009. In October 2009, the United States and the EU adopted data protection principles. By June 2012, negotiations for a Data Privacy and Protection Agreement (DPPA) had made progress on data security, transparency, and oversight. However, issues like purpose limitation and redress remained contentious. EU officials pushed for judicial redress rights for European citizens in the U.S. Privacy Act of 1974. The negotiations for a Data Privacy and Protection Agreement (DPPA) between the United States and the EU were stalled due to the lack of judicial redress rights for EU citizens in the U.S. Privacy Act. However, the revelations of U.S. surveillance activities in June 2013 injected renewed momentum into the discussions. In July 2013, MEPs urged the EU and U.S. to resume DPPA negotiations for transatlantic trust. The \"Moraes report\" in March 2014 emphasized the need for judicial redress rights for EU citizens in U.S. legislation. In June 2014, the Obama Administration committed to seeking legislation to conclude DPPA negotiations. The Obama Administration is dedicated to ensuring EU citizens have the same rights as U.S. citizens regarding personal information protection under the proposed DPPA. This decision aims to restore EU trust in U.S. data privacy commitments. The DPPA was finalized by U.S. and EU negotiators on September 8, 2015, but the EU delayed signing until U.S. judicial redress legislation was passed. In response, H.R. 1428 and S. 1600 were introduced to extend judicial redress provisions to citizens of covered countries. The Judicial Redress Act extends privacy protections to citizens of covered countries or regional organizations with agreements with the U.S. The Act gained importance after the EU invalidated the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Agreement allowing data transfer between European and U.S. companies. The CJEU invalidated the Safe Harbor Agreement due to inadequate data protection and lack of judicial remedies for EU citizens in the U.S. The Judicial Redress Act aimed to address European concerns and strengthen confidence in the new Privacy Shield agreement. The new \"Privacy Shield,\" agreed upon by U.S. and EU negotiators on February 2, 2016, aims to replace Safe Harbor. However, concerns remain about the scope of judicial redress in the U.S. legislation and its equivalence to EU standards. H.R. 1428 passed the House on October 20, 2015, and was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee on January 28, 2016. The Senate Judiciary Committee approved H.R. 1428 on January 28, 2016, with an amendment by Senator John Cornyn. The amendment specified that the Judicial Redress Act would only apply to countries that allow data transfer to the U.S. without impeding national security interests. This provision may have influenced the U.S.-EU Privacy Shield agreement. The Judicial Redress Act, as amended, was signed into law on February 24, 2016 (P.L. 114-126). The EU welcomed the act's enactment, stating it will pave the way for the U.S.-EU DPPA signature. EU member states and the European Parliament must approve the DPPA for it to enter into force. Parliament approval needed for DPPA to enter force, process may take months. US and EU cooperate on border control, aviation, and maritime security. Emphasis on international information exchanges and biometric identifiers for travel document security. In January 2010, the United States and the EU pledged to strengthen aviation security measures worldwide. In October 2010, U.S.-EU collaboration led to an ICAO declaration on aviation security. They have also worked together to improve cargo and supply chain security. In June 2011, they reaffirmed their commitment to bolster supply chain security and global cooperation. Since 2001, the US and EU have implemented measures to enhance aviation security. Recent incidents have reignited discussions on improving air cargo security, such as the 2009 airliner bombing attempt and subsequent thwarted attacks. Both parties aim to strike a balance between border security and facilitating transatlantic travel and commerce. The US and EU have implemented measures to enhance aviation security since 2001. Recent incidents, such as the 2009 airliner bombing attempt and the thwarted Yemen bomb plot in 2010, have led to tighter rules for carrying electronic devices on international U.S.-bound flights. This highlights the ongoing terrorist threat to aviation. Since 2001, the US and EU have worked closely to address the terrorist threat to aviation, coordinating on regulations for transatlantic flights. In 2003, there were objections to US rules on armed air marshals, leading to consideration of alternative measures. In 2008, an agreement was reached on coordinating air cargo security measures. The US and EU agreed to implement cargo security measures to ensure the security of all cargo on passenger flights between their territories, in compliance with the 9/11 Commission Act. In 2012, they reached an agreement on an air cargo security partnership to recognize each other's security regimes and eliminate duplication of controls. The US and EU have agreed to mutually recognize each other's air cargo security regimes to enhance cargo security, save time and money for operators, and improve transatlantic shipments. They will also exchange information on the evolution and implementation of their security regimes. The US and EU have agreed to mutually recognize each other's air cargo security regimes to meet the U.S. requirement for 100% cargo screening on passenger planes bound for the United States. Despite shared commitment, some differences in perspective remain, with the US accelerating body scanner installations post-2009 attack and encouraging the EU to follow suit. The European Parliament approved the use of body scanners at EU airports in July 2011, with safeguards in place to protect passenger privacy and health. Scans must only produce stick figure images, not body images, and x-ray scans are banned in favor of millimeter wave scans. Passengers have the right to opt for the use of scanners. The European Parliament approved the voluntary use of body scanners at EU airports in July 2011, with safeguards in place to protect passenger privacy and health. In November 2011, the European Commission adopted common standards for body scanners, but member states are not required to deploy them. Some European officials have concerns about body scanners at U.S. airports, but in January 2013, the TSA announced the removal of full-body scanners. The TSA will remove full-body scanners producing revealing images by June 2013, keeping scanners with generic body images using millimeter wave technology. Concerns about privacy violations led to this decision, while U.S. officials are also monitoring changes to EU regulations on carry-on liquids and gels. The EU plans to eliminate restrictions on liquids in cabin baggage by April 2013, following the introduction of liquid screening equipment in all EU airports. This change aims to harmonize the small amounts of travel-sized liquids and gels permitted in carry-on baggage to minimize inconvenience for international travelers. In April 2013, the EU postponed its deadline to eliminate restrictions on liquids and gels in carry-on baggage due to concerns about airline security and potential flight delays. U.S. policymakers also questioned the effectiveness of current liquid-screening technology. In January 2014, the EU began lifting restrictions on liquids and gels in cabin baggage, aiming to end all restrictions by January 2016. The US and EU signed a customs cooperation accord in April 2004, including extending the US Container Security Initiative throughout the EU to screen maritime cargo for dangerous substances. In May 2012, the US and EU agreed to recognize each other's trusted shipper programs to improve supply chain security and trade opportunities. This mutual recognition accord aims to speed up customs procedures for trusted traders designated by C-TPAT or AEO programs. The US and EU agreed to recognize each other's trusted shipper programs in May 2012 to improve supply chain security and trade opportunities. This mutual recognition accord aims to speed up customs procedures for trusted traders but also allows customs authorities to focus on risky consignments and facilitate legitimate transatlantic trade. Recent tensions over a provision in the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 have receded, as EU officials found 100% container scanning unrealistic and costly. US policymakers shared concerns about the effectiveness and financial burden of this requirement. In May 2012, the US Department of Homeland Security extended the 100% scanning deadline by two years, with an additional two-year extension announced in June 2014. Proponents argue for full implementation despite concerns about cost and effectiveness, as existing programs already target high-risk cargo for inspection. The manifest data used by U.S. and European authorities to assess container risk is inadequate. Tensions have arisen between the U.S. and EU over the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) and its application to all member states. New EU members sought to join the VWP after 2004 enlargement but faced exclusion due to not meeting requirements. The EU argued for equal visa-free privileges for U.S. citizens in all member states. The EU argued for full visa reciprocity with the U.S., citing concerns about security in the Visa Waiver Program. Some Members of Congress supported extending the program to new EU members, while others were skeptical post-9/11 due to security issues. In July 2007, Congress passed the Implementing Recommendations. In July 2007, Congress passed the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-53) to strengthen the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) by enhancing security measures and expanding eligibility for EU members and other interested countries. The changes included requirements for VWP countries to meet security and passport standards, share information agreements, and submit biographical information through ESTA for visitors entering the U.S. The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-53) strengthened the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) by allowing the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to waive admission requirements for new EU member states. Currently, 23 out of 28 EU member states are part of the VWP, with efforts to include Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Poland, and Romania. In January 2014, a revised EU reciprocity mechanism aimed to achieve full visa reciprocity with the United States and other countries. Under new EU rules, visa-free travel for citizens of certain third countries may be suspended if there is no full visa reciprocity. The European Commission is actively assessing this with the United States and other countries every six months. The Visa Waiver Program is a key reason for U.S. officials' concerns. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) is a concern for U.S. officials due to reports of Europeans fighting in Syria and Iraq. The Obama Administration supports the VWP for transatlantic commerce and tourism, but has implemented enhanced security measures for VWP travelers. The Obama Administration implemented enhanced security measures for VWP countries after the Paris attacks in November 2015. These measures included capturing information on past travel to terrorist safe havens and strengthening security controls. The Obama Administration implemented enhanced security measures for VWP countries after the Paris attacks in November 2015, including capturing information on past travel to terrorist safe havens. In mid-December 2015, Congress passed legislation to further enhance VWP security by prohibiting travel to Syria, Iraq, Iran, or Sudan. The new legislation prohibits individuals who have traveled to Syria, Iraq, Iran, or Sudan after March 1, 2011, from entering the United States under the VWP. They must now obtain a visitor visa at a U.S. consulate abroad. Additionally, all VWP participant countries must issue electronic passports and implement enhanced security measures. In 2016, DHS expanded VWP travel restrictions to include Libya, Somalia, and Yemen for individuals who traveled there since March 1, 2011. The restrictions do not apply to dual nationals of these countries. EU officials are concerned about the new requirements, arguing they could create a de facto visa regime and discriminate against dual nationals. European policymakers doubt the effectiveness of the legislation, fearing it will impact European citizens who traveled to these countries for legitimate reasons. The new law provides exemptions for government and military personnel and grants the Secretary of DHS authority to waive exclusion from the VWP for individuals on a case-by-case basis, including journalists and humanitarian workers. EU leaders have warned about possible reciprocal measures regarding visa-free travel to Europe for U.S. citizens. Some Members of Congress are concerned about potential discrimination in the new VWP legislation related to dual nationals. Bills introduced by Representative Justin Amash and Senator Jeff Flake aim to eliminate these restrictions. This could prevent the EU from imposing reciprocal visa requirements on U.S. citizens. The EU may impose reciprocal visa requirements on U.S. citizens for short-term travel to Europe, raising concerns about civil liberties and human rights standards. Tensions between the U.S. and Europe have been fueled by the treatment of suspected terrorist detainees, including criticism of U.S. policies such as the detention facility at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. The European media focused on the U.S. detention facility at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, plans to try enemy combatants before military commissions, and the use of \"enhanced interrogation techniques.\" The practice of \"extraordinary rendition\" and possible CIA detention facilities in Europe also drew attention and led to investigations by European authorities. Some detainees at Guant\u00e1namo and those subjected to U.S. rendition were European citizens or residents, sparking concerns among European leaders and analysts. Many European leaders and analysts criticized U.S. detainee and interrogation policies as breaching international and European law, degrading human rights values, and hindering efforts to win Muslim support against terrorism. The Bush Administration defended these policies as crucial in fighting terrorism and denied violating human rights commitments. The Bush Administration defended U.S. detainee and interrogation policies as crucial in fighting terrorism, despite European criticism. The Obama Administration aimed to close Guant\u00e1namo and banned torture, easing U.S.-EU frictions over detainee policies. The U.S. State Department appointed a special envoy in 2009 to work on closing the detention facility at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, persuading countries to accept detainees cleared for release. Some EU members accepted released detainees, but others declined, posing challenges for the Obama Administration's efforts to close Guant\u00e1namo. The Obama Administration faced obstacles in closing Guant\u00e1namo due to congressional opposition and reluctance from other countries to accept detainees. In 2011, President Obama signed an executive order allowing indefinite detention for detainees not charged or convicted. The Obama Administration faced challenges in closing Guant\u00e1namo due to congressional opposition and international reluctance to accept detainees. In 2011, indefinite detention was allowed for those not charged or convicted. European concerns about Guantanamo's impact on terrorism recruitment and detainee well-being were also raised. In 2013, the European Parliament urged the US to close the facility due to hunger strikes. The Obama Administration continues efforts to close Guant\u00e1namo, facing challenges from Congress. In 2013, Congress eased restrictions on transferring low-risk detainees. President Obama signed the bill but urged lifting other restrictions preventing transfers to U.S. prisons for trial. The Obama Administration has been working to close Guant\u00e1namo, despite facing challenges from Congress. In February 2016, President Obama submitted a plan to Congress to shut down the facility before the end of his term. Out of nearly 800 detainees at Guant\u00e1namo since 2002, 147 have been resettled overseas during the Obama Administration, with 91 detainees remaining as of February 2016. As of February 2016, 91 detainees remain at Guant\u00e1namo, with 35 cleared for transfer. European concerns persist regarding the past involvement of European governments in U.S. detainee policies. The European Parliament has investigated the role of EU member states in hosting CIA detention facilities and aiding CIA flights for terrorism suspects. EU member states have been urged to fully investigate the existence of CIA detention facilities on their territories. The European Parliament has called for investigations into CIA detention facilities on their territories and urged the United States to cooperate with requests for information on rendition flights. The European Parliament has called for investigations into CIA detention facilities on their territories and urged the United States to cooperate with requests for information on rendition flights. Some U.S. and European officials are concerned about allegations of U.S. wrongdoing and criminal proceedings against CIA officers in EU states, which could jeopardize U.S.-European intelligence cooperation against terrorism. Successive U.S. Administrations and Members of Congress have supported enhancing U.S.-EU cooperation against terrorism since the 2001 attacks. The George W. Bush Administration prioritized U.S.-EU collaboration on police and judicial matters after the 2001 attacks, despite initial concerns about weakening bilateral relationships with EU member states. Improved cooperation aimed to enhance border controls, transport security, and tracking of suspected terrorists to prevent their entry into the U.S. or sanctuary in Europe. Observers note that U.S.-EU counterterrorism cooperation is complicated by different EU and member state competencies and policy preferences. Policy areas like data protection, customs, and visas fall under the EU's competence, leading to occasional frictions in the relationship. Despite tensions, collaboration continues. The U.S.-EU relationship can face frictions due to disconnect, but both are committed to closer cooperation in counterterrorism, law enforcement, border controls, and transport security. Cooperation against terrorism is crucial in combating threats from European and American citizens fighting with Islamist groups. Aviation and cargo security, U.S. border control measures, and visa policy are key issues for Congress. In the 113th and 114th Congresses, hearings focused on threats from Western foreign fighters in Syria and Iraq. Congress passed the Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015 to strengthen security controls. Congressional decisions on intelligence reforms and data privacy may also impact U.S.-EU cooperation. Possible changes to U.S. surveillance laws will be closely monitored in Europe, with EU officials welcoming the U.S. Judicial Redress Act as a positive step towards enhancing U.S.-EU data privacy agreements. This could help rebuild trust in transatlantic information-sharing arrangements. The European Parliament's influence in counterterrorism areas has been growing, with Members of Congress potentially shaping its views. Efforts by some Members of Congress to engage in dialogue on U.S. surveillance operations were appreciated by European Parliamentarians. Representative Jim Sensenbrenner testified before the European Parliament in November 2013 on possible changes to U.S. surveillance legislation. In late 2013, Senator Chris Murphy and Representative Mike Rogers led congressional delegations to Europe to discuss alleged U.S. intelligence activities with European officials and reaffirm the importance of U.S.-European relations. Some Members of Congress maintain contacts with European Parliament counterparts. The Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue (TLD) facilitates discussions between members of the European Parliament and the U.S. House of Representatives twice a year on foreign policy and economic issues. There is interest in strengthening ties between the two bodies to enhance dialogue on counterterrorism issues."
