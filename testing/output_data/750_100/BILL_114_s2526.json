The Act establishes a program to improve US manufacturing competitiveness by designating and supporting manufacturing communities. The Act establishes a program to support designated manufacturing communities by providing preferential consideration for financial or technical assistance to consortium members under subsection (c). The Act establishes a program to support designated manufacturing communities by providing preferential consideration for financial or technical assistance to consortium members under subsection (c). The participating agencies for the program include the Department of Agriculture. The Act establishes a program to support designated manufacturing communities by providing preferential consideration for financial or technical assistance to consortium members. Participating agencies include the Department of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Housing and Urban Development, Labor, Transportation, Appalachian Regional Commission, Delta Regional Authority, and Environmental Protection Agency. The participating agencies in the program established under subsection (b) include the Environmental Protection Agency, National Science Foundation, and Small Business Administration. The head of each participating agency must identify applicable programs for the program. The participating program includes agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency, National Science Foundation, and Small Business Administration. The head of each agency must identify relevant programs for the initiative. Multiple members of the same consortium may seek financial or technical assistance, with the agency head determining preference. The consortium must determine preference among its members for financial or technical assistance. If multiple members are eligible for preference, they may need to show coordination. The consortium members must coordinate in developing their applications for financial or technical assistance. The head of each agency must submit a report on how preferential consideration will be given. The Secretary may provide a Federal point of contact for designated manufacturing communities. Under subsection (d), a Federal point of contact assists consortium members in accessing Federal funds and technical assistance. The head of a participating agency may award financial or technical assistance to a designated manufacturing community as appropriate for the program and economic development strategy. The consortium members can receive financial or technical assistance to support investments in ecosystems that enhance US manufacturing competitiveness. This assistance can be used for various investments outlined in the program. The consortium members can receive assistance for investments in infrastructure, access to capital, exports promotion, equipment upgrades, workforce training, energy efficiency, business incubators, site preparation, and advanced research. The Secretary of Commerce coordinates with participating agencies to identify programs and agencies coordinate with each other to leverage complementary activities. The Secretary of Commerce coordinates with participating agencies to identify programs and avoid duplication of efforts. The Secretary designates eligible consortiums as manufacturing communities through a competitive process. Eligible consortiums represent a region defined by the consortium. The Secretary of Commerce designates eligible consortiums as manufacturing communities through a competitive process. Consortiums must include institutions of higher education, private sector entities, and government entities. Private sector partners, institutions of higher education, government entities, and economic development may also be included. The Secretary of Commerce designates eligible consortiums as manufacturing communities through a competitive process. Consortiums must include institutions of higher education, private sector entities, government entities, economic development, community and labor groups, financial institutions, utilities, district organizations, and Indian tribes. The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act allows for entities such as Indian tribes, States, political subdivisions, and consortiums to be involved in economic or infrastructure development activities. Entities such as Indian tribes, States, political subdivisions, consortiums, and nonprofit organizations can participate in economic or infrastructure development activities. A consortium can define the region it represents with approval from the Secretary. Each designation under paragraph (1) shall be for a period of 2 years and can be renewed upon receipt of an application. The region defined by a consortium should be large enough to contain critical elements of key technologies or supply chain and small enough to enable close collaboration among members. Upon receipt of an application, the Secretary may renew a designation made under paragraph (1) for a period of 2 years. An eligible consortium seeking renewal shall submit an application containing required information. The Secretary is authorized to make modifications as necessary. The Secretary may renew a designation for an eligible consortium that has changed its composition or submitted a revision to the plan. Evaluation for renewal is based on certain criteria. To renew a designation of an eligible consortium, the Secretary assesses performance against previous terms and post-designation awards, as well as progress on proposed project-specific metrics. The consortium's application for recent designation is evaluated based on metrics to track progress. Potential changes to consortium composition or strategy may enhance competitiveness. An eligible consortium seeking a designation under paragraph (1) must submit an application to the Secretary with specified contents and criteria. The application for designation by an eligible consortium must include a description of regional boundaries and manufacturing concentration, along with a competitive ranking nationally based on employment and sales. The application for designation by an eligible consortium must include a description of regional boundaries and manufacturing concentration, along with a competitive ranking nationally based on employment and sales. An integrated assessment of the local industrial ecosystem of the region of the consortium is also required, which may include workforce and training, supplier network, research and innovation, infrastructure or site development, trade and international investment, operational improvements, and capital access components needed. The curr_chunk discusses the need for an evidence-based plan to develop components of the manufacturing ecosystem in a specific region selected by a consortium. This plan includes making specific investments to address gaps in the ecosystem and making the region uniquely competitive. The consortium proposes investments and an implementation strategy to address ecosystem gaps. Outcome-based metrics and evaluation methods will track performance in improving manufacturing. The consortium aims to enhance manufacturing in the region through investments and an implementation strategy. The Secretary will evaluate applications based on regional cooperation and national manufacturing competitiveness. The consortium designated as a manufacturing community by the Secretary before the enactment of the Act will be recognized as such under this subsection if still designated as part of the initiative. The Secretary may accept transferred funds from another agency to carry out this section."
