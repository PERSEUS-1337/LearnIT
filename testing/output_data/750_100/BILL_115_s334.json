    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Fracturing Regulations are Effective in State Hands Act\". Congress acknowledges that hydraulic fracturing has been a widely used practice in the United States for over 60 years in numerous wells. The Ground Water Protection Council, a respected organization of State water regulators, has confirmed in a report that current State regulations for oil and gas activities are proactive in protecting water resources. The 2004 EPA study found no evidence of drinking water contamination from hydraulic fracturing of coalbed methane reservoirs. The 2009 report by the Ground Water Protection Council highlighted state regulations designed to protect water resources in oil and gas activities. The 2009 report by the Ground Water Protection Council found no evidence of groundwater contamination associated with hydraulic fracturing, stating that states have comprehensive laws and regulations to ensure safe operations and protect drinking water. In 2011, Lisa Jackson, the Administrator of the EPA, testified that there were no proven cases of fracking affecting water. Bureau of Land Management Director Bob Abbey also stated that there was no evidence of adverse effects from the chemicals used in fracking technology. Activities related to hydraulic fracturing, such as surface discharges and air emissions, are under scrutiny. The hydraulic fracturing process is not included in the underground injection control program of the Safe Drinking Water Act, although other environmental regulations cover surface discharges, wastewater disposal, and air emissions at the Federal level. In 2011, the Secretary of the Interior announced plans for new Federal regulations on hydraulic fracturing on Federal land. A 2012 study by the Energy Institute at the University of Texas found no evidence of chemicals from hydraulic fracturing fluid in aquifers. The Ground Water Protection Council and State Oil and Gas Regulatory Exchange released a report in 2014 describing State-based oil and gas regulations that have substantially improved groundwater protection laws in step with industry growth. The term \"Federal land\" in this Act includes public lands, National Forest System land, Bureau of Reclamation land, and Corps of Engineers land. State authority is also addressed in the Act. The State has sole authority over regulations for well treatment using fluids under pressure with propping agents to enhance oil, gas, or geothermal production. Federal land is subject to similar regulations. The State has sole authority over regulations for well treatment using fluids under pressure with propping agents to enhance oil, gas, or geothermal production on Federal land."
