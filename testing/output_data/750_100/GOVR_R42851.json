    "content": "The PACT Act requires remote retailers of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to pay state and local taxes before delivering the goods. Three retailers are challenging the Act, claiming it violates the Due Process Clause. The Supreme Court in Quill Corp. v. North Dakota emphasized the need for a connection between a state and the transaction being taxed. In Red Earth LLC v. United States and Gordon v. Holder, federal district courts granted preliminary injunctions concluding that the PACT Act's requirement for remote retailers to pay state and local taxes violates due process by not requiring minimum contacts. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the preliminary injunction in Red Earth. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the preliminary injunction in Red Earth, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit will consider the preliminary injunction in Gordon on appeal. In Musser's Inc. v. United States, the federal district court rejected the due process argument related to the PACT Act, stating it is just a federal statute requiring compliance with state and local laws. The court found that the plaintiff had minimum contacts with the jurisdictions it shipped to. The plaintiff had minimum contacts with jurisdictions where it shipped tobacco products through its interactive website. The constitutionality of the PACT Act may depend on what constitutes minimum contacts for remote retailers. Congress may not be able to require remote retailers to pay taxes to jurisdictions without minimum contacts. The constitutionality of the PACT Act hinges on defining minimum contacts for remote retailers, as determined by the Supreme Court in Quill. Minimum contacts are based on purposeful availment of an economic market in the forum state and must be rationally related to the taxing state's values. The PACT Act requires states to give something in return for taxes collected on remote sales of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. It aims to enforce laws on remote sellers, increase tax collection, deter smuggling, and limit youth access to cheap tobacco products by deeming interstate sales as intrastate sales. The PACT Act requires delivery sellers to comply with state laws for sales of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco as if sales occurred within the specific state. Sellers must pay all applicable taxes and meet legal requirements before delivery. State and local taxes must be paid on sales of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, with required stamps to indicate payment. State taxation of out-of-state businesses is governed by the Commerce Clause and Due Process Clause, ensuring taxes do not unduly burden interstate commerce and are only imposed if there is a sufficient connection to the state. The PACT Act is being challenged by remote retailers under the Due Process Clause, which is governed by the Supreme Court's opinion in Quill. The Court considered whether out-of-state retailers could be required to collect use tax on merchandise sold in a state. The Supreme Court upheld the state's ability to collect use tax from out-of-state retailers, stating that physical presence is not necessary to establish minimum contacts for taxation purposes. This decision was based on the Court's previous ruling in Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz regarding jurisdiction over out-of-state defendants. The Supreme Court ruled that physical presence is not required for establishing minimum contacts for taxation purposes, especially in cases where business is conducted solely through mail and wire communications across state lines. Personal jurisdiction can still be established if a commercial actor's efforts are purposefully directed towards residents of another State, even without physical presence. The Supreme Court's ruling in Quill established that physical presence is not necessary for personal jurisdiction in taxation cases. The key factor is whether the out-of-state business has purposefully directed its activities at the taxing state, giving fair warning of tax liability. In Red Earth, Seneca Nation members operate tobacco retail businesses that advertise in the state. The Seneca Nation of Indians, who own tobacco retail businesses, sought an injunction against the PACT Act's tax requirements. They argued that the Act violates due process by subjecting them to state taxes without minimum contacts. The US contended that the Act satisfied minimum contacts through the plaintiffs' online advertising. The plaintiffs argued that maintaining websites and shipping goods into taxing jurisdictions satisfied minimum contacts for the PACT Act. However, the district court rejected these arguments, noting that not all plaintiffs have websites and that the websites are considered \"passive\" virtual catalogs. The court ruled that a passive website alone does not establish minimum contacts for the PACT Act, and rejected the argument that shipping goods into a state satisfies this requirement. The court rejected the idea that a single sale creates enough contacts to impose tax collection duties on an out-of-state seller, citing that existing cases suggest otherwise. The court found that a single sale may not satisfy the minimum contacts requirement, as opposed to multiple cases holding that it does not. This contrasts with the ruling that a passive website or shipping goods into a state alone does not establish minimum contacts for the PACT Act. The Supreme Court in Quill would likely have based its decision on the defendant's sale into the state instead of the defendant's \"continuous and widespread solicitation of business\" within North Dakota. The court found that a single sale may not satisfy the minimum contacts requirement, as opposed to multiple cases holding that it does not. Congress is broadening the jurisdictional reach of each state and locality without regard to the constraints imposed by the Due Process Clause. The PACT Act seeks to eliminate the due process requirement, leading to a legal challenge. The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld a preliminary injunction against the Act, questioning Congress's ability to mandate vendors to submit to any state's taxing jurisdiction regardless of their level of contact with the state. The court upheld the preliminary injunction against the PACT Act, which requires sellers to collect state and local taxes based on one delivery. The Supreme Court has not definitively ruled on whether a single sale satisfies due process requirements. When the constitutional question is uncertain, a court should uphold the injunction and allow for a trial on the merits. The district court upheld the preliminary injunction against the PACT Act, which requires sellers to collect state and local taxes based on one delivery. The plaintiff in Musser's sought an injunction on the ground that the Act violates the Due Process Clause. The district court denied the injunction under two alternative analyses. The district court denied the injunction under two alternative analyses, rejecting the Red Earth district court's analysis and emphasizing that the tax-payment requirement is imposed by Congress, not by a state unilaterally. Congress has long required interstate businesses to comply with state and local laws in regulating interstate commerce. Pharmacies, farmers, and distributors of explosives must comply with state and local laws as required by Congress for the sale of their products. Federal requirements do not violate due process, as Congress has authority over interstate commerce. The court's analysis may be seen as mixing Congress's Commerce Clause authority with the issue of state taxation. The court concluded that the plaintiff had minimum contacts in all 50 states due to the interactive nature of its website, using the sliding scale approach developed in Zippo Mfg. Co. v. Zippo Dot Com, Inc. for determining personal jurisdiction over internet-based businesses. The court determines personal jurisdiction over internet-based businesses based on the level of interactivity and commercial nature of the exchange of information on the website. The court concluded that a website facilitating online orders and payments to deliver products across states establishes sufficient contacts for due process concerns. Minimum contacts can be met with a single sale through an interactive website. Gordon, a member of the Seneca Nation of Indians, owns a store and a telephone order business selling cigarettes and tobacco products. He sought a preliminary injunction against the PACT Act's requirement to pay state and local taxes for products sent to other jurisdictions, arguing it violates due process by not requiring minimum contacts. Initially denied, Gordon appealed the decision. The district court denied Gordon's motion as untimely, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit reversed and remanded the case, stating that the motion was timely. The Court of Appeals highlighted that Due Process and Commerce Clause violations should be considered separately, even when Congress authorizes state levies based on minimum contacts. The Quill case did not address excise taxes, leaving open the question of whether national authorization of state levies on e-commerce makes concerns about presence and burden irrelevant. The government argued that Gordon only needed minimum contacts with the United States, not individual states, in response to his due process claim. The government argued that Gordon only needed minimum contacts with the United States, not individual states, in response to his due process claim. It cited Supreme Court cases to support its argument, stating that Gordon's tobacco sales into a state satisfy minimum contacts with that state. The court discussed the PACT Act imposing a new duty on delivery sellers to ensure state and local taxes are paid, citing the U.S. Court of Appeals' rejection of Congress's power to authorize violations of the Due Process Clause. The court reviewed the PACT Act challenge, comparing it to federal statutes and addressing the government's argument on minimum contacts based on due process cases like International Shoe Co. v. Washington. The court discussed the issue of personal jurisdiction, citing Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz to emphasize the importance of minimum contacts with the jurisdiction for a lawsuit to proceed. The court highlighted that jurisdiction is proper when the defendant's actions create a substantial connection with the forum State. The defendant's deliberate engagement in significant activities within a State or creating continuing obligations with residents of the forum establishes jurisdiction. A single act creating a substantial connection with the forum supports jurisdiction, while acts with only an attenuated affiliation are insufficient. The Supreme Court emphasized that for a defendant to be haled into court in a specific forum, their conduct and connection with that forum must make it reasonably foreseeable. This focus on foreseeability provides predictability to the legal system, allowing defendants to structure their actions with some assurance of where they may be held liable. The district court discussed Quill's due process challenge, stating that a definite link is required between a state and the person, property, or transaction it seeks to tax. Quill's mail order business had minimum contacts with North Dakota sufficient to meet the due process requirement. The district court found that Quill had sufficient contacts with North Dakota to meet the due process requirement, but the standard was not met in Gordon's case. Gordon's business did not purposefully avail itself of the benefits of the economic market in the states where it sold products. Even if a single sale in a state could establish a minimum connection, it was not the case here. The district court did not find a rational connection between the tax on Gordon's products and the benefits provided by the state. It is unclear what protection or benefits Gordon receives from the state where he delivers his products. The court found that the PACT Act may violate due process as it allows state taxation of out-of-state businesses, potentially subjecting them to state laws that violate the Commerce Clause. The PACT Act may not comply with the Due Process Clause as it could allow state taxation of out-of-state businesses without minimum contacts. The courts have analyzed its constitutionality under the Due Process Clause, questioning if it authorizes state taxation of retailers lacking minimum contacts with the taxing jurisdiction. The opinion in Musser's may have mixed up the Commerce Clause and due process analyses, but it remains uncertain how higher courts will interpret the due process implications of the PACT Act. Higher courts may question if a single sale into a jurisdiction satisfies the due process requirement of minimum contacts, as noted in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit's review of the preliminary injunction in Red Earth."
