    "content": "Child nutrition programs, such as the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program, provide food to children in institutional settings. Other programs like the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program and Special Milk Program offer support for healthy snacks and milk in schools. Additionally, the Child and Adult Care Food Program provides meals and snacks in child care settings. The Child and Adult Care Food Program and the Summer Food Service Program provide meals in child care and after-school settings. The child nutrition programs were last reauthorized by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010. Some authorities expired in 2015, but program operations continued with funding from annual appropriations acts. Lawmakers in the 114th Congress began but did not complete child nutrition reauthorization. Nutrition reauthorization involves potentially changing permanent statutes related to child nutrition programs. Legislation for reauthorization (S. 3136 and H.R. 5003) in the 114th Congress did not pass both chambers. No significant child nutrition reauthorization efforts were made in the 115th Congress. The 115th Congress saw no significant child nutrition reauthorization efforts, but the 2018 farm bill included provisions related to child nutrition programs. Issues raised during the 114th Congress and 2018 farm bill negotiations, such as food quality and sourcing, may impact future reauthorization efforts or policymaking. The report provides an overview of current issues in child nutrition programs, including food quality, sourcing, access to summer meals, and the Community Eligibility Provision. Stakeholders involved in these issues include school food authorities, advocacy organizations, and food industry groups. The report highlights recent issues raised by Congress but does not cover every issue in detail. The report offers a high-level review of recent issues in child nutrition programs raised by Congress and stakeholders, referencing legislative proposals in the 114th and 115th Congresses. CRS reports provide more detailed information on specific issues, such as the structure and functions of child nutrition programs and child nutrition reauthorization proposals. The Child Nutrition Reauthorization requires school meals to meet specific nutritional standards for federal reimbursement, including updating standards for school meals and creating new standards for competitive foods. USDA was mandated to issue proposed regulations for competitive foods within a year of the enactment of the law. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) required nutrition standards for school meals and competitive foods to be implemented within specific timeframes. It also included increased federal subsidies for schools meeting the new requirements and funding for technical assistance. The nutritional requirements were largely detailed in subsequent regulations, not the HHFKA itself. The USDA-FNS published final rules for school meals and competitive foods based on Dietary Guidelines for Americans and Institute of Medicine recommendations. Updated standards increased fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, while limiting calories, sodium, whole grains, and proteins. Milk was restricted to low-fat and fat-free varieties. The nutrition standards for school meals and competitive foods included limits on calories, sodium, and fat. The standards applied to non-meal foods and beverages sold during the school day, with exceptions for fundraisers. Implementation began in school year 2012-2013 for meals and 2014-2015 for competitive foods. Some schools faced challenges implementing sodium limits and whole grain requirements for school meals, leading to issues with obtaining products, student acceptance, participation, costs, and food waste. Reports from the School Nutrition Association and studies by the U.S. Government Accountability Office and USDA confirmed these issues in the first two years of implementation. In SY2012-2013 and SY2013-2014, issues arose with the implementation of school meal standards. SNA and other groups advocated for changes, leading to adjustments in USDA regulations from FY2015 to FY2019. The USDA published a final rule in December 2018 that changes aspects of school meal standards starting in SY2019-2020. The rule allows flavored, low-fat milk to be offered in school meals, requires a 50% whole grain-rich requirement, maintains Target 1 sodium limits, implements Target 2 limits in SY2024-2025, and eliminates Target 3 limits. The USDA's final rule in December 2018 modifies school meal standards by allowing flavored, low-fat milk, requiring 50% whole grain-rich foods, maintaining Target 1 sodium limits, implementing Target 2 limits in SY2024-2025, and eliminating Target 3 limits. Changes to milk requirements also impact other beverages sold in schools, while nutrition standards for competitive foods remain largely unchanged. Legislative proposals in the 115th Congress, such as the House-passed version of the 2018 farm bill, were considered in relation to nutrition standards. The House-passed version of the 2018 farm bill aimed to revise nutrition standards for school meals and competitive foods, focusing on research-based standards for school-age children without adding extra costs. However, this provision was not included in the enacted bill. Child nutrition reauthorization proposals in the 114th Congress also sought to alter nutrition standards. The House committee's proposal during the 114th Congress aimed to revise school meal standards, requiring USDA to review them every three years and make necessary revisions. Fundraisers by student groups would no longer need to meet competitive food standards, and federally reimbursable meal foods could be sold a la carte. The Senate committee's proposal would have required USDA to revise whole grain and sodium requirements for school meals within 90 days. Negotiations between the Senate committee, the White House, USDA, and the School Nutrition Association resulted in an agreement to reduce the whole grain-rich requirement to 80% and delay the sodium requirement for two years. Fresh fruit and vegetable snacks in FFVP must be in their natural state without additives, but there are discussions about including frozen, dried, and canned options in the program. The 2014 farm bill funded a pilot project that included canned, dried, and frozen fruits and vegetables in the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP) in select states. 56% of pilot schools chose to incorporate these options during the demonstration. During the pilot project, schools introduced dried and canned fruits in the FFVP, leading to decreased vegetable offerings and increased fruit offerings. However, there was no significant impact on students' vegetable consumption, and fruit consumption declined on FFVP snack days. Student satisfaction with FFVP slightly decreased, while parents' responses were mixed, and school administrators generally favored the changes. Legislative proposals are being considered to make these changes permanent. In the 115th Congress, legislative proposals were considered to change FFVP offerings, including allowing CDF and pur\u00e9ed forms of fruits and vegetables. Similar proposals were made in the 114th Congress, such as serving \"all forms\" of fruits and vegetables and tree nuts in participating schools. Temporary hardship exemptions were also proposed for schools with limited storage and preparation facilities. Schools with limited storage and preparation facilities or limited access to fresh fruits and vegetables may have been granted hardship exemptions to serve CDF fruits and vegetables in FFVP. However, they would eventually need to transition to 100% fresh products. Schools in the NSLP and/or SBP must adhere to federal requirements for domestically sourced foods, as outlined in the programs' laws and USDA guidance. Buy American requirements mandate that schools in the 48 contiguous states purchase domestic commodities or products to the maximum extent possible. USDA regulations require schools in the 48 contiguous states to purchase domestic commodities or products to the maximum extent practicable. \"Domestic commodities or products\" are defined as those produced and processed substantially in the United States, with over 51% domestically grown ingredients. USDA has issued guidance on implementing Buy American requirements for SFAs and state agencies. The Buy American requirements, outlined in a June 2017 memorandum, apply to foods purchased with funds from the nonprofit school food service account. SFAs are encouraged to integrate Buy American into their procurement processes by monitoring the USDA catalog for products and including Buy American language in procurement documents. SFAs are allowed to make exceptions to the Buy American requirements. SFAs are permitted to make exceptions to Buy American requirements when certain criteria are met, such as when a U.S. product is not available in sufficient quantities or when the cost is significantly higher than a non-domestic product. State agencies must review SFAs' compliance and take corrective action if needed. The 2018 farm bill requires USDA to enforce Buy American requirements and ensure understanding of responsibilities by SFAs and states within 180 days. It clarifies domestic product definition for enforcement purposes. The 2018 farm bill mandates USDA to enforce Buy American rules for school food purchases, emphasizing sourcing from the US for economic and safety reasons. Critics highlight concerns over sourcing from China, while others advocate for schools' discretion in procurement. Some policymakers advocate for increasing schools' discretion in food procurement for summer meals, as high-quality domestic options may not always be available or cost-effective. Summer meals are typically provided in group settings through programs like SFSP and SSO, but alternatives are being considered, especially for rural areas facing barriers to onsite consumption. The 2010 Agriculture Appropriations Act provided $85 million for projects to improve access to summer meals for children in urban and rural areas. One project, the Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer for Children (SEBTC), started in 2011 and continues in limited states and Indian Tribal Organizations. The Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer for Children (SEBTC) project provides electronic food benefits to households with children eligible for free or reduced-price school meals. Participants receive either $30 or $60 per month on an EBT card for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Participants in SNAP jurisdictions can redeem benefits at any SNAP-authorized retailer, while WIC EBT participants are limited to WIC-eligible foods at WIC-authorized retailers. An evaluation of Summer EBT from FY2011 to FY2013 found a decrease in very low food security among participants, with improved consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Both WIC and SNAP models showed increased consumption, with greater increases at sites using the WIC model. Congress has provided funding for Summer EBT projects, including in FY2019. In FY2019, Congress provided $28 million for Summer EBT projects, prioritizing new states and statewide projects. Awardees included Connecticut, Delaware, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, Oregon, Virginia, and the Chickasaw and Cherokee nations. USDA also awarded grants to Tennessee and Texas for summer 2018. In the 114th and 115th Congresses, there were proposals to expand Summer EBT nationwide with funding recommendations from the Obama Administration and freestanding bills with similar objectives. Funding from the 2010 Agriculture Appropriations Act was also mentioned. The 2010 Agriculture Appropriations Act funded the Enhanced Summer Food Service Program (eSFSP) from 2010 to 2012 in eight states. The program included initiatives to extend meal site operations, add recreational or educational activities, provide meal delivery in rural areas, and offer food backpacks for weekends and holidays. Evaluations showed increased summer meal participation rates for all initiatives. Rates rose during the demonstration periods for all four initiatives, with consistent food insecurity rates for children in the meal delivery and backpack demonstrations from summer to fall. However, caution is advised in interpreting the results due to small sample size, lack of comparison group, and potential confounding factors. Another project, authorized by the 2010 Agriculture Appropriations Act, granted exemptions from congregate feeding requirements to outdoor meal sites facing excessive heat since 2015. Exemptions from congregate feeding requirements have been granted to outdoor meal sites facing excessive heat each summer since 2015. USDA offers exemptions for extreme weather conditions on a case-by-case basis. Other proposals and hearings related to congregate feeding in SFSP have been discussed in recent years. The proposed bills would have allowed rural meal sites to provide SFSP meals for offsite consumption in certain conditions. This includes children in rural areas and nonrural areas with high percentages of students eligible for free or reduced-price meals. The bills would also have permitted congregate feeding sites to offer meals for offsite consumption episodically under specific circumstances. The Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) provides free meals to students in schools with high numbers of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Participation in CEP has increased since its nationwide implementation in SY2014-2015, with over 20,700 schools participating as of SY2016-2017. Supporters argue that CEP improves meal access, reduces stigma, and lowers administrative costs. The House's committee-reported child nutrition reauthorization bill in the 114th Congress aimed to restrict schools' eligibility for the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) to better target resources to students in need. CEP has also caused data issues for other federal and state programs, such as the Title I-A program. Funding for schools is determined by free and reduced-price lunch data, which is no longer collected under the Community Eligibility Provision. Students may qualify for free, reduced-price, or full-price meals, leading to issues of unpaid meal costs and schools' responses. Some schools respond to unpaid meal costs with \"lunch shaming\" practices, such as taking away hot meals or imposing restrictions on students until debts are repaid. Limited national data is available on the prevalence of these instances. Limited national data on prevalence of unpaid meal practices. School districts face financial burden from unpaid meal costs. Student payments crucial for school food program revenue. Schools must collect revenue to fund operations or face \"bad debt.\" Congress and USDA actions since 2010 address unpaid meal funds recovery. Congress and USDA have taken actions since 2010 to address the issue of unpaid meal costs, including examining states' and school districts' policies. USDA's report to Congress in June 2016 did not recommend national standards for meal charges. The USDA's subsequent Report to Congress in June 2016 did not recommend national standards for unpaid meal charges but suggested clarifying policy guidance and promoting best practices. SFAs were required to establish a meal charge policy by July 1, 2017, with instructions on handling unpaid meals. USDA-FNS provided further guidance through webinars and a best practice guide. The USDA's Report to Congress in June 2016 did not recommend national standards for unpaid meal charges but suggested promoting best practices. Findings from a study and Request for Information showed meal charge policies were determined at the school level, with varying levels of formality and enforcement. School officials expressed a preference for local control. In RFI comments, school and district officials prefer local control of meal charge policies, while national advocacy groups support national standards. Lunch shaming and unpaid meal costs were discussed in the 115th Congress, with provisions in the FY2018 appropriations law aimed at preventing discrimination against children eligible for free or reduced-price meals. Legislative proposals in the 115th Congress addressed these issues. Legislative proposals in the 115th Congress, such as the Anti-Lunch Shaming Act of 2017, aimed to establish national standards for how schools treat children unable to pay for meals. States have also enacted legislation to address unpaid meal costs, with Illinois passing a law in 2018 requiring schools to serve regular meals to students who cannot pay. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) introduced new requirements for schools' pricing of paid lunches. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) introduced new requirements for schools' pricing of paid lunches, aiming to ensure children receiving free and reduced-price lunches get the full value of federal funds. SFAs were mandated to review and potentially increase prices, with the option to use nonfederal funding sources to meet the requirements. Prior to the paid lunch equity requirements, federal subsidies for free and reduced-price lunches were cross-subsidizing other aspects of the meals programs. Federal reimbursements for free, reduced-price, and paid lunches are all mixed into the same nonprofit school food service account. Raising prices may reduce participation in paid lunches. The paid lunch equity formula requires the price per paid lunch to eventually match or exceed the difference between federal reimbursements for free and paid lunches. If not, schools must increase prices over time to make up the difference. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) required schools to gradually increase the price of paid lunches if they were not charging at least $3.00 per lunch to match federal reimbursements. Schools cannot raise prices by more than 10 cents annually, but they have the option to do so. Additionally, the law mandated that revenue from nonprogram foods must go to the school food service account. The law mandated that revenue from nonprogram foods must go to the SFA-run NSFSA, preventing it from being used for other school purposes. USDA-FNS published a rule in June 2011 implementing this requirement, with exemptions for SFAs in strong financial standing for SY2013-2014 through SY2017-2018. The enacted FY2018 appropriation expanded exemptions for SFAs with negative NSFSA balances, potentially requiring price increases for paid meals. Legislative proposals in recent Congresses aimed to eliminate or modify paid lunch equity requirements. The curr_chunk provides a list of acronyms related to various food programs such as CACFP, NSLP, SBP, and USDA-FNS. These acronyms represent different programs and provisions under the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act. Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer for Children (SEBTC) is a program during the school year by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service (USDA-FNS)."
