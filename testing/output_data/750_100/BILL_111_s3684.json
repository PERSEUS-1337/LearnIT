    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Cavernous Angioma CARE Center Act of 2010\". Cavernous angioma, also known as cerebral cavernous malformations, affects around 1,500,000 people in the US. It is a blood vessel disease with vascular lesions growing in the brain and spinal cord. Detection requires specialized imaging techniques, and symptoms may not appear until they become serious. Individuals diagnosed with cavernous angioma may experience neurological deficits, seizure, stroke, or sudden death. Limited research on cavernous angioma means there is no treatment regimen other than brain and spinal surgery. Some patients are not eligible for surgery, and there is a shortage of physicians familiar with the condition. Cavernous angioma is prevalent in New Mexico due to a specific disease-causing mutation, affecting tens of thousands of individuals. Other states with high rates include Texas, Arizona, and Colorado. Senate Resolution 148, 111th Congress, emphasizes the need to increase research, awareness, and education about cerebral cavernous malformations. The National Institutes of Health supports research at institutes of higher education through centers of excellence to promote multidisciplinary research approaches. To address the public health threat of cavernous angioma, a multidisciplinary center is needed to provide care, advocacy, research, and education. This center aims to develop a cure, enhance medical care, and serve as a model for similar centers nationwide. A centralized Cavernous Angioma Clinical Care, Advocacy, Research, and Education Center should be established at the University of New Mexico to enhance medical care for individuals with cavernous angioma nationwide. SEC. 3. CAVERNOUS ANGIOMA CARE CENTER. Part B of title IV of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include a Cavernous Angioma Care Center of Excellence. The Director of NIH will establish a Cavernous Angioma CARE Center of Excellence at the University of New Mexico to conduct research on diagnostic, prevention, and treatment methods for individuals with cavernous angioma. The center will also serve as a model for medical schools and research institutions. The CARE Center at the University of New Mexico will consist of cavernous angioma researchers, clinicians, and medical staff including a medical director, headache or pain specialist, epilepsy specialist, psychiatrist, neuropsychologist, dermatologist, and nurse practitioner specializing in neurology or neurosurgery. The CARE Center at the University of New Mexico will include a team consisting of a nurse coordinator, research coordinator, clinical nurse, radiology specialist, clinical vascular fellow, basic science postdoctoral fellow, and a genetic counselor. The center will be affiliated with a university medical center with an accredited medical school. The CARE Center at the University of New Mexico, affiliated with an accredited medical school, provides education and training in neurological disease, diagnosis, and treatment of cavernous angioma. It maintains a program for postdoctoral fellows in cavernous angioma research, recruits innovative researchers and clinicians, and offers continuing medical education for clinicians. The curr_chunk discusses programs dedicated to patient advocacy, outreach, and education for cavernous angioma care. This includes launching a public awareness campaign, creating patient education materials, and establishing an education program for school nurses. The curr_chunk focuses on establishing communication with other research institutions, facilitating collaborations for clinical trials, and developing electronic health tools for cavernous angioma care. The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of an advisory board for the CARE Center, composed of individuals with expertise in cavernous angioma, patient advocacy groups, physicians, scientists, and affiliated institutions. The CARE Center is headed by a Director with expertise in cavernous angioma patient care and research. The Director's duties include promoting understanding and treatment of cavernous angioma, providing high-quality medical and surgical care, and ensuring community-, family-, and patient-centered care. The CARE Center, led by a Director specializing in cavernous angioma care and research, aims to advance medical research, provide high-quality care, and serve as a model facility for others in the United States. Reporting on its progress is required within two years of the Cavernous Angioma CARE Center Act of 2010. The advisory board of the CARE Center must submit biannual reports to the Secretary detailing progress, expenditures, and outcomes of the center's activities as required by the Cavernous Angioma CARE Center Act of 2010. The CARE Center advisory board must submit biannual reports to the Secretary detailing progress, expenditures, and outcomes. Authorization of $2,000,000 is appropriated for the Care Center for fiscal year 2011."
