    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 34171 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to define terms related to administrative budget and administrative cost allowance for successor agencies. The administrative cost allowance for successor agencies is set at 5% of property tax for the period January 1, 2012, through June 30, 2012, and up to 3% for each fiscal year ending on June 30, 2016. The allowance cannot be less than $250,000 unless reduced by the oversight board or by agreement with the successor agency. Starting July 1, 2016, the administrative cost allowance for successor agencies is up to 3% of the property tax distributed in the previous fiscal year, minus any repayments and costs from the preceding year. The minimum allowance is $250,000 unless reduced by the oversight board. The administrative cost allowance for successor agencies is up to 3% of the property tax distributed in the previous fiscal year, with a minimum allowance of $250,000 unless reduced by the oversight board or by agreement with the department. Starting July 1, 2016, a successor agency's annual administrative costs cannot exceed 50% of the total Redevelopment Property Tax Trust Fund distributed to pay enforceable obligations in the previous fiscal year. This limit applies to administrative costs regardless of whether they are paid within the administrative cost allowance or not, but excludes costs paid from bond proceeds or grant funds. The limit on a successor agency's annual administrative costs, starting July 1, 2016, is 50% of the total Redevelopment Property Tax Trust Fund distributed to pay enforceable obligations in the previous fiscal year. This limit applies to administrative costs regardless of whether they are paid within the administrative cost allowance or not, but does not include costs paid from bond proceeds or grant funds. The administrative cost allowance is the sole funding source for legal expenses related to civil actions. Employee costs for project implementation activities are not considered administrative costs. (c) \u201cDesignated local authority\u201d refers to a public entity established under Section 34173.\n(d) (1) \u201cEnforceable obligation\u201d includes specific criteria. Enforceable obligation refers to bonds issued by a former redevelopment agency, including debt service, reserve set-asides, and other required payments under the bond indenture. A reserve may be held if property tax allocation is insufficient for upcoming bond payments. Loans borrowed by the redevelopment agency for lawful purposes must be repaid according to a set schedule or mandatory terms. Payments required by the federal government, preexisting state obligations, and obligations imposed by state law, including federal base reuse obligations for the former Norton Air Force Base, pass with a state water contractor agreement. The county auditor-controller makes passthrough payments, while legally enforceable payments for agency employees include pension payments, debt service, and unemployment payments. Layoff costs for city employees under collective bargaining agreements are considered enforceable obligations payable from property tax funds. The successor agency or designated local authority must reimburse the housing entity for any employee obligations when transferring employees to the entity assuming housing functions from the former redevelopment agency. The oversight board, along with the successor agency, has the authority to appeal judgments or set aside settlements against the former redevelopment agency. Any legally binding agreement or contract not void due to debt limit or public policy can be terminated by the successor agency or oversight board with compensation. Titles or headings in a document do not determine enforceable obligations. Contracts or agreements necessary for the administration or operation of the successor agency, including litigation expenses, settlements, office space, equipment, supplies, and insurance costs, must comply with specified sections. Legal expenses related to civil actions contesting the validity of certain parts shall only be incurred after January 1, 2016. Legal expenses related to contesting the validity of certain parts shall only be payable out of the administrative cost allowance. A sponsoring entity may provide funds to a successor agency for legal expenses related to civil actions, including challenging the validity of specific parts. If the successor agency wins the case, the funds provided for legal expenses will be repaid as an enforceable obligation. If the successor agency does not receive a final judicial determination granting relief, funds provided by the sponsoring entity will be considered a grant and not eligible for repayment as an enforceable obligation. Repayments owed to the Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund of a redevelopment agency must be approved by the oversight board and transferred to the Low and Moderate Income Housing Asset Fund for affordable housing purposes. Written agreements entered into at the time of issuance of indebtedness obligations, but no later than December 31, 2010, solely for securing or repaying those obligations may be considered enforceable obligations. Additionally, agreements entered into by June 27, 2011, solely for refunding or refinancing other indebtedness may also be deemed enforceable obligations. Agreements entered into by the redevelopment agency prior to June 28, 2011, for the refunding or refinancing of indebtedness obligations may be deemed enforceable obligations. Loan agreements between the agency and the creating entity within two years of the agency's creation may also be considered enforceable obligations. Agreements made by the former redevelopment agency before June 28, 2011, regarding state highway infrastructure improvements or repayment of loans from federal agencies are considered enforceable obligations. The former redevelopment agency's agreements before June 28, 2011, related to state highway infrastructure improvements or loan repayments from federal agencies are considered enforceable obligations. Funds provided by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development were loaned to the city, county, or city and county. Contracts or agreements between the former redevelopment agency and other public agencies outside of redevelopment project areas not properly authorized under Part 1 shall be void, except for housing-related contracts authorized under Part 1. The curr_chunk defines \"Indebtedness obligations\" as bonds or other debt issued by the redevelopment agency, \"Oversight board\" as entities established by Section 34179, and \"Recognized obligation\" as listed in the Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule. The \"Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule\" outlines payment amounts and due dates for enforceable obligations until June 30, 2016, and for each fiscal year after July 1, 2016. \"School entity\" refers to entities defined in the Revenue and Taxation Code. The successor agency is defined as the entity that replaces the former redevelopment agency. Taxing entities refer to cities, counties, special districts, and school entities that receive property tax payments. Property taxes include all revenues from unitary, supplemental, and roll corrections. The Department refers to the Department of Finance. From July 1, 2014, to July 1, 2018, inclusive, the \"housing entity administrative cost allowance\" is defined as up to 1% of property tax allocated to the Redevelopment Obligation Retirement Fund for each fiscal year, with a minimum of $150,000 per year. The housing entity administrative cost allowance is remitted by the successor agency to the local housing authority that assumed the housing functions of the former redevelopment agency. If there are insufficient funds in the Redevelopment Obligations Retirement Fund, the unpaid amount can be carried over to future payment schedules without a five-year limit."
