    "content": "In the design of deep neural networks, the focus has been on improving accuracy, resulting in complex architectures that are hard to deploy practically. Recently, there is interest in developing quantitative metrics that go beyond accuracy to evaluate network performance. This study introduces NetScore, a new metric that assesses the balance between accuracy, computational complexity, and practical on-device edge usage of deep neural networks. The study introduces NetScore, a metric that evaluates the balance between accuracy, computational complexity, and network architecture complexity of deep neural networks. It compares top-1 accuracy and information density across 60 different deep convolutional neural networks for image classification on the ImageNet dataset, serving as a reference guide for practitioners. The recent surge in deep learning research and industrial interest has highlighted the challenges in deploying complex deep neural networks. Designing networks that balance accuracy and complexity is a key focus area, with assessing network performance being a major challenge. The challenges in designing practical deep neural networks lie in assessing network performance, with a focus on balancing accuracy and complexity. The information density metric proposed by BID0 is a widely cited metric, but it does not consider computational requirements for network inference. There is a need for universal performance metrics that account for accuracy, architectural complexity, and computational complexity. NetScore is a new metric introduced in this study to assess the balance between accuracy, computational complexity, and network design. The results can serve as a reference guide for practitioners in the field. The deep convolutional neural networks evaluated include AlexNet. The study evaluates deep convolutional neural networks including AlexNet BID22, as shown in Fig. 1(right)."
