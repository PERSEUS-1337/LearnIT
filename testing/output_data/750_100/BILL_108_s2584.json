    "content": "The \"Agricultural Producers Value-Added Investment Tax Credit Act of 2004\" is cited as the short title. It introduces a new section, SEC. 45G, which provides a credit for farmer investment in value-added agricultural property. The \"Agricultural Producers Value-Added Investment Tax Credit Act of 2004\" introduces section 38, providing a 50% credit for eligible persons or farmer-owned entities on the basis of qualified value-added agricultural property placed in service during the taxable year. The credit is allocated among eligible persons in a farmer-owned entity on a pro rata basis. The \"Agricultural Producers Value-Added Investment Tax Credit Act of 2004\" offers a 50% credit for eligible persons or farmer-owned entities based on qualified value-added agricultural property placed in service during the taxable year. The credit is capped at $30,000 for eligible persons and is reduced by creditable investments for farmer-owned entities. The term 'creditable investments' refers to the qualified investments made by an eligible person in a farmer-owned entity, reduced by the total qualified investments made by that person in the entity. The limitation for creditable investments made by an eligible person in a farmer-owned entity is based on the aggregate qualified investments made by the person in all farmer-owned entities. For tax purposes, the total qualified investments made by an eligible person in value-added agricultural property cannot exceed $30,000 in a taxable year. Qualified value-added agricultural property refers to property used to add value to goods derived from organic matter. Value-added agricultural property must be derived from organic matter available on a renewable basis, including crops, agricultural wastes, wood residues, and animal wastes. The property must have a useful life of 3 years or more and be owned and operated by an eligible person. An eligible person or farmer-owned entity must own and operate value-added agricultural property derived from renewable organic matter. The eligible person must materially participate in an eligible farming business. The determination of eligibility for an eligible farming business is made at the shareholder, partner, or beneficial interests level for corporations, cooperatives, partnerships, estates, or trusts. An eligible farming business is defined as a farming business that is not a passive activity. A farmer-owned entity is defined as a corporation or partnership where eligible persons own at least 50% of the voting power and stock or profits interest. Eligibility for an eligible farming business is determined at the shareholder, partner, or beneficial interests level. A farmer-owned entity is defined as a corporation or partnership where eligible persons own at least 50% of the voting power and profits interest. Cooperative ownership requires eligible persons to own 50% or more of the voting power and patronage interests. Constructive ownership rules apply for determining ownership percentages. In determining family members for tax purposes, only an individual's spouse, children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, along with their spouses who reside together or jointly operate farming businesses, are considered part of the family. For tax purposes, family members include spouses, children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren who reside together or jointly operate farming businesses. A child legally adopted or placed with the taxpayer for adoption is treated as a blood relative. Qualified investments refer to cash payments for purchasing equity in a farmer-owned entity. The term \"qualified equity interest\" refers to stock in a domestic corporation or a capital/profits interest in a domestic partnership acquired by the taxpayer between December 31, 2004, and January 1, 2011, solely in exchange for cash. The special rules under section 1202(c)(3) apply to the acquisition of a patronage interest in a cooperative between December 31, 2004, and January 1, 2011. In the case of a separate return by a married individual, the threshold amount is reduced to $15,000 instead of $30,000. Rules similar to section 52 and 50(b) apply for allocation of credit in estates and trusts. Basis of qualified value-added agricultural property is reduced by the credit amount allowed under this section. The basis of qualified value-added agricultural property is reduced by the credit amount allowed and increased by any recapture under subsection (e) within a 5-year period. The basis of qualified value-added agricultural property may be reduced if the property no longer qualifies, is disposed of, or the owner ceases to be eligible. Special rules apply in the event of death. The suspension of qualified value-added agricultural property for an eligible person lasts for 2 years after their death. Heirs who are also eligible persons are exempt from certain transfer rules. The Secretary will create necessary regulations for this section. The section applies to property placed in service before December 31, 2010. It amends the definition of current year business credit to include the value-added agricultural property investment credit for eligible persons. The credit is allowable against minimum tax. The amendment allows the value-added agricultural property credit to be used against minimum tax. The value-added agricultural property credit can now be used against minimum tax, as per the amendment. Additionally, a limitation on carryback of the credit before the effective date has been introduced. The value-added agricultural property investment credit cannot be carried back to any taxable year before the enactment of section 45G. This credit is now included in the deduction for certain unused business credits under section 196 of the tax code. The tax code is amended to include a basis adjustment for payments related to credits allowed under section 38. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for subpart D of part IV of the tax code. The tax code is amended to include a new value-added agricultural property investment credit under section 45G. The effective date for the amendments is after December 31, 2004."
