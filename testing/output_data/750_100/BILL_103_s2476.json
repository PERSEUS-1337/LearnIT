The term 'principal residence' in section 1034 has the same meaning as before. The term 'date of acquisition' refers to the specific date. The term 'date of acquisition' refers to the specific date when a binding contract is entered into or construction of a principal residence begins.

The term 'functionally impaired individual' refers to someone certified by a licensed health care practitioner for a continuing plan of care. A functionally impaired individual is certified by a licensed health care practitioner as unable to perform at least 3 activities of daily living without substantial assistance. Special rule for home health care services: If services are provided while an individual is residing at home, the requirement of 3 activities of daily living for certification is reduced to 2. Activities of daily living in a nursing home include eating, transferring, toileting, dressing, and bathing. A licensed health care practitioner is required for certification.

The text chunk specifies that the amendments apply to payments and distributions after the enactment date of the Act."
