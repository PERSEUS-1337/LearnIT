    "content": "The hidden feature of federal crimes is that helpers and offenders face the same punishment under 18 U.S.C. 2, which treats anyone who orders a federal crime with the same consequences. This secondary liability is similar to conspiracy, as society fears the crimes of several more than the crimes of one. The aiding and abetting subsection (\u00a72(a)) is more commonly prosecuted than the causes subsection (\u00a72(b). Aiding and abetting under 18 U.S.C. 2(a) requires the defendant to embrace another's crime and consciously contribute to its success. The defendant must associate with the venture, participate in it, and seek to make it succeed. Knowing the offense is happening before it occurs is necessary for conviction. The defendant must embrace another's crime, consciously contribute to its success, and associate with the venture to be convicted of aiding and abetting under 18 U.S.C. 2(a). Knowledge before the offense occurs is necessary for conviction, and minimal assistance is sufficient. A completed offense is a prerequisite to conviction for aiding and abetting under 18 U.S.C. 2(a), where the defendant must embrace another's crime and consciously contribute to its success. Knowledge before the offense occurs is necessary for conviction. Accomplices must aid and abet before or at the time of the offense to be convicted, as assistance after the crime is a separate offense. Sometimes accomplices can avoid liability if there is a significant culpability gap between them and the primary offender. This often involves victims, customers, or subordinates. The three types of accomplices or co-conspirators are victims, customers, and subordinates. Victims are those who pay extortion, blackmail, or ransom monies, but not all victims qualify for exceptions based on culpability. Customers who have not been convicted as co-conspirators include drinkers, bettors, johns, and drug addicts. In United States v. Farrar and Rewis v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled that customers of illegal establishments like speak-easies and gambling dens could not be prosecuted as aiders and abettors. The Court concluded that Congress did not intend mere bettors to be covered under the law. The federal law prohibits any level of involvement in illegal gambling businesses under 18 U.S.C. 1955, except for mere bettors. Similarly, the Controlled Substances Act reinforces the idea that a drug trafficker's customers cannot be prosecuted as coconspirators or aiders and abettors. While the trafficker faces severe punishment for possession with intent to distribute, the customer is typically punished for simple possession, usually as a misdemeanor. \"Subordinates\" have a harder time avoiding secondary liability. In Gebardi, the Supreme Court ruled that a woman agreeing to be transported for immoral purposes couldn't be charged with conspiracy under the Mann Act. Lower courts followed this ruling but limited it to cases where the prostitute only acquiesced to transportation. OSHA's provisions do not allow prosecution of employees as aiders and abettors for OSHA violations. Employees of an OSHA offender may be prosecuted as aiders and abettors, while subordinates supervised by offenders of the federal gambling business statute do not receive the same benefit. The treatment of subordinates of a drug kingpin remains unclear. Willfully causing an act to be done that would be an offense against the United States makes one punishable as a principal. The language of \u00a72(b) leaves room for interpretation regarding crimes committed through an agent. Section 2(b) applies to defendants who work through intermediaries, whether witting or unwitting, guilty or innocent. It covers cases where the intermediary is aware or unaware of their actions constituting an offense. Even if the intermediary is innocent, as long as the \"causing\" individual commits the underlying offense, Section 2(b) still applies. Section 2(b) imposes no liability unless the actions of the defendant and his intermediary, taken together, constitute an offense. The amendment adding \"willfully causes\" in 1951 originated in the Senate Judiciary Committee, with little explanation provided. Speculation suggests the addition of \"willfully\" may have been to address a point made by Judge Learned Hand regarding mental state in \u00a72(a). The courts interpret \"willfully\" in \u00a72(b) as intending the commission of a crime and using someone else to commit it. Liability can be incurred even if unaware that the conduct is criminal. Federal courts mention a withdrawal defense similar to conspiracy cases. In aiding and abetting cases, withdrawal may limit liability under \u00a72(a) if the underlying offense is not committed due to the withdrawal of assistance. The defendant must demonstrate affirmative action to withdraw from the conspiracy, such as confessing to authorities or communicating withdrawal to coconspirators. In cases of aiding and abetting, withdrawal may limit liability if the offense is not committed due to the withdrawal of assistance. The question of withdrawing from aiding and abetting a crime remains unsettled, with varying results in different courts. Proponents of a general withdrawal defense may find support in recent dicta in Rosemond, where the defendant had been convicted of distributing marijuana and discharging a firearm during a drug trafficking offense. The Supreme Court clarified that an accomplice must know of the substantive offense beforehand to be held liable for aiding and abetting. It suggested that an accomplice could withdraw and escape liability before the offense is committed, even if they contributed to its success. Congress has not enacted a general civil aiding and abetting statute. Courts have concluded that aiders and abettors do not incur civil liability for violations of various statutes, such as the Anti-Terrorism Act, Electronic Communications Privacy Act, Stored Communications Act, or RICO."
