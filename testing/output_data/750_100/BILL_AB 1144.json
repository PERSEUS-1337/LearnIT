    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 399.16 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to allow electricity products from eligible renewable energy resources within the WECC transmission network service area to comply with renewables portfolio standard procurement requirements. These products can be differentiated based on their grid operation impacts and meeting article requirements. (b) A balanced portfolio of eligible renewable energy resources shall be procured to meet project viability principles and provide benefits, including electricity products that meet specific criteria. To meet project viability principles and provide benefits, a balanced portfolio of eligible renewable energy resources must have a first point of interconnection with a California balancing authority or distribution facilities used to serve end users within the area. The use of another source for ancillary services is allowed, but only electricity generated by the eligible renewable energy resource counts towards the portfolio content category. Unbundled renewable energy credits earned by electricity generated by an entity meeting specific criteria and used at a wastewater treatment facility owned by a public entity. The facility must have been first put into service on or after January 1, 2016, and there must be an agreement to transfer electricity to a California balancing authority. The renewable energy credit requirements include the generating facility meeting specific criteria and the electricity being used at a public entity's wastewater treatment facility. The wastewater treatment facility must have generating capability put into service after January 1, 2016, and not participate in the small-scale bioenergy feed-in tariff program. Retail sellers must procure eligible renewable energy resource electricity products to achieve a balanced portfolio, including incremental electricity scheduled into a California balancing authority. Additionally, they must meet specific requirements for all procurement credited toward each compliance period. Retail sellers must procure eligible renewable energy resource electricity products to achieve a balanced portfolio, including incremental electricity scheduled into a California balancing authority. Not less than 50 percent for the compliance period ending December 31, 2013, 65 percent for the compliance period ending December 31, 2016, and 75 percent thereafter of the eligible renewable energy resource electricity products associated with contracts executed after June 1, 2010, shall meet specific product content requirements. Additionally, not more than 25 percent for the compliance period ending December 31, 2013, 15 percent for the compliance period ending December 31, 2016, and 10 percent thereafter of the eligible renewable energy resource electricity products associated with contracts executed after June 1, 2010, shall meet different product content requirements. Any renewable energy contracts executed after June 1, 2010, must meet specific product content requirements. Restrictions on crediting renewable energy products apply to contracts signed after January 13, 2011. Contracts signed before June 1, 2010, count towards procurement requirements if certain conditions are met. The renewable energy contract must meet specific product content requirements if executed after June 1, 2010. Approval by the commission is required for electrical corporations, even if granted after the specified date. Contract amendments post-June 1, 2010, cannot increase capacity or change the renewable resource. Extensions are allowed for contracts with a 15-year procurement commitment. A retail seller can request a reduction in procurement content requirements from the commission if unable to comply due to uncontrollable conditions. The commission can lower the requirement but not below 65 percent after December 31, 2016. A public entity selling renewable energy credits cannot make marketing claims about the renewable attributes of the electricity that earned the credit. All renewable attributes are transferred to the purchaser of the credit. For calculating renewables portfolio standard obligations, electricity generated and sold by a public entity with renewable energy credits must be added to the total retail sales of the buyer."
