    "content": "The 9/11 Commission report highlighted that key officials responsible for alien admissions were not fully involved in counterterrorism efforts before September 11, 2001, leading to missed opportunities to intercept the terrorists. The report emphasized the need for intelligence and law enforcement to exploit al Qaeda's travel vulnerabilities. The 9/11 hijackers had connections to al Qaeda, used fraudulent passports, made false statements on visa applications, and violated immigration laws. The 9/11 Commission recommended targeting terrorist travel as a key strategy to combat terrorism. The U.S. border security system should be integrated into a larger network of screening points, including transportation systems and vital facilities like nuclear reactors. The Department of Homeland Security, with support from Congress, should quickly implement a biometric entry-exit screening system. Collaboration with other governments is essential to prevent terrorists from entering the country. The 9/11 Commission's recommendations for immigration law and policy have broad implications and have been a key component of major legislative proposals in the 108th Congress. Two bills passed their respective Houses, proposing revisions to immigration law. The National Intelligence Reform Act of 2004, introduced by Senators Collins and Lieberman, faced contention over immigration provisions. The compromise bill, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, was signed on December 17, 2004. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (P.L.108-458) signed on December 17, 2004 includes some immigration provisions. The major areas under consideration in comprehensive reform proposals are briefly discussed. Actions to identify and intercept terrorists entering or leaving the United States are a key component of the 9/11 Commission's recommendations. Congress required the development of an automated entry and exit data system in 1996. In 1996, Congress mandated the creation of an automated entry and exit data system to track aliens' arrivals and departures, but it has not been fully implemented. After 9/11, Congress passed the USA PATRIOT Act and the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Reform Act of 2002 to expedite the system's development and require biometric identifiers in travel documents for improved security. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 aimed to keep inadmissible aliens abroad. The Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 mandated a pre-inspection program for aliens departing to the United States and authorized assistance to air carriers in detecting fraudulent documents. In the 108th Congress, proposals were made to improve monitoring of persons entering and exiting the United States, including the development of a biometric entry system. Proposals in the 108th Congress aimed to enhance monitoring of individuals entering and exiting the United States, including the development of a biometric entry system, pre-flight passenger record checks against terrorist watch lists, establishment of a cruise ship passenger watchlist, and authorization for permanent pre-enrollment programs by the Department of Homeland Security. The 108th Congress proposed measures to enhance monitoring of individuals entering and exiting the United States, including establishing permanent pre-enrollment programs for criminal and watch-list screenings, improving passport security, and promoting international standards for name translations in travel documents. The 108th Congress proposed measures to enhance monitoring of individuals entering and exiting the United States, including improving passport security and promoting international standards for name translations in travel documents. Additionally, they aimed to expand pre-inspection programs in foreign countries, provide assistance to airlines in detecting fraudulent documents, and enhance the security of the visa issuance process by training consular officers and immigration inspectors in detecting terrorist indicators and patterns. The 108th Congress proposed measures to enhance monitoring of individuals entering and exiting the United States, including improving passport security and promoting international standards for name translations in travel documents. They also aimed to disrupt travel document fraud operations, increase consular officers, require visa applicants aged 12-65 to be interviewed, and station anti-fraud specialists at consular posts overseas.

They also aimed to disrupt travel document fraud operations, increase consular officers, require visa applicants aged 12-65 to be interviewed, and station anti-fraud specialists at consular posts overseas. In certain circumstances, authorizing and encouraging the President to enter into international agreements to curtail terrorist travel by upgrading verification and information-sharing systems; limiting the President's ability to waive general statutory requirements for U.S. citizens traveling abroad or attempting to enter the United States to bear a valid U.S. passport. The House-passed proposal includes amending waiver authority for document requirements for arriving foreign nationals, requiring a joint determination by the Secretary of Homeland Security and Secretary of State based on reciprocity. It also mandates the development of a plan for biometric use by the Secretary of State in consultation with DHS. The Senate-passed proposal requires U.S. citizens and foreign nationals from contiguous territories to present biometric passports for travel into the United States. This plan would be developed in consultation with DHS. For more information on border security and monitoring foreign students, refer to CRS reports RL32399, RL32188, and RL32234. The House-passed and Senate-passed versions of S. 2845 differed on grounds for alien exclusion, removal, and relief from removal. The Immigration and Nationality Act establishes criteria for foreign nationals entering or remaining in the U.S., including forms of relief like asylum. The Immigration and Nationality Act establishes criteria for foreign nationals entering or remaining in the U.S., including forms of relief like asylum. Congress has expanded grounds of inadmissibility and deportation while restricting relief from removal and judicial review of removal decisions. The Supreme Court has a strong presumption in favor of judicial review of administrative actions. In response to the 9/11 attacks, Congress expanded terrorism grounds for inadmissibility, removal, and detention in the USA PATRIOT Act. The Supreme Court maintains a strong presumption in favor of judicial review, including habeas review, for removal-related matters. The House-passed S. 2845 aimed to broaden terror-related activity grounds for inadmissibility and deportation of aliens, including barring those engaged in terrorist activity from relief from removal. The House-passed S. 2845 aims to expand grounds for inadmissibility and deportation of aliens engaged in terrorist activities, including receiving military training from designated terrorist organizations and providing support to such organizations. The House-passed S. 2845 aims to expand grounds for inadmissibility and deportation of aliens involved in terrorist activities, genocide, torture, extrajudicial killings, or severe violations of religious freedom while serving as foreign government officials. It also grants the Secretary of Homeland Security more discretion in determining countries for removal of inadmissible aliens. The House-passed S. 2845 aims to expand grounds for inadmissibility and deportation of aliens involved in terrorist activities, genocide, torture, extrajudicial killings, or severe violations of religious freedom. It grants the Secretary of Homeland Security more discretion in deciding countries for removal of inadmissible aliens and increases the prior continuous U.S. physical presence required for exemption from immediate removal from two years to five years. It also provides exceptions for aliens currently being prosecuted or serving a criminal sentence. The House-passed S. 2845 expands grounds for inadmissibility and deportation of aliens involved in terrorist activities, genocide, torture, extrajudicial killings, or severe violations of religious freedom. It grants the Secretary of Homeland Security more discretion in deciding countries for removal of inadmissible aliens and increases the prior continuous U.S. physical presence required for exemption from immediate removal from two years to five years. It also provides exceptions for aliens currently being prosecuted or serving a criminal sentence. The bill also clarifies restrictions on judicial review for certain removal decisions and precludes courts from staying a removal order pending judicial review unless clear and convincing evidence shows the entry or execution of such order is prohibited by law. The United States offers relief from removal for foreign nationals facing persecution based on race, religion, nationality, social group membership, or political opinion. Regulations also prevent the return of individuals to countries where they may be at risk of torture or other cruel treatment. The United States provides relief from removal for foreign nationals facing persecution based on specific criteria. Proposals to modify asylum and other forms of relief include establishing stricter standards for asylum applicants accused of terrorist or guerrilla activities and ensuring that aliens posing a danger to national security are not granted relief. The House-passed bill allows for the indefinite detention of aliens deemed a danger to national security, with review every six months by the Secretary of Homeland Security. Concerns have been raised about terrorist aliens obtaining U.S. identification documents. The 9/11 Commission highlighted that most of the hijackers acquired U.S. identification documents, aiding them in terrorist activities. National standards for birth certificates and drivers' licenses were recommended to prevent fraudulent acquisition. The controversy over setting national standards for identification issuance persists. The controversy surrounding various forms of identification, such as state drivers' licenses and birth certificates, has been linked to immigration legislation. Congress provided standards for acceptance of these documents under \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd 656 of the IIRIRA, but the provision was repealed in 2000 amid concerns of creating a national identification card. Following the 9/11 Commission's recommendations, proposals were made to enhance federal oversight and security of drivers' licenses. Proposals were made to increase federal oversight and improve the security of state-issued identification documents, including drivers' licenses and birth certificates. Measures were suggested to enhance the security of Social Security documents and verify the identity of individuals applying for benefits under the INA. These proposals included requirements for states to meet federal security standards for issuing identification cards. The House-passed and Senate-passed proposals aim to enforce national minimum standards for state-issued documents like drivers' licenses, identification cards, and birth certificates, ensuring federal agencies only accept documents meeting these standards for official purposes. The House and Senate proposals enforce national standards for state-issued documents, prohibiting acceptance of non-compliant documents for official purposes. Federal agencies are given authority to conduct audits on state compliance, and grants to states are made contingent on participation in the program. The House and Senate bills focus on enforcing national standards for state-issued documents, including creating electronic birth and death registration systems, establishing an electronic interface for verifying vital records, and restricting the issuance of multiple replacement Social Security cards. The House and Senate bills aim to improve the security of state-issued documents by prohibiting the display of Social Security numbers on driver's licenses, enhancing the application process for newborn Social Security numbers, studying photo ID requirements for Social Security numbers, and requiring independent verification of birth records for Social Security accounts. Additionally, the bills mandate that aliens in the US can use a valid foreign passport or immigration document to establish their identity to federal employees. Aliens in the United States can use a valid foreign passport or immigration document issued by DHS or the Department of Justice to establish their identity to federal employees. Other documents are not accepted for this purpose. The DHS is responsible for enforcing immigration laws and securing the border through its agencies like CBP and ICE. Other federal agencies also have roles in immigration enforcement. The 9/11 Commission emphasized the importance of a border security system that can identify individuals entering the United States. Proposals following the Commission's recommendations called for increased resources to enhance border security. The bills implementing the 9/11 Commission recommendations aim to improve border security by increasing the number of border patrol agents, immigration investigators, and consular officers. They also focus on enhancing training for immigration enforcement officials and deploying technologies like biometrics for document authentication. The bills aim to improve border security by implementing measures such as biometrics for document authentication, increasing appropriations for pre-inspection at foreign airports, expediting construction of barriers at the San Diego border, continuous surveillance of the Southwest border with remotely piloted aircraft, and implementing an advanced technology security pilot program on the Northern border. An advanced technology security pilot program is being implemented on the Northern border of the United States as part of efforts to improve border security. The program is a Senate-passed initiative aimed at enhancing surveillance and monitoring capabilities. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) outlines rules for aliens entering and staying in the United States, along with procedures for entry and removal. Federal law imposes penalties for activities like smuggling illegal aliens or committing document fraud to violate immigration laws. S. 2845 proposed increasing criminal penalties for such conduct. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 increased penalties for document fraud, alien smuggling, and false claims of U.S. citizenship. It included some immigration provisions from S. 2845 but not all. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 included immigration-related provisions from S. 2845, such as accelerated deployment of the biometric entry and exit system and in-person consular interviews for nonimmigrant visa applicants. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 included provisions for enhanced immigration security measures, such as expanding pre-inspection programs at foreign airports, requiring individuals entering the United States to have proper documentation, and improving technology and training for detecting terrorist travel. It also established the Human Smuggling and Trafficking Center. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 establishes the Human Smuggling and Trafficking Center, requires oversight of DHS's responsibilities for terrorist travel, and creates a Visa and Passport Security Program. It also makes any alien deportable if they received military training from a designated terrorist organization. The act makes it grounds for removal if a nonimmigrant visa is revoked by the State Department, with review possible in a removal proceeding. It also deems any alien inadmissible and deportable for involvement in genocide, torture, extrajudicial killing, or severe violations of religious freedom while serving as a foreign official. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act requires new standards for federal use of personal identification documents like birth certificates and driver's licenses to enhance security. States can receive grants to implement these standards. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act authorizes additional resources for enforcement, including increasing consular officers and border patrol agents annually. ICE investigators are also to be increased by at least 800 each year from FY2006 through FY2010. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act mandates an increase in ICE investigators by at least 800 annually from FY2006 through FY2010. It also requires an increase of 8,000 beds for immigration detention and removal operations. Additionally, the act establishes a pilot program for advanced border security technologies and surveillance along the northern border of the United States. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act increases penalties for alien smuggling and requires outreach programs to educate the public about the consequences of illegally bringing in and harboring aliens."
