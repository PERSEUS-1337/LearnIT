    "content": "Title VI of the Higher Education Act authorizes grants to institutions for enhancing foreign language and area studies instruction. This program has a historical significance in establishing area studies departments in colleges and universities. The FLAS program, supported by HEA Title VI, has a long history of promoting foreign language and area studies in colleges and universities. It is a priority for the federal government due to its importance in diplomacy, national security, and trade competitiveness. Recent interest in FLAS has grown due to concerns about terrorism from regions not commonly included in American curricula. The program may be up for reauthorization. Title VI programs under the Higher Education Act (HEA) may be up for reauthorization by the 110th Congress. The funding for Title VI remained at $93.1 million in FY2007 and $95.6 million in FY2008. The U.S. Department of Education has discretion in allocating funds among specific activities supported by Title VI. The U.S. Department of Education has discretion in allocating funds for Title VI programs under the Higher Education Act. The Higher Education Amendments of 1998 authorized Title VI funding through December 31, 2005, with specific authorization levels for Parts A, B, and C. The statutory authorities in the HEA expired in FY2004 but have been extended. The last specific authorization was for FY1999, with funding allocated for Part A, Part B, and Part C. The Higher Education Act authorized funding for Title VI programs in FY1999, with $80 million for Part A, $18 million for Part B, and $10 million for Part C. Approximately three-fifths of the funds were used for National Language and Area Centers (NLACs) and FLAS Fellowships. NLAC grant recipients also receive grants for FLAS Fellowships. Under HEA Title VI programs, funds are allocated competitively for National Language and Area Centers and FLAS Fellowships, with an emphasis on excellence in selection. Other smaller supplementary programs support specific goals or the primary programs. The FY2002 Department of Education Appropriations Act (P.L. 107-116) specifies the allocation of funds for National Language and Area Centers, FLAS Fellowship recipients, and Language Resource Centers, emphasizing equitable distribution and excellence in selection. The Act also outlines provisions for specific languages or world regions in which aided students are to specialize. The FY2002 Department of Education Appropriations Act (P.L. 107-116) and subsequent legislation for FY2004 specified the allocation of funds for language and area centers, emphasizing equitable distribution and excellence in selection. The guidance aims to sustain investments in training experts with foreign language proficiency and cross-cultural skills in targeted world regions. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 (P.L. 108-447) and conference report (H.Rept. 108-792) allocate funds for language and area centers to enhance foreign language capacity and international expertise in strategic world areas important to national security interests. One percent of the total appropriation is earmarked for program evaluation, national outreach, and information dissemination. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 allocates funds for language and area centers to enhance foreign language capacity and international expertise. One percent of the total appropriation is designated for program evaluation, national outreach, and information dissemination. Additionally, $1,500,000 is allocated for an independent review of Title VI programs by the National Research Council. The National Foreign Language Center at the University of Maryland is a significant source of evaluations for HEA Title VI programs. Funds under the International Research and Studies program can be used for assessing the effects of these programs, including the utilization of program graduates. The ED has provided funds for the EELIAS Project to evaluate HEA Title VI programs and the Fulbright-Hays program. The project aims to develop performance indicators, an Internet-based data reporting system, and evaluate each Title VI program. The EELIAS Project aims to evaluate HEA Title VI programs and the Fulbright-Hays program by developing performance indicators, an Internet-based data reporting system, and conducting internal and external evaluations over a five-year period. A 2000 report assessed the impact of foreign language components only. The report concludes that HEA Title VI support is critical for maintaining the nation's capacity in less commonly taught languages, which are strategically important for the United States. IHEs receiving Title VI NLAC grants enroll a significant percentage of graduate students in these languages. Title VI grants have supported the development of textbooks for Less Commonly Taught Languages. The Higher Education Act may be up for reauthorization during the 110th Congress, with discussions on increasing interaction between American society and cultures worldwide. This is seen as important for national security concerns. It is important for our nation to provide education and support for people to acquire advanced knowledge of the language and culture of nations of current concern, such as Afghanistan. Ongoing support for instruction in all major and minor languages and cultures is crucial as it is impossible to predict which nations will generate concern in the future. The question is whether federal support should be provided for instruction in critical foreign languages and cultures, including those with major security or trade interests. This support could be focused on colleges, universities, or federally-operated institutions dedicated to teaching government employees. The federal government operates two foreign language schools, the Defense Language Institute Foreign Language Center in Monterey, California, and the Foreign Service Institute School for Language Studies in Arlington, Virginia, to meet direct foreign language requirements. Title VI provides grants to IHEs for educational programs in specific subject areas, differing from the HEA's student aid approach. Title VI of the Higher Education Act provides institutional aid and fellowships for specific subject areas, unlike most other forms of financial aid which are focused on high-need institutions. This targeted approach requires specific justification, as it supports advanced study in a particular field. The primary argument for supporting Title VI departure from general HEA strategy is the importance of advanced study in foreign languages and regions for national security, defense, and economic competitiveness. Advocates believe maintaining research and instructional programs in critical foreign language and area studies is a national priority that should be supported in federally-operated institutions and colleges accessible to the Nation. Foreign language and area studies are crucial for national security, defense, and economic competitiveness. These skills are essential for national defense, diplomacy, international trade, and increasing understanding of foreign cultures. Research and language instruction improvements are more likely to occur in IHEs than federal institutions. The quality of FLAS programs relies on linkages between American and foreign educational institutions. The development of linkages between American and foreign educational institutions is crucial for national security and economic competitiveness. Colleges and universities find it easier to establish ties compared to federal government institutions. Support for specific subject areas under HEA Title VI is not unique, as other federal agencies also provide support to IHEs on a larger scale. Examples include support for health care education and training. Support for specific subject areas under HEA Title VI is not unique, as other federal agencies also provide support to IHEs on a larger scale. Examples include health care education and training by the National Institutes of Health and other agencies of the Department of Health and Human Services, and science and mathematics education by the National Science Foundation. Each subject area is considered of special national interest and deserving of targeted federal support. It could be argued that sufficient student interest may lead to adequate instruction and research in critical foreign languages and area studies without federal subsidies. Efforts may be made to utilize language skills of recent immigrants for foreign language and area studies programs at colleges and universities. Private foundations have supported FLAS programs, and federal aid under Title VI could be limited to start-up costs rather than ongoing expenses. \"Various entities like IHEs, foundations, and corporations support FLAS programs by providing funds or in-kind support. Title VI proponents argue for federal aid to support rare language instruction due to lack of individual incentives. Without targeted federal aid, ongoing support for critical languages like Pashto or Farsi may be at risk.\" Title VI funding is crucial for supporting FLAS programs in U.S. colleges and universities. However, there are concerns about the adequacy and focus of the support provided. The report focuses on the reauthorization of Title VI by the 109th Congress and questions whether it is effectively coordinated with other related programs. Title VI funding supports FLAS programs in U.S. colleges and universities. Questions arise about its coordination with other related programs and the potential for consolidation to improve efficiency. The purpose of Title VI is to coordinate federal programs in foreign language, area studies, and international studies. The Fulbright-Hays Act authorizes international exchange activities for graduate students and scholars in various fields, administered by the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs of the Department of State. The Fulbright-Hays Act supports international exchange activities for graduate students and scholars in various fields, including foreign travel-related activities for American graduate students and professors. These activities are available to U.S. citizens only. The NSEP, under the David L. Boren National Security Education Act, provides aid for international education and foreign language studies for American undergraduate and graduate students. Three types of assistance are authorized: scholarships for undergraduate students to study in critical foreign countries, grants to institutions of higher education to establish programs. Total appropriation for ED's Fulbright-Hays programs was $12.9 million for FY2003. The NSEP, established under the David L. Boren National Security Education Act, provides aid for international education and foreign language studies for American undergraduate and graduate students. It offers scholarships for undergraduate students to study in critical foreign countries, grants to institutions of higher education to establish programs, and fellowships to graduate students for education abroad or in the U.S. Individuals who receive NSEP fellowships and scholarships are required to seek employment in a national security position for a limited period of time. The NSEP program offers scholarships for students to study in critical foreign countries and grants to institutions for educational programs. Recipients are required to seek employment in national security or work in higher education related to their scholarship. The National Security Education Program (NSEP) offers scholarships for students to study critical foreign languages and grants to institutions for educational programs. A revised strategy for institutional grants includes a Flagship Language Initiative focused on advanced study of key foreign languages. This initiative was initiated in 2002 and authorized by P.L. 107-306. The NSEP aims to complement, not duplicate, foreign language and area studies programs authorized under HEA Title VI and other legislation. The National Security Education Program (NSEP) offers scholarships for students to study critical foreign languages and grants to institutions for educational programs. NSEP has unique elements such as a service requirement and support for travel grants to undergraduate students. Administered by the Department of Defense's National Defense University, NSEP aims to complement existing language and area studies programs authorized under HEA Title VI. The National Security Education Program (NSEP) is overseen by the Security Education Board (NSEB) to determine critical areas for national security. NSEP grants are administered through non-governmental organizations like the Institute of International Education (IIE) for undergraduate students and the Academy for Educational Development (AED) for graduate fellowship competitions. The NSEP began making grants in academic year 1994-1995, with funding levels fluctuating over the years. The program faced potential elimination in the 104th Congress but was ultimately reduced to $75 million. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2003 set the annual funding level at $8 million, with additional appropriations authorized. The NSEP differs from HEA Title VI in that it has a service requirement. The NSEP, unlike HEA Title VI, has a service requirement, focuses on national security-related FLAS skill needs, is funded through a trust fund, and supports international travel for undergraduate students. Administered by DOD, it is smaller in scale and authorized by the International Academic Opportunity Act of 2000. Scholarships of up to $5,000 are available for U.S. citizen undergraduate students for travel costs. The scholarships for undergraduate students can be used for travel and study abroad expenses. Eligibility requires being a recipient of financial aid through the Pell Grant program. Preference is given to students who have not previously studied abroad, and there are no specific restrictions on subjects or regions, except for Cuba or countries under a travel warning. The Gilman program provides study abroad opportunities for students who may not otherwise be able to participate. In the 2002-2003 academic year, 179 students received Gilman Scholarships administered by the Department of State. The Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE) administers programs to foster innovative approaches in U.S. postsecondary education. FIPSE, authorized by Title VII, Part B of the HEA, supports innovative approaches in U.S. postsecondary education. It offers grants for international education programs through specific programs like the Program for North American Mobility in Higher Education, U.S.-Brazil Higher Education Consortia Program, and European Community-United States Cooperation Program. Grants are awarded through competition to U.S. IHEs to collaborate with foreign institutions. The curr_chunk discusses the funding levels and programs offered by FIPSE for international education collaborations with foreign institutions. It questions whether these programs should be consolidated under a coordinated national strategy for efficiency. The curr_chunk discusses the potential consolidation of federal programs serving similar purposes to enhance efficiency under a coordinated national strategy. The Fulbright-Hays, FIPSE, and NSEP institutional grant programs are similar to HEA Title VI activities and may already be coordinated to some extent. The curr_chunk suggests that while the Fulbright-Hays, FIPSE, and NSEP programs are already somewhat coordinated under ED's Office of Postsecondary Education Programs, further consolidation or oversight by a single board could enhance efficiency. The NSEP's focus on national security needs and service requirements set it apart from other programs, making coordination more aligned with its goals than full consolidation with Title VI and related programs. The NSEP is currently coordinated with other programs under ED's Office of Postsecondary Education Programs, but there are suggestions for further consolidation. The efficiency of operating a separate program like NSEP alongside Title VI is being questioned due to funding issues. The Gilman International Scholarship Program also funds undergraduate students for travel abroad. The Gilman Scholarship Program funds undergraduate students for international travel, but lacks the national security focus of NSEP. There are proposals to transfer the program to the Department of Education and consolidate it under Title VI of the Higher Education Act. Additionally, suggestions include establishing a multi-agency board or federal entity to coordinate all foreign language and international studies programs. One proposal is to establish a multi-agency board or federal entity to coordinate foreign language and international studies programs, including those funded by the Department of Education and Title VI of the Higher Education Act. This board would focus on long-range planning to meet the nation's needs for specialists in foreign languages. Currently, HEA Title VI grants are dispersed across various languages and regions, including critical areas. Should there be more coordination between federal language training institutions and IHEs supported by Title VI? Title VI grants support study of critical areas like the Middle East and South Asia, as well as Western Europe. While the definition of \"critical\" regions may change, a stable group can be identified for funding. The funding for Title VI grants supports the study of critical regions such as the Middle East, South Asia, and Western Europe. There is a question of who should decide how funds are allocated for different languages or regions, whether it be the Department of Education, an interagency advisory body, a new entity, or Congress. Matching federal funds with non-federal resources is required for several HEA Title VI programs. The HEA Title VI programs require federal funds to be matched with non-federal resources, attracting additional funds from various sources. However, there are concerns about whether the program's scale is sufficient to meet national needs. Opponents question increased targeting of grants for languages and regions. Opponents argue against increased targeting of HEA Title VI grants for specific languages and regions, citing the difficulty in predicting future critical areas. They suggest relying on the initiative of IHEs to propose grants for a comprehensive range of languages and regions, rather than directing grants through a central coordinating body. The annual survey conducted as part of the NSEP identifies foreign languages, world regions, and disciplines of major national security interest. It does not quantify individual language needs but highlights areas that are infrequently taught in colleges. The General Accounting Office conducted a study on language needs in federal departments, highlighting shortages of translators, interpreters, diplomats, and intelligence specialists due to the changing security environment and globalization of the U.S. economy. The General Accounting Office study identified shortages of translators, interpreters, diplomats, and intelligence specialists with critical foreign language skills, which have hindered various U.S. operations."
