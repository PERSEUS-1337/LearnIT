The Act of June 7, 1956 is amended by recognizing the Lumbee Indians of North Carolina as descendants of coastal tribes and a distinct Indian community. The State of North Carolina has acknowledged the Lumbee Indians as an Indian tribe since 1885. The Congress acknowledged the Lumbee Indians as an Indian tribe in 1956 but did not grant them the benefits and privileges of federal recognition. Now, the Congress finds that the Lumbee Indians should receive full federal recognition and the accompanying benefits and privileges. The Congress finds that the Lumbee Indians should receive full federal recognition and the accompanying benefits and privileges. The Act of June 7, 1956 is amended to extend federal recognition to the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina, ensuring that all laws and regulations applicable to Indians and Indian tribes apply to them and their members. The Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina, as determined under section 3(c), can petition for tribal acknowledgment under part 83 of title 25 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Members are eligible for services and benefits provided to federally recognized tribes, with those residing in specific North Carolina counties considered to be on or near an Indian reservation. Verification by the Secretary of the Interior is required. Upon verification of a tribal roll, the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Health and Human Services will collaborate with the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina to determine needs and budget for eligible services. This information will be included in the first budget request to Congress after verification. The tribal roll in effect at the enactment of this section will define the service population of the tribe, subject to verification by the Secretary of the Interior. Verification will confirm compliance with membership criteria in the tribe's constitution adopted on November 11, 2000. Lands conveyed to the United States by the tribe will be treated as 'on-reservation' trust acquisitions. The Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina's lands in Robeson County may be treated as 'on-reservation' trust acquisitions. North Carolina has jurisdiction over criminal offenses and civil actions on these lands owned by the tribe. The Secretary of the Interior can accept such acquisitions. The Secretary of the Interior can accept transfers of jurisdiction from the State of North Carolina to the United States on behalf of the Lumbee Tribe. This transfer may only occur after an agreement between the tribe and the state, with a 2-year waiting period. This provision does not impact the Indian Child Welfare Act. The Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 allows for the appropriation of necessary funds to carry out the Act."
