    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Homeowners Empowerment and Protection Act of 1995\". The Congress recognizes the strong interest of 65,000,000 homeowners in the US in preserving and enhancing their property value. The value of a home is closely tied to its location and the quality of the neighborhood and environment. The value of homes in the United States can be affected by various factors such as water quality, air clarity, risk of flooding, scenic beauty, wildlife abundance, and neighboring land development or industrial activities. The importance of protecting private homeowners from irresponsible actions that can harm property values is crucial for homeowners, communities, and society as a whole. Current public information and participation procedures often do not adequately notify homeowners of activities that could significantly impact their home values. Homeowners have the right to access information about activities that may reduce the value of their homes. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget must establish uniform Federal procedures for agencies to require notice for property impacting activities within 90 days of this Act. A lead agency will be designated for applications involving multiple agencies. For property impacting activities, an application means a request for authorization to conduct activities that generate pollutants or adverse impacts affecting private homes. Homeowners must receive notice through certified delivery. The applicant must provide written notice to homeowners within 1/4 mile of the site and publish notice in local newspapers at least 3 times. The agency may also notify homeowners by mail if their property is likely to be affected. The notice for property impacting activity must describe the application, potential impacts on home values, homeowners, and the public, contact information for the applicant and agency representative, and opportunities for public comment. Each agency must establish a toll-free number for homeowners to voice concerns about potential property value impacts from proposed activities and to request more information. This is in addition to existing procedures for public comment on property impacting applications. When an applicant or homeowner's property may lose value due to an authorized activity, the agency must thoroughly assess the impact on home values and explore alternative actions to minimize negative effects. SEC. 4. HOMEOWNER RIGHT OF ACTION. Whenever a person carries out an activity authorized by a permit or Federal law that generates pollutants causing a significant reduction in the value of a private home by $10,000 or more, the homeowner can take legal action against them. A homeowner can take legal action against a person who carries out an activity causing a significant reduction in the value of a private home by $10,000 or more. Before filing a lawsuit, the homeowner must provide a notice of intent to sue to the defendant and the relevant agency. If requested, the agency head will attempt to resolve the claim through a meeting with the parties involved. In any legal action under this section, the homeowner must prove that the defendant's activity caused a decrease in the home's value. Similarly affected homeowners can file class actions under rule 23 of the Federal law. In legal actions under this section, homeowners can file suit in Federal district court where their home is located. They are entitled to recover the reduction in their home's value caused by the defendant's activity, capped at the median value of nearby homes. Homeowners awarded compensation also receive reasonable attorney's fees. The court may award reasonable attorney's fees and other costs. It can also issue an injunction for violations of federal laws. The United States district court has jurisdiction over actions under this section. Frivolous lawsuits may be dismissed by the court. The court may order the plaintiff to pay the defendant's attorney's fees and expenses if the case is found to be frivolous or brought to harass. No action can be brought under this section for a private home after 5 years from the date the home's value has decreased by $10,000. The value of a home has reached $10,000. Savings provisions in the Act ensure no limitation on pursuing claims under the Constitution or any other law. Commencement of a suit or compensation under the Act is not a condition precedent for any other claim or cause of action. The Act applies to permits, licenses, approvals issued by agencies and contracts, leases, arrangements entered into after 180 days from enactment. Definitions are provided in Section 6. The Act defines key terms such as \"agency,\" \"potential to reduce the value,\" and \"private home\" as any owner-occupied dwelling, including multi-family dwellings and condominiums. The term \"reduction in value\" in the Act refers to the difference in fair market value of a private home affected by certain activities, compared to its value in the absence of such activities. The term \"person\" in the Act includes individuals, corporations, partnerships, or other entities, excluding Federal, State, or local government agencies."
