The Secretary will establish a system for registration and renewal of payroll tax deposit agents, with a fee not exceeding $100. Agents have the option to submit a bond for compliance. The system for registration and renewal of payroll tax deposit agents will include options for submitting a bond or undergoing an annual audit, requiring specific disclosures, ensuring direct notification of nonpayment of taxes, and imposing penalties for unregistered individuals. The system for registration and renewal of payroll tax deposit agents includes penalties for unregistered persons acting as payroll tax deposit agents, with fines up to $10,000 for each 90 days of noncompliance. A payroll tax deposit agent is defined as a person providing payroll processing or tax services to employers with access to their funds. The term \"employment tax\" includes unemployment insurance contributions. Payroll tax deposit agents can elect to submit a bond for a specified amount. The bond amount for payroll tax deposit agents ranges from $50,000 to $500,000 and is determined by the Secretary's regulations. Bonds must be in a specified form with prescribed surety. Annual audits, if elected, must be conducted by an independent third party. Annual audits for payroll tax deposit agents must be conducted by an independent third party based on audit principles determined by the Secretary. Key requirements include balancing the escrow account yearly, ensuring no commingling of funds, and no use of escrow funds for operating costs. The Secretary requires payroll tax deposit agents to disclose clients' liability for employment taxes and mechanisms for verification. The Secretary mandates that payroll tax deposit agents must provide clients with information on tax deposits, including verification mechanisms and necessary details for selecting agents. Only registered persons can make federal tax deposits on behalf of employers. The Secretary mandates regulations for payroll tax deposit agents to make federal tax deposits, file tax returns, and access confidential tax information on behalf of employers. Agents are subject to penalties for failure to collect or pay over tax. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include payroll tax deposit agents. This amendment does not affect the interpretation of section 6672. Additionally, a clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for chapter 77. The amendments regarding payroll tax deposit agents in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 will take effect upon the enactment of the Act, with penalties applying to failures after the enactment date."
