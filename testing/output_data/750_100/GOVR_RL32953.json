    "content": "Climate change responses at the national level in the United States have included monitoring power plant emissions, improving appliance efficiency, and promoting renewable energy sources. Despite these efforts, carbon dioxide emissions have continued to rise. President George W. Bush rejected the Kyoto Protocol in 2001. President George W. Bush rejected the Kyoto Protocol in 2001, which aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through legally binding commitments. The Administration's focus on voluntary initiatives to address climate change is evident in the 2002 Climate Action Report, with only six out of over 50 programs being regulatory. Several regulatory programs implemented to achieve energy or environmental goals inadvertently reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Congressional proposals in the 109th Congress aimed to enhance monitoring of greenhouse gas emissions for research purposes. The 109th Congress proposed measures to improve monitoring of greenhouse gas emissions for research and development, enact a market-oriented reduction program similar to the current acid rain program, and implement energy programs to reduce greenhouse gases. This report focuses on comparing the provisions of two bills in the second category. The report compares two proposals from the Senate's debate on the Energy Policy Act of 2005, focusing on reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions through market-based mechanisms and encouraging innovation in carbon-intensive technologies. The bill, similar to past proposals, aims to reduce emissions through market-based mechanisms and innovation in carbon-intensive technologies. It would require economy-wide reductions, allowing participation in international trading systems and carbon sequestration programs. The bill aims to reduce emissions through market-based mechanisms and innovation in carbon-intensive technologies. It excludes residential and agricultural sources of greenhouse gases and entities emitting less than 10,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents annually. Senator Bingaman's draft amendment is based on the National Commission on Energy Policy's report, calling for a mandatory, economy-wide tradeable permit program to limit greenhouse gases. The Climate and Economy Insurance Act of 2005 would mandate an accelerated reduction in the country's economy's greenhouse gas intensity. The draft amendment mandates a 2.4% annual reduction in greenhouse gas emissions per dollar of GDP between 2010 and 2019, increasing to 2.8% annually after 2019. It includes a market-oriented allowance trading program with a cost-limiting safety valve allowing entities to make payments to DOE instead of reducing emissions. Initial payment price is set at $7 per ton in 2010. The draft amendment allows entities to make payments to DOE instead of reducing emissions at a price of $7 per ton in 2010. It aims to reduce greenhouse gas intensity rather than placing an absolute cap on emissions from covered entities like S. 1151. Uncovered emissions are expected to continue rising under this proposal. Under the draft amendment, U.S. emissions are expected to grow if economic growth outpaces reductions in emissions intensity. A cost-limiting \"safety valve\" allows entities to purchase tradeable allowances or make payments to DOE at a set price. Unlike S. 1151, there is no provision for reducing uncovered emissions. The comparison between S.1151 and the draft amendment includes differences in price limits, covered entities, agency responsibilities, credit generation, and allowance sale/auction proceeds utilization. Emission reduction estimates for both options involve uncertainty. The estimates provided in Table 2 for emission reduction under both options involve uncertainty, particularly for the draft amendment. In 2004, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) analyzed an earlier version of S. 1151, predicting a 6.7% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2010. This contrasts with CRS's estimate of a 2.5% reduction in emissions for the draft amendment. The CRS did not estimate longer-term reductions from either S. 1151 or the draft amendment due to uncertainty. Greenhouse gas emissions would likely continue to increase under both options, albeit more slowly than business-as-usual. The initial reduction in emissions achieved in 2010 would be slowly eroded over time, with uncontrolled emissions increasing under S. 1151 and covered emissions growing under the draft amendment. Under the draft amendment, covered emissions would continue to grow if economic growth outstripped the annual reduction in carbon intensity. Emissions could potentially rise faster under the draft amendment compared to S. 1151. The draft amendment's estimates for emissions reductions under S. 1151 may be understated or overstated due to uncertainties. Calculations are based on projected GDP and carbon intensity improvements. The draft amendment's estimates for emissions reductions under S. 1151 are uncertain, with the primary source of uncertainty being the number of covered entities. Higher coverage could lead to more reductions than estimated, while lower coverage may result in lower compliance costs but greater uncertainty. The draft amendment introduces uncertainties regarding emissions reductions, with a future baseline calculated from projections of 2009 GDP growth and carbon intensity improvement. Economic growth projections range from 2.5% to 3.6% annually, with a reference case at 3.1% annually. The draft amendment introduces uncertainties regarding emissions reductions, with a future baseline calculated from projections of 2009 GDP growth and carbon intensity improvement. The estimate of 3.1% annual GDP growth could be off by 20% or more, and carbon intensity improvement projections are uncertain. Current intensity levels are higher than projected under the President's Climate Change Initiative. The draft amendment raises questions about coverage and uncertainties in achieving emissions reductions. The safety valve could trigger at a $7 per ton of carbon dioxide level. The Energy Information Administration's analysis projects uncertainty in achieving emission reductions under the draft amendment, particularly in the longer term. The projected cost under S. 1151 is more uncertain due to future growth in greenhouse gas emissions by covered entities. Any increased emissions from economic growth would need to be offset under S. 1151. The potential costs of S. 1151 are uncertain due to varying estimates on permit prices and the impact of economic growth on emissions. Higher economic growth would require more emissions to be offset, leading to higher costs, while lower economic growth would result in fewer reductions and lower costs. The potential costs of S. 1151 are uncertain due to varying estimates on permit prices and the impact of economic growth on emissions. A market-based allowance trading system could increase costs if options are restricted, with estimates ranging from $9 to $15 per ton. The draft amendment's cost estimates are less sensitive to these factors. The draft amendment requires less emission reductions than S. 1151 and incorporates economic growth into its emissions limitation target, allowing for some increase in future emissions if projected economic growth exceeds the mandated improvement in greenhouse gas intensity. This results in fewer offsets required and lower costs. The draft amendment's projected cost is influenced by the availability of cost-effective control measures like energy efficiency improvements and carbon sequestration. The draft amendment focuses on cost-effective carbon sequestration and non-CO2 greenhouse gas reductions, with a projected permit price of $5 a ton in 2010. The safety valve limits the upside risk to $7 a ton. No international trading uncertainty is introduced, unlike in S. 1151. The draft amendment projects a permit price of $4.8 - $5.9 a ton in 2001 dollars, with a safety valve to limit costs. Market-based mechanisms focus on emissions levels or compliance costs for efficient solutions. Market-based mechanisms, such as tradeable permit programs or carbon taxes, set limits on emissions or costs while allowing the marketplace to determine the actual outcomes. The preference for one system over the other depends on how one views the uncertainty of costs and benefits involved. The effectiveness of a safety valve in reducing CO2 emissions depends on the view of costs and benefits. A tradeable permit program may be suitable for those confident in achieving CO2 reduction benefits, as it allows for efficient handling of costs through permit trading. The effectiveness of a safety valve in reducing CO2 emissions depends on the view of costs and benefits. A safety valve can cap the marginal cost of control for emitters, allowing for more certainty in cost management. The safety valve on the draft amendment could be seen as a contingent carbon tax, raising a major policy question about economic costs and emission reduction goals. S. 1151 leans towards total emissions reduction, while the draft amendment leans towards price control. The draft amendment and S. 1151 propose market-based systems to limit greenhouse gas emissions, but differ in their approach. S. 1151 sets an absolute cap on emissions for covered entities, allowing trading under the cap, while the draft amendment limits emissions intensity with a cost-limiting safety valve. Both proposals would likely reduce short-term U.S. emissions below business-as-usual levels, with S. 1151 leading to larger and more certain reductions. Under both proposals, total U.S. emissions could be expected to continue their upward trend, albeit at a slower rate than currently forecasted."
