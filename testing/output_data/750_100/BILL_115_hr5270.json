    "content": "The \"Electricity Reliability and Fuel Security Act\" establishes a federal tax credit for coal-powered electric generation units under section 45T of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Electricity Reliability and Fuel Security Act\" provides a tax credit for coal-powered electric generation units under section 45T of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The credit is equal to 30% of qualified expenses or $13 multiplied by the unit's capacity rating in kilowatts. The \"Electricity Reliability and Fuel Security Act\" offers a tax credit for coal-powered electric generation units that use coal for at least 75% of electricity production. Qualified expenses refer to costs for operating or maintaining the unit, excluding coal expenses. Qualified public entities can transfer the credit under certain conditions. The tax credit can be transferred to the eligible project partner if the entity elects to do so. The eligible project partner, not the qualified public entity, will be treated as the taxpayer for the credit. The definition of a 'public entity' includes Federal, State, or local government entities, mutual or cooperative electric companies, and not-for-profit electric utilities that have received a loan under the Rural Electrification Act of 1936. Eligible project partners can receive the tax credit if the entity chooses to transfer it. Eligible project partners for coal-powered electric generation units include those responsible for operating, maintaining, repairing, providing coal, financing construction or operation, or leasing the unit. Special rules apply to partnerships for claiming the tax credit for coal-powered electric generation units. A qualified public entity is treated as the taxpayer for their share of the credit, and any partner of the partnership is considered an eligible project partner. The tax credit for coal-powered electric generation units allows eligible project partners to take the credit in the first taxable year ending with or after the qualified public entity's taxable year. Transfer of benefits to eligible project partners is subject to private use rules. The tax credit for coal-powered electric generation units allows eligible project partners to claim the credit without it being considered private business use. The basis of the property is reduced by the amount of the credit allowed. This section applies to taxable years between December 31, 2017, and January 1, 2023. A conforming amendment is made to Section 501(c)(12)(I). The tax credit for coal-powered electric generation units is amended to include a new clause for the credit determined under section 45T. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1. The tax credit for coal-powered electric generation units is amended to include a new clause for the credit determined under section 45T."
