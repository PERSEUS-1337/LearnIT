The Act amends the deduction limitation for policyholder dividends by mutual life insurance companies to 30% of life insurance company taxable income, with a minimum limit of $35,000,000. Stock life insurance companies are treated as mutual if certain conditions are met. Stock life insurance companies can be treated as mutual if at least 80 percent of the total voting power or value of shares is owned by one or more mutual life insurance companies. Repeal of Section 809 in the tax code related to mutual life insurance companies. Amendments made to sections 807 and 812 regarding policyholders' share of tax-exempt interest. Amendments were made to sections 817 and 842 of the tax code by striking certain paragraphs and redesignating others. The effective date for these amendments is for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1994, with an exception for recomputation under section 809(f). The amendments made by this section do not impact the application of section 809(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 before its repeal. For life insurance companies subject to the limitation under section 808(b)(2), no capital loss from a taxable year after December 31, 1994, can be carried back to a year before January 1, 1995. Small life insurance companies are exempt from capitalizing certain policy acquisition expenses under Section 848 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. This exemption applies to taxable years starting after December 31, 1994. Additionally, there is a sense of Congress regarding the use of increased revenues. The Congress intends for any revenue increase from the amendments to be used for deficit reduction, tax incentives for small life insurance companies, and programs benefiting children's nutrition, education, housing, and family support."
