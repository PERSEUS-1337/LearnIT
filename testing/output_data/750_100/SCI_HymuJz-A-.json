    "content": "The text discusses the limitations of modern machine vision algorithms in learning visual relations, particularly when faced with high intra-class variability. It highlights how convolutional neural networks struggle with visual-relation problems and break down when rote memorization is not feasible. Additionally, it introduces relational networks as a potential solution for solving complex visual question answering tasks. Feedback mechanisms like working memory and attention are crucial for abstract visual reasoning, as seen in the success of biological vision. Deep CNNs struggle with complex visual tasks, but relational networks offer a potential solution. The CNN, trained on millions of photographs, accurately categorized images into one thousand natural object categories, surpassing human accuracy on the ImageNet challenge. However, it failed to learn the relation between two curves in a simple binary image, a task that is intuitive to human observers. This highlights the limitations of CNNs in understanding complex visual relationships. Contemporary computer vision algorithms, including CNNs, struggle to learn the concept of \"sameness\" as exemplified by simple images, despite being able to accurately detect objects in complex photographs. This limitation has been overlooked in the field. The limitations of modern computer vision algorithms, such as CNNs and relational networks (RNs), in recognizing visual relations, particularly in tasks like same-different comparisons, have been highlighted. RNs, despite their success on VQA benchmarks, have only been tested on toy datasets, showing similar limitations as CNNs. This failure to grasp the concept of \"sameness\" is a significant issue in contemporary computer vision research. The limitations of modern computer vision algorithms, such as CNNs and relational networks (RNs), in recognizing visual relations have been highlighted. Previous work showed that black-box classifiers fail on most tasks from the synthetic visual reasoning test (SVRT), despite massive amounts of training data. Previous work has demonstrated the limitations of CNNs and relational networks in solving visual-relation problems, as shown by the failure of various models on the SVRT tasks. BID4, BID12, and BID26's experiments revealed that feedforward neural networks struggle with these tasks, raising questions about the choice of hyperparameters or a systematic failure of the models. In a series of experiments, the limitations of CNNs and relational networks in solving visual-relation tasks were demonstrated. These constraints were not overcome by relational networks designed for such problems. The ability of primates to reason about visual relations is attributed to brain mechanisms like working memory and attention. The study highlights the need for feedback mechanisms in computer vision models to tackle complex visual reasoning tasks. Three main contributions are outlined: a performance analysis of CNN architectures on SVRT problems, a visual-relation challenge revealing CNNs' reliance on rote memorization for same-different tasks, and a modification to the sort-of-CLEVR challenge to improve relational reasoning. The SVRT challenge presents twenty-three binary classification problems based on abstract rules, aiming to inspire the computer vision community to rethink visual question answering challenges and draw inspiration from neuroscience and cognitive science for designing visual reasoning architectures. In problem 9, positive examples have three items, the largest in between two smaller ones. Nine CNNs were trained on each of the twenty-three SVRT problems, with the best-performing network's accuracies ranked. The study tested CNNs of different depths and receptive field sizes for high-throughput analysis. CNNs performed better on spatial-relation problems compared to same-different problems. A single problem required detecting both relations simultaneously. The study tested CNNs with different depths and receptive field sizes on spatial-relation and same-different problems. They generated 2 million examples for each of the twenty-three problems, split evenly into training and test sets. The networks were trained using an ADAM optimizer with a base learning rate of \u03b7 = 10 \u22124. The best networks' accuracy for each problem was sorted and colored red or blue based on SVRT problem descriptions. The study tested CNNs on spatial-relation and same-different problems, sorting accuracy by SVRT descriptions. SD problems with words like \"same\" were colored red, while SR problems with phrases like \"left of\" were colored blue. CNNs performed worse on SD than SR problems, with some SD problems showing low accuracy. The study found that CNNs struggled with same-different (SD) problems, with some SD tasks resulting in accuracy not much better than chance. Larger networks performed better on SD problems, while spatial-relation (SR) problems were equally well-learned across all network configurations. This aligns with earlier evidence of a visual-relation dichotomy and highlights the challenges SD tasks pose to CNNs. Experiment 1 confirms previous findings that feedforward models struggle with visual-relation problems like BID6, BID12, BID4, and BID22. The SVRT challenge, while useful, has limitations in its sample size and representation of visual relations. The SVRT challenge presents a limited sample of visual relations, with images categorized based on same/different and horizontal/vertical patterns. The SVRT challenge involves different problems with unique image structures, making direct comparisons challenging. For example, Problem 2 requires one large and one small object, conflicting with Problem 1 where items must be identically-sized and positioned. The SVRT challenge involves problems with varying object numbers and sizes in images, making direct comparisons difficult. Using closed curves as objects in SVRT images hinders quantification of image variability and task difficulty. It is unclear how image generation parameters affect task difficulty within a single problem. The PSVRT challenge addresses issues with SVRT by creating a new dataset with two problems: Spatial Relations (SR) and Same-Different (SD). SR involves classifying images based on horizontal or vertical arrangement, while SD involves classifying images based on similarity. The image generator in the PSVRT challenge produces gray-scale images with square binary bit patterns on a blank background. It uses parameters like item size, image size, and number of items to control image variability. The image generator in the PSVRT challenge produces gray-scale images with square binary bit patterns on a blank background. Parameters like item size, image size, and number of items control image variability and spatial extent. The number of items also affects item and spatial variability, with the SD and SR category labels determined by the presence of identical items and average orientation of displacements. The PSVRT challenge generates gray-scale images with binary bit patterns on a blank background, with parameters controlling image variability. Each image is created by selecting a joint class label for SD and SR, sampling the first item, and potentially creating identical copies based on the SD label. The PSVRT challenge involves generating gray-scale images with binary bit patterns on a blank background, with parameters controlling image variability. Images are created by selecting a joint class label for SD and SR, sampling the first item, and potentially creating identical copies based on the SD label. In the experiment, a baseline architecture was used to examine the difficulty of learning PSVRT problems over a range of image variability parameters. Items are consecutively sampled and randomly placed in an image grid with background spacing. The image distribution is kept identical between different problem types by always drawing class labels for both problems. The study focused on training a baseline architecture to learn PSVRT problems with different image variability parameters. Training sessions measured the number of examples needed to reach 95% accuracy, serving as a measure of problem difficulty. The network was trained from scratch in all conditions to estimate the challenge of fitting the training data. The study aimed to estimate the difficulty of fitting training data for PSVRT problems by varying image parameters in three sub-experiments. Each condition trained a baseline CNN from scratch with 20 million images, reporting the best-case result for minimum TTA. The study trained a baseline CNN with 20 million images, reporting the best-case result for minimum TTA. The network had four convolution and pool layers, followed by four fully-connected layers with dropout in the last layer. An ADAM optimizer with a base learning rate of 10^-4 was used. The study used an ADAM optimizer with a base learning rate of 10^-4 and Xavier method for weight initialization. Experiments were also conducted with a larger network size. A strong dichotomy in learning curves was observed, with a sudden rise in accuracy from chance-level termed as the \"learning event\". The study observed a dramatic rise in accuracy from chance-level, termed the \"learning event\". Training runs that exhibited this event almost always reached 95% accuracy within 20 million images. A strong bi-modality in final accuracy was noted - either chance-level or close to 100%. Minimum TTA in each experimental condition was reported in FIG1, with no straining effect found in SR. In SR, no straining effect was found across all image parameters. The learning event occurred immediately after training began, with accuracy reaching 95% soon after. In SD, a significant straining effect was observed with image size and number of items. Increasing image size led to higher TTA and decreased likelihood of learning. The network learned SD in 7 out of 10 random initializations for baseline parameters, but only in 4 out of 10 on 120 \u00d7 120 images. Image sizes of 150 \u00d7 150 and above never resulted in learning SD. The network never learned the problem when there were 3 or more items in an image, even with a relaxation of the same-different rule. The CNN failed to learn for any parameter configuration. Increasing the number of \"same\" templates strains CNNs due to the exponential relationship between image size and item number, leading to a quadratic-rate increase in image variability with larger sizes and an exponential-rate increase with more items. This strain is equally strong between two CNNs with more than a twofold difference. Increasing item size did not have a visible straining effect on CNNs, unlike the exponential relationship between image size and item number. Learnability remains stable across different item sizes, suggesting the possibility of constructing feedforward feature detectors that can generalize to coordinated item variability. When CNNs learn a PSVRT condition, they build a feature set tailored for a specific dataset rather than learning the rule itself. These features should be minimally sensitive to irrelevant image variations. The CNN in the experiment showed increasing TTA with image variability, suggesting learned features are not rule-detectors but templates. The Relational Network (RN) is designed to detect visual relations and sits on top of a CNN to learn from pairs of high-level features. The Relational Network (RN) is a feedforward network that learns from pairs of high-level CNN feature vectors to answer relational questions. It outperformed a baseline CNN on visual reasoning tasks, including the \"sort-of-CLEVR\" VQA task with simple 2D items. The sort-of-CLEVR tasks involve two shapes (circle or square) and six colors (yellow, green, orange, blue, red, gray). The RN is trained to answer relational and non-relational questions but lacks in teaching the concept of sameness and has low item variability. The RN is encouraged to solve relational problems through rote memorization of item configurations. Training the model on a two-item sort-of-CLEVR same-different task and PSVRT stimuli aimed to measure the RN's ability to transfer concepts and benchmark visual reasoning models. Architecture details: Software used for relational networks available at https://github.com/gitlimlab/Relation-Network-Tensorflow. The model architecture included a convolutional network with four layers, a 4-layer MLP with 256 units, a 3-layer MLP with 256 units, ReLu activations, 50% dropout, and softmax output. The system was trained with cross-entropy loss. The model architecture included a convolutional network with four layers, a 4-layer MLP with 256 units, a 3-layer MLP with 256 units, ReLu activations, 50% dropout, and softmax output. The layer was passed through a softmax function and trained with cross-entropy loss using an ADAM optimizer with a base learning rate of 2.5 \u00d7 10 \u22124. Weights were initialized using Xavier initialization. The model was able to reproduce results from BID22 on the sort-of-CLEVR task by constructing twelve different versions of the dataset, each missing one of the twelve possible color+shape combinations. The CNN+RN architecture was trained to detect the sameness of two scene items with 95% training accuracy. However, it did not generalize well to left-out color+shape combinations on the sort-of-CLEVR task. The model learns faster than CNNs on PSVRT due to the limited number of color+shape combinations in each setup. The CNN+RN architecture learns orders of magnitude faster than CNNs on PSVRT stimuli but struggles with generalization to left-out color+shape combinations on the sort-of-CLEVR task. The average training accuracy curve rises rapidly to around 90%, but the average validation accuracy remains at chance, indicating a lack of transfer of same-different ability to the left-out condition. The CNN+RN architecture learns quickly on PSVRT stimuli but struggles with generalization to left-out color+shape combinations on the sort-of-CLEVR task. Training on 20M images with image size varied from 30 to 180 pixels, the CNN+RN behaves like a vanilla CNN, initially performing at chance-level but eventually reaching over 95% accuracy. The CNN+RN architecture achieves over 95% accuracy on images up to size 120, but struggles with larger sizes like 150 and 180. This limitation may be due to the representational capacity of the RN architecture, which can solve some tasks but not all, indicating that visual-relation problems can exceed CNNs' capacity. Learning templates for object arrangements is challenging for deep networks. Learning templates for object arrangements is challenging for deep networks due to the combinatorial explosion in the number of templates needed. While biological visual systems excel at detecting relations, feedforward networks struggle with stimuli that have a combinatorial structure. This limitation has been overlooked by current computer vision scientists, despite cognitive scientists acknowledging it. Humans are capable of learning complex visual rules and generalizing them to new instances with just a few training examples. The participants in the study were able to learn complex visual rules and generalize them to new instances with just a few training examples. Problem 20, which involved reflection around the perpendicular bisector of shapes, was learned from an average of about 6 examples. This visual reasoning ability is not exclusive to humans, as birds and primates have also shown the capability to recognize same-different relations. Ducklings can quickly learn the concepts of same and different from a single example, as shown in a recent study. This ability to transfer knowledge to novel objects suggests a high level of abstract thinking in animals. The behavior of ducklings in learning the concepts of same and different contrasts with the CNN+RN in Experiment 3, which struggled to transfer these concepts to novel objects. Evidence suggests that visual-relation detection in animals may rely on feedback signals beyond feedforward processes. Despite the presence of feedback connections in the visual cortex, certain visual recognition tasks can be achieved with minimal cortical feedback. However, object localization in clutter requires attention as the feedforward sweep is too spatially coarse for this task. Recognition of spatial relations between objects necessitates spatial information. The processing of spatial relations between objects in a cluttered scene requires attention and working memory, as shown by neuroscience evidence. Working memory plays a role in solving tasks that involve spatial and same-different relationships. The computational role of attention and working memory in detecting visual relations during the solving of Raven's progressive matrices involves constructing flexible representations dynamically through attention shifts, rather than storing templates in synaptic weights. This approach helps prevent capacity overload in feedforward neural networks. Humans have a superior ability to detect visual relations compared to modern computers, leading to the exploration of attentional and mnemonic mechanisms in computational understanding of visual reasoning."
