    "content": "The \"Children Health Insurance Act of 1996\" is cited as the short title. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a new section on Health Insurance Availability for Children. The \"Children Health Insurance Act of 1996\" introduces sections on excise tax for failure to provide coverage and access to coverage, along with definitions. Imposition of Tax on group health plans and insurers for failure to meet coverage requirements. Tax amount is 25 percent of each premium received for group health plan failures. The tax amount imposed on group health plans and insurers for failure to meet coverage requirements is 25 percent of each premium received. For self-insured plans, the cost of coverage is treated as the premium received. Insurers offering individual health insurance coverage are also subject to the tax for failures. The tax amount imposed on group health plans and insurers for failure to meet coverage requirements is 25 percent of the total premiums paid for the coverage in the plan year. No tax will be imposed if the failure was not discovered despite reasonable diligence. The tax imposed on group health plans and insurers for failing to meet coverage requirements is 25 percent of total premiums paid. No tax applies if the failure is corrected within 30 days and was due to reasonable cause, not willful neglect. The tax imposed for failing to meet coverage requirements can be waived by the Secretary if the failure was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect. This tax does not apply to governmental plans or church plans. Liability for Tax: The group health plan is responsible for the tax imposed on it, while the insurer offering health insurance coverage is responsible for the tax imposed on them. \"Requirement of access to coverage under SEC. 9902.\" Each group health plan must offer qualifying coverage for qualifying young dependents of participants. The offer must be made when a person first becomes a qualifying young dependent and annually thereafter. Health insurers in the individual market must offer qualifying coverage for individuals under 21 years of age. Qualifying coverage must be offered for individuals under 21 years of age in the United States, providing health care benefits without limitations based on pre-existing conditions or waiting periods. Medicare benefits under parts A and B of title XVIII of the Social Security Act, or equivalent benefits, with a maximum coinsurance limit for part B services. Well child care benefits are also included. Well child care benefits include payment for newborn and well-baby care, pediatrician services for high-risk deliveries, routine office visits, and immunizations without deductibles, coinsurance, or copayments. The Secretary, in consultation with the American Academy of Pediatrics, shall establish a periodicity schedule for immunizations, routine laboratory tests, and preventive dental care for healthy children. Managed care is permitted under this section. \"Managed care is permitted for the benefits described in this section, as long as there is reasonable access. A 'qualifying young dependent' is an individual under 21 years old, residing in the US, a citizen or national (or alien permanently residing in the US under color of law), and a dependent as defined in section 152.\" \"SEC. 9903. DEFINITIONS.\" \"In this chapter, the term 'group health plan' is defined as per section 5000(b)(1), excluding plans with medical benefits limited to coverage described in paragraph (2)(B). Health insurance coverage refers to benefits for medical care under hospital or medical service policies or plans.\" The term 'group health plan' excludes certain limited medical benefit plans. Health insurance coverage includes benefits for medical care under various policies or plans, excluding specific types of coverage. The curr_chunk discusses various types of coverage, including on-site medical clinics, employee assistance programs, Medicare supplemental health insurance, liability insurance, and similar supplemental coverage provided under a group health plan. The curr_chunk lists different types of insurance coverage, including general liability, automobile liability, workers' compensation, automobile medical-payment, specified disease or illness, hospital indemnity, short-term limited duration, and other comparable coverage. The curr_chunk defines a health maintenance organization as a federally qualified organization or one recognized under State law. The curr_chunk further defines an insurer as an insurance company, service, or organization licensed to do business in a State and subject to State insurance regulations. The curr_chunk defines the individual market as the market for health insurance coverage offered to individuals, excluding coverage offered only through association affiliation. The curr_chunk adds definitions for 'beneficiary' and 'participant' based on the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. It also includes a clerical amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The curr_chunk introduces the effective date for the requirement of health insurance availability for children and the application to coverage offered on or after January 1, 1998. It also mentions a refundable tax credit for the purchase of health coverage for children. The curr_chunk introduces a refundable tax credit for the purchase of health coverage for children under section 35 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. A refundable tax credit is introduced for the purchase of health coverage for children under section 35 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The credit allows individuals to claim 80% of qualified health premiums paid in the taxable year, with the credit applied against tax liability at a rate of $0.50 for each $1 of tax liability. The tax credit under section 35 of the Internal Revenue Code allows individuals to claim 80% of qualified health premiums paid in the taxable year. The credit is applied against tax liability at a rate of $0.50 for each $1 of tax liability, and it is reduced by the sum of the tax imposed for the taxable year, the taxpayer's social security taxes, and the credit allowed under section 32. The term 'social security taxes' refers to taxes imposed on amounts received by the taxpayer during the taxable year, including taxes on self-employment income. The taxpayer's income for the taxable year includes one-half of the taxes imposed on amounts received during the calendar year. Social security taxes do not include taxes eligible for a special refund under section 6413(c). The taxpayer may be entitled to a special refund of taxes under section 6413(c) for amounts paid under agreements with foreign affiliates. The term \"qualified health premium\" refers to the amount paid for health coverage of a qualifying young dependent. The term \"qualifying young dependent\" refers to a dependent who has health coverage that includes qualifying coverage. The table of sections is amended to reflect this definition. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1997."
