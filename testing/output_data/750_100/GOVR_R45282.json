    "content": "FIFRA requires EPA to review and register pesticide products, establish maximum limits for pesticide residues in food, and assess fees on pesticide manufacturers for registrations and applications. These fees fund EPA's pesticide regulatory activities. The EPA's pesticide regulatory activities are funded by appropriations from the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury and various fees authorized by Congress. The Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2003 established the current pesticide fee framework, building upon provisions enacted in 1988 to enhance EPA's review of pesticide registrations. The Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2003 (PRIA 1) authorized EPA to collect registration service fees for pesticide registrations issued before November 1, 1984. It established fee amounts for various review activities and required EPA to complete its review within specific timeframes. The Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2003 (PRIA 1) authorized EPA to collect registration service fees for pesticide registrations issued before November 1, 1984. PRIA 2 and PRIA 3 further amended the pesticide fee framework by adding new application categories, revising decision timeframes, and adjusting fee amounts. The current pesticide fee framework, as amended by PRIA 3 and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, is outlined in the following sections. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, outlines the authority to collect pesticide maintenance fees, which expires on September 30, 2018. FIFRA Section 4 sets annual maximum maintenance fees per registrant based on registrations held, with a cap of $27.8 million per fiscal year. Failure to pay maintenance fees may result in EPA canceling the pesticide registration, while small businesses receive fee reductions. Section 4 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, allows for fee reductions for small businesses and exempts certain public health pesticides from maintenance fees. Collected fees are deposited into the \"Reregistration and Expedited Processing Fund\" for EPA to use for evaluating inert ingredients, expedited processing of applications, and reevaluating registered pesticides. EPA is required to use up to $800,000 per year from FY2013 through FY2018 to enhance information. EPA is required to use up to $800,000 per year from FY2013 through FY2018 to enhance information systems capabilities for tracking pesticide registration decisions. The authority to collect registration service fees begins to phase out starting at the end of FY2018, with a potential 70% reduction in fees for FY2019 if not extended. Section 33 of PRIA 3 establishes registration service fee amounts for various actions requested by applicants related to pesticide registration. EPA must complete these actions within specified timeframes, with fee reductions for small businesses and exemptions for applications for minor uses or in the public interest. The EPA is exempt from payment of registration service fees for applications involving tolerance setting in the public interest and governmental entities. The authority to collect fees under FIFRA Section 33 must be provided by annual appropriations. EPA cannot assess fees if appropriations for specified functions are below the FY2012 level. For FY2013 through FY2018, EPA was authorized to assess registration service fees regardless of minimum appropriations. Fee receipts collected must be deposited in the \"Pesticide Registration Fund\" and are subject to annual appropriations acts for expenditure. EPA can use the fee receipts once Congress appropriates them. EPA may use fee receipts without fiscal year limitation for various purposes including application review, worker protection activities, partnership grants, and pesticide education programs. The Inspector General of EPA must annually audit the funds in accordance with FIFRA. The Inspector General audits the Expedited Processing Fund and Pesticide Registration Fund as required by FIFRA. Congress allocated $8.89 billion for EPA in FY2018 for specified functions, including those of the EPA Office of Pesticide Programs. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 authorizes EPA to assess registration service fees for pesticide programs. Collected fees range from $21.4 million to $28.7 million for maintenance and $10.6 million to $18.6 million for registration services annually, providing one-fourth of total appropriations. Congress has initiated efforts to reauthorize these fees. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 authorizes EPA to assess registration service fees for pesticide programs, providing a significant portion of total appropriations. Congress has made efforts to reauthorize these fees, with separate versions of legislation passed by the House and Senate awaiting resolution of differences. The Senate passed an amendment to H.R. 1029, now named the Pesticide Registration Improvement Extension Act of 2018, reauthorizing maintenance and registration service fees through FY2023 and FY2025. The amendment increases the cap on annual maintenance fees and directs EPA to allocate funds for expedited rulemaking related to pesticide efficacy. The Senate amendment to H.R. 1029 requires EPA to carry out two final rules by October 1, 2021, related to pesticide efficacy and maintenance fees. EPA must allocate funds for enhancing good laboratory practices standards compliance monitoring and revise registration service fee amounts. The Senate amendment to H.R. 1029 mandates EPA to implement two final rules by October 1, 2021, regarding pesticide efficacy and maintenance fees. One rule focuses on agricultural worker protection standards, including training and use of protective equipment. The other rule revises standards for certified pesticide applicators. EPA is authorized to propose revisions addressing application exclusion zones. The Senate amendment to H.R. 1029 aims to protect applicators, the public, and the environment from risks associated with restricted use pesticides. It also directs the U.S. Government Accountability Office to publish a report by October 1, 2021, on the use of designated representatives and their impact on pesticide application information and worker health and safety. The House and Senate versions of H.R. 2, the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018, are being reconciled in a conference to resolve differences. Previous PRIA reauthorizations were passed without roll call votes, indicating support for extending the pesticide fee framework. The current iteration of PRIA reauthorization has faced delays due to disagreements between the House and Senate on EPA administration and enforcement of certain FIFRA regulations. Members have acknowledged a coalition of organizations that helped develop PRIA in the early 2000s, representing the pesticide industry, state agricultural departments, and environmental and farmworker interests."
