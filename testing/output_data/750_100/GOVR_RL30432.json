    "content": "The EPA believes there should be a higher rate of NSR permits for new or expanded facilities. The CAA requires preconstruction review and permits for major modifications or new sources of air pollution. States with EPA-approved SIPs must approve construction or modifications to ensure compliance with NAAQS. Applicants must demonstrate that the project will not violate NAAQS to receive a \"Permit to Construct.\" The New Source Review (NSR) process ensures that proposed sources or modifications do not worsen air quality standards locally or downwind. Applicants must also demonstrate compliance with Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) regulations to prevent exceedences of pollution increments. NSR is triggered for new sources emitting over 100 tons annually or modifications causing significant emission increases. The NSR process requires sources emitting over 100 tons annually or causing significant emission increases to comply with PSD regulations. Sources covered by PSD must install BACT, while those under non-attainment provisions must install LAER and obtain offsets. Both BACT and LAER must meet or exceed federal NSPS standards. The NSR process mandates sources emitting over 100 tons annually to comply with PSD regulations. BACT and LAER must meet or exceed federal NSPS standards. Few preconstruction permits have been issued to coal-fired power plants under NSR. Current U.S. coal-fired capacity has remained steady at 300,000 MW for the last ten years, with minimal additions to capacity. Emissions trends for electric utilities show a generally static situation with coal-fired capacity. NOx emissions have remained constant over the last decade, while SO2 emissions significantly dropped in 1995 due to the acid rain control program under the 1990 CAA Amendments. Powerplants were required to reduce emissions by 30% from baseline levels specified in the program. The 1990 CAA Amendments required powerplants to reduce emissions of SO2 and NOx. By 1995, SO2 emissions had decreased significantly, but some reductions were offset by increases in emissions from other plants. Overall, emissions only decreased by 3.6 million tons, with a 0.1 million ton reduction in NOx by 1996. Despite a lack of new plant construction, coal-fired electricity generation and coal consumption have continued to increase. Despite aging coal-fired facilities, coal consumption and electricity generation have increased over the past decade due to utilities' efforts to optimize performance. Contrary to expectations, the efficiency of coal-fired units has not decreased, suggesting a fundamental change in plant maintenance economics. The EPA lawsuits question whether efforts to maintain or expand coal-fired facilities constitute \"routine maintenance\" or a \"major modification\" under the CAA, which would require pollution control equipment. The restructuring of the electric utility industry has made it more economical for utilities to invest in maintaining their coal-fired capacity. The restructuring of the electric utility industry has intensified the issue of plant economics, leading many utilities to avoid using the term \"life extension\" for old power plants due to the Clean Air Act regulations exempting pre-1971 plants from emissions restrictions. The Clean Air Act exempts pre-1971 plants from emissions restrictions, but they can lose this exemption if they are significantly modified. Regulatory activities related to electricity generation and air quality include the Ozone Transport Rule, Section 126 Petitions, Regional Haze Rule, new NAAQS for Fine Particulates, revised Ozone NAAQS, NSPS for NOx for electric utilities, initiatives by the Ozone Transport Commission, and legislative initiatives. The Department of Justice/EPA lawsuits under NSR are aimed at enforcing existing laws and regulations, separate from regulatory development activities such as the Ozone Transport Rule and other initiatives. EPA has clarified that the NSR enforcement actions are not connected to the regulatory initiatives mentioned earlier. The EPA's NSR enforcement actions target coal-fired utilities for violations dating back to 1996. Remedial actions can include monetary penalties and installing updated pollution control technology like flue-gas desulfurization units. EPA's recent NOx NSPS for new utility boilers is also part of the enforcement measures. The EPA's recent enforcement actions target coal-fired utilities for violations dating back to 1996, requiring them to install updated pollution control technology like flue-gas desulfurization units. The new NOx NSPS for utility boilers could lead to substantial reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions, with control devices reducing emissions by 70-90%. Administrator Browner stated that controlling emissions from these plants could result in an 85 to 95 percent reduction in pollutants. The focus on NSR reflects the belief that continuing operation of aging coal-fired plants is a cost-effective alternative to constructing new capacity in the competitive generating market of a restructured industry. This could lead to significant reductions in pollutants, equivalent to taking 26 million cars off the road and reducing acid rain by 15%. The EPA is taking legal action against utilities for maintenance activities approved for decades, as the trend of renovating coal-fired capacity has been increasing for almost two decades. The potential emissions impact of extending the life of these facilities has been recognized since the late 1980s. The EPA faced challenges enforcing NSR on existing coal-fired electric generating facilities due to budget constraints and defining major modifications. The term \"modification\" was first used in the 1970 CAA Amendments, leading to difficulties in determining what constitutes a major modification. The EPA defined modification as any physical or operational change that increased the emission of air pollutants. Replacement of components exceeding 50% of building costs also triggered NSPS regulations. The focus shifted in 1977 to compliance with NSR regulations for existing coal-fired electric generating facilities. The EPA defined \"significant\" increase in emissions for major sources in terms of tons per year, with thresholds set at 40 tons for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Facilities exceeding these thresholds are subject to NSR, but enforcing them has been challenging. EPA's NSPS program thresholds do not constrain utilities' life extension efforts, which mainly focus on improving unit availability and reliability rather than capacity. The EPA's NSR program focuses on enforcing emission thresholds for major sources, with challenges in enforcement. Life extension efforts in utilities aim to improve unit availability and reliability, not capacity. However, these efforts may lead to increased emissions, raising questions about measuring changes and establishing baselines. EPA's decision to enforce NSR against facilities undergoing life extension projects sparked debate in the late 1980s. In 1988, the EPA ruled that a life extension project by Wisconsin Electric Power Company (WEPCO) triggered NSR due to potential increased emissions. After litigation and debate, EPA changed the trigger in 1992 to compare actual emissions before and after modifications. The current NSR regulations for utility plants define \"actual emissions\" and \"future actual\" emissions. EPA excludes routine maintenance, repair, and replacement from modifications under NSR. Increases in production rates without capital expenditures are also not considered modifications. Utilities responded to EPA's inquiry about their life extension activities. Utilities have shifted from using the term \"life extension\" to \"rehabilitation program\" in their maintenance schedules to avoid being classified as modifications under NSR regulations. This involves integrating life extension efforts into routine maintenance schedules to blur the line between modifications and routine activities. The Justice Department's lawsuits aim to enforce the Clean Air Act's New Source Review requirements regarding new construction and modifications of coal-fired facilities by utilities. EPA's Compliance Order addresses modifications by the Tennessee Valley. The distinction between \"modification\" and \"routine maintenance\" is becoming blurred in maintenance schedules. EPA issued a \"Compliance Order\" regarding modifications made by Tennessee Valley Authority to its coal-fired power plants that should have triggered new source reviews. Justice Department/EPA identified facilities violating NSR requirements and types of rehabilitations considered modifications. Complaints may be modified or new ones issued as investigations progress. The EPA's compliance order seeks injunctive relief and civil penalties for complaints against investor-owned facilities violating NSR requirements. It requires defendants to comply with CAA requirements, install BACT as needed, apply for permits, and audit operations for NSR compliance. TVA is asked to develop a schedule for meeting requirements, audit coal-fired power plants for NSR compliance, and remedy any noncompliance. The EPA's compliance order requires power plants to determine NSR compliance, develop a schedule for remedying noncompliance, and retire SO2 allowances for any reductions. The industry argues for an exemption for \"routine maintenance\" under NSR regulations. Industry is challenging EPA's NSR compliance order, arguing that activities triggering NSR were well-publicized and necessary for plant operation. They claim these activities are like routine maintenance and should not be considered major modifications under NSR criteria. The EPA Administrator announced that controlling sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from plants could lead to an 85 to 95 percent reduction in these pollutants, reducing emissions by 1.87 million tons of SO2 and 0.63 million tons of NOx. This would not trigger the major modification criterion of NSR, as emissions cannot exceed the cap and applying NSR to sources under the cap would result in pollution being produced elsewhere at a higher cost. The EPA Administrator announced significant reductions in emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from plants, totaling 1.87 million tons of SO2 and 0.63 million tons of NOx. These cuts would compensate for previous slippage in title IV reductions, with potential for further reductions through life extension efforts. Despite the potential for substantial emission reductions, the complexity of the Clean Air Act may pose challenges. The Clean Air Act (CAA) is a complex legislation with different reduction programs. Title IV limits SO2 emissions from utilities to 8.9 million tons by 2000, with interim reductions in 1995. Emissions are capped based on historical fuel consumption levels. The 1990 CAA Amendments program limits SO2 emissions from utilities based on historical data, not regulatory limits. It created an emissions allowance system where allowances can be traded or banked for future use. The program has achieved 100% compliance but does not integrate well with the 1977 CAA Amendments NSR program. The 1990 CAA Amendments program focuses on reducing SO2 emissions from utilities through an allowance system, which can be traded or banked. It does not integrate well with the 1977 CAA Amendments NSR program, as they have different objectives and enforcement mechanisms. Compliance with emissions cap is the key criterion for the 1990 program, while NSR focuses on individual plant standards and BACT installation. The current SO2 NSPS requires a 70%-90% reduction in emissions, but existing coal-fired facilities can meet less stringent requirements under title IV with low-sulfur coal. Installing BACT under NSR may result in excess allowances for sale under title IV, potentially nullifying NSR enforcement efforts. The affected plant sold its SO2 reduction to another facility not covered by NSR. The net result could be no reductions, as there is no provision in title IV for adjusting allowance allocations due to NSR enforcement. Congress would need to change the law or utilities voluntarily surrender excess allowances from NSR actions. The situation with potential NOx reduction is more complex. The NOx NSPS historically lagged behind in technology development until the new standard was set in 1998, requiring more advanced pollution control devices like selective catalytic reduction (SCR). In 1998, EPA set a new NOx NSPS standard for coal-fired facilities at 0.15 lb. of NOx per million Btu, aligning with available technology. However, this standard was challenged in court, leading to the D.C. Court of Appeals vacating the new standard for modified utility boilers in September 1999. This decision means that the NSPS for modified sources reverts to the 1979 standard until EPA proposes a revised NSPS, creating uncertainty in determining BACT or LAER for modified coal-fired sources. The uncertainty surrounding the NSPS for modified coal-fired sources is due to conflicting standards set in 1979 and 1998. The interaction of NSR and title IV further complicates the issue, with the NOx reduction program under title IV differing from the SO2 program. The title IV NOx program is based on emission rates, not tonnage limitations, with emission rate targets set for existing facilities to be achieved by 1995 or 2000. The NSPS for modified coal-fired sources is uncertain due to conflicting standards set in 1979 and 1998. The title IV NOx program requires existing facilities to achieve emission rate targets by 1995 or 2000, with some facilities already having more stringent controls since 1995. BACT determinations from 1991-1995 show a range of permitted emission rates, making it difficult to determine current BACT standards. EPA is enforcing NSR requirements to reduce emissions, but the outcome is uncertain. Some believe it may lead to costly litigation instead of actual emission reductions. Title IV of the Clean Air Act, enacted in 1990, effectively reduced SO2 and NOx emissions from existing utility plants, surpassing the impact of NSR provisions added in 1977. The \"cap and trade\" program under title IV achieved 100% compliance and significantly decreased emissions from coal-fired electric generating facilities. The \"cap and trade\" program under title IV has had 100% compliance and reduced emissions from coal-fired electric generating facilities. One alternative is to lower the cap on SO2 emissions to further reduce pollution. EPA lawsuits regarding NSR compliance could take years to resolve with uncertain outcomes. The 1990 SO2 cap reduced emissions from existing facilities to 1971 NSPS levels and reduced NSPS for new sources to zero. Lowering the existing cap by two-thirds could achieve similar emission reductions as all powerplants meeting the 1978 NSPS. Utilities would have flexibility in achieving reductions, but would receive credit for shutdowns not allowed under NSR enforcement. The allowance system's administrative and cost advantages may justify new legislation. EPA is urging states to consider a regional cap and trade program for NOx emissions to address uncertainties in NSR enforcement and other initiatives. This program is part of EPA's proposed Federal Implementation Plan for states that do not submit adequate SIPs under the Ozone Transport Rule. Implementing a regionwide cap and trade program for NOx under the stalled NOx SIP Call would require extraordinary cooperation between affected states or new EPA authority. Another alternative is to focus on reducing SO2 and NOx emissions through other regulatory initiatives, such as the Ozone Transport Rule, Section 126 petitions, fine particulate NAAQS, and regional haze rule. The implementation of fine particulate NAAQS and a regional haze rule will require reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions, with long implementation schedules extending beyond 2010. An alternative approach could involve tightening the title IV SO2 cap and creating an NOx cap without requiring additional legislative authority. Another option is to control pollutants like mercury and carbon dioxide from coal-fired power plants, which could also reduce SO2 and NOx emissions. The EPA is considering regulating CO2 emissions under the Clean Air Act, which is controversial. Controlling mercury emissions from utility boilers has been slow. Options for reducing CO2 include voluntary initiatives or ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. Another option is to reform NSR. One reform proposal for NSR is to define \"modification\" based on plant age, simplifying the trigger. EPA has been considering reforms, including \"off-ramps\" to NSR. One focus of reform for NSR is the proposal of \"off-ramps\" such as the \"Clean Unit Exclusion,\" which would exempt units with state-of-the-art pollution control technology from NSR rules. This exclusion applies to units that have installed BACT or LAER in the last 10 years and would allow modifications that do not increase emissions. EPA sees this as a potential improvement, but its effectiveness is up for debate. The EPA is considering alternatives to the current NSR rules, such as cap and trade programs for pollutants. Replacing NSR with a cap could offer the same environmental protection at a lower cost. The focus of the debate has been on \"grandfathered\" power plants. The Clean Air Act of 1970, as amended in 1977 and 1990, has a loophole that allows older coal-burning power plants to emit significantly more pollution than new plants. Industry lobbyists argued that these older plants would retire soon, but many are still operating without environmental controls. The term \"grandfathered powerplant\" is used in debates on emissions from existing powerplants, indicating if they are covered under the Clean Air Act. Passed in 1970, the Act requires the EPA to set regulations for new sources, but older plants from the 30s, 40s, 50s, and 60s still operate without environmental controls. Performance Standards (NSPS) require new sources built after their promulgation to install the best continuous emission reduction system demonstrated by the EPA. NSPS regulations for powerplants cover sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter. \"Grandfathered\" refers to plants built before NSPS regulations and not subject to them. NSPS for powerplants were first issued in 1971 and revised in 1979, with NOx regulations updated in 1998. The NOx NSPS regulations for powerplants were revised in 1998, requiring \"grandfathered\" sources to meet emission rate limits established by a State Implementation Plan (SIP). The term \"grandfathered\" is ambiguous due to certain pollutants like CO2 and Hg not being covered by the NSPS. EPA must review the NSPS every eight years, increasing stringency for covered pollutants. The EPA reviews the NSPS every eight years, increasing stringency for covered pollutants. The term \"grandfathered\" is ambiguous as there is no set baseline, making it unclear which powerplants fall under this category. Title IV of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments changed regulations for existing powerplants regarding SO2 and NOx emissions. Under title IV, existing powerplants have more stringent requirements than some NSPS. For example, \"grandfathered\" powerplants had to meet stricter NOx standards in 1995 than new powerplants. Similarly, in 2000, coal-fired powerplants had to meet SO2 standards equivalent to or stricter than the 1971 NSPS. The term \"grandfathered\" becomes meaningless in these cases. Age of plant is irrelevant when debating NOx emissions. If the focus is on NOx emissions from powerplants, the age of the plant is not relevant; instead, the fuel source is key. Coal-fired facilities, regardless of age, are the main target for increasing NOx controls. When discussing \"grandfathered\" powerplants and SO2 emissions, the title IV emissions cap is the important factor to consider. Age was a factor in allocating emission credits under title IV, but the focus was on whether the plant was operational, under construction, or planned at the time of enactment. The NSPS for SO2 for new powerplants is somewhat irrelevant as all new sources must offset their emissions under the cap. The NSPS for SO2 for new powerplants is effectively nil as they must offset their emissions under the cap. Shrinking the current cap on SO2 is the most logical approach to reduce emissions. EPA favors state-by-state emissions caps to address transported pollution programs in the Northeast. The WEPCO decision sparked public debate and congressional oversight, similar to the potential impact of DOJ/EPA actions on NSR. The suits regarding NSR issues depend on interpretations of CAA provisions and may require new legislation for consistency and updating the Clean Air Act's approach to regulation of the electric utility industry's environmental impact."
