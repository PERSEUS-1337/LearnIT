    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The Legislature declares that the FAST Act, passed in 2015, provides long-term funding for surface transportation and mandates NHTSA to award grants through rulemaking. The FAST Act includes grant programs for states that implement impaired driving interventions like 24/7 Sobriety programs to deter high-risk offenders. The Legislature aims to establish a statewide 24/7 Sobriety program in California to qualify for FAST Act grant funding and additional NHTSA funding. Section 23582.5 of the Vehicle Code allows the court to order individuals convicted of DUI offenses to participate in a 24/7 Sobriety program as a condition of probation, parole, or sentence if deemed appropriate. This program must be completed successfully within 10 years of previous DUI convictions. The court may require a person arrested for DUI to enroll in a 24/7 Sobriety program as a condition of release on bond if deemed appropriate and if the person has previous DUI convictions within 10 years. A person with a suspended or revoked driving privilege can enroll in a 24/7 Sobriety program to obtain a restricted driving privilege if they have committed a violation within 10 years of a previous DUI conviction. This program can be an alternative or in conjunction with other requirements. The 24/7 Sobriety program can be used as an alternative to or in conjunction with an ignition interlock device program. A person subject to this subdivision must participate in the 24/7 Sobriety program for a minimum of one year. A \"24/7 Sobriety program\" requires participants to abstain from alcohol or drugs, undergo frequent testing, and face immediate sanctions for violations. The program must be evidence-based, meeting specific criteria. Evaluation research shows that the 24/7 Sobriety program produces positive results attributed to the program itself, peer-reviewed and endorsed by respected organizations. Participants may also be required to participate in other DUI programs as mandated by California law. The court shall prioritize testing methods that sanction violations promptly. Participants must pay program costs based on their ability to pay. Programs cannot exceed 180 days unless the defendant tests positive for alcohol or drugs. The Office of Traffic Safety must include provisions for the 24/7 Sobriety program in its highway safety plan. The department will establish uniform data collection for participant information, testing details, and fees. Section 1808 of the Vehicle Code is amended regarding fees and fee payments.
