    "content": "The President's gravest decision is directing the use of nuclear weapons through Nuclear Command and Control (NC2), which involves authority over military forces, government activities, and multinational actions. The infrastructure supporting this authority is the Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS). The Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) is defined as a combination of elements essential for controlling nuclear weapon operations to provide the President with capabilities required for exercising authority. It supports the President's responsibilities as Commander in Chief and is part of Continuity of Government activities. The Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) is crucial for the President's authority as Commander in Chief and Continuity of Government activities. Congress oversees DOD's plans for sustaining and modernizing the NCCS, with potential for revisiting its structure and relevance based on NPR and QDR findings. The NCCS architecture, shaped during the Cold War, may need restructuring due to evolving threats from China, North Korea, and Iran. The addition of non-nuclear responses and active defenses could lead to complex requirements. Legacy systems have equities with other user agencies that will need to be addressed. The NCCS, despite strategic and budgetary implications, is often not well understood outside the military. This report will discuss NCCS platforms, functions, current role, issues, and proposed modernization initiatives. The NMCS is the priority component of the NCCS. The NMCS is the priority component of the NCCS, providing command and control of the armed forces, both nuclear and conventional. It includes various command nodes and supporting components. The National Military Command Center (NMCC) is the primary location for national command and control, staffed around-the-clock by watch teams led by high-ranking officers. Located in a shielded room in the Pentagon, the NMCC monitors nuclear forces and military operations. The National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) serves as a backup if ground-based command centers are destroyed. The NAOC, a fleet of modified Boeing 747-200B aircraft based at Offutt AFB in Nebraska, serves as a survivable airborne backup to the NMCC's command and control capabilities. It is always on alert and its communications are hardened against Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP). USSTRATCOM provides personnel and day-to-day administration, while the Air Force's Air Combat Command serves as the program's resource manager. Site-R, located at Fort Ritchie, Maryland, can be activated as an alternate NMCC location. The USSTRATCOM Global Operations Center at Offutt AFB serves as a backup for essential emergency actions and as the command center for the USSTRATCOM Commander. The facility is protected against EMP and has its own emergency power supply for extended operations. Staffed 24/7 by teams led by a Senior Controller, the USSTRATCOM Airborne Command Post (ABNCP) serves as a survivable airborne backup if needed. The ABNCPs are modified Boeing 707 aircraft with a crew of 22, including aircrew, communications operators, and battlestaff personnel led by a General or Admiral. The Airborne Emergency Action Officer (AEAO) leads the aircraft, known as the E-6B, which serves as the Airborne Launch Control System (ALCS) and Take Charge And Move Out (TACAMO) relay for Navy ballistic missile submarines. It can communicate launch codes to ICBM facilities and directives to submarines using various communication systems. The ABNCP can communicate using UHF or EHF satellite systems. USSTRATCOM provides battlestaff personnel, while the aircraft and communications operators are from the Navy's STRATCOMM Wing One. The MCCC is a convoy of trucks that serves as a survivable road-mobile backup to USSTRATCOM GOC or ABNCP. The President is the only one who can direct the use of nuclear weapons, and the NCCS has evolved to meet the President's requirements for decision making. The National Command and Control System (NCCS) has evolved to serve the President's requirements for advice and decision making for the strategic nuclear forces. One of its major functions is situation monitoring, which involves monitoring strategic intelligence from classified and open sources to anticipate crises. The National Command and Control System (NCCS) includes situation monitoring, which involves tracking weather and detecting potential attacks through Tactical Warning and Attack Assessment (TW/AA) centers. These centers quickly verify missile launches and determine the origin, size, and potential targets of the attack to aid decision makers in shaping their response. The TW/AA centers use dual phenomenology, combining satellites and radars to verify attacks. Decision making involves the President consulting with senior commanders and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as the primary military advisor. Continuous situation updates are crucial for effective communication between the President, advisors, and nuclear commanders. The force management process ensures data on the readiness of the nuclear deterrent and supporting forces is available to decision makers for day-to-day operations and crisis situations. This includes information on forces available, locations, maintenance/supply status, and alerting forces during a crisis. The force direction function involves nuclear command and control aspects such as nuclear surety and positive control. Nuclear surety includes controls to prevent unauthorized use of nuclear weapons, while positive control ensures instructions to launch reach forces and are carried out if given by the President. Force direction involves employing and ending hostilities. The Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) must be survivable, reliable, and secure to operate effectively in extreme conditions. It needs to support rapid connectivity between decision makers and forces without generating false alarms or passing inaccurate information. The NCCS must be a secure system to limit access to authorized personnel, ensure communication authenticity, and protect against interference. Security is crucial as potential adversaries adopt asymmetric capabilities like computer attacks. Nuclear command and control is central to deterrence according to the DOD's 2001 Nuclear Posture Review. The DOD's 2001 Nuclear Posture Review was directed by Congress to assess the role of nuclear forces in US military strategy, policy requirements for maintaining a credible nuclear deterrence posture, the relationship between deterrence policy and arms control objectives, and the necessary levels and composition of nuclear delivery systems. The 2001 Nuclear Posture Review assessed the role of nuclear forces in US military strategy and policy requirements for maintaining a credible nuclear deterrence posture. Assistant Secretary Crouch briefed the public on the unclassified aspects of the NPR report in 2002. Assistant Secretary Crouch proposed changes in the multinational environment drove the need for the NPR post-Cold War. The Administration aimed to improve relations with Russia and reduce dependence on offensive nuclear forces for deterrence. The NPR highlighted potential threats from the proliferation of WMDs and ballistic missiles. The NPR post-Cold War aimed to address new threats like WMD proliferation and ballistic missiles. DOD emphasized a \"capabilities based\" approach to provide a range of options for the President. The NPR introduced a \"new triad\" of capabilities including offensive forces, active defenses, and passive defensive forces. The NPR's new triad includes offensive forces, active defenses, and passive defensive forces to increase options and reduce reliance on offensive systems. The Administration emphasizes command, control, intelligence, and planning at the center of the new triad for enhanced precision, adaptability, and deterrence during crises. The Administration aims to improve command and control operations during crises, integrating nuclear and non-nuclear forces for quicker responses and increased flexibility. This emphasis on NC2 capabilities in the NPR may lead to new systems initiatives being implemented by the Bush Administration and the Department of Defense. USSTRATCOM implemented the framework from the 2001 NPR, taking on additional missions such as global strike, space operations, missile defense, information operations, and C4ISR. In 2005, it was designated as the focal point for combating weapons of mass destruction, establishing a Center for Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction under General James Cartwright. The Commander of USSTRATCOM established a Center for Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction in partnership with the Defense Threat Reduction Agency. The 2001 NPR framework was incorporated into DOD doctrinal guidance, with a focus on deterring and retaliating against the use of weapons of mass destruction. The Joint Staff was preparing an update to its \"Doctrine for Joint Nuclear Operations\" in 2005. The Joint Staff was preparing an update to its \"Doctrine for Joint Nuclear Operations\" in 2005, focusing on rapid crisis action planning to respond to unanticipated WMD threats. This concept is a carry-over from the 2001 NPR, emphasizing integration of nuclear and non-nuclear offensive forces with defensive forces. The need for rapid planning in joint operations plans and orders during an imminent crisis is crucial. To compress the time required for developing and disseminating plans to nuclear forces, there may be a need for increased computer workstation capability, availability at command centers, communication capacity, and integration with other military operations. The need for increased computer workstation capability, communication capacity, and robust communications for coordination with intelligence providers in nuclear planning is becoming crucial. Senior leaders are expecting bandwidth-hungry video-teleconferencing links for long-distance deliberations. The Secretary of Defense appointed a commission to review the implementation of the 2001 NPR, focusing on programmatic requirements and NC2. The commission is expected to submit its report to Congress by June 30, 2007, potentially advancing the debate on NPR's findings. The NPR does not address the policy for the role and uses of nuclear weapons. The NPR does not address the policy for the role and uses of nuclear weapons, suggesting that non-nuclear weapons could fulfill missions previously allocated to nuclear weapons. The presence of nuclear weapons in the U.S. arsenal for the foreseeable future seems likely, shaping the required command and control architecture. Assumptions about deterrent capabilities and NC2 system expectations determine the level of robustness, redundancy, or survivability needed. The nuclear command and control systems, developed during the Cold War, have remained largely unchanged since then. Key installations like the NORAD-Cheyenne Mountain Complex, E-4 National Airborne Operations Center, and USSTRATCOM underground command post were established in the 1960s-1980s to manage nuclear confrontation with the Soviet Union. Today, these systems still shape the requirements for robustness and survivability. The Cold War-era nuclear command and control systems may no longer be suitable for current needs due to evolving threats. The infrastructure, designed to withstand decapitation attacks, may require updates to address new challenges. During the Cold War, concerns over decapitation attacks on nuclear command and control systems led to upgrades in the 1980s to ensure government control of weapons. This included increased redundancy and survivability of communication. The threat of a nuclear strike from Russia today is considerably diminished compared to the Cold War era. The Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty, agreed to in 2002, committed both sides to reduce deployed nuclear weapons to lower levels. This represents a significant decrease from the tens of thousands deployed during the height of the Cold War. Despite the reduced threat of a nuclear strike from Russia, the question arises in the current strategic and fiscally constrained environment whether the expense of maintaining a command and control architecture designed for a major nuclear exchange is still justified. Analysts warn of potential nuclear threats from China, with projections of significant military expenditures and advancements in survivable systems like the mobile DF-31A ICBM. China's military advancements include the mobile DF-31A ICBM and potential threats to the United States. General Zhu Chenghu's comments on using nuclear weapons against U.S. cities were widely reported. Analysts debate China's intentions in the Pacific Rim, with some downplaying the threat. Kurt Campbell argues that the China threat is overstated and the relationship with China is not a clear confrontation like the Cold War. Cooperation characterizes the U.S. and European relationships with China, and highlighting a \"China threat\" may be a search for a great power peer competitor. This could justify the development of major weapons. The development of major weapons systems is justified by the perceived threat from China's increasing nuclear capability, as well as from rogue states like Iran and North Korea seeking nuclear weapons. North Korea has been actively pursuing nuclear weapons since the 1960s. North Korea has been pursuing nuclear weapons since the 1960s. A.Q. Khan may have provided information for Kim Jong Il's efforts. In 2005, North Korea claimed to have nuclear weapons, but this has not been verified. Estimates suggest they may have around ten bombs. North Korea also manufactures various SCUD type missiles. North Korea manufactures SCUD type missiles, NoDong missile, and TaepoDong missiles. It is unclear if they can attach nuclear weapons to these missiles. Reliable information from inside the country is scarce. Post-Iraq criticisms have made experts hesitant to estimate North Korean programs. Some suggest North Korea's claims of having nuclear weapons are deception. The Iranian nuclear program is also a concern. The Iranian nuclear program raises concerns about their pursuit of nuclear weapons, with varying predictions on when they could achieve this capability. Some analysts suggest Iran may have nuclear weapons sooner than projected, with estimates ranging from two years to 2009. However, others argue that Iran's nuclear fuel cycle research falls within permitted activities under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Iran's development at Natanz and other nuclear sites has raised suspicions due to secrecy and concealment. There are concerns that Iran may be working on nuclear-capable long-range delivery systems, as shown by the testing of the Shahab-3 missile. Reports suggest a link between the Iranian military's study of high explosives and the civilian nuclear program, raising fears of nuclear weapon construction. Iran's civilian nuclear program at Natanz and other sites has raised suspicions due to secrecy. Concerns are heightened by Iran's aggressive rhetoric towards Israel and the US. Small nuclear arsenals could pose a threat to US infrastructure through electromagnetic pulse attacks. A high-altitude nuclear explosion can cause voltage surges that damage electronic components. A voltage surge from a high-altitude nuclear explosion could lead to catastrophic failures in critical infrastructure, potentially causing the deaths of thousands or millions of people. Congress chartered the EMP Commission to assess the threat of an electromagnetic pulse attack on the United States. The EMP Commission was established by Congress to assess the threat of an electromagnetic pulse attack. Analysts suggest that China, North Korea, and Iran may use high-altitude nuclear bursts to generate EMP against critical infrastructure in the US. Recent North Korean and Iranian missile tests, detonating at high altitude, could indicate preparation for launching short-range missiles from a freighter off the U.S. coast. Technology may allow for generating localized EMP bursts without nuclear detonation, but skepticism exists about the extent of the EMP threat and its impact on military and commercial systems. Many military systems have EMP protection, and commercial systems can easily add it. The threat of a single EMP attack from a freighter off the U.S. coast may not cause catastrophic failures as feared. The motivation for China to use EMP against the U.S. is unclear due to potential retaliatory consequences, but using it against U.S. forces aiding Taiwan is more conceivable. Some analysts believe North Korea's long-range ballistic missile program has stalled due to reluctance from Russia and China to share advanced technology. The EMP Commission found a decline in EMP hardening and practice in the military since the 1990s. Congress directed the reestablishment of the EMP Commission to assess the vulnerability of military systems. The EMP Commission was tasked to assess the vulnerability of military systems to EMP threats and the challenges faced in integrating nuclear and non-nuclear offensive forces with defensive forces. The current command and control system may need improvement to handle new challenges, such as involving additional participants in decision-making for non-nuclear and defensive forces. Implementing NPR recommendations could increase demand for capacity and require faster response times, especially for missile defense. The defense response may be more compressed than an offensive response during the Cold War, with a need for further development in directing non-nuclear strikes. This includes conventional attacks on strategic targets using precision weapons, conventional ballistic missiles, and \"non-kinetic options\" like information operations and electronic warfare. The question of \"release authority\" arises when considering these additional choices, as only the President can direct the release of nuclear weapons. The President can direct the release of nuclear weapons, but the question arises whether they should also be required to direct the release of \"non-nuclear\" or \"non-kinetic options.\" While the President has the authority to determine their level of involvement in military operations, they have historically not been involved in planning specific conventional missions, except for rare instances like Lyndon Johnson's personal selection of targets during the Vietnam War. Tasking Orders for recent campaigns against Iraq in 1991 or 2003, or Kosovo, may require Presidential involvement due to their strategic importance. USSTRATCOM targets of high criticality might also warrant Presidential authorization. Requiring Presidential approval for releasing these strikes could pose operational challenges, as conventional weapons lack permissive action link codes like nuclear weapons. The process of ensuring only conventional weapons are launched without Presidential authorization becomes complex, especially when conventional weapons are mixed with nuclear weapons on the same platform. Non-kinetic strikes like cyber-attacks could pose significant challenges by targeting strategically important assets and producing grave effects. Cyber-attacks targeting strategic assets could have effects equivalent to a WMD strike, raising concerns about Presidential control and adding complexity to command and control processes. The merging of active defenses, particularly missile defenses, into the NC2 architecture will require further adaptation in command and control processes to ensure timely decision-making and implementation. Approval processes may need to be revised to prevent delays in reaching critical targets. Release authority for offensive responses must also be agreed upon to effectively integrate missile defenses. Given the limited defensive capability, there may be a need to decide on which locations to defend and delegate missile defense release authority to the unified combatant commander to prevent delays in responding to incoming missiles. Presidential involvement may be necessary for grave decisions, but time constraints could require standing Presidential guidance to ensure timely responses. Presidential involvement may be necessary for grave decisions, but time constraints could require standing Presidential guidance to ensure timely responses, especially when choosing between defensive and offensive actions. Decision-making in limited time frames is crucial, as a successful defensive response can impact the range of offensive options considered. An attack that could overwhelm the defensive system may necessitate an earlier offensive response for damage limitation. Regional combatant commanders will have responsibility for defense in their area of responsibility, with multiple command centers involved. USSTRATCOM is tasked with leading missile defense, which must be linked to systems in regional combatant commands like USCENTCOM or USNORTHCOM. General Cartwright, the USSTRATCOM commander, has directed personnel to ensure interoperable missile defense command and control systems with common technical standards. Bandwidth demands on networks will increase as more participants are added to decision conferences for missile defense. The ultimate customer of any command and control system involving non-nuclear and defensive choices is the President. The President must be able to make non-nuclear and defensive decisions with the help of a system that presents choices clearly and aids in decision-making within tight timeframes. The system should facilitate interaction with advisers and maintain tight control over nuclear weapons. The nuclear command and control systems play a crucial role in maintaining tight Presidential control over nuclear weapons and ensuring clear and actionable orders for weapons operators. These systems also have the potential to support non-nuclear military forces direction and status monitoring, making them versatile national assets with robust decision-making and communication capabilities. The National Military Command Center (NMCC) provides 24-hour monitoring of worldwide military operations, aids in managing peacetime contingencies like natural disasters, and forms response cells or crisis action teams to prepare orders and monitor forces during crises. Command and control assets also supported mitigation and recovery activities after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The NMCC and NORAD were involved in coordinating the restoration of air traffic after the 9/11 attacks. These assets are crucial for continuity of operations during domestic contingencies or natural disasters. President Bush visited USSTRATCOM in Omaha, Nebraska on 9/11 for secure communication. During Hurricane Rita in September 2005, President Bush utilized command and control assets at U.S. Northern Command to monitor the government response. These assets can also support civil authorities after disasters. FEMA and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff signed an agreement to utilize the National Airborne Operations Center for such purposes. Staff have signed a memorandum of agreement to make the National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC), a modified Boeing 747-200 command and control aircraft, available for FEMA support during disasters and emergencies. NAOC was used during Hurricane Opal in 1995 and is valued for its versatile situation monitoring, communications, and tele-conferencing capabilities by senior government leadership. The NMCC is co-located in the Pentagon, easily accessible to the Secretary of Defense and other DOD leadership. Secretary Rumsfeld relied on NAOC for support during official travel. The NAOC, a modified Boeing 747-200 command and control aircraft, is used for official travel support, including trips to Iraq and Central Asia. Utilizing NC2 assets for missions beyond nuclear forces requires balancing tradeoffs and could lead to competition for access during crises, potentially causing shortfalls in response plans. Tying these systems to other agency functions adds to organizations with equities in system viability, even after newer systems are in place or when military deems capability no longer necessary. The military may incur costs to sustain systems no longer needed, leading to added burdens on operators. Training for secondary roles reduces readiness for primary missions, especially with shrinking manpower pools. Given changing threats and Nuclear Posture Review recommendations, what requirements are needed for today's systems? The DOD chartered a committee in 2001 to review the U.S. Nuclear Command and Control System, focusing on survivability and incorporating new technology and potential threats. The DOD committee reviewed the U.S. Nuclear Command and Control System in 2001, highlighting the importance of maintaining system hardness against weapon effects. The report suggested transferring system life cycle management to operators for better maintenance and procedural discipline. The End-to-End Review proposed a model for NC2 systems, highlighting operator requirements not being fully supported by acquisition programs due to unrealistic or unachievable expectations within budget and timeline constraints. Multiple agencies' involvement in NC2 systems further complicates the issue. The debate over meeting operator needs and managing acquisition programs economically continues, with concerns about declining expertise in NC2 and reduced manpower in nuclear forces since the end of the Cold War. The reduction in manpower in nuclear forces since the end of the Cold War has led to a decrease in expertise in nuclear operations. This has resulted in a \"revolving door\" of positions and a \"brain drain\" of people with expertise in critical disciplines, potentially hindering responses during crises. Additionally, the legacy NC2 architecture may face challenges from the Defense Department's military transformation efforts. The Defense Department's move towards military transformation includes U.S. Strategic Command establishing subordinate functional component commands for global strike, space operations, missile defense, information operations, and combating WMD. These multi-service organizations are geographically separated to decentralize activities from USSTRATCOM headquarters towards a more collaborative and horizontal process. The 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review proposes changes in NC2 programs to facilitate USSTRATCOM's move to distributed command and control capabilities. It recommends retiring expensive legacy mobile platforms like the E-4B NAOC aircraft and replacing them with C-32 aircraft. The NAOC capability to support FEMA would shift to the E-6B aircraft, requiring additional communication upgrades. The USSTRATCOM MCCC would also be retired. The USSTRATCOM MCCC would be retired in FY2007 as part of the move to distributed command and control capabilities. The new architecture must be survivable against various attacks, including WMD, electronic, or cyber-warfare. USSTRATCOM is considering implementing an IP-based communications architecture to link distributed locations. The USSTRATCOM is considering implementing an IP-based communications architecture to link distributed locations for nuclear command and control. However, the high degree of assurance of rapid message transmission needed for nuclear command and control has not been proven with an IP network. The communications bandwidth required for this expanded infrastructure is already at a premium across the military. The need for satellite communications links has grown significantly since September 11, 2001, and is expected to increase further in the next 10 years. The nuclear community will be competing with the military for command and control links, especially with a dispersed operations concept. Coordination of new systems like missile defense into the NC2 network is necessary, but the level of certification and configuration management required is still undetermined. The procurement programs for upgrades and enhancements of existing systems in the nuclear command and control architecture were included in DOD's FY2006 and FY2007 budget requests. The need for compatibility, clear chain of command, and defined procedures in a distributed architecture is crucial to avoid chaos. The MEECN, a vital communication network between the President and nuclear forces, received funding for upgrades in FY2006 and FY2007. The FY2006 Defense Authorization Act authorized $20.5 million for procurement and $57.3 million for R&D. In FY2007, $3.4 million was requested for procurement and $64.1 million for R&D. In FY2007, the DOD is seeking $3.4 million for procurement and $64.1 million for R&D. Modernization efforts in MEECN include upgrades for high data rate terminals, secure computer terminals, and satellite communications for Minuteman ICBM Launch Control Centers. The DOD is seeking funds for modernization efforts in MEECN, including upgrades to communications systems for Minuteman ICBM Launch Control Centers. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld is personally involved in directing upgrades to the NMCC and its alternate at Site-R, aiming to consolidate separate command centers into two new centers in the Pentagon. The DOD is seeking funds for modernization efforts in MEECN, including upgrades to communications systems for Minuteman ICBM Launch Control Centers. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld is consolidating separate command centers into two new centers in the Pentagon focused on tracking global crises and providing military advice to the President. These new facilities will be more secure and survivable against various threats. The Defense Department is seeking funds for modernization efforts in MEECN, including consolidating functions to create efficiencies and reduce manpower. They requested funding for planning and system engineering through 2011, with Congress authorizing the full amount for FY2006. Additionally, they are seeking funds for developing a future missile warning and attack assessment system. The Defense Department is requesting funds for modernization efforts in missile warning and attack assessment systems, as well as for enhancing airborne command and control platforms. Congress has approved funding for these initiatives in the FY2006 Authorization and appropriations legislation. For FY2007, DOD is asking for $50.9 million for further research and development in this area. The Air Force requested funds for E-4B NAOC and E-6B ABNCP modifications in FY2006, which were fully authorized and funded by Congress. The FY2007 budget request includes funds for E-4B modifications for aircraft improvements. The E-6B aircraft operated by the Navy is undergoing upgrades to its systems, including digital equipment for audio distribution, an \"office in the sky\" for senior leaders with secure voice, video, and data services, improvements to the on-board LAN, transition to digital UHF radio links, precision navigation upgrades, and integration with Global Air Traffic systems. Proposed upgrades for the E-6B aircraft operated by the Navy include modifications to aircraft and mission systems, costing $11.2 million for procurement and $31.4 million for RDT&E. The aircraft systems upgrades involve improved cockpit displays, enhanced navigation systems, and a service life assessment of the airframe. Mission system improvements will replace legacy computers and communication equipment deemed unsupportable after 2010. The Navy is requesting funding for upgrades to the E-6B aircraft, including modifications to aircraft and mission systems. Congress fully supported the Navy's request for the E-6 in the FY2006 Defense Authorization Act. The Defense Department is requesting funds for E-6 modifications procurement and research and development. The most controversial aspect of nuclear command and control modernization programs is the acquisition of the Advanced EHF communications satellite. The Advanced EHF (AEHF) communications satellite will replace the aging MILSTAR satellite constellation, providing secure, anti-jam communications capabilities at higher data rates. Lockheed Martin and Northrop-Grumman are the contractors for the AEHF program. The Air Force requested funding for the program in FY2006. The Air Force requested $665.3 million in RDT&E and $529 million for procurement in the FY2006 budget. Congress fully funded the Air Force budget request for AEHF in the FY2006 Defense Authorization and appropriations legislation. In FY2007, DOD is not requesting procurement funds as three satellites have already been purchased for the AEHF constellation. The Air Force is seeking $633 million for AEHF R&D in FY2007. AEHF has faced schedule delays, cost overruns, and technical shortfalls. The AEHF program has suffered from schedule delays and cost overruns due to technical shortfalls in developing communications encryption equipment. The first launch is now targeted for 2008, with the program estimated to cost over $7 billion, resulting in a Nunn-McCurdy notification to Congress. AEHF is intended to bridge MILSTAR and the TSAT program. The Transformational Satellite (TSAT) program, incorporating laser communication cross-links between satellites and Internet routing capability, faced a two-year delay from Air Force plans due to budget cuts and immature technologies. Some suggest testing these technologies on AEHF satellites first to reduce risk. Congress considered but did not direct the Air Force to buy an additional AEHF satellite for FY2006 to hedge against further TSAT delays. The FY2006 Defense Appropriations Act reduced funding for TSAT by $400 million and directed the Air Force to focus on technology development. Congress approved $436-plus million, reserving $120 million for either a fourth AEHF satellite or continued systems development for TSAT based on an analysis of alternatives study. Increased demands on the nuclear command and control system were driven by the 2001 NPR and subsequent events. Increased demands on the nuclear command and control system, driven by the 2001 NPR and subsequent DOD policy, will pose challenges for the NCCS in the future. The system's Cold War architecture may compete for budgetary priority against conventional systems perceived as more immediately relevant to today's threat environment and the war on terror. The value of the NCCS lies in its ability to fulfill missions beyond the traditional DOD purview, despite differing opinions on its importance. The NCCS performs key functions related to the nuclear deterrent, facing budget constraints and competing pressures from conventional missions. The DOD focuses on upgrading the Cold War NCCS architecture, but changes may be signaled by USSTRATCOM's activation of functional component commands and recommendations in the 2006 QDR. Congress may need to address these potential shifts in direction. The 2006 QDR may signal a change in direction for the US nuclear command and control system. Congress may need to address questions about the nature of threats from China, North Korea, Iran, and terrorist organizations, and how nuclear weapons fit into US strategy. The role of nuclear weapons in command and control systems is a topic of debate, with some advocating for reducing their role for non-proliferation efforts, while others want to increase their utility against proliferators. The architecture of the Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) is being questioned, with a need to incorporate new command and control requirements for non-nuclear offensive responses. The debate surrounds the need for additional command and control requirements for non-nuclear offensive responses and missile defense. There is a discussion on the release authorities and the possibility of legislation before making architectural decisions. A more dispersed approach, like the one proposed by USSTRATCOM, could be more suitable for the current threat environment, potentially leading to manpower and budget savings in the long term. However, the effectiveness of applying a distributed, network style approach to nuclear command and control remains untested. The level of investment needed for modernization or new procurement is also being questioned, with ongoing NCCS initiatives projected to continue for years. The NCCS modernization and procurement initiatives are expected to continue for years. The retirement of certain platforms may offer short-term savings, but there are questions about the adequacy and necessity of existing NCCS platforms. The value of secondary uses of the NCCS and the potential added value for taxpayers are also being considered. The taxpayer may benefit from utilizing existing capabilities for ancillary functions in homeland security and disaster response. The question arises whether continued investment in these platforms is justified if their primary mission requirements are surpassed, and if civilian agencies should take over their procurement and operation."
