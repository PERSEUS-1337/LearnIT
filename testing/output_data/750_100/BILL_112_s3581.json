The amendment to section 45Q of the Internal Revenue Code limits the credit allowed for qualified carbon dioxide captured by carbon capture equipment at a qualified facility. The credit is capped at the national limitation allocated under subsection (f). The amendment to section 45Q of the Internal Revenue Code sets a national limitation on the amount of qualified carbon dioxide that can be captured by carbon capture equipment at a qualified facility. The national limitation is 75,000,000 metric tons of qualified carbon dioxide, minus the amount captured before August 1, 2013. The Secretary will establish procedures for allocating the national limitation under section 45Q to projects for carbon capture equipment and certifying these projects by July 1, 2013. The Secretary will allocate under subparagraph (A) and rank applications based on submission dates. The Secretary will prioritize applications based on submission dates, with those received earlier given higher priority. Applications received before the established procedures deadline will be considered as received on that date. Applicants concurrently applying for certification on the same date will be given higher priority. Projects with an earlier construction commencement date will also receive higher priority in allocation of tonnage by the Secretary. The Secretary will allocate tonnage to applicants based on the amount requested and the rank of the application. Projects with no or partial allocation will retain their ranking and may receive forfeited or recaptured tonnage. The Secretary is limited in the allocation process. The Secretary may allocate tonnage to projects based on requested amount and application rank. Projects with partial allocation may receive forfeited or recaptured tonnage. There is a limitation on the allocation process. The Secretary may allocate tonnage to projects based on requested amount and application rank, with a limitation on the allocation process. Projects may receive forfeited or recaptured tonnage. The qualified facility must have a written, binding contract for disposal in secure geological storage or a disposal plan by the applicant for 15,000,000 metric tons of qualified carbon dioxide. The allocation of tonnage to projects is subject to reduction for prior credits based on carbon capture equipment usage before August 1, 2013. No credit is allowed for capturing qualified carbon dioxide at a qualified facility before a specified date. Each project allocated a portion of the national limitation must apply for certification to the Secretary within 6 months of receiving the allocation. The project must apply for certification to the Secretary within 6 months of receiving the allocation, and construction must start within 30 days after the regulations are established. The certification for the project can be revoked if the Secretary finds that there was a materially inaccurate representation made by the applicant. The certification for the project may be revoked if carbon capture equipment is not placed in service within a specified timeframe after the allocation was issued. The certification for a project may be revoked if carbon capture equipment is not placed in service within 3 years of the allocation being issued for a modification of an existing industrial facility. The Secretary will reallocate national limitation for projects as needed. Public disclosure of allocation details and project descriptions is required within 30 days of any changes. The Secretary will issue an annual report summarizing credits allocated and available for allocation under section 45Q of the Code, with conforming amendments made to paragraphs (2) and (3) of section 45Q(c) related to certified projects. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to limit the 10-year credit for carbon capture equipment.
