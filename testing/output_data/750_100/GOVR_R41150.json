    "content": "Energy and Water Development funding for FY2010 was provided in H.R. 3183, which became P.L. 111-85 when signed by President Obama on October 28, 2009, totaling $33.5 billion. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (P.L. 111-5) also allocated $44.3 billion for programs in the Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, and the Department of Energy. President Obama's proposed FY2011 budget for Energy and Water Development programs was $35.3 billion. On July 15, 2010, the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development approved a bill for funding. The House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development approved a bill to fund programs at $34.7 billion, while the Senate approved a bill with $35.0 billion. A continuing resolution was passed to fund government programs at the FY2010 level until March 4, 2011. The House and Senate approved bills to fund Energy and Water Development programs at different levels. A continuing resolution extended funding through March 4, 2011, with amendments made to reduce funding levels for certain programs. H.R. 1 was introduced to continue funding for the rest of FY2011 at FY2010 levels, with exceptions for reduced funding. The House passed H.R. 1, and the Senate offered a substitute amendment to continue funding with fewer restrictions. The Senate rejected both the House-passed version of H.R. 1 and the S.Amdt. 149, leading to the introduction of H.R. 1473, which was passed by both chambers and signed into law. This bill funded Energy and Water Development programs at approximately $32.2 billion. The bill includes funding for civil works projects of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Central Utah Project, Bureau of Reclamation, Department of Energy, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and Appalachian Regional Commission. Budget totals for energy and water development appropriations from FY2004 to FY2011 are provided in tables. Budget details for each title of the bill are also listed in tables. The FY2010-FY2011 budget for various departments and agencies, including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Department of Energy, and independent agencies, is discussed in tables. The Army Corps of Engineers' budget request for FY2011 was $4.88 billion, $564 million lower than the previous year. Funding levels were not specified below the major program level in the bills analyzed. The Senate Appropriations Committee provided the Corps with $5.32 billion for FY2011, an increase of $381 million over the Administration's request but slightly below the FY2010 appropriation. The House Appropriations Subcommittee allocated $5.28 billion. The House-passed Continuing Resolution would have reduced funding for the Corps to approximately $4.8 billion, $641 million below the FY2010 level. The final Continuing Resolution provided $5.05 billion for the Corps, an increase of $152 million. The final Continuing Resolution provided $5.05 billion for the Corps in FY2011, an increase of $152 million over the President's requested level but $411 million below the FY2010 enacted level. Federal funds for the Corps are not distributed based on a formula or competitive program, with about 85% of appropriations directed to specific projects. Funding for the agency is often part of the debate over earmarks. Annual appropriations for the agency are often debated in relation to earmarks. Projects must be previously authorized, typically in a Water Resources Development Act (WRDA). The backlog of authorized projects ranges from $11 billion to over $80 billion, leading to questions about the disconnect between authorization and appropriations processes and how to prioritize activities. Since Hurricane Katrina, the Corps' Civil Works program has received significant annual appropriations, totaling around $18.7 billion in supplemental funds. This includes $15 billion for post-hurricane repairs in Louisiana and the Gulf Coast region. Specific allocations include $5.76 billion in FY2009 for Louisiana hurricane protection in 2008 and $797 million in 2009. The Corps received $797 million in supplemental appropriations for flood control and coastal emergencies, with $439 million allocated for barrier island and ecosystem restoration for the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Additionally, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided the Corps with an extra $4.6 billion for FY2009 and FY2010. Congress closely monitors construction funding for the Corps due to numerous authorized projects lacking appropriations. The FY2011 Obama Administration request included $1.69 billion for construction, a decrease of $341 million from the FY2010 level. The Obama Administration's FY2011 request for construction funding was $1.69 billion, a reduction of $341 million from the previous year. The request limited new construction starts, with only two new starts included. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed $1.9 billion for construction, utilizing unobligated balances from prior year appropriations. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed $1.9 billion for construction, utilizing unobligated balances from prior year appropriations for the Continuing Authorities Program to fund FY2011 construction activities. The House subcommittee bill would have funded Construction at $1.851 billion, while P.L. 112-10 provided $1.78 billion for construction, slightly more than the amount requested by the Administration. The enacted bill also included a provision barring the Corps from using appropriations for new starts. The Inland Waterway Trust Fund (IWTF) is facing a deficit as needed funding for eligible ongoing work exceeds incoming collections. The Inland Waterway Trust Fund is facing a deficit as collections have not kept up with outlays. Current law dictates federal responsibility for construction and rehabilitation of waterways, with funding split between the IWTF and federal general revenue. Funding comes from a fuel tax on commercial vessels and investment interest. Additional federal funding was provided in FY2009 and FY2010. The FY2009 and FY2010 appropriations included extra federal funding to support the Inland Waterway Trust Fund (IWTF) solvency. Previous administrations proposed increasing revenues by replacing the fuel tax with a lock user fee, but Congress criticized this. The FY2011 Budget suggested limiting IWTF spending to current fuel tax revenues, without assuming additional revenue from a lock user fee proposal. The Senate Appropriations Committee rejected the user fee approach for FY2011 and agreed to budget only current fuel tax revenues. Concerns were raised about the level of appropriations for Corps activities in the restoration of the Central and Southern Florida ecosystem. Funding for Corps activities in the Everglades comes from Energy and Water Development appropriations and Department of the Interior appropriations bills. The FY2011 Obama Administration requested $180 million for the Corps' component of south Florida Everglades restoration work, the same as FY2010. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed reducing this to $155 million, citing a $25 million cut needed for the Central and Southern Florida restoration element. $25 million is required for the Central and Southern Florida restoration element due to the Corps' inability to use the original amount requested for FY2011. The Administration has not proposed across-the-board reductions for savings and slippage since FY2006. These reductions account for delays in project spending caused by various factors. In FY2006, Congress stopped applying an S&S rate to decrease reprogramming allocations among projects. The FY2011 Senate Appropriations Committee markup included reductions for Investigations, Construction, Operations and Maintenance, and Mississippi Rivers & Tributaries. The Obama Administration requested $43.0 million for the Central and Southern Florida restoration element due to delays in project spending. The Obama Administration requested $43.0 million for the Central Utah Project (CUP) Completion Account in FY2011, $1 million more than the amount appropriated for FY2010. The FY2011 request for the Bureau of Reclamation totaled $1.064 billion in gross current budget authority, $22 million less than enacted for FY2010. Another $167 million is estimated to be available for FY2011 via \"permanent and other\" funds. $167 million is estimated to be available for FY2011 via \"permanent and other\" funds, for a total of $1.182 billion. The discretionary budget request for Title II funding was approximately $1.107 billion. The Senate bill would have appropriated $1.133 billion, while the House subcommittee's bill would have appropriated $1.108 billion. P.L. 112-10 appropriated $1.094 billion for these programs. Reclamation's largest account, Water and Related Resources, includes construction, operations, and maintenance. The Obama Administration requested $913.6 million for the Water and Related Resources Account for FY2011, a reduction from FY2010 of $37.6 million. H.R. 1 proposed funding the account at $911.6 million, $39 million below the FY2010 level. The House-passed version of H.R. 1 included amendments with potentially significant policy impacts. Section 4028 of H.R. 1 aimed to eliminate funding for a dam removal study in the Klamath basin, while Section 4075 would have prohibited funding for the implementation of biological opinions related to the Central Valley Project and the California State Project. It also barred funding for the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act. The Bureau of Reclamation manages dams and water diversion projects in the West, providing water for irrigation and reclaiming arid lands. They oversee over 300 storage reservoirs in 17 states, serving 10 million acres of farmland and 31 million people. The Bureau of Reclamation manages water for irrigation and hydroelectric power in the West, serving 10 million acres of farmland and 31 million people. Reclamation facilities also offer flood control, recreation, and wildlife benefits, but face controversy over their impact on species and water conflicts. The budget consists mainly of project funding with limited programs. In FY2010, the House Committee on Appropriations criticized Reclamation for not providing leadership in water supply management in the West. The challenges of balancing needs and increasing demand require active leadership. The Central Valley Project in California, one of Reclamation's largest projects, has faced water delivery limitations due to drought and environmental restrictions. In FY2010, the House Committee on Appropriations criticized Reclamation for not providing leadership in water supply management in the West, particularly regarding the Central Valley Project in California. Water delivery limitations have been imposed on CVP facilities due to drought and environmental restrictions, leading to amendments in appropriations bills to prevent new Biological Opinions on project operations. The 2004 Operations Criteria and Plan (OCAP) increased pumping from the Delta, endangering Delta Smelt and salmon in California, protected under the Endangered Species Act. Factors like invasive species, pollution, and water withdrawals also contribute to fishery declines. Low Delta Smelt numbers led to court limits on pumping. The low numbers of Delta Smelt led to court-imposed limits on pumping, impacting water deliveries to certain districts and exacerbating unemployment. Proposed FY2010 amendments were not enacted, but a bill included a two-year authorization for water transfers among certain CVP contractors. The Administration requested $40.0 million for the California Bay-Delta Restoration Account (Bay-Delta, or CALFED) for FY2011, with funds targeted at water use efficiency, water quality, water storage, conveyance, and ecosystem restoration. Funding for conveyance declined, while funding for water use efficiency and science increased. The enacted Continuing Resolution (P.L. 112-10) provided the same amount as the President's FY2011 budget request, with funding for water use efficiency and science increasing substantially. Reclamation proposed an allocation of $72.1 million for the San Joaquin River Restoration Fund for FY2011, a significant increase over FY2010. The San Joaquin River Restoration Fund was authorized by Title X of the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-11) to implement fisheries restoration and water management provisions. Funding comes from a reallocation of $5.6 million annually from Central Valley Project Restoration Fund receipts and other sources. Additional authorization is needed for any allocation of receipts. Construction of Friant Dam in the 1940s blocked salmon migration in the San Joaquin River. The San Joaquin River Restoration Fund aims to restore the salmon run and improve water management. Additional authorization is required for fund allocations exceeding $88 million authorized in P.L. 111-11. Planned actions for FY2011 include releasing interim flows from Friant Dam and completing planning and design for channel improvements. The Senate Appropriations Committee markup included an additional $8 million for San Joaquin River restoration, in addition to the $72 million already allocated. The House-passed CR (H.R. 1) includes a provision that no funding be made available for implementation of the settlement agreement in FY2011. Reclamation has not commented on the potential impact of this provision. P.L. 112-10 did not specify funding levels for the settlement. Reclamation proposed funding for a new program for FY2011\u2014the WaterSMART. Reclamation proposed funding for the WaterSMART Program in FY2011, focusing on water conservation, re-use, and planning. The program includes WaterSMART Grants, Basin Studies, and Title XVI Projects, with a proposed increase of $27.4 million over FY2010 levels. In FY2011, Reclamation proposed $62 million for the WaterSMART Program, with $27 million for WaterSMART/Challenge Grants, $6 million for Basin Studies, and $29 million for Title XVI Projects. The Senate Appropriations Committee reduced funding to $20 million for Grants, $4 million for Studies, and $7.7 million for Projects. P.L. 112-10 did not specify funding levels for WaterSMART within the larger Water and Related Resources account. The Energy and Water Development bill has funded DOE programs since FY2005, including research on renewable energy, nuclear power, general science, environmental cleanup, and nuclear weapons. The FY2010 appropriations funded DOE programs at $27.1 billion, with additional funding from the ARRA for selected programs. The ARRA (P.L. 111-5) provided funding for selected DOE programs in FY2010. The Obama Administration requested $29.6 billion for DOE programs in FY2011, but the final legislation (P.L. 112-10) appropriated $26.3 billion. DOE administers various programs with different functions and missions, with the most important programs described in the following pages. The FY2011 request sought $2,355.5 million for the EERE. DOE's FY2011 request for EERE programs was $2,355.5 million, with an increase of $85.6 million compared to FY2010. However, P.L. 112-10 provided $1,825.6 million, a reduction of $416.9 million. Additionally, DOE requested $189.5 million for EDER programs, but P.L. 112-10 only provided $144.7 million. The DOE requested $50 million for a new science and engineering education program called RE-ENERGYSE to train a skilled clean energy workforce. The program aims to address the U.S. lag in educating students for emerging energy trades and green jobs. The DOE requested $50 million for the RE-ENERGYSE program to train a skilled clean energy workforce. This includes funding for higher education programs to develop professionals in the clean energy field and technical training for green jobs. The funding includes $15 million for a technical training, education, and outreach subprogram to support training programs at community colleges and other centers. It also supports a K-12 education activity aimed at educating and inspiring students to pursue clean energy careers and adopt sustainable energy practices. The DOE proposed a RE-ENERGYSE program with $115 million in funding in FY2010, but Congress did not fund it. The House Committee on Appropriations expressed concerns about the program's alignment with other departments and lack of sufficient details and background research. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $7.5 million for DOE to conduct a study to define education and workforce needs and assess program complementarity with other federal agencies. The committee seeks further dialogue to clarify the proposal's intentions and DOE's role in educational initiatives. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended zero funding for the FY2010 RE-ENERGYSE proposal and FY2011, with a net funding increase of $55.4 million for the Solar Program in FY2011. The Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) subprogram would receive the majority of the increase to support a demonstration project expected to accelerate CSP deployment in the desert Southwest by two to three years, leading to about 1,000 megawatts of new capacity. The DOE proposed a major CSP demonstration project to accelerate deployment in the desert Southwest by two to three years, adding 1,000 MW of new capacity. Firms are competing for CSP development permits, but water issues could be a barrier. The PV R&D Program received an increase of $23.5 million for the PV Manufacturing Initiative to reduce technology costs and promote commercialization. The Senate Committee recommended $50.0 million for the CSP demonstration. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $50.0 million for the CSP demonstration project, with a net increase of $42.5 million for the Wind Program and $49.0 million for a new offshore wind development activity. The offshore wind demonstration project aims to address various barriers and accelerate market deployment of over three gigawatts of planned projects. The DOE proposed a major wind demonstration project for offshore projects, the Cape Wind project has been delayed. The Senate Committee recommended funding for at least two offshore wind demonstration projects off the Atlantic Coast. The Geothermal Program would see an increase of $11.0 million, mainly for collaborative R&D activities addressing induced seismicity and water availability. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended funding for increased R&D efforts in geothermal systems, including addressing induced seismicity and water availability. They also directed the DOE to allocate $5.0 million towards low-temperature geothermal systems. The Vehicle Technologies Program would receive a net increase of $13.9 million, with a focus on improving battery and energy storage performance and cost. The Energy Efficient Building Systems Design Hub would receive a modest increase in funding from $22.0 million to $24.3 million, the only hub seeking more funding in FY2011. The omnibus climate/energy bills would authorize DOE to establish more hubs. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $8.7 million less than the request for the Buildings Program, with a lower amount for the Building Design Hub. The committee directed GAO to determine if new program guidelines are needed for the ENERGY STAR program. The Industrial Technologies Program would receive a net increase of $4.0 million, with a new Manufacturing Energy Systems subprogram established with funding of $10.0 million. The Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) would also see changes. The Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) would receive an increased budget of $10.3 million, focusing on meeting goals set by the Energy Independence and Security Act and Executive Orders. Efforts would include energy assessments, commissioning projects, fugitive emissions capture, and pilot projects for renewable energy sources. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended nearly the same funding as the request for alternative fueling stations. The Weatherization Program would have grown by $90.0 million, with $85.8 million supporting the Administration's goal to increase weatherization for low-income households. This increase would allow for the weatherization of an additional 13,200 households. The State Energy Program would see a $25.0 million increase to expand activities, while the Facilities Program would have a net increase of $38.5 million, mainly for the Energy Systems Integration Facility completion. The Weatherization Program would receive $100.0 million less than requested, with the Senate citing sufficient funds from the Recovery Act. The Senate Committee on Appropriations supported the requested increase in funding for the Energy Systems Integration Facility (ESIF) at NREL and research equipment. Program Direction would have a $60.0 million increase, with $54.8 million for salaries and benefits to handle more contracts and agreements. DOE expects transactions to double due to various requirements and accountability work. DOE expects transactions to double from FY2009 through FY2011, with Program Support receiving a $42.3 million increase, mainly for the Strategic Priorities and Impact Analysis subprogram. This subprogram focuses on policy analysis of EE and RE technologies as solutions to climate change, incorporating cross-cutting projects previously supported by all EERE programs. The proposed funding increase for the Program Support subprogram would enhance coordination and value by incorporating cross-cutting projects previously supported by all EERE programs. It would also support the Low-Carbon Energy Systems project to help meet climate goals set at the United Nations' 2009 Climate Change Conference. Additionally, $15.0 million of the increase would expand support for the International subprogram, focusing on energy security, economic goals, and climate change through partnerships with developing countries like China, India, and Brazil. The FY2011 funding increase would support new initiatives focused on global technology deployment and climate change mitigation, including the China and India Clean Energy Research Centers and programs under the Major Economies Forum. The expanded funding would also provide resources for EERE to support regional partnerships such as APEC, ECPA, EDIN, and a regional energy platform for Africa. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended increased funding for global technology deployment and climate change mitigation initiatives, including partnerships with countries like China, India, Russia, Brazil, Canada, and Argentina. They also recommended funding for congressionally directed projects, covering 134 activities. The Hydrogen/Fuel Cell Program would have been impacted by the funding changes. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended restoring funding for the Hydrogen/Fuel Cell Program by $37.0 million, the Market Transformation subprogram by $16.9 million, and the Water Power Program by $9.5 million. Water power technologies utilize marine and hydrokinetic resources to generate electricity. The DOE's Water Power Program focuses on technology development and market acceleration for marine and hydrokinetic resources to generate electricity. FY2010 funds support ongoing assessments and new projects, with FY2011 funding expected to continue and expand activities. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended additional funding, including $15.0 million for conventional hydropower. The DOE is shifting support towards cross-cutting technology efforts over specific industry activities. The Senate Committee recommended $14.0 million for the Industries of the Future program, which is $1.2 million less than FY2010 funding. The FY2011 request included $185.9 million for the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability, a $13.9 million increase. The FY2011 budget includes a $13.9 million increase for the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability, with a focus on energy storage technology to address power infrastructure issues and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This funding will support research on lithium-based batteries for stationary applications. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended the requested amount for energy storage technology programs, with an additional $4.3 million for specific projects. The total appropriation was reduced to $144.7 million in P.L. 112-10. The Obama Administration's FY2011 funding request for nuclear energy research and development was also mentioned. The Obama Administration's FY2011 funding request for nuclear energy research and development was $824.1 million, including advanced reactors, fuel cycle technology, and infrastructure support. The total nuclear energy request was 4.8% above the FY2010 appropriation. P.L. 112-10 provided $732.1 million for those programs, with an additional $88.2 million requested for safeguards and security at DOE's Idaho nuclear facilities. The nuclear energy R&D program focuses on generation, safety, waste storage, management, and security technologies to meet energy and climate goals. The Obama Administration's FY2011 funding request for nuclear energy research and development was $824.1 million, focusing on advanced reactors, fuel cycle technology, and infrastructure support. Critics argue that DOE's nuclear research program provides wasteful subsidies to an industry they believe should be phased out due to safety and economic concerns. The Nuclear Power 2010 Program, which assisted in designing new nuclear power plants, has been completed with no further funding. The newly established Reactor Concepts Research, Development, and Demonstration Program are now prioritized. The FY2011 budget request for nuclear energy research and development includes funding for small modular reactors, extending the lives of existing nuclear power plants, and research on spent nuclear fuel disposal and fuel cycle options. Additionally, a new program called Nuclear Energy Enabling Technologies (NEET) is proposed. The FY2011 budget request includes funding for Nuclear Energy Enabling Technologies (NEET) at $99.3 million, supporting various nuclear technologies and advanced power concepts. Generation IV Research and Development funding is split between NEET and Reactor Concepts RD&D. University nuclear education and research funding remains at $5 million under the RE-ENERGYSE initiative. $3 million is allocated for International Nuclear Energy Cooperation. The FY2011 budget request includes $195 million for the Reactor Concepts RD&D program, which covers the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) demonstration project and research on advanced reactors. New programs are being established for small modular reactors and enhancing the sustainability of existing commercial nuclear plants. The FY2011 budget request includes $195 million for the Reactor Concepts RD&D program, which covers the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) demonstration project. The NGNP is a high-temperature gas-cooled reactor intended for various industrial processes. The Obama Administration's budget did not initially mention the NGNP project, but Congress allocated $169 million in FY2010 and $103 million in FY2011 for its development. The FY2011 budget includes $103 million for NGNP, with a decision on final design and construction expected by the end of FY2011. The Advanced Reactor Concepts program, with a funding request of $21.9 million, focuses on reactors for improved sustainability and safety. The DOE's proposed Small Modular Reactors Program aims to focus on developing reactors for improved sustainability, safety, economics, security, and proliferation resistance. This program includes fast reactors using high-energy neutrons and reactors utilizing various heat-transfer fluids like liquid sodium. International collaboration in this area will continue through the Generation IV International Forum (GIF). The DOE requested $38.9 million for this program, which aims to explore small reactor concepts as alternatives to existing commercial reactors exceeding 1,000 megawatts of electric generating capacity. The DOE plans to award financial assistance for small modular reactors (SMRs) to reduce costs and make them easier to finance. The Light Water Reactor Sustainability Program will receive $25.8 million for research on extending the life of existing commercial light water reactors. The DOE's Light Water Reactor Sustainability Program aims to extend the life of existing commercial reactors beyond 60 years by studying aging materials and safety margins. Research also focuses on improving plant efficiency through capacity increases and system upgrades. The Fuel Cycle Research and Development Program conducts long-term research on technologies for managing spent nuclear fuel. Total FY2011 funding request for these programs is included in the DOE budget justification. The DOE's Fuel Cycle Research and Development Program, previously known as the Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative (AFCI), received a total FY2011 funding request of $201 million, $65 million higher than the previous year. The program focused on developing spent fuel reprocessing technology to recycle plutonium, uranium, and other radioactive materials into new nuclear fuel, as part of the Bush Administration's GNEP initiative to provide secure nuclear fuel services and prevent the spread of nuclear fuel cycle technology. The DOE's Fuel Cycle Research and Development Program, previously known as the Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative (AFCI), aims to discourage the international spread of nuclear fuel cycle technology. Under the Obama Administration, the program focuses on developing technology options for various nuclear fuel cycle approaches, including direct disposal of spent fuel and recycling. The program also conducts research on storage, transportation, and disposal of used nuclear fuel and radioactive wastes. The Fuel Cycle R&D Program supports the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future, researching waste treatment technologies and geologic disposal media. Other research areas include advanced fuels for reactors, nuclear waste characteristics, and fuel modeling and simulation. The NEET program focuses on nuclear energy technology issues such as reactor improvements, nuclear waste characteristics, and fuel cycle options. Research includes new reactor materials, weapons proliferation risks, advanced manufacturing methods, and sensors. The Energy Innovation Hub for Modeling and Simulation is also part of the program with increased funding. The NEET program received a slight increase in funding to $24.3 million. The Modeling and Simulation Hub aims to create a computer model of a reactor for better understanding of nuclear technology. The Obama Administration requested $586.6 million for Fossil Energy Research and Development in FY2011, a 12.7% decrease from the previous year's appropriation. This decrease reflects cuts in funding for Natural Gas Technologies, Unconventional Fossil Energy Technologies, and Cooperative Research and Development. The DOE Office of Fossil Energy plans to restructure the FY2012 Coal subprogram to focus more on carbon capture and storage technologies. This change follows a directive to merge FutureGen and the Clean Coal Power Initiative into a Carbon Capture Demonstration Initiative funded at $1.52 billion. The FutureGen project aimed to demonstrate clean coal-based power generation with capture technologies. The FY2011 request had no funding for the Carbon Capture Initiative. DOE has abandoned the FutureGen project concept and will use $1 billion to refit an existing plant for CO2 capture. The Clean Coal Technology program has only project-closeout activities remaining, with no further funding requested in FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a 24% increase in the Fossil Energy budget for FY2011, totaling $725.95 million. This increase would fund projects for high-quality fuels derived from coal/biomass feedstocks, meeting military and civilian specifications but with higher carbon lifecycle emissions than conventional petroleum fuels. Additionally, the committee supports the restoration of the Natural Gas Technologies program and the funding of a new Unconventional Fossil Energy program. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was authorized in 1975 to provide an emergency source of crude oil in case of supply interruptions. It consists of caverns in Louisiana and Texas with a capacity of 727 million barrels. The Northeast Heating Oil Reserve (NHOR) stores 2 million barrels of home heating oil. The federal government stores 2 million barrels of refined home heating oil in above-ground facilities in Connecticut, New Jersey, and Rhode Island. Since 1994, the SPR has not purchased oil, instead acquiring additions with royalty-in-kind (RIK) oil. Acquisition procedures include direct purchase, transfer of royalty oil, and receipt of premium barrels. In 2008, Congress ordered the DOE to suspend filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) unless oil prices dropped below $75/barrel. However, due to a sharp decline in oil prices, the Bush Administration announced plans in 2009 to purchase nearly 10.7 million barrels for the SPR. RIK fill was resumed in May 2009 at an average of 26,000 barrels per day, totaling over 6.1 million barrels to be delivered. The Secretary of the Department of the Interior announced the phasing out of the RIK Program, leading to the cancellation of upcoming natural gas sales. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 required the expansion of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to its authorized maximum of 1 billion barrels, with a possible site in Richton, MS being evaluated. The Administration proposed to suspend spending on expanding the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in its FY2011 request, redirecting $71 million to non-expansion operations and maintenance. This decision was based on EIA projections of declining U.S. petroleum consumption and import dependence, with the current Reserve projected to reach 90 days by 2025. The FY2011 request for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was reduced to $138.9 million, down from $243.8 million in FY2010. Congress approved $11.3 million for the NHOR in FY2010, with the same amount proposed for FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $209.9 million for the SPR and did not support canceling $71 million for the Richton, MS, SPR site expansion. P.L. 112-10 set the SPR spending level at $209.9 million but rescinded $86.8 million from prior year appropriations. The DOE Office of Science conducts basic research in six program areas and is a major federal funder of research in the physical sciences. For FY2011, DOE requested $5.121 billion for the Office of Science, an increase of 4.4% from the previous year. The House Appropriations Subcommittee recommended $4.900 billion, and the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $5.012 billion. In the 112th Congress, funding for the Office of Science varied between $4.018 billion and $4.857.7 billion. The President's Plan for Science and Innovation aimed to double R&D funding for the Office of Science and two other agencies by FY2016. The funding for the Office of Science increased over the decade from FY2006 to FY2016 as part of the American Competitiveness Initiative. The requested funding for basic energy sciences was $1.835 billion, up 12.1% from FY2010. Funding for Energy Frontier Research Centers would have increased by $40 million. The Administration proposed to establish new energy innovation hubs focusing on materials for batteries and energy storage with $34 million in funding, and fuels from sunlight with $24 million. Congress funded only three out of the eight proposed hubs in FY2010, aiming to address basic science and technology challenges for the nation's energy future. In the 111th Congress, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1.739 billion for basic energy sciences, providing about two-thirds of the requested funding for energy innovation hubs and $17 million for high-energy physics projects at Fermilab. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $84 million for the Large Hadron Collider and $627 million for biological and environmental research in the 111th Congress. This included increases for climate and Earth system modeling and genomic science. In the 111th Congress, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $614 million, including $11 million for an artificial retina project and $15 million transferred to nuclear physics for medicine research. H.R. 1 would have limited funding for biological and environmental research to $302 million in FY2011. The request for nuclear physics was $562 million, up 5.0% from FY2010, with $36 million allocated for the CEBAF upgrade. In FY2011, the CEBAF project received $36 million, an increase from $20 million in FY2010. The total cost and completion date remained unchanged, but some construction activities were moved forward and funded by the Recovery Act. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $554 million for the project, with an additional $35 million proposed for leadership computing facilities at national laboratories. In FY2011, funding for leadership computing facilities at national laboratories increased by $35 million. However, there was a decrease of $6 million for research and evaluation prototypes due to the conclusion of a partnership with DARPA. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $418 million for fusion energy sciences, a 10.8% decrease from the previous year. The U.S. contribution to ITER would drop from $135 million to $80 million in FY2011 due to construction delays. The ITER partners include China, the European Union, India, Japan, Russia, South Korea, and the United States. The total project cost is estimated to be between $1.45 billion to $2.2 billion. The expected start-up date for ITER was delayed to November 2019. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $384 million for fusion energy sciences in the 111th Congress. The committee expressed concern about the cost and schedule of ITER and U.S. leadership in materials science for fusion. ARPA-E, authorized by the America COMPETES Act, supports energy technology research projects to overcome long-term technological barriers. FY2011 requested $300 million for ARPA-E. President Obama's FY2011 budget requested $300 million for ARPA-E, but only $179.6 million was appropriated. The budget also called for the termination of DOE's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management, which was responsible for developing a nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain. The Obama Administration decided in June 2008 that Yucca Mountain is not a viable option for nuclear waste disposal. No funding is being requested for Yucca Mountain in FY2011, and the DOE filed a motion to withdraw the license application in 2010. The NRC rejected the withdrawal motion, citing the NWPA's requirement for full consideration of the application. The full NRC commission is now reviewing the withdrawal. The NRC is considering the withdrawal of the license application for Yucca Mountain, which is opposed by states with defense-related waste. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future, established by the DOE, will evaluate alternatives to Yucca Mountain. Congress provided $5 million for the Commission to study options for temporary storage, treatment, and permanent disposal of highly radioactive nuclear waste. A draft report is expected within 18 months. The DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy will lead future waste management activities, with substantial funding requested for research on disposal technologies. Nuclear utilities have won court decisions due to DOE's failure to meet waste disposal deadlines. Utilities upset over DOE's failure to meet waste disposal deadlines have won court decisions upholding the department's obligation to compensate for damages. DOE estimates liability payments could reach $11 billion if waste removal doesn't begin by 2020. The DOE established the Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to provide loan guarantees for energy projects using new technologies. Subsidy costs, ranging from 1% to 10% of the loan guarantee amount, must be paid upfront by each project to cover potential government costs. The DOE's loan guarantee program, established under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, allows for subsidy costs ranging from 1% to 10% of the loan guarantee amount. The FY2009 omnibus funding measure provided DOE with a loan guarantee authority of $47 billion, with allocations for various energy sectors. President Obama's FY2011 budget proposed increasing the loan guarantee ceiling for nuclear power plants to $54.5 billion. The DOE increased the loan guarantee ceiling for nuclear power plants to $54.5 billion. The first preliminary nuclear loan guarantee was announced for the Vogtle nuclear power plant in Georgia, guaranteeing $8.33 billion for two new reactors. This would bring the total nuclear loan guarantee ceiling to $18.5 billion, enough for about four reactors. The DOE proposed increasing the nuclear loan guarantee ceiling to $54.5 billion, which could cover about 13 reactors. Critics argue that this would divert resources from cleaner energy technologies. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act created a loan guarantee program for renewable energy projects. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act established a loan guarantee program for renewable energy projects with a $6 billion appropriation. $2 billion was transferred to the \"cash for clunkers\" program and $1.5 billion was rescinded for other purposes. The remaining $2.5 billion should support loan guarantees totaling $25 billion. President Obama requested a $500 million appropriation for energy efficiency and renewable energy loan guarantees under the Sec. 1703 program. The DOE budget estimates that this funding would support loan guarantees totaling $3 billion-$5 billion. Additionally, $58 million was requested for administrative costs, offset by receipts. P.L. 112-10 reduced the loan guarantee authority for non-nuclear technologies to $7.3 billion. The loan guarantee authority for non-nuclear technologies under Section 1703 has been reduced to $7.3 billion, with an additional $170 million provided for renewable energy and efficiency projects. The total loan guarantee ceiling now stands at about $9.3 billion, with separate allocations for nuclear and uranium enrichment projects. The loan guarantee authority for renewable energy and efficiency projects under P.L. 112-10 is up to $1.183 billion, in addition to the remaining $31.8 billion in Section 1703 authority. This additional authority is available to projects that applied under Section 1705 before February 24, 2011. The Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, established by P.L. 110-140, allowed DOE to issue up to $25 billion in direct loans. The DOE has a loan program for automobile manufacturers and parts suppliers to invest in plant capacity for fuel-efficient vehicles. Congress established the Stockpile Stewardship Program to maintain nuclear weapons expertise. The Stockpile Stewardship Program, established by Congress, ensures the preservation of US nuclear weapons expertise and the safety of the nuclear weapons stockpile without underground testing. It is operated by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), a semi-autonomous agency within the Department of Energy (DOE). The Stockpile Stewardship Program, established by Congress, ensures the preservation of US nuclear weapons expertise and the safety of the nuclear weapons stockpile without underground testing. NNSA manages two programs outside of the Weapons Activities account: Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation and Naval Reactors. P.L. 111-84, section 3113, established a \"stockpile management\" program to increase the reliability, safety, and security of the nuclear weapons stockpile. The stockpile management program, established by P.L. 111-84, aims to enhance the reliability, safety, and security of the nuclear weapons stockpile. It requires any changes to the stockpile to align with program objectives and basic design parameters, emphasizing the use of well-understood or certifiable components without the need for underground nuclear weapons testing. Stewardship activities primarily occur at the nuclear weapons complex, which includes three laboratories. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) manages and sets policy for a complex consisting of eight sites, including laboratories and production sites. The FY2011 request document includes data from NNSA's Future Years Nuclear Security Program (FYNSP) for FY2012-FY2015. The complex was larger during the Cold War in terms of sites, budgets, and personnel. During the Cold War, the National Nuclear Security Administration managed a larger complex with more sites, budgets, and personnel. Despite post-Cold War reductions, Congress has pushed for further changes to the Complex for efficiency, security, and cost reduction. In response, NNSA submitted the \"Complex 2030\" plan to Congress in January 2007, which was met with displeasure by the House Appropriations Committee in FY2008. The Senate Appropriations Committee criticized the NNSA's lack of a long-term efficiency strategy for the nuclear complex and rejected the premature deployment of the Complex 2030 consolidation effort. Congress emphasized the need for a comprehensive expenditure plan before considering further funding for Complex 2030 and the Reliable Replacement Warhead program. The joint explanatory statement accompanying the consolidated appropriations bill directed the Administration to develop a comprehensive nuclear weapons strategy for the 21st century. NNSA announced its plan, Complex Transformation, which includes retaining existing sites, reducing the weapons program footprint, closing or transferring structures, reducing the number of weapons workers, dismantling weapons more rapidly, and building new facilities like the Uranium Processing Facility at Y-12 Plant. The Administration's Complex Transformation plan includes building new facilities like the Uranium Processing Facility at Y-12 Plant, Weapons Surveillance Facility at Pantex Plant, and Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement Nuclear Facility at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The House Appropriations Committee requires substantial changes to the nuclear weapons complex before considering funding for new programs or the Reliable Replacement Warhead. The House Appropriations Committee recommends replacing Cold War strategies with a modern nuclear deterrent strategy, determining the size and nature of the nuclear stockpile and weapons complex needed for future security needs. They suggest eliminating funds for the Reliable Replacement Warhead and other programs in FY2009. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended eliminating funds for the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) and other programs in FY2009. The FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act did not provide RRW funds, and the FY2010 and FY2011 budgets did not request RRW funds due to the Administration's decision to cancel its development. The FY2011 budget request for Weapons Activities was $7,008.8 million, with Presidential commitments towards a nuclear-free world. The Department of Defense submitted its Nuclear Posture Review Report in April 2010, outlining the role of U.S. nuclear forces and plans for sustaining the nuclear arsenal. The President provided Congress with a classified report on maintaining delivery platforms and a reliable U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile. The Administration plans to invest $80 billion in the next decade to sustain and modernize the nuclear weapons complex. The projections for weapons stockpile and infrastructure costs are outlined for each fiscal year. In the 112th Congress, there was a contentious reduction proposed in the requested increase for nuclear weapons funding. The Administration worked out a compromise with Senate Republicans to increase funding for Weapons Activities over FY2010-FY2020 to modernize the nuclear weapons complex and maintain nuclear weapons. The New START resolution emphasized the commitment to a robust stockpile stewardship program and nuclear weapons production. The President's FY2012 budget requested an increase in funding for Weapons Activities to ensure the safety and reliability of the US nuclear arsenal. The issue of funding was resolved for FY2011 with a reduction in the budget, raising questions about Congress providing the funds for FY2012. The Defense Stockpile Work (DSW) involves direct work on nuclear weapons in the stockpile, including monitoring their condition, maintenance, repairs, refurbishment, life extension, modifications, R&D support, and dismantlement. Specific items under DSW include Life Extension Programs (LEPs) to extend the life of existing warheads. An LEP for the B61 mods 7 and 11 bombs was completed in FY2009, and an ongoing LEP for the W76 warhead for the Trident II submarine-launched ballistic missile. The FY2010 appropriation was $223.2 million, and the FY2011 request was $249.5 million. The W76-1 program had a FY2010 appropriation of $223.2 million and a FY2011 request of $249.5 million, which was recommended by the Senate Appropriations Committee. The program involves maintenance, replacement of components, and assessment for all weapon types in the stockpile. The FY2010 appropriation for Stockpile Systems was $357.8 million, with a FY2011 request of $649.4 million. The FY2010 appropriation for Stockpile Systems was $357.8 million, with a FY2011 request of $649.4 million. The largest increase in funding is for the B61 bomb, from $92.0 million to $317.1 million. Other substantial increases are for the W78 warhead and the W87 warhead. B61 funds are divided into system sustainment and phase 6.2/6.2A study. The former involves maintenance, inspections, assessments, and the like, while the latter supports a life extension study. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount for Stockpile Systems, with a focus on surveillance activities for nuclear weapons to maintain confidence in their performance. The funding would support a life extension study of nuclear and non-nuclear components, including enhanced surety and compatibility with modern aircraft like the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. \"A robust surveillance program is crucial for maintaining confidence in nuclear weapons performance without underground testing. Concerns were raised about potential shortfalls in surveillance jeopardizing the annual assessment of weapon safety and reliability. The B61 bomb has multiple variants, with a controversial study on a new variant, the B61-12, aiming to consolidate variants into a single version. The House bill recommended no funds for this redesign without a clear nuclear weapons strategy, stockpile, and complex plans.\" The Senate bill included the requested amount for nuclear weapons strategy and stockpile. The conference bill allocated $92.0 million for B61 stockpile systems activities, with $32.5 million for a study of nonnuclear components for the proposed B61-12. Upon completion of the Nuclear Posture Review, an additional $15,000,000 can be reallocated for the B61-12 non-nuclear upgrade study. No funds may be used for B61-12 nuclear components. The conference agreement allocated $92.0 million for B61 stockpile systems activities, with $32.5 million for a study of nonnuclear components for the proposed B61-12. An additional $15,000,000 can be reallocated for the B61-12 non-nuclear upgrade study upon completion of the Nuclear Posture Review. No funds may be used for B61-12 nuclear components without prior approval. For FY2011, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount for a study on safety and security features for a refurbished B61. NNSA was directed to submit a report on the cost-benefit analysis of adding these features and to provide an updated analysis on B61 LEP alternatives. The President and Congress aim to reduce the stockpile to the lowest level consistent with national security. The FY2010 current appropriation for warhead dismantlement and disposition is $96.1 million, with a decrease to $58.0 million in the FY2011 request. This reduction is due to fewer dismantlements and component dispositions, aiming to prevent storage problems in the nuclear weapons enterprise. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $64.4 million, an increase of $6.4 million above the request, with $27.5 million allocated to help restore weapons dismantlement activities at Pantex. Several components of WDD have been relocated within DOE or to different budget categories within Weapons Activities in recent years. The major activity for FY2009, the Pit Disassembly and Conversion Facility (PDCF), was moved to the Readiness in Technical Base and Facilities account for FY2010. The \"pit\" is the fissile component of a nuclear warhead that initiates a thermonuclear explosion. PDCF would convert the plutonium in pits to plutonium oxide for use in a Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) for commercial nuclear reactors. WDD includes a Waste Solidification Building (WSB) to convert liquid wastes into solids for disposal off-site. The WSB account has been moved to the Fissile Materials Disposition Program within Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation. Stockpile Services include Production Support, R&D, Certification, Safety, Management, Technology, Production, and Plutonium Sustainment. NNSA states that Stockpile Services provide the foundation for production capability and capacity within the nuclear security enterprise, supporting various weapons programs. The FY2010 appropriation for funds supporting weapons-types was $828.8 million, with a $941.5 million request for FY2011. The largest increase was for Plutonium Sustainment, aimed at maintaining technical skills and restoring the capability to build up to 10 pits per year. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a $30.5 million reduction in the request. The FY2010 appropriation for weapons-type funds was $828.8 million, with a $941.5 million request for FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a $30.5 million reduction in the request. Within the funds provided, at least $74.0 million shall be used to support surveillance, no more than $160.0 million for plutonium sustainment, and $84.1 million for weapons assembly, disassembly, and dismantlement at Pantex. These efforts provide specialized scientific knowledge and technical support for the nuclear weapons stockpile. The FY2011 request for nuclear weapons laboratories includes funding for campaigns such as the Science Campaign, aimed at improving scientific capabilities for assessing nuclear explosives without underground testing. The FY2011 request is $365.2 million, an increase from the FY2010 appropriation of $295.6 million. The FY2011 request for nuclear weapons laboratories is $365.2 million, an increase from the current appropriation of $295.6 million. The Advanced Certification program would see a significant increase from $19.4 million to $77.0 million to improve weapons certification processes and modernize surety options through experiments at the Nevada Test Site and the Dual-Axis Radiographic Hydrodynamic Test Facility at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended reducing the FY2011 request for nuclear weapons laboratories by $10.9 million. $53.3 million is allocated to the Z facility at Sandia, and $10.0 million for plutonium experiments. The Z facility in Albuquerque releases high energy pulses for material studies. The committee deems the facility crucial for nuclear stockpile safety. The FY2010 appropriation for assessing and improving the safety, reliability, and performance of nuclear weapons was $150.0 million, with a $141.9 million request for FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended increasing the amount by $8.0 million to enhance engineering capabilities and infrastructure. The committee provided funds to support capabilities for creating a nuclear environment to simulate nuclear weapons. The Inertial Confinement Fusion Ignition and High Yield Campaign aims to develop tools for high temperatures and pressures in the laboratory for weapons research and scientific talent attraction. NNSA emphasizes the importance of high energy density physics experiments to validate theoretical models used for assessing nuclear weapon energy generation. The National Ignition Facility (NIF) is the world's largest laser used to validate advanced theoretical models for assessing and certifying the stockpile without nuclear testing. NIF aims to achieve thermonuclear burn conditions in the laboratory, a significant scientific achievement. Despite initial controversy and technical issues, NIF was dedicated in May 2009 and has shown progress in its research efforts. In January 2010, scientists successfully fired an array of 192 laser beams at NIF. In January 2010, scientists at NIF fired 192 laser beams at a helium-filled target, heating it to 6 million degrees Fahrenheit. This marked a significant advance in their research efforts at the $3.5 billion facility. The FY2010 appropriation was $457.9 million, with a $481.5 million request for FY2011, supported by the Senate Appropriations Committee. An independent advisory board was recommended to evaluate experiments at NIF, including the Advanced Simulation and Computing Campaign for nuclear weapons modeling. The Advanced Simulation and Computing Campaign develops computation-based models of nuclear weapons using data from various sources to create a surrogate for nuclear testing. Some doubt the reliability of simulations for certifying warhead safety and advocate for a return to testing. The campaign includes funding for hardware, operations, and software, with appropriations of $567.6 million in FY2010 and a request of $615.7 million in FY2011. The Readiness Campaign focuses on developing technologies to improve manufacturing safety and efficiency, with a current appropriation of $100.0 million in FY2010 and a request of $112.1 million in FY2011. The largest dollar increase is for Stockpile Readiness, aimed at ensuring future manufacturing capabilities for weapon components containing special materials. The largest dollar increase in the Stockpile Readiness program is for advances in manufacturing lithium parts at the Y-12 National Security Complex and ensuring capability at the Savannah River Site to produce and test components. The Tritium Readiness program saw a significant decrease in funding due to the cyclical nature of fixed-price contracting for tritium producing materials. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended reducing Tritium Readiness funding from $50.2 million to $30.2 million for FY2011, with concerns about technical challenges in tritium production. The program funds infrastructure and operations at Complex sites, with a FY2011 request of $1,849.0 million. The largest funding category is Operations of Facilities, with a FY2011 request of $1,258.0 million. Other categories include Program Readiness, Material Recycle and Recovery, and Construction. Institutional Site Support funding within Operations of Facilities decreased from $120.1 million in FY2010 to $41.0 million in the FY2011 request. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended increasing RTBF funds by $71.0 million above the requested $41.0 million for FY2011. It expressed concern about insufficient funds for Pantex and Y-12, stating that the increase would prevent layoffs and disruptions to dismantlement and life extension schedules. The committee also restored funding for the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center and raised concerns about NNSA's fund usage for a replacement. The Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Facility Replacement (CMRR) at Los Alamos National Laboratory is a costly and controversial project to replace the aging CMR building. It supports research into plutonium and pit production at Los Alamos. The House Appropriations Committee has expressed concerns about the project's current design. The House Appropriations Committee and Senate Appropriations Committee have expressed concerns about the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Facility Replacement (CMRR) project at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The House committee stated that proceeding with the project as currently designed would strongly prejudice any nuclear complex transformation plan, while the Senate committee highlighted issues with worker safety and containment precautions in the existing CMR facility. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees have raised concerns about the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Facility Replacement (CMRR) project at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The House committee emphasized the impact on nuclear complex transformation plans, while the Senate committee focused on worker safety and containment issues in the existing CMR facility. The House recommended no funds for the project, while the Senate recommended an increase of $24.8 million for CMRR. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $125.0 million, an increase of $24.8 million, for CMRR to address funding shortfalls. NNSA justifies the increase by stating that CMRR's capabilities are currently restricted, while others argue that Plutonium Facility 4 could fulfill some of CMRR's functions. Weapons Activities include various programs, such as Secure Transportation Asset for safe operations. The Secure Transportation Asset program provides safe transport of nuclear weapons and materials, with a FY2010 appropriation of $234.9 million and a FY2011 request of $248.0 million. The Nuclear Counterterrorism Incident Response program responds to nuclear incidents globally and defends against nuclear terrorism, with a FY2010 appropriation of $221.9 million and a FY2011 request of $233.1 million. The FY2011 appropriation for the Nuclear Counterterrorism Incident Response program was $221.9 million, with a requested amount of $233.1 million. The Facilities and Infrastructure Recapitalization Program focuses on restoring the physical infrastructure of the nuclear security enterprise, with a FY2010 appropriation of $93.9 million and a FY2011 request of $94.0 million. Site Stewardship aims to ensure environmental compliance and operational efficiency, consolidating several earlier programs. The FY2010 budget for the nuclear security enterprise was $61.3 million, reduced from the requested $90.4 million due to budget limitations. The Senate denied funding for the stewardship planning initiative in FY2010. The FY2011 request was $105.5 million, with a recommended reduction by the Senate Appropriations Committee. Defense Nuclear Security includes operations, maintenance, and construction. The FY2010 budget for Defense Nuclear Security was $769.0 million, with a reduction to $720.0 million in the FY2011 request. The reduction was mainly due to efficiencies in staffing levels and procurement. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $668.0 million for operations and maintenance, and $43.0 million for construction. The FY2011 budget for construction was reduced by $9.0 million to $43.0 million for safeguards and security upgrades. Cyber Security aims to enhance information technology security within the NNSA enterprise. The FY2011 request for Cyber Security was $124.3 million, with the Senate Appropriations Committee supporting the requested amount. DOE's nonproliferation and national security programs provide technical support for U.S. efforts. The National Nuclear Security Administration's security programs aim to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons globally. Funding for these programs increased to $2.137 billion in FY2010, with additional funds requested for FY2011 to support construction projects like the Pit Disassembly plant. The Nonproliferation and Verification R&D program received $317.3 million for FY2010, with a request for $351.6 million for FY2011. International Materials Protection, Control, and Accounting (MPC&A) was funded at $572.1 million in FY2010, with a request for $590.1 million for FY2011. Nonproliferation and International Security programs, including international safeguards and export controls, had a FY2011 request of $155.9 million compared to $187.2 million appropriated for FY2010. The Fissile Materials Disposition program aims to dispose of U.S. surplus weapons-grade plutonium by persuading Russia to shut down nuclear reactors producing weapons-grade plutonium. Two reactors were shut down in 2008 and replaced with fossil-fueled facilities, with the third reactor scheduled for shutdown in December 2010. Funding for the program was $24.5 million in FY2010, with no further funding requested for FY2011. The Fissile Materials Disposition program aims to dispose of U.S. surplus weapons plutonium by converting it into fuel for commercial power reactors. Funding for the program was controversial due to lack of progress on disposing of Russian plutonium, but the Obama Administration allocated $701.9 million for FY2010. Rosatom agreed on a program in November 2007 to dispose of Russian surplus weapon-grade plutonium using fast reactors under nonproliferation restrictions. The FY2011 budget request was $1,030.7 million for the Savannah River project and $100 million for research on a gas-turbine modular helium reactor. The Global Threat Reduction Initiative aims to convert research reactors worldwide from using highly enriched uranium. The Office of Environmental Management was established by DOE in 1989 to clean up former nuclear weapons production facilities, including disposing of radioactive waste and surplus nuclear materials. The FY2011 budget request for this program was $558.8 million. The Office of Environmental Management oversees the cleanup of federal nuclear energy research laboratories and excess buildings. Cleanup efforts are ongoing at over 100 federal facilities across the United States, with some facilities requiring cleanup for several years or even decades due to high-level radioactive waste storage and severe contamination. As of FY2010, the Office of Environmental Management managed 18 facilities. DOE estimates that completing cleanup at 18 facilities could cost between $192.8 billion and $247.2 billion. Additional funds may be necessary for operating and maintaining cleanup remedies, monitoring contaminant levels, and ensuring the effectiveness of long-term activities for radioactive waste containment. The Office of Environmental Management oversees cleanup of facilities with long radioactive decay periods. Some facilities have been transferred to other DOE offices or the Army Corps of Engineers. Congress directed the transfer of less contaminated sites to the Corps under FUSRAP. Cleanup of FUSRAP sites is funded within the Corps' civil works budget. The Corps is responsible for activities at FUSRAP sites for the first two years after cleanup. DOE's Office of Legacy Management handles long-term maintenance. Funding for these offices is discussed in three appropriations accounts. The Defense Environmental Cleanup, Non-Defense Environmental Cleanup, and Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund received a total of $5.69 billion in FY2011, which is a decrease from the President's request and the previous year's appropriation. The FY2011 appropriations for DOE's Office of Environmental Management accounts were $5.69 billion, lower than the President's request and the previous year. Additionally, P.L. 112-10 rescinded $22.7 million in unobligated balances from previous fiscal years for the three accounts, affecting cleanup efforts. The pace of cleanup at DOE's largest nuclear weapons production facilities, including Hanford, Savannah River Site, and Idaho National Laboratory, has been a concern due to high-level radioactive waste storage. These facilities have complex cleanup challenges from years of weapons production, requiring significant funding from the Non-Defense Environmental Cleanup account. The Office of Environmental Management relies heavily on funding from three facilities - Hanford, Savannah River Site, and Idaho National Laboratory. Cleanup at these sites is expected to continue for decades, with completion estimated as late as 2062 for Hanford, 2040 for Savannah River Site, and 2044 for Idaho National Laboratory. These extended timelines are due to the substantial volumes of high-level radioactive wastes that need to be treated and disposed of at these locations. The high-level radioactive wastes stored in tanks at Hanford, Savannah River Site, and Idaho National Laboratory present technical difficulties for removal and treatment before disposal in a geologic repository. Delays in waste treatment facility construction raise concerns about environmental risks from potential untreated waste releases. Leakage from some tanks at Hanford has contaminated groundwater discharging into the Columbia River. The DOE monitors water quality in the Columbia River for contaminants from facilities leaking wastes. There is interest in funding cleanup of uranium enrichment facilities in KY, OH, and TN. Title XI of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 established the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund to finance cleanup of facilities and reimburse licensees for cleanup costs. Congress authorized special assessments from nuclear utilities and payments from the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury. The Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund was created to fund cleanup of facilities and reimburse licensees for cleanup costs. The original requirement for contributions from the federal government and nuclear utilities expired in 2007, but Congress has continued federal payments through annual appropriations without separate reauthorizing legislation. The Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund was created to fund cleanup of facilities and reimburse licensees for cleanup costs. Congress has continued federal payments through annual appropriations without separate reauthorizing legislation. The fund balance may not be enough to cover future cleanup costs, with only $4.5 billion available as of FY2010, far less than the estimated $13.9 billion to $27.7 billion needed. The President proposed reinstating nuclear utility assessments. The President proposed reinstating nuclear utility assessments to increase resources for cleanup, with OMB estimating $200 million in assessments for FY2011 and $2.2 billion over a 10-year period. Congress needs to enact reauthorizing legislation for the federal government to resume collection of the assessments, with bills introduced in the 111th Congress but not enacted. The Senate Appropriations Committee questioned the need for reinstating assessments for the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund in its report on S. 3635. The President requested $730.5 million for cleanup in FY2011, assuming $200 million in offsetting receipts from nuclear utility assessments. P.L. 112-10 included $507.0 million in appropriations for FY2011, a $223.5 million decrease from the President's request. In FY2011, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $550.0 million for the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund, noting the lack of legislation to generate $200 million in offsetting receipts. P.L. 112-10 allocated $33.6 million for the fund, a decrease from the President's request. In FY2011, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $550.0 million for the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund, with a federal payment lower than the President's request. The payment is made through a transfer of funds from the Defense Environmental Cleanup Account, fulfilling the required federal contribution as authorized in the Energy Policy Act of 1992. The 1992 law mandates DOE to cover cleanup costs even if the fund is depleted, subject to annual appropriations. The Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund requires additional federal funds for future cleanup of facilities. Once cleaned up, responsibility for long-term activities is transferred to DOE's Office of Legacy Management, funded within the Other Defense Activities Account. The Office of Legacy Management, funded within the Other Defense Activities Account, received $788.4 million in FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $188.6 million for FY2011, similar to the President's request but slightly less than the previous year's appropriation. Funding needs are expected to increase as nuclear weapons production facilities are cleaned up and transferred from the Office of Environmental. DOE's Power Marketing Administrations sell power from dams operated by federal agencies for various purposes like irrigation and flood control. Weapons production facilities are being cleaned up and transferred for long-term management. The Power Marketing Administrations sell power from federal dams to preference customers at low rates to cover expenses and repay debt. The Obama Administration's FY2011 request for PMAs was $118.5 million, a 4% decrease from FY2010. The FY2011 budget request for Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) was $118.5 million, a 4% decrease from FY2010. The change enacted in FY2010 reclassified PMAs' receipts from mandatory to discretionary funding, offsetting expenses for WAPA, SWPA, and SEPA. SWPA requested $12.7 million and WAPA requested $105.5 million in discretionary funding. SEPA's receipts were expected to cover all operating costs in FY2011. Additionally, $220,000 was requested for Falcon and Amistad operations and maintenance, with collections of $23 million from Colorado River basins. The Power Marketing Administrations' budget request for FY2011 was $118.5 million, with SWPA and WAPA requesting discretionary funding. BPA, a self-funded agency, operates under the Federal Columbia River Transmission System Act of 1974 and has permanent borrowing authority increased to $4.45 billion in FY2003. ARRA further increased BPA's borrowing authority to $7.7 billion. The FY2011 budget proposed Bonneville accrue expenditures of $3.763 billion for operating expenses, $77 million for Projects Funded in Advance, $758 million for capital investments, and $387 million for capital transfers. ARRA provided $10 million in non-reimbursable appropriations to WAPA for activities authorized in section 402 of the act, along with borrowing authority for new or upgraded electric power transmission. The Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) now has the authority to borrow up to $3.25 billion from the United States Treasury for new or upgraded electric power transmission lines to support renewable energy resources. This borrowing authority is available on a permanent basis through the Transmission Infrastructure Program. Other independent agencies funded by the Energy and Water Development bill include the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC), and the Denali Commission. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requested $1.053 billion for FY2011, a decrease of $13.3 million from the previous year. The budget included $272.5 million for new reactor activities, mainly for handling new nuclear power plant license applications. P.L. 112-10 provided $1.052.3 billion for NRC, including funding for the inspector general's office. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has seen an increase in new reactor license applications since 2007 due to volatile fossil fuel prices and incentives from the Energy Policy Act of 2005. However, some license applicants have halted their projects. The NRC's proposed FY2011 budget included funding for licensing the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, which the Obama Administration wants to cancel. The NRC's FY2011 budget request included funding for adjudicating the license withdrawal motion for the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, as well as activities related to an orderly closure of the agency's Yucca Mountain licensing support. The requested amount was included in P.L. 112-10. The NRC's FY2011 budget request included $531.6 million for activities such as reactor safety inspections, license renewals, and security oversight. Homeland security spending within NRC is set to increase by $3.8 million. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 requires 90% of NRC's budget to be offset by fees on licensees. The NRC's FY2011 budget request included $531.6 million for reactor safety inspections, license renewals, and security oversight. Expenditures from the Nuclear Waste Fund for waste repository licensing and general homeland security are not subject to offset by fees on licensees. The FY2011 request would result in a net appropriation of $138.3 million, a decrease from FY2010. P.L. 112-10 provides for a net appropriation of $138.1 million, including the inspector general's office."
