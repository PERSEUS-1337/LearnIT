    "content": "The \"H-2A Improvement Act\" allows nonimmigrant status for dairy workers, sheepherders, and goat herders coming temporarily to the United States to perform agricultural labor. Special rules are established for aliens employed in these roles. Section 218 of the Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to include special rules for aliens employed as dairy workers, sheepherders, or goat herders, allowing them to be admitted for an initial period of 3 years under nonimmigrant status. Aliens employed as dairy workers, sheepherders, or goat herders may be admitted for an initial period of 3 years, with the possibility of extending for an additional 3 years. Employers hiring H-2A workers for these positions are exempt from showing they are temporary or seasonal. There is also a provision for adjustment to lawful permanent resident status. An eligible alien with H-2A worker status as a dairy worker, sheepherder, or goat herder for at least 33 of the last 36 months can seek immigrant visa under section 203(b)(3)(A)(iii). An eligible alien with H-2A worker status in dairy, sheepherding, or goat herding for 33 of the last 36 months can apply for an immigrant visa under section 203(b)(3)(A)(iii) without the need for labor certification. The visa petition can be filed by the employer or the eligible alien themselves. Filing a petition or application for adjustment of status based on a petition for an eligible alien with H-2A worker status shall not be a basis for denying various requests related to H-2A workers. The Secretary of Homeland Security will extend the stay of an eligible alien with a pending or approved petition for H-2A worker status in 1-year increments until a final determination is made on the alien's eligibility. The Secretary of Homeland Security will extend the stay of an eligible alien with a pending or approved petition for H-2A worker status in 1-year increments until a final determination is made on the alien's eligibility for adjustment of status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence. Nothing in this paragraph may prevent an eligible alien from seeking adjustment of status in accordance with any other provision of law."
