    "content": "China maintained a currency peg to the U.S. dollar at an exchange rate of 8.28 yuan to the dollar from 1994 to July 21, 2005. The Chinese central bank controlled the peg by buying or selling dollar-denominated assets to balance demand for the yuan. This fixed exchange rate prevented the yuan from fluctuating based on economic factors. The Chinese government maintained a currency peg to the U.S. dollar at an exchange rate of 8.28 yuan to the dollar from 1994 to July 21, 2005. The fixed value of the yuan was likely close to the market value initially, but economic conditions changed in the last few years of the peg. The Chinese government announced on July 21, 2005, that the yuan's exchange rate would become adjustable based on market supply and demand, referencing a basket of currencies including the dollar, yen, and euro. The Chinese government announced on July 21, 2005, that the yuan's exchange rate would be adjusted based on a currency basket including the dollar, yen, and euro. The U.S. dollar against the yuan would be immediately adjusted from 8.28 to 8.11, with a 2.1% appreciation. The yuan would be allowed to fluctuate by 0.3% (later 0.5%) daily against the basket, but remained not fully convertible in international markets. China continued tight restrictions on capital transactions, describing the situation as a \"managed float.\" Since July 2005, China has allowed the yuan to appreciate slowly through market intervention, accumulating foreign reserves rapidly. China's foreign exchange reserves grew from $403 billion in 2003 to $1.7 trillion in March 2008, with a large trade surplus of $262 billion in 2007. The yuan has risen 16% against the dollar since the 2005 reforms, indicating a significant shift in the economic environment between China and the United States. The yuan has appreciated 16% against the dollar since 2005 reforms, causing concerns in the United States about the falling dollar and its impact on the economy. Despite the increase in the yuan's value, worries persist. This paper reviews economic issues related to China's currency policy, including concerns raised by the United States and China's reluctance to make significant changes. It discusses China's fixed exchange rate regime, studies on China's real exchange rate, trends in the U.S.-China trade imbalance, and the economic consequences of China's currency policy. The economic consequences of China's currency policy for both China and the United States, including China's massive accumulation of foreign exchange reserves and purchases of U.S. federal debt instruments. Policy options for the United States to induce China to reform its currency policy, with many U.S. policymakers, business people, and labor representatives arguing that China's currency is significantly undervalued, affecting trade between the two countries. Many analysts argue that China's undervalued currency has led to a significant increase in the U.S. trade deficit with China, impacting U.S. production and employment in various manufacturing sectors. This currency policy also influences other East Asian countries to keep their currencies weak against the dollar to compete with Chinese goods. Several groups are urging the Bush Administration to pressure China to revalue its currency or allow it to float freely in international markets. President Bush and officials have criticized China's currency policy, advocating for market-determined exchange rates. Initially, the Administration rejected calls to directly pressure China to abandon its currency peg, instead focusing on encouraging financial system reform. The Bush Administration sought to encourage China to reform its financial system and adopt a more flexible currency policy, with a tougher stance taken in April 2005. This was driven by complaints from Members over China's currency policy and the introduction of currency bills. During the 109th congressional session, the Senate failed to reject an amendment imposing a 27.5% tariff on Chinese goods if China didn't appreciate its currency. Senate Republicans negotiated to allow a vote on a similar bill sponsored by Senator Schumer at a later date. During the 109th Congress, sponsors of an amendment agreed not to offer similar amendments to other bills. Supporters of S. 295 threatened to bring the bill up for a vote on two occasions in 2006 but were convinced not to by Administration and Chinese officials. Several currency bills were introduced, and significant events regarding China's currency policy included a 4.1% increase in import prices from China from April 2007 to April 2008. The index was first published in December 2003. U.S. imports from China rose by only 1.8% in the first three months of 2008. The exchange rate with the dollar was 7.00 yuan on May 8, 2008, an appreciation of 15.9% since July 2005. China's foreign exchange reserves reached $1.68 trillion by the end of March 2008. The China Investment Corporation (CIC) was officially launched on September 29, 2007, with an initial capitalization of $200 billion. China's CIC, with $200 billion capitalization, invested $5 billion in Morgan Stanley. In response to rumors, China stated it had no plans to sell off its dollar assets. Regulations for domestic firms were eliminated. The government eliminated regulations for domestic firms regarding foreign exchange holdings. The IMF clarified currency manipulation and emphasized the need to address it. A petition was filed over China's currency practices. The USTR's office declined a petition regarding China's currency practices, despite a request for a trade dispute case to be brought to the WTO. The Treasury Department is required to report on exchange rate policies of countries with large surpluses and determine if they manipulate their currencies against the dollar for unfair trade advantages. The Treasury Department reports on currency manipulation by major trading partners, with China being cited for manipulating its currency in the past due to a dual exchange rate system. No country has been designated as a currency manipulator since 1994. Since 1994, the Treasury Department reports have increasingly focused on China's currency policy and reforms. Despite praising China's July 2005 currency reforms, the reports criticized China for not fully implementing commitments to increase flexibility in its exchange rate mechanism and rely more on market forces to determine the yuan's value. China's new managed float exchange rate regime was described as based on market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies. The Treasury Department's report in June 2007 stated that China's currency policy, described as based on market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies, did not significantly influence the daily closing level of the yuan. Despite this, the trading behavior suggested that the new mechanism was still a tightly managed currency peg against the dollar. Treasury decided not to label China as a currency manipulator due to assurances from Chinese officials about commitment to market-determined currency flexibility and promoting domestic growth through financial reform. The Treasury Department's reports in June and December 2007 addressed China's currency policy and urged for the acceleration of RMB's exchange rate appreciation to minimize risks for China and the world. Treasury did not label China as a currency manipulator but emphasized the need for market-determined currency flexibility and financial reform. Many Members criticize Treasury's decision not to label China as a currency manipulator despite its interventions to control the exchange rate. Calls for legislation to revise criteria for currency manipulation determination. Chinese officials argue for their currency policy. Chinese officials defend their currency policy, stating it is for economic stability and investor confidence, not to favor exports or discourage imports. They fear changing the policy could lead to an economic crisis and harm export industries during ongoing economic reforms. Chinese officials are concerned about rising unrest in rural areas due to income disparities and government corruption. They argue that appreciating the currency could lower farmers' income and strain the underdeveloped banking system. Chinese officials were considering currency reform but decided against it after the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis, believing that China's currency peg helped protect its economy. China's currency has been relatively immune from crisis, with U.S. officials urging faster reforms for a more flexible currency system. Fixed exchange rates have a historical background, including the Bretton Woods system and the international gold standard. China's currency policy was based on a fixed exchange rate until July 2005, where the central bank maintained a constant yuan-dollar exchange rate. This system contrasted with a floating exchange rate, like the one the United States has with the Euro area, where market forces determine the exchange rate. Under a floating exchange rate system, the exchange rate of the euro to the dollar is determined by the relative demand for goods and assets of the Euro area and the United States. Changes in demand for a country's currency can lead to fluctuations in the exchange rate. Maintaining a fixed exchange rate requires no action from the central bank as long as it aligns with the market rate. The Chinese maintaining a floating exchange rate would likely lead to currency appreciation due to productivity and quality improvements, increasing demand for Chinese goods and foreign direct investment. To maintain an exchange rate peg in changing economic circumstances, the central bank must adjust currency supply to match market demand by altering foreign exchange reserves. The current account balance is closely tied to the trade balance between the United States and China. Any increase in net exports or net private capital inflows leads to a corresponding increase in foreign exchange reserves to maintain the exchange rate peg. Excess demand for yuan has been observed in recent years, prompting the central bank to maintain the peg by adjusting its currency supply. Since 2005, the Chinese central bank has maintained a prevailing exchange rate peg by increasing foreign reserves through buying dollars from the public. They hold U.S. financial securities instead of U.S. dollars, accumulating reserves rapidly and becoming the world's largest holder in 2006. China surpassed Japan as the world's largest holder of foreign exchange reserves, with reserves growing from $75 billion in 1995 to $1.53 trillion in 2007. Despite a 43% increase in foreign exchange holdings from 2006 to 2007, the yuan has appreciated by about 16% against the dollar by April 2008. This shift in currency value is attributed to a \"managed float\" system where market forces play a role in determining the exchange rate. The Chinese government maintains a \"managed float\" system for the yuan, allowing market forces to influence its movement while intervening to slow its appreciation against the dollar. This strategy is evident in the rapid accumulation of foreign reserves, suggesting that a freely floating yuan would appreciate more quickly. The Chinese government accumulates foreign exchange reserves to finance trade and protect against currency speculation. The rapid increase in reserves in China has outpaced GDP and imports growth, indicating a potential strategy to prevent the yuan from appreciating too quickly against the dollar. The nature of China's foreign reserves, including the share held in U.S. assets and the reasons for annual increases, remains largely unknown. Economic activity is influenced by the real exchange rate, which takes inflation into account. The United States and China experienced similar overall price level increases from 1994 to 2003, impacting the difference between real and nominal exchange rates. In 2003, China had higher inflation than the United States, causing the real and nominal exchange rates to diverge. The real exchange rate appreciated from China's perspective, making their exports more expensive. However, from 1997 to 2003, the real and nominal exchange rates converged due to China's lower inflation rate compared to the U.S. In 2003, the Chinese exchange rate reached its lowest level since 1994 in real terms, making their exports progressively less expensive. The yuan has appreciated since 1997, bringing it almost back to its 1998 level in real terms. If the demand for Chinese goods increases, the floating yuan would appreciate until the trade balance returns to equilibrium. The yuan has appreciated since 1997, bringing it almost back to its 1998 level in real terms. With a fixed exchange rate, the real exchange rate returns to its market value through price adjustment instead, which takes time. If the exchange rate were fixed below the market level, Chinese exports would be relatively inexpensive and U.S. imports would be relatively expensive, leading to a persistent trade surplus with the United States. The purchase of U.S. assets by private Chinese citizens and the accumulation of dollar reserves by the Chinese central bank increase the supply of yuan, causing inflation in China. This leads to a rise in prices, making exports costlier and imports cheaper, eventually returning the trade surplus to equilibrium. Despite the fixed nominal exchange rate, the real exchange rate adjusts to market value over time, impacting trade dynamics. When a country uses its monetary policy to influence the value of its currency, it loses the ability to use monetary and fiscal policy to counteract changes in the business cycle. For example, a peg would prevent a country from lowering interest rates to offset an economic downturn, leading to capital outflows. When a country pegs its currency to another with higher interest rates, it risks losing monetary autonomy during an economic downturn. Capital may flow out, putting pressure on the currency peg until interest rates are raised. This loss of autonomy is less significant for small countries tied to neighbors with similar business cycles. China maintains a fixed exchange rate with capital controls to preserve monetary autonomy, unlike countries closely linked to partners with similar business cycles. Chinese enterprises must exchange foreign currency for yuan, and individuals and firms have limited access to foreign exchange. China's fixed exchange rate and capital controls restrict the exchange of foreign currency for yuan. This allows China to maintain monetary autonomy, despite limited access to foreign exchange for individuals and firms. The yuan's appreciation is influenced by the central bank's foreign reserves, with uncertainty about its potential increase due to lack of data before June 2005. Estimates of yuan's undervaluation were made until June 2005 to assess sensitivity of imports and exports to exchange rate changes. Two main methods used were \"fundamental equilibrium exchange rate\" and \"purchasing power parity\" methods. The fundamental equilibrium exchange rate (FEER) method is used to estimate misalignments in exchange rates based on the belief that current account balances are temporarily out of line with their \"fundamental\" value. This method calculates how much the exchange rate must change to achieve the desired current account adjustment. Ernest Preeg estimated that the yuan was undervalued by 40% in 2003, based on rule-of-thumb estimates. This claim is not backed by formal analysis but is derived from observations on Chinese foreign exchange reserves and trade surplus. In 2002, there was a decrease in net foreign direct investment flows. The trade surplus would be zero without the increase in foreign exchange reserves. A 1% decline in the dollar could lead to a $10 billion decline in the trade deficit in the United States. The dollar would need to decline by 40% to eliminate the $400 billion trade deficit. The Chinese trade surplus plus net FDI flows equaled the increase in foreign exchange reserves. The Institute for International Economics (IIE) estimates that the yuan was 15%-25% undervalued in 2003. It argues that the current account surplus should be reduced by $50 billion to return to equilibrium, leading to a deficit of 1%-1.5% of GDP in China. The Institute for International Economics (IIE) estimates that the yuan was 15%-25% undervalued in 2003, with a current account surplus reduction of $50 billion needed to return to equilibrium, resulting in a deficit of 1%-1.5% of GDP in China. IIE Fellow Morris Goldstein testified that estimates of yuan misalignment can be obtained through trade models or by gauging the appreciation needed to reduce global payment imbalances, particularly the U.S. current-account deficit. Goldman Sachs Economic Research Group has estimated the yuan's revaluation required for achieving equilibrium. Goldman Sachs Economic Research Group estimates that the yuan was 9.5%-15% undervalued in 2003. They suggest a 9.5%-15% revaluation to achieve equilibrium, based on their elasticity estimates. Virginie Coudert and Cecile Couharde argue that China has an underlying current account deficit of 1.5%-2.8% of GDP. Goldman Sachs estimates the yuan was 9.5%-15% undervalued in 2003, suggesting a revaluation for equilibrium. Coudert and Couharde argue China has a current account deficit of 1.5%-2.8% of GDP, with the yuan 44%-54% undervalued against the dollar. These estimates are not from econometric models but based on general observations. The estimates of the yuan's undervaluation are not based on economic models but on \"rules of thumb\" assumptions. The main source of contention is defining an \"equilibrium\" current account balance, with no consensus on what equilibrium would be. The authors base equilibrium on personal opinion, with some using arbitrary assumptions and others more sophisticated ones. Changing the assumed equilibrium current account balance significantly affects estimated undervaluation. Different saving and investment rates lead to countries lending and borrowing from each other. The Preeg, IIE, and Goldman Sachs estimates suggest a deficit in China's current account balance, allowing for FDI inflows but not portfolio borrowing. Choosing a balance instead of a deficit as the equilibrium benchmark would result in smaller estimates of the yuan's undervaluation. The current situation in China involves limited capital flows due to capital controls. It is uncertain whether requiring Chinese borrowing from the world is more sustainable than China lending to the world. China needs to increase foreign reserves to prevent a rise in foreign indebtedness. Capital controls make it challenging to determine China's equilibrium current account balance. If China maintains capital controls after currency reform, the current account balance may be stable. However, if capital controls are eliminated with a floating exchange rate, the economic situation would change. Private Chinese citizens could borrow or lend to the world, resulting in a trade deficit or surplus. If private citizens lend as much as the Chinese central bank currently does to the US, the equilibrium would shift. If China maintains capital controls after currency reform, the current account balance may be stable. However, if capital controls are eliminated with a floating exchange rate, the economic situation would change. Private Chinese citizens could borrow or lend to the world, resulting in a trade deficit or surplus. The equilibrium market exchange rate would be equal to the current fixed rate, and the trade deficit would remain unchanged. If private capital outflows exceeded the current increase in foreign reserves, the yuan would depreciate. The issue of whether China would be a net borrower or lender if their currency floated and capital controls were abolished is uncertain due to their high national saving and investment rates. The equilibrium exchange rate is considered \"market determined\" due to capital controls in China. Bosworth argues that China's high internal saving rate allows it to offset FDI inflows with official outflows through foreign reserve accumulation. Wang suggests that China's equilibrium current account surplus may be larger than the actual surplus, indicating an overvalued yuan. The FEER approach is also mentioned. The yuan may be overvalued, with the FEER approach suggesting that revaluing it could reduce the unsustainable U.S. trade deficit. The Coudert and Couharde estimate that the yuan is 54% undervalued, based on the belief that the dollar is 35% overvalued, the yen 37% undervalued, and the euro 27% undervalued in 2003. The sustainability of the U.S. trade deficit is not widely agreed upon, but evidence suggests it is not unsustainable in the medium term. The trade deficit has persisted for several years without hindering economic growth or causing significant declines in the dollar. The U.S. trade deficit has not caused significant declines in the dollar. Even if China's trade surplus is eliminated, it may still have a bilateral surplus with the U.S. Other countries could lend to the U.S., causing other deficits to widen. It is unclear how much of a reduction in the U.S. trade deficit can be attributed to China. The international experience suggests that even countries with overall trade deficits, like the United States, can have trading partners with whom they run surpluses. Comparisons to other East Asian countries show mixed results in current account balances, with some countries running deficits and others running surpluses. Since the Asian financial crisis in 1997, countries like Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, and Japan have consistently maintained current account surpluses. This trend, along with large foreign exchange reserves, is also observed in other East Asian countries with varying exchange rate regimes. China's current account balance, although large compared to other regions, is in line with its neighbors. China's current account balance is not significantly different from its neighbors, including Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, and Japan, who have maintained surpluses since the Asian financial crisis in 1997. Estimates of the yuan's undervaluation based on purchasing power parity suggest a 56% undervaluation in February 2007 according to the Economist's Big Mac Index. The Big Mac Index is a flawed method for determining exchange rates as it only considers the price of a Big Mac in different countries. The index concludes that the yuan is undervalued by 56% based on this comparison, but this method does not account for non-tradeable goods like services. Li Ong estimates that most of the value of a Big Mac comes from services, which are influenced by local factors such as wages and rent. The Big Mac Index determines exchange rates based on the price of a Big Mac in different countries, but it does not consider non-tradeable goods like services. Local factors such as wages and rent influence the value of a Big Mac. Purchasing power parity is unreliable in reality as prices are lower in developing countries than in industrialized countries. Some economists use purchasing power parity (PPP) to estimate a country's currency value, but this method has limitations. PPP may not accurately predict exchange rates in the short term and can identify any currency as overvalued or undervalued. Additionally, PPP estimates may not change much over time, even with significant changes in the trade deficit. Economist Jeffrey Frankel suggests that income level can be regressed on the exchange rate to determine a country's equilibrium exchange rate based on PPP. He estimates China's exchange rate was undervalued by 36% in 2000, with speculation that it has increased since then. Coudert and Couharde calculated the yuan to be undervalued by 41%-51% in 2003. Frankel notes that PPP only holds over the long run and financial flows can impact market-determined exchange rates. Economist Jeffrey Frankel suggests that income level can be regressed on the exchange rate to determine a country's equilibrium exchange rate based on PPP. He warns that financial flows can cause market-determined exchange rates to diverge from PPP for years. Frankel also emphasizes the need for a gradual adjustment in exchange rates to avoid economic disruption and questions the immediate impact of exchange rate changes on trade deficits and employment. The \"Balassa-Samuelson\" effect suggests that as countries become richer, their exchange rates are expected to appreciate due to productivity growth in tradeable goods. Different proxies, like income levels and consumer price index to producer price index ratio, are used to estimate undervaluation of currencies. In 2003, different studies estimated the yuan to be undervalued by varying percentages. Wang found the yuan to be only modestly undervalued, cautioning that the price index proxy may be inaccurate for China. Cheung et al. were able to replicate others' results. Cheung et al. question the undervaluation of the yuan, noting that estimates lack statistical significance and become smaller when adjusting for serial correlation. Dunaway et al. show that adding additional variables to the PPP model affects the results. The Treasury Department's report on exchange rates discusses the use of economic models to estimate currency misalignment, noting the impact of additional variables on undervaluation estimates. The report highlights the variability in conclusions due to model adjustments and the lack of a single accurate model for explaining exchange rate movements. The Treasury Department's report on exchange rates emphasizes the importance of using economic models to estimate currency misalignment. It suggests focusing on serious misalignments, using real effective exchange rates, utilizing multiple models, and considering empirical data, indicators, policies, and institutional factors to understand exchange rate movements. The Treasury Department's report emphasizes using economic models to estimate currency misalignment, considering factors beyond trade flows. Critics of China's currency peg point to the U.S.-China trade imbalance as proof of undervaluation, but other factors and structural causes also play a role in bilateral trade balances. China's overall trade surplus in 2007 was $262 billion, with a $256 billion surplus with the US. Despite the undervaluation of the yuan against the dollar, China had trade deficits with other countries like Taiwan and South Korea. In 2007, China had a $256 billion trade surplus with the US, but also deficits with Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan. US exports to China increased significantly, making China the third largest US export market. Total US exports rose 18.1% in 2007. In 2007, China became the third largest U.S. export market, with a significant portion of imports coming from export-oriented multinational companies that have moved production to China for low-cost labor. The share of China's exports produced by foreign-invested enterprises rose from 1.9% in 1986 to 40.7% in 1996, and further to a higher percentage by 2007. In 2007, China became the third largest U.S. export market, with a significant portion of imports coming from foreign-invested enterprises. By 2007, FIEs accounted for 57.1% of China's exports and 58.5% of imports, importing raw materials for assembly and exporting final products. China tends to run trade deficits with East Asian countries and trade surpluses with countries like the United States. This has contributed to the rising U.S. trade deficit with China. The rising U.S. trade deficit with China is due to China becoming a production platform for foreign companies, particularly foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs). FIEs account for a significant portion of China's exports and imports, with a sharp rise in their trade share linked to rapid growth in foreign direct investment (FDI) in China. In 2007, a large portion of China's exports, mainly to the United States, was driven by foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs). FIEs import about 80% of what they export, having little impact on China's overall trade balance. Foreign multinational companies shifted production to China from other East Asian countries, as shown in Table 6. In 2000, Japan was the top foreign supplier of U.S. computer equipment, but by 2007, China became the largest supplier with a 51.5% share. Japan's ranking fell to 4th place, with a 7.0% share. U.S. imports of computer equipment from China increased by 436% in seven years, while the total value of U.S. imports only rose by 26%. Chinese computer production has increased significantly, with a large share attributed to foreign companies moving manufacturing facilities to China. The undervaluation of the yuan against the dollar has benefits and costs for both China and the United States, as it makes Chinese exports cheaper and boosts China's export industries. This policy also makes China more attractive for foreign investment in export-oriented industries. The undervaluation of China's currency attracts foreign investment in export-oriented production facilities, benefiting Chinese exporting firms but hurting non-exporting Chinese firms reliant on imports. This policy may hinder efficient resource allocation in the long run. In the short run, a revaluation of the yuan could impact China's economy by reducing aggregate spending through increased imports and decreased exports. The debate on whether this is beneficial depends on the current state of the Chinese economy, with some arguing for revaluation to prevent overheating and inflation, while others highlight the potential disruption to underemployed rural labor currently absorbed by the undervalued yuan. Many economists argue that China's currency policy hinders the government's ability to use monetary policy for stable economic growth, leading to an overreliance on fixed investment and exports. This policy may also increase the risk of non-performing loans in the banking system due to easy credit expansion. China's currency policy has led to an inflow of \"hot money\" into speculative ventures like real estate and the stock market. Banks are unable to use interest rate policies effectively to regulate investments, as raising rates could attract more foreign capital. Keeping interest rates low in a booming economy may lead to inefficient capital allocation and overproduction in certain sectors. Additionally, China's large foreign exchange reserves may impact the economy. The accumulation of large foreign exchange reserves by China may facilitate a quicker move towards a fully convertible currency. However, it also comes with opportunity costs as these funds could be used for infrastructure, education, social safety net, and bank recapitalization, which may offer higher returns to the economy than holding U.S. Treasuries or Chinese bonds. The accumulation of foreign exchange reserves by China, instead of investing in infrastructure, education, and social safety nets, may have higher returns to the economy than U.S. Treasuries or Chinese bonds. This can lead to a decrease in the value of the yuan, making Chinese exports cheaper and U.S. exports more expensive, resulting in a rise in the U.S. trade deficit and a reduction in aggregate demand in the short run. China's exports to the United States, mainly labor-intensive consumer goods, do not directly compete with domestic producers. However, some U.S. industries, such as makers of machine tools and furniture, are concerned about growing competition. The undervalued Chinese currency poses a competitive challenge for U.S. industries like tool and die makers. While it may reduce their output, U.S. computer firms benefit from lower prices on imported parts, increasing their competitiveness in global markets. Additionally, many imports from China are produced by U.S.-invested enterprises, which also benefit from the undervalued yuan. An undervalued yuan benefits U.S.-invested enterprises by lowering prices on imported parts, increasing competitiveness for U.S. computer firms. This leads to a current account deficit with China, resulting in capital flows to the U.S., boosting capital investment in plant and equipment due to lower interest rates. The lower interest rates caused by capital inflow from China benefit private firms and households in the U.S. by increasing investments and household spending on goods. Additionally, Chinese investments in U.S. Treasury securities fund U.S. assets. China is the second largest foreign holder of U.S. Treasury securities, with $397 billion as of September 2007. If the U.S. trade deficit with China is eliminated, the U.S. government would need to find other buyers for its securities at higher interest rates, increasing the budget deficit. The undervalued yuan lowers import prices from China, boosting U.S. consumption of goods. This improves terms-of-trade and increases purchasing power for U.S. consumers in the long term. The rise of the yuan against the dollar may have an impact. The price of Chinese products in the U.S. is being impacted by the dollar and rising raw material prices. Import prices from China increased by 4.1% from April 2007 to April 2008, the largest 12-month increase since December 2003. Critics blame China's currency policy for job losses in the U.S. manufacturing sector. In the U.S. manufacturing sector, 2.7 million factory jobs have been lost since July 2000. However, there is no clear link between job losses and imports from China. Manufacturing output is at an all-time high, with employment falling due to productivity growth, not a decline in output. The trade deficit is not limited to China, and there is a long-term trend shifting U.S. employment towards the service sector. The shift away from manufacturing towards the service sector in the U.S. has been significant, with employment in manufacturing decreasing over the years due to changing technology and comparative advantage in globalization. This trend is larger than the Chinese currency issue and predicts that the U.S. will focus on producing knowledge- and technology-intensive goods for trade with countries like China, which excel in producing labor-intensive goods. Trade leads to more manufacturing abroad and less in the United States, regardless of China's currency policy. Alan Greenspan stated in 2005 that an undervalued yuan does not significantly impact manufacturing activity or jobs in the U.S. Instead, the shift towards manufacturing abroad is expected to continue over time. Undervalued yuan does not affect aggregate demand in the US but shifts production towards firms benefiting from lower interest rates due to Chinese capital inflows. This leads to no significant impact on overall US employment or unemployment. Despite a widening trade deficit with China, the US unemployment rate decreased from 6.3% in 2003 to around 5% in 2008. The trade deficit with China has led to a shift in production towards firms benefiting from Chinese capital inflows. This shift may have adverse short-run consequences on aggregate spending and employment, potentially causing a temporary decline in the inflation rate. A decline in the inflation rate could be beneficial or harmful, depending on the current economic conditions. A fall in aggregate spending is more concerning in a sluggish economy than in full employment. Government policy adjustments and market forces can offset any output decline in the trade sector by boosting other elements of demand. Shifting U.S. output towards a higher capital base could expand the economy in the long run due to capital inflow/trade deficit, but U.S. citizens may not benefit from Chinese-owned capital. In the United States, U.S. workers using Chinese-owned capital would see higher productivity and wages. China accounts for a significant portion of U.S. imports, leading to a trade deficit due to domestic saving and investment imbalances. The United States has experienced a decline in saving as a share of GDP over the past two decades. Despite high rates of productivity growth and strong economic fundamentals, there is a chronically low household saving rate and a negative government saving rate due to the budget deficit. This leads to foreigners using their savings to finance investment opportunities in the U.S., resulting in a trade deficit. Foreign-owned capital yields returns to foreigners instead of Americans, while U.S. labor sees the benefits. China's gross national saving as a percent of GDP is significantly higher than the U.S., with a lower rate of private consumption. China also maintains a higher rate of gross fixed investment compared to the United States. China's gross national saving is 118% of its gross national investment, compared to 68% in the United States. This difference results in China having excess saving to invest overseas, while the United States needs to borrow from abroad. The current account balances as a percent of GDP are 9.0% for China and -6.2% for the United States, indicating a need for both countries to adjust their saving and investment patterns to reduce trade imbalances. Some analysts believe China is already moving in this direction based on statements from high-level officials. China is transitioning towards boosting consumer spending, as indicated by high-level officials. The Treasury Department's report highlighted China's commitment to sustainable domestic growth through modernizing the financial sector. However, shifting from exports and domestic investment to consumption for GDP growth may take years, with government policy only able to indirectly influence long-term consumption patterns. The United States has a trade deficit with some countries and a trade surplus with others due to comparative advantage. Concerns for the US include its low saving rate, reliance on foreign financing for investments, and the overall trade deficit being more important than bilateral trade balances. The United States relies on foreign financing for investments, including capital from China. The dollar has depreciated against various currencies, which could stimulate exports and reduce demand for imports. Some economists are concerned about the potential impact of a gradually declining dollar on economic activity. Some economists fear a sudden plummet in the value of the dollar due to the unsustainably large trade deficit, which could lead to severe dislocations in the U.S. economy. They worry that if the deficit persists at current levels, the net debt owed to foreigners would grow without bounds, potentially resulting in rapid dollar depreciation if investors realize it is inevitable. Some economists fear a sudden plummet in the value of the dollar due to the large trade deficit, leading to dislocations in the U.S. economy. The scenario of significant dollar depreciation is seen as unlikely but could have costly consequences. Central banks in China and other developing countries have accumulated foreign reserves to slow down the depreciation since 2002. Some Asian and oil-producing countries have built up foreign reserves to prevent their currency from appreciating against the dollar. This policy may continue as long as China does it, as other Asian countries see their exports competing directly with China. The support for the dollar by China and other developing countries has helped maintain investor confidence in U.S. assets despite the trade deficit. If China and other countries stop intervening in currency markets, the dollar could potentially drop significantly in a short period. The United States could pressure China for currency reforms, such as making the yuan fully convertible and allowing it to appreciate. Other options include reducing China's intervention in currency markets and increasing currency flexibility through financial sector reforms. Options to induce China to reform its exchange rate regime, including proposed legislation, have sparked a policy debate. Some Members of Congress are frustrated with the Treasury Department's failure to designate China as a currency manipulator, believing it would increase pressure on China to reform its currency practices. The Treasury Department's November 2005 currency report states that identifying \"fundamentally misaligned currencies\" is complex, with no formulaic procedure. Proposed legislation like H.R. 782, H.R. 2942, S. 796, and S. 1607 aim to address currency manipulation by requiring Treasury to identify such currencies. S. 1677 would mandate citing a country for currency manipulation regardless of intent. Proposed bills aim to address currency manipulation by requiring Treasury to identify fundamentally misaligned currencies. S. 1677 would mandate citing a country for currency manipulation regardless of intent, potentially pressuring China to reform its currency policy. President Bush and Administration officials believe China's currency policy is detrimental. The United States has been working to assist China in reforming its financial sector and currency policy. High-level talks like the Strategic Economic Dialogue have been used to encourage China to promote domestic consumption and reduce reliance on exports. China has been invited to attend G-7 meetings since 2004. China has been attending G-7 finance meetings since 2004, with its currency policy being a major topic of discussion. The United States has been pressuring China to make its currency more flexible, and there is a push within the G-7 to increase pressure on China to adjust its exchange rates. States could build consensus within the G-7 to pressure China on currency reform or persuade China to engage in talks with other East Asian economies to reach an exchange rate policy consensus. Other East Asian countries fear their exports would suffer without China's cooperation. The United States could also press for further actions. The United States could pressure China to work with the International Monetary Fund to understand economic risks and promote balanced growth. Convincing China that exchange rate liberalization is in its long-term interest is crucial. Threatening trade sanctions may be used as leverage. Some Members support legislation, such as H.R. 1002, to impose tariffs on imports from China unless it appreciates its currency. Proponents believe threats of tariffs were effective in the past to push China to reform its currency policy. Opponents argue that sanctions would violate WTO rules and could backfire. Some proposals aim to impose sanctions on currency policy without violating WTO rules. For instance, S. 1607 would restrict certain countries with misaligned policies from U.S. government procurement, oppose new multilateral bank loans, and halt financing by the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation. Critics claim China's currency policy breaches WTO rules, and the U.S. could potentially file a complaint. Critics argue that China's currency policy violates WTO rules. The US could take the issue to the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body (DSB), which could direct China to adjust its currency policy. If China refuses, the US may impose trade sanctions. Using the WTO offers a multilateral approach, but there is no guarantee of a ruling in favor of the US. The US could use Section 301 of U.S. trade law to address China's trade barriers and discriminatory practices. Failure to use WTO dispute resolution procedures may lead to China filing a WTO case against the US. In 2004, the Bush Administration rejected two Section 301 petitions on China's exchange rate policy. The Bush Administration rejected two Section 301 petitions on China's exchange rate policy, one by the China Currency Coalition and one by 30 Members of Congress. Both petitions aimed to bring a case before the WTO against China for violating WTO rules with its currency peg. Despite a later petition by 42 House Members, the USTR declined to pursue a trade dispute case in the WTO, expressing doubts about the chances of success. The Bush Administration rejected Section 301 petitions on China's exchange rate policy, expressing doubts about winning a case in the WTO. Legislation like H.R. 321 and S. 796 call for action against China's currency policy, seeking to modify WTO rules on currency manipulation. U.S. countervailing laws allow relief from imported products through higher duties. The Commerce Department pursued a countervailing case against Chinese subsidized products, imposing duties ranging from 11 to 20% in March 2007. Commerce Department imposed duties ranging from 11 to 20% on Chinese subsidized products. China's economic reforms have made some sectors market-based, allowing identification of government subsidies. Some argue that China's currency policy is an export subsidy actionable under U.S. countervailing laws. Proposed bills aim to apply countervailing laws to non-market economies and address currency misalignment. Several Members argue for legislation that would make currency misalignment or manipulation actionable under U.S. laws, citing WTO rules. Critics raise concerns about the difficulty of determining China's currency subsidy level and potential challenges in the WTO. U.S. antidumping laws allow relief for imports sold below fair value, with critics of China's currency policy highlighting the impact of undervaluing the yuan on Chinese prices. Critics of currency policy argue that undervaluing the yuan affects Chinese exports to the U.S., harming American industries. Proposed legislation aims to factor in currency misalignment on export prices for determining antidumping duties, but critics question its feasibility and WTO compatibility. Utilizing U.S. trade remedy laws may be an alternative approach. One option to address the surge in Chinese exports to the U.S. is to utilize U.S. trade remedy laws, such as safeguard provisions, to impose restrictions on imported Chinese products causing market disruption to domestic producers. This could provide temporary relief for affected U.S. firms. The surge in textile and apparel imports from China led the Bush Administration to invoke the China textile safeguard. An agreement was reached with China to limit certain exports until 2008. H.R. 782 and S. 796 would consider exchange rate misalignment by China in market disruption determinations under the safeguard. The Bush Administration invoked the China textile safeguard due to a surge in imports from China. Policy analysts caution against pressuring China on its currency policy, suggesting a more comprehensive trade strategy. U.S. officials have urged China to accelerate economic and trade reforms in SED talks. The Administration's policy in the SED talks focuses on urging China to boost domestic consumption and make its currency policy more flexible. U.S. trade policy should press China to comply with WTO commitments, addressing issues such as market access and protection of intellectual property rights. China's WTO commitments are clear and binding, giving the United States a stronger position to push China to liberalize its economy and open its markets. Supporters argue that China's leaders are more likely to adhere to international rules than respond to direct U.S. pressure. Concerns have been raised about China's large holdings of U.S. federal debt being used as a political tool. China's large holdings of U.S. federal debt could be used as a political tool against the United States, with China threatening to make the dollar collapse by selling off its U.S. Treasuries. This prompted concern among U.S. policymakers, including Senator Charles Grassley. Senator Charles Grassley raised concerns about China's large holdings of U.S. federal debt and asked the Chinese government to confirm that their comments did not reflect official policy. The Chinese ambassador responded that China had no plans to drastically adjust its foreign reserves, and an official from the People's Bank of China stated that U.S. government securities were an important part of China's foreign exchange reserves. China's large holdings of U.S. federal debt are an important component in China's foreign exchange reserve investment portfolio. China is considered a responsible investor and is unlikely to liquidate a large portion of its dollar-denominated assets. Such a move could lead to a sharp appreciation of the yuan against the dollar, resulting in a capital loss for China and lower value of its remaining U.S. assets. It could also increase the cost of China's exports to the United States and potentially reduce economic growth in the U.S. The Chinese government launched the China Investment Corporation (CIC) in 2007 to manage foreign exchange reserves, potentially diversifying away from dollar-denominated assets like Treasury securities. China's holdings of Treasury securities have increased minimally since then. If China allows its currency to be determined by market forces, the yuan could appreciate, boosting U.S. exports and reducing the bilateral trade deficit. This would also lead to a decrease in Chinese central bank purchases of U.S. assets. The falling dollar could lead to a rise in U.S. interest rates, reducing spending on investments and consumer goods. Analysts fear a sudden decline in Chinese demand for U.S. assets could destabilize the U.S. economy. A drop in the dollar's value could destabilize the U.S. economy, while a rise in the yuan could increase import prices and inflationary pressures. Floating exchange rates fluctuate frequently and are typically accompanied by the removal of capital controls. China's capital controls prevent citizens from freely buying and selling foreign currency. China opposes a floating exchange rate due to fears of large private capital outflows, which could lead to a depreciation of the exchange rate. This could reduce output for U.S. exporters and increase the bilateral trade deficit with the United States. China could attempt to float its exchange rate while maintaining its capital controls, eliminating the possibility of currency depreciation due to private capital outflows. This may make imposing effective capital controls more challenging, as a fluctuating currency would incentivize evasion. Another option is to maintain the status quo. Maintaining the status quo could lead to a slow rise in the nominal exchange rate, causing the real rate to adjust over time as inflation rates diverge between countries. This adjustment would decrease the U.S. trade deficit and benefit American exporters and import-competing firms. However, the process would take time, and pressure on the U.S. trade sector would persist in the meantime. No solution guarantees immediate results. China's high saving rate and the US's low saving rate contribute to their trade imbalances. Even with a floating exchange rate, persistent trade imbalances can occur at the bilateral level. China's low-cost labor and productivity gains continue to drive export growth to the US, regardless of the exchange rate regime. The significant appreciation of the yuan since 2005 has not reduced the U.S. trade deficit with China. The debate among U.S. policymakers over China's currency policy is linked to concerns over the trade deficit, decline in manufacturing employment, and China's economic rise. Most economists agree that China's currency would likely appreciate against the dollar if allowed to float. The yuan's appreciation against the dollar may not reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China, as other factors are at play. There is debate over the potential effects of a yuan appreciation on the U.S. economy, with some sectors benefiting and others being harmed. The trade deficit with China has not hindered the U.S. from achieving full employment. The U.S. trade deficit with China has not hindered full employment, with various factors affecting manufacturing employment. It is unclear if production has shifted to China from the U.S. or other low-wage countries. Foreign multilateral corporations' involvement in China's exports complicates who benefits from the trade relationship and the implications of the rising U.S. trade deficit with China. The rising U.S. trade deficit with China raises concerns about the effects of an appreciating yuan and the potential destabilizing effects of the falling dollar. There is debate over policy options to promote U.S. economic interests in light of China's accumulation of U.S. assets. Chinese officials plan to gradually make the currency more flexible and eventually adopt a floating currency to avoid disruptions to the economy. However, the current currency policy may be undermining these efforts by expanding the money supply. China's currency policy, including the accumulation of foreign reserves, promotes easy credit policies that may lead to non-performing loans. Efforts to limit bank loans in booming sectors are mainly government-directed, hindering the establishment of a market-based financial system. This policy acts as a de facto subsidy, benefiting some export industries while undermining others and preventing efficient resource distribution in the economy. China's currency policy, particularly its cautious exchange rate reforms, is criticized by U.S. officials for hindering global trade balance adjustments and potentially harming world economic growth. Both countries agree on the need for major economic reforms to boost domestic consumption and savings levels. China's currency policy is criticized by U.S. officials for hindering global trade balance adjustments and potentially harming world economic growth. The United States must do more to boost its level of domestic saving. China officials intend to boost economic development in the hinterland and expand spending on social security, health care, and education, but this will take many years to implement. Currency legislation in the 110th Congress on China's currency policy includes H.R. 321, which would require the Treasury Department to determine if China has manipulated its currency and impose additional tariffs on Chinese products if manipulation is found. The bill calls for action against China's currency policy, including filing a WTO case and modifying rules on currency manipulation. H.R. 782/S. 796 would apply U.S. countervailing laws to products from non-market economies like China and establish a new methodology for estimating government subsidies. Exchange rate misalignment would be actionable under U.S. countervailing law. The bills aim to address China's currency manipulation by making exchange rate misalignment actionable under U.S. countervailing law. They also require the Treasury Department to assess currency misalignment in reports to Congress, restrict the Department of Defense from buying certain Chinese products affected by currency misalignment, and consider currency misalignment in safeguard measures on Chinese imports. H.R. 1002 proposes additional tariffs on Chinese goods unless China stops manipulating its currency. H.R. 2942 is also mentioned in the context. The bills aim to address China's currency manipulation by applying countervailing laws to nonmarket economies and making exchange rate manipulation actionable under U.S. countervailing law. They require the Treasury Department to identify fundamentally misaligned currencies and take priority action if consultations fail to resolve the currency issues. The USTR would be required to take action in the WTO if necessary. The bill requires the Treasury Department to identify fundamentally misaligned currencies and take priority action if consultations fail to resolve the currency issues. If the designated country fails to adopt appropriate policies within 180 days, the U.S. would impose penalties such as antidumping duties, procurement bans, and financing restrictions. The bill requires the Treasury Department to identify countries manipulating their currencies and take action if they fail to address the issue. Penalties such as antidumping duties and financing restrictions would be imposed if appropriate measures are not taken within 180 days. The USTR may file a case in the WTO, and the Treasury Department could intervene in international currency markets. A modified version of the bill passed the Senate Finance Committee, giving Treasury the authority to address currency manipulation regardless of intent. S. 2813 (Bunning) introduced on August 1, 2007, requires the Treasury Department to identify currency manipulators, submit an action plan, and consult with the IMF. Several bills in the 109th Congress addressed foreign exchange rate policies, including S.Amdt. 309 (Schumer) imposing a tariff on Chinese goods for currency manipulation. The Senate failed to reject an amendment related to currency manipulation on April 6, 2005. Despite plans for a vote on S. 295, it was delayed in June 2005 due to expectations of China's currency reforms. In November 2005, Senator Schumer pushed for consideration of S. 295 after disappointment over China's currency reforms. On March 28, 2006, Schumer and Graham delayed the bill due to China's apparent seriousness about reform. However, by September 2006, Schumer was disappointed with China's lack of progress and requested the Senate to take up S. 295. On September 28, 2006, Senators Schumer and Graham announced they were persuaded by President Bush not to pursue a vote on S. 295 to give Secretary of Treasury Henry Paulson more time to negotiate with China on its currency policy. H.R. 3283 (English) would apply U.S. countervailing laws to non-market economies like China and require the Treasury Department to define \"currency manipulation\" and report on China's currency regime. The bill passed on July 27, 2005, and a similar bill was introduced in the Senate as S. 1421 (Collins)."
