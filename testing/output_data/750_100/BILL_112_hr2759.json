SHORT TITLE, ETC.\" The Act may be cited as the \"Business Transparency on Trafficking and Slavery Act.\" Congress finds that in 2010, the Department of Labor identified goods made by forced labor and child labor from 70 countries. The United States is the largest importer, and there is a growing demand for information on human rights impacts of products. California enacted the first State law in 2010 requiring public disclosure by manufacturers and retail companies. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 requires disclosure of policies to eradicate slavery, forced labor, and human trafficking in supply chains. The Act has exceptions for goods not produced in sufficient quantities in the US. Consumers cannot bring civil actions for enforcement of this provision in US courts. The Tariff Act aims to protect American manufacturers from unfairly priced goods, not consumers from tainted goods. Enforcement actions are limited, with fewer than 40 recorded in 80 years. Other mechanisms related to slavery and trafficking in commerce face similar issues of scope and inability to identify specific suppliers. Congress recognizes forced labor, slavery, and human trafficking as serious concerns. Legislation is needed to address forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor in commerce, as current regulations are inadequate. Businesses can play a role in solving these issues by being transparent. Businesses can address forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor by being transparent and responding to consumer and investor demands. SEC. 2. DISCLOSURE TO SEC RELATING TO SLAVERY CONDITIONS WITHIN PRODUCT SUPPLY CHAINS. Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is amended to require disclosures relating to slavery conditions within product supply chains. The Commission must promulgate regulations within 270 days for companies to include such disclosures in their annual reports. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is amended to require companies to disclose measures taken to address forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor in their supply chains. This includes policies to identify and eliminate such practices. Companies are required to disclose policies addressing forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor in their supply chains. This includes policies to identify and eliminate these practices, as well as prohibiting the use of corporate products, facilities, or services for such purposes. Companies must disclose their efforts to address risks of forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor in their supply chains. This includes identifying risks, measures taken to eliminate them, and specifying if verification was done by a third party. The text chunk specifies the verification process for supplier compliance with company standards to eliminate forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and the worst forms. The disclosure requires assessing supply chain management and procurement systems to identify risks of forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor. Suppliers in the supply chain must have appropriate systems in place to address these issues. The company requires suppliers to certify compliance with laws on forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor. It also maintains accountability standards for employees or contractors failing to meet these standards. The company ensures that employees and management receive training on forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor. It also mandates that recruitment practices at all suppliers align with company standards. Suppliers must comply with company standards to eliminate exploitative labor practices, including forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor. Audits of labor recruiters are conducted, and results are disclosed. Remediation is provided to victims identified in the supply chain. The rules require annual reports in interactive data format, with information made publicly available. Disclosure must also be on the company's website. The disclosure required by paragraph (1) must be available on the person's website with a link labeled \"Policies to Address Forced Labor, Slavery, Human Trafficking, and Child Labor.\" If the person lacks a website, the disclosure must be provided within 30 days upon request. The term \"forced labor, slavery, human trafficking and the worst forms of child labor\" refers to child labor that violates international standards, including International Labor Organization Convention No. 182 and criminal provisions related to slavery and human trafficking under chapter 77 of title 18 within the jurisdiction of the United States. The term \"person\" in this context refers to any publicly-traded entity. The term 'person' in this context refers to any publicly-traded or private entity required to submit annual reports to the Commission with global receipts over $100,000,000. 'Remediation' refers to activities addressing non-compliance, and 'supply chain' pertains to a company's supply network. The term 'supply chain' for disclosure purposes includes all suppliers of products, components, and raw materials used in manufacturing or service provision, regardless of direct relationships. 'Verification' is the evaluation process for compliance with documented standards. The curr_chunk discusses the evaluation of a documented program on forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor, including monitoring activities and remediation of violations."
