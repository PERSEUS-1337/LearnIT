The \"Automobile Fuel Efficiency Improvements Act of 2003\" mandates phased increases in fuel economy standards for passenger automobiles, with minimum standards set for different model years. The \"Automobile Fuel Efficiency Improvements Act of 2003\" mandates phased increases in fuel economy standards for passenger automobiles, with minimum standards set for different model years. The standards for model years 2011 to 2014 are 32, 36, and 40 miles per gallon respectively. Amendments allow for higher standards to be set by regulation. The \"Automobile Fuel Efficiency Improvements Act of 2003\" mandates phased increases in fuel economy standards for passenger automobiles. Amendments include adjustments to the standard applicable for non-passenger automobiles. The fuel economy standards for automobiles manufactured by a manufacturer in different model years are as follows: 17 miles per gallon after 1984 and before 2006, 19 miles per gallon after 2005 and before 2009, 21.5 miles per gallon after 2008 and before 2012, 24.5 miles per gallon after 2011 and before 2015, and 27.5 miles per gallon after 2014. The Secretary must explain to Congress if fuel economy standards are not increased within 24 months after the latest increase. Increased inclusiveness of definitions of automobile and passenger automobile. The definition of automobile in the United States Code is amended to increase the weight limit from 6,000 to 12,000 pounds and the fuel economy standard from 10,000 to 14,000 pounds. The weight limit for a passenger automobile is increased to 14,000 pounds, excluding vehicles designed for the transportation of persons with a gross vehicle weight of 12,000 pounds or less. The weight limit for a passenger automobile is increased to 14,000 pounds, excluding vehicles with certain characteristics such as a primary load carrying device, seating capacity of more than 12 persons, or a cargo area of at least 6 feet in interior length. The amendments made by this section apply to automobiles manufactured for model years after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 4. CIVIL PENALTIES. Increased penalty for violations of fuel economy standards under section 32912 of title 49, United States Code. The penalty amount is increased to $10 and will be adjusted annually on October 1. The penalty amount for violations of fuel economy standards under section 32912 of title 49, United States Code will be increased annually on October 1 based on the Consumer Price Index for all-urban consumers. The amendments made by subsection (a) regarding automobile manufacturing apply to model years after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 5. ACCURATE FUEL ECONOMY TESTING. Biennial Report on Testing Quality: The Secretary of Transportation must submit a report to Congress every odd-numbered year on the quality of testing for determining automobile fuel economy, including information on available technologies for automobiles. The biennial report to Congress must assess the accuracy of automobile fuel economy, discuss planned changes in testing methodology, and evaluate the expected impact of these changes on fuel economy measures. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will consult on the preparation of the biennial report to Congress. A clerical amendment will be made to the table of sections at the beginning of the chapter. The first biennial report on testing quality under section 32920 of title 49, United States Code, will be submitted to Congress in 2005. The Secretary of Transportation will conduct a study at the John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center to improve the process for measuring fuel economy. The curr_chunk provides accurate measures of automobile fuel economy in highway, urban, and combined use for comparison with ratings under the testing process in chapter 329 of title 49. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress two years after the enactment of this Act, detailing determinations and comparisons made regarding automobile fuel economy measures. An estimate of the adjustment needed to align automobile fuel economy ratings with the most accurate testing process determined under subparagraph (A)(i) of chapter 329 of title 49, United States Code. The Secretary of Transportation must develop a revised testing procedure for accurately measuring automobile fuel economy within 180 days of submitting a required report to Congress. The Secretary of Transportation must develop a revised testing procedure to determine the average fuel economy of automobiles manufactured after model year 2006, based on accurate measures of actual fuel economy. This procedure will result in comparable adjustments in average fuel economy standards. The Secretary of Transportation will amend fuel economy standards for automobiles manufactured after 2006 to reflect improved accuracy in calculations due to a revised testing procedure. The Secretary will ensure that amended fuel economy standards are as stringent as the original standards under section 32902 of title 49, United States Code, despite the revised testing procedure. SEC. 6. STANDARDS FOR EXECUTIVE AGENCY AUTOMOBILES. Section 32917 of title 49, United States Code is amended to set fleet average fuel economy standards for non-passenger automobiles. The fleet average fuel economy standards for non-passenger automobiles are set under subsection (a) of section 32902 of title 49, United States Code for the model year that includes January 1 of that fiscal year. In the case of passenger automobiles, the fleet average fuel economy for that year must meet the average fuel economy standard under subsection (b) or (c) of the same section for the model year. In paragraph (2) of subsection (b), the fleet average fuel economy of non-passenger or passenger automobiles in a fiscal year is defined. The text discusses fleet average fuel economy standards for non-passenger and passenger automobiles, with specific details on defining the fleet average fuel economy in a fiscal year. It also mentions the minimum number of exceptionally fuel-efficient vehicles required. The President must regulate that 20% of passenger automobiles leased or bought by executive agencies have a fuel economy rating at least 5 miles per gallon higher than the average standard. Additionally, starting in fiscal year 2009, at least 10,000 exceptionally fuel-efficient vehicles must be included. Starting in fiscal year 2009, executive agencies must include at least 10,000 vehicles in their fleet with a fuel economy at least 5 miles per gallon higher than the average standard."
