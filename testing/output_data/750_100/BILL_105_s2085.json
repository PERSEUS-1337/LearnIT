    "content": "The Act titled \"Fairness for Small Business and Employees Act of 1998\" is also known as the \"Truth in Employment\" Act. It includes findings related to employment practices. Congress finds that trust and civility in labor-management relationships are crucial for a productive workplace and economy. The practice of \"salting\" with union organizers infiltrating workplaces has become a form of harassment that threatens the balance of collective bargaining rights. Union organizers are increasingly seeking employment. Union organizers are now seeking employment with nonunion employers to organize employees or cause economic harm to competitors. Employers should expect job applicants to prioritize furthering the business goals. SEC. 102. PURPOSES.\n\nThe purposes of this title are to preserve the balance of rights between employers, employees, and labor organizations, protect workers' rights to organize, and prevent pressure on employers to hire individuals aiming to disrupt the workplace or cause economic harm.\n\nSEC. 103. PROTECTION OF EMPLOYER RIGHTS. The National Labor Relations Act is amended to clarify that employers are not required to hire individuals who are not genuine job applicants seeking to further their own employment or agency status. This does not affect the rights of bona fide employee applicants under the Act. The National Labor Relations Act allows employees to form, join, or assist labor organizations, bargain collectively, and engage in concerted activities for mutual aid or protection. TITLE II--FAIR HEARING\n\nSEC. 201. FINDINGS. SEC. 201. FINDINGS: Congress finds that bargaining unit determinations require case-by-case analysis, the NLRB has held hearings for decades on this matter, and a blanket rule limiting factors detracts from promoting stability in labor relations. SEC. 202. PURPOSE.\n\nThe purpose of this title is to ensure that the National Labor Relations Board conducts a hearing process and specific analysis to determine the appropriateness of a single location bargaining unit based on relevant facts and circumstances.\n\nSEC. 203. REPRESENTATIVES AND ELECTIONS. Section 9(c) of the National Labor Relations Act is amended to include provisions for determining the appropriateness of a bargaining unit that includes employees from multiple facilities of a single employer. The Board will conduct a hearing to assess factors like functional integration and centralized control in making this determination. The Board will consider various factors when determining the appropriateness of a bargaining unit that includes employees from multiple facilities of a single employer, such as functional integration, centralized control, common skills, and bargaining history. TITLE III--ATTORNEYS FEES\n\nSEC. 301. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. Congress finds that small businesses and labor organizations lack expertise and resources when facing actions by the National Labor Relations Board. The Equal Access to Justice Act has not effectively leveled the playing field for these entities in their dealings with the Board. The purpose of this title is to ensure that small businesses and labor organizations are not deterred from seeking review or defending against actions by the National Labor Relations Board due to the expense involved. It aims to reduce the disparity in resources and expertise between these entities and the Board. The purpose of this section is to reduce the resource and expertise gap between small businesses, labor organizations, and the National Labor Relations Board. It aims to hold the Board accountable by awarding fees and costs to these entities when they prevail in enforcement actions. The National Labor Relations Act is amended to include a new section allowing for awards of attorneys' fees and costs. This aims to reduce the resource and expertise gap between small businesses, labor organizations, and the National Labor Relations Board. The National Labor Relations Act is amended to allow for awards of attorneys' fees and costs to small businesses and labor organizations who prevail in adversary adjudications conducted by the Board. This aims to bridge the resource and expertise gap between these entities and the National Labor Relations Board. The National Labor Relations Act is amended to allow for awards of attorneys' fees and costs to small businesses and labor organizations who prevail in adversary adjudications conducted by the Board. An employer or labor organization meeting specific criteria can be awarded fees and expenses as a prevailing party in court proceedings. The National Labor Relations Act is amended to allow for awards of attorneys' fees and costs to small businesses and labor organizations who prevail in adversary adjudications conducted by the Board, in accordance with section 2412(d) of title 28, United States Code. Any appeal of a determination of fees shall be determined without regard to whether the position of the United States was substantially justified or special circumstances make an award unjust. SEC. 303 of the National Labor Relations Act specifies that the provisions regarding agency and court proceedings apply to cases initiated after the enactment of the Act."
