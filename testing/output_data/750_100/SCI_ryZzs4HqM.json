The method aims to improve prediction accuracy, reduce uncertainties in grid operation, and lower operational costs. The proposed unified architecture for multi-horizon solar forecasting outperforms previous methods by achieving lower prediction errors. This method allows for real-time multi-horizon forecasts, which is beneficial for practical applications in the evolving smart grid facing challenges due to increased renewables, storage devices, and active loads. The modern grid, with high renewable penetration, faces challenges of uncertainty and fluctuations. Real-time observability, control, and accurate renewable generation forecasting are crucial for resiliency and sustainable operational costs. ISOs are struggling with short-term forecasting errors, leading to increased frequency regulation service requirements and costs. The increased grid penetration levels of solar pose challenges for grid reliability and operating costs. Integrating wind and solar forecasts into unit commitment could save $5 billion per year. Solar forecast accuracy is crucial for effective Unit Commitment. Solar power generation forecast is crucial for Unit Commitment due to very-short-term solar forecast errors caused by passing clouds leading to sudden changes in PV plant outputs. Improving forecast accuracy is essential for effectively integrating solar energy into the grid at all timescales and minimizing strain on the grid. The paper discusses the importance of accurate solar power generation forecasting for integrating solar energy into the grid efficiently. It reviews the shortcomings of current forecasting approaches and introduces a unified architecture with a novel algorithm to improve forecasting techniques. The proposed architecture is based on RNN and includes training algorithms for implementing the neural network. Additionally, exploratory data analysis, evaluation metrics, input data structure, and the proposed algorithm are presented in detail. Forecasting methods for renewable generation and electric load prediction can be classified into five categories: 1) Regressive methods like Autoregressive (AR), ARIMA, and exponential smoothing models, nonlinear stationary models; 2) Artificial Intelligence techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks, k-nearest neighbors, fuzzy. The paper concludes with future research directions in solar forecasting. Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models, including hybrid models like neuro-fuzzy systems and ANN with satellite cloud indices, are powerful tools for forecasting solar radiation. However, NWP models have limitations in predicting precise cloud field positions due to coarse spatial resolution. NWP models have limitations in predicting cloud field positions accurately due to coarse spatial resolution. To improve accuracy, regional NWP models are downscaled for site-specific forecasts. Another limitation is the temporal resolution, with output variables ranging from 3-6 hours for GFS and 1 hour for mesoscale models, making it challenging to predict ramp-rates and very short-term outputs. Satellite-based irradiance measurement is useful for areas without ground-based measurements. Radiometer in satellites records radiance, impacted by atmospheric conditions. Limitations include accurate radiance values under clear sky and dense cloud conditions. The limitations of solar irradiance forecasting using satellite remote sensing include the reliance on empirical or statistical algorithms that require ground-based solar data. This has led to a shift towards timeseries analysis using statistical models for short-term solar forecasting research. Short-term solar forecasting research focuses on timeseries analysis using statistical models and AI techniques. Statistical techniques include linear stationary models, nonlinear stationary models, and linear nonstationary models. These techniques have advantages over NWP and sensing methods but are limited by strict assumptions of normality. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) can model complex non-linear relationships between exogenous variables like humidity, temperature, pressure, and Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI). Deep Neural Networks (DNN) with multiple hidden layers are effective in solving complex problems due to advancements in computational capabilities. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) have not been explored for solar forecasting, unlike feedforward neural networks. RNN captures sequence dynamics with cyclic feedback connections, unlike feedforward networks that assume data independence. Recent advances in parallelism, network architectures, optimization techniques, and GPUs have enabled successful large-scale learning with RNNs for solar forecasting, overcoming traditional limitations. This paper proposes two approaches using RNNs for solar forecasting, including a single algorithm that can output forecasts for different time horizons and a unified architecture for multi-time-horizon predictions of solar irradiance values. The proposed method using RNNs can predict solar irradiance values for multiple time horizons with forward inference time in milliseconds, enabling real-time forecasts based on live data. The model introduces a temporal component with directed edges spanning adjacent time steps, offering value for industrial applications with high renewable energy penetration. The RNN architecture utilizes past information in sequential data with input sequences denoted by (x BID0 , x BID1 ,...x (T) ) and target sequences denoted by (y BID0 , y BID1 ,...y (T) ). The input of the RNN has three dimensions: Mini-batch Size, Number of columns per time-step, and Number of time-steps. The RNN architecture utilizes past information in sequential data with input sequences denoted by (x BID0 , x BID1 ,...x (T) ) and target sequences denoted by (y BID0 , y BID1 ,...y (T) ). The input of the RNN has three dimensions: Mini-batch Size, Number of columns per time-step, and Number of time-steps. The number of time-steps is the differentiating factor of RNN, which unfolds the input vector over time. In a typical multilayer feedforward neural network, the input vector is fed to the neurons at the input layer, which then gets multiplied by the activation function to produce the intermediate output of the neuron, this output then becomes the input to the neuron in the next layer. The net input to this neuron belonging to the next layer is the weight on connections (W) multiplied by previous neuron's output with the bias. The proposed RNN architecture utilizes past information in sequential data with input sequences denoted by (x BID0 , x BID1 ,...x (T) ). The next layer involves weights on connections (W) multiplied by the previous neuron's output with bias, followed by an activation function (g) to produce the neuron's output. The architecture uses Rectified Linear Units (ReLU) as the activation function and unfolds the input at time t. The RNN architecture is trained using backpropagation through time (BPTT) and Mean Squared Loss (MSE) as the loss function. Gradients are computed with back-propagation-through time and weights are updated using stochastic gradient descent to minimize the loss. RMSE is calculated for benchmarking. The RNN aims to learn the complex relationship between sequences of exogenous variables and their impact on solar irradiance. The algorithm in the study recognizes non-linear factors like atmospheric conditions impacting solar irradiance, leading to lower RMSE compared to other approaches. The unified architecture was trained and tested on data from NOAA's SURFRAD BID30 sites, with input features including various solar measurements. Global solar measurements such as direct-normal solar, downwelling diffuse solar, and net solar are crucial for understanding solar irradiance. Other important measurements include infrared radiation, UVB, and air temperature, among others. According to Dobbs BID28, global downwelling solar measurements are the most representative. Global downwelling solar measurements best represent Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) at SURFRAD sites, validated through exploratory data analysis. Clear Sky GHI and global downwelling solar at SURFRAD site follow the same trend and are positively correlated. The Bird model is used to calculate clear sky GHI, with clear sky index denoting the ratio between observed and theoretical maximum at time t. The algorithm introduced in BID28 calculates the clear sky index using Mean Squared Error (MSE) to measure the difference between target and output values. Root Mean Squared Error is then calculated for benchmarking. The Unified Recurrent Neural Network Architecture algorithm is divided into three main blocks, as shown in Figure 4. The algorithm, divided into three main blocks, imports site-specific data and clear sky global horizontal irradiance values from the Bird Model. The dataset is split into train and testing sets, and the clear sky index parameter is created. Missing values are replaced, outliers are eliminated, and a Recurrent Neural Network model is defined. The Recurrent Neural Network model is instantiated with architectural parameters such as input dimension, hidden dimension, layer dimension, and output dimension. Sequence length and batch size are also defined. The model is trained and tested on the dataset for a pre-set number of epochs. The Mean Squared Error (MSE) is de-normalized and used to calculate Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). If RMSE is unsatisfactory, hyperparameters are tuned and the model is retrained. The algorithm is trained using data from SURFRAD observation sites in various locations. Results from two proposed methods using RNN architecture are presented for different time horizons. The RNN architecture and algorithm predict for 1-hour, 2-hour, 3-hour, and 4-hour time horizons independently at seven SURFRAD sites. The proposed method outperforms other machine learning algorithms in terms of RMSE values for all forecasting horizons and sites. The proposed method involves developing one model per SURFRAD site to make predictions for 1-hour, 2-hour, 3-hour, and 4-hour time horizons simultaneously. This multitime-horizon implementation is unique as existing methods only focus on single time horizon forecasts. The overall performance is evaluated by calculating the mean RMSE values for all four forecasting horizons. The proposed method achieves better RMSE values compared to existing literature, which typically focuses on single time horizon forecasts. The proposed method achieves significantly lower RMSE in short-term forecasting time horizons (1 to 4 hours) compared to existing methods. It can predict for multi-time horizons, making it relevant for industry applications and optimizing smart grid operational efficiencies. Real-time data can be fed to the RNN for multiple time horizon predictions, addressing uncertainties in power systems. The proposed novel Unified Recurrent Neural Network for solar forecasting utilizes AI, specifically deep neural networks, to leverage the increasing availability of solar data. This approach shows promise in addressing the limitations of current methods by offering predictive success across various temporal and spatial resolutions. The proposed Unified Recurrent Neural Network Architecture utilizes AI for high-fidelity solar forecasting across different time scales, outperforming traditional Machine Learning methods with real-time data input. The proposed real-time solar forecasting engine can be further improved through hyper-parameter tuning and architectural changes. Future research avenues include extending the architecture with LSTM cells and intra-hour forecasting horizons."
