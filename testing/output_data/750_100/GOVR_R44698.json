    "content": "Poverty rates have been rising since 2000, with only three significant declines between 2000 and 2015. Policymakers are reexamining the causes of poverty and the effectiveness of policy responses. Discussions on poverty and public policy raise questions about the demographics of poverty in the United States. The report provides a snapshot of poverty in the United States in 2015, highlighting the diverse demographics of people living in poverty. Special attention is given to the role of work in the lives of those who are poor, emphasizing the importance of income from work for economic stability. The report focuses on the demographics of people in poverty, particularly those who are working-age adults and individuals aged 65 and older. It also considers living arrangements and factors that impact family well-being. Factors influencing individuals' attachment to the labor market are important but not covered in this report. This report examines the composition of people in poverty, focusing on different population groups' shares of the poverty population rather than poverty rates among these groups. It highlights how the size of a population group can affect its representation in the poverty population, providing valuable perspectives for public policy. Both perspectives on poverty are valid and relevant to public policy. Readers interested in poverty rates for different demographic groups and trends over time should refer to CRS Report R44644, Poverty in the United States in 2015: In Brief. Poverty is a lack of resources to meet basic needs, identified using the official measure by the U.S. Census Bureau. The Census poverty measure is family-based, where a person's poverty status depends on their income and that of other family members. The poverty status of an individual is determined by their income compared to a dollar threshold based on family composition. For example, in 2015, the poverty threshold for a single person was $12,331, and for a family of two adults and two children, it was $24,036. The official poverty measure, in place for 50 years, sets a threshold of $24,036 for a family of two adults and two children. It only considers pre-tax income and does not account for taxes, non-cash benefits, or assets. However, recent changes now include distributions from retirement savings as income. The official poverty measure does not consider living cost differences or modern family arrangements. The Census Bureau has a supplemental poverty measure that adjusts for taxes, housing costs, and uses an expanded family definition. In 2015, an estimated 43.1 million people had income below the poverty threshold. In 2015, an estimated 19.4 million people, close to half of all those in poverty, were living in deep poverty, defined as having income below 50% of the poverty threshold. In 2015, close to half of all people in poverty (45.1%) were living in deep poverty, with individuals of all ages and various racial and ethnic groups represented. Children comprised one-third (14.5 million) of those in poverty, over-represented compared to the overall population. Working-age adults and the aged also made up the population living in poverty. In 2015, the poverty population consisted of various age groups and racial/ethnic backgrounds. Working-age adults were the largest group in poverty, but they were under-represented compared to the overall population. Non-Hispanic whites were the largest racial/ethnic group in both the poverty population and the total population. Non-Hispanic whites were the largest racial/ethnic group overall (61.4% of the total population) and represented the largest group within the poverty population (41.2%). Hispanics were the second largest group (17.8% of the total population) and represented 28.1% of those in poverty. Non-Hispanic African-Americans were the third largest group in both populations, with 12.3% in the total population and 22.0% in poverty. Minority groups were over-represented in poverty, including Hispanics, non-Hispanic African-Americans, and non-Hispanic American Indians. The racial and ethnic composition of people in poverty by age group is influenced by overall demographic trends. Children are more diverse than adults, with minorities over-represented in poverty for all age groups in 2015. Hispanic children make up the largest share of poor children. In 2015, non-Hispanic white children accounted for 51.4% of the overall child population, while women represented 55.9% of the population in poverty. This disparity may be due to women heading more single-parent households and earning less than men on average. Policies regarding poverty differ for children, working-age adults, and aged adults. Children are dependent on their parents for economic support, working-age adults are expected to work and support themselves and their children, and aged adults may retire and receive income from benefits based on past work. The report explores poverty among children, working-age adults, and aged adults, highlighting the central role of work as the primary means of economic support. Living arrangements and the ability to share resources are also considered in economic well-being. Children in America are disproportionately poor, with a poverty rate of 19.7% in 2015. They rely on their parents or adult caretakers for support, often from their earnings. The number of adult workers in the family can exceed two, as shown in Figure 7. Among children in the total population, over 90% lived in families with at least one adult earner, and 50.3% lived in families with two or more adult earners. Two-thirds of poor children lived in families with earners, with 57.5% in families with one earner and 10.5% in families with two or more earners. 32.1% of poor children lived in families with no income from earnings. The distribution of children in poverty by family type in 2015 showed that children in female-headed families made up the majority (54.1%) of poor children, while children in married couple families accounted for one-third (33%) of all poor children. In 2015, families accounted for one-third (33%) of all poor children, with married couple families being under-represented among children in poverty. Children in poverty are more likely to live in larger families, which require higher income to meet their needs. In 2015, 27% of poor children were in families with four or more children, higher than the 14.2% in the overall population. Larger families are more likely to be poor due to earnings not being determined by family size. In 2015, the majority of people in poverty in America were working-age adults (18-64 years old), representing 56.6% of all individuals in poverty. This age group had a poverty rate of 12.4%, lower than the overall population. Among working-age adults who were poor, the majority (61.3%) did not have earnings from work. In 2015, 61.3% of working-age adults in poverty did not have earnings from work. Among the poor, 38.8% were working in some capacity, with only 10.4% working full-time all year. Reasons for not working included illness, caregiving, schooling, retirement, and job availability issues. In 2015, 9.0% of working-age adults said they were going to school, 9.0% said they were retired, and 8.2% said they could not find a job. Educational attainment is linked to success in the workforce, with higher levels of education leading to higher earnings and more stable employment. The largest group (55.5%) of poor working-age adults had a high school diploma but no post-secondary credential. Among working-age adults, those with only a high school diploma make up the largest share of the poor population. This group accounts for 55.5% of poor working-age adults, while those without a high school diploma make up 25.1%. Even when excluding young adults, high school graduates without a post-secondary credential remain the largest group among the poor. Working-age adults, including those living alone or with cohabiting partners, who did not live in families were disproportionately poor in 2015. 41% of all working-age adults in poverty lived outside of a family, with family living arrangements more prevalent in the overall population than among the poor. In 2015, working-age adults living alone or with cohabiting partners were disproportionately poor. The poverty status of individuals living with others is based on individual income, with no pooling of resources assumed. Aged adults are the least likely to be living below the poverty line. In 2015, aged adults accounted for 14.9% of the total population but only 9.7% of the population in poverty. The poverty rate among aged adults was 8.8%. Income from work plays a key role in their economic well-being, with 77.0% of adults aged 65 and older not working. Various forms of work-related income, including Social Security, contribute to their financial stability. In 2015, Social Security income was received by families of 62.4% of aged persons in poverty, compared to 86.0% in the total population. Aged persons also receive income from pensions earned during their working careers, including private or government pensions. Fewer aged adults in poverty receive these benefits compared to the overall aged population. In 2015, retirement, disability, or survivor pensions were received by 48.5% of all aged persons' families, but only by 7.7% of families of aged persons in poverty. Earnings from current work were received by 40.7% of aged persons' families, with only 11.0% of families in poverty receiving such earnings. Most aged adults (97.2%) lived in families with income derived from work. In 2015, almost three in four aged adults lived in families with income derived from work, with a smaller share among those who were poor. Half of aged adults in poverty lived alone, a significantly higher rate than the overall aged population. Aged adults in poverty were much less likely to be living in families compared to the overall aged population. The report provides basic information about the 43 million Americans living below the poverty line in 2015, showing that they are a diverse group including children, working-age adults, and aged adults. Certain groups are over-represented among those in poverty, such as full-time workers, caretakers, and those living alone or in families. The report highlights key factors contributing to poverty, such as women, minorities, children, and individuals living alone. It emphasizes the importance of income from work in determining poverty status, with children relying on their parents' income and working-age adults on their own work. For aged adults, past work or the work of those they live with plays a significant role. However, despite earnings from work, poverty remains a challenge for many, including two-thirds of children. In 2015, a significant number of children and aged persons in poverty had some form of work-based income. The complexity of circumstances leading to poverty requires further exploration for effective federal policy interventions."
