    "content": "A biologic or biological product is a therapeutic drug or vaccine made from living organisms like human, animal, yeast, or microorganisms. It consists of proteins, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, or cells used in transplantation. A biosimilar is a similar but not identical drug to the brand-name biologic. A generic drug is chemically identical to its reference brand-name drug, with a much simpler molecular structure compared to biologics. For example, aspirin has a small molecular structure with nine carbon atoms, eight hydrogen atoms, and four oxygen atoms, while biologic drugs like Remicade have thousands of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. Inflectra, a biosimilar to Remicade, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The FDA regulates biologics and chemical drugs. CBER oversees traditional biologics, gene therapy products, and human tissue used in transplantation. CDER regulates prescription brand-name and generic drugs. The Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) regulates prescription brand-name and generic drugs, over-the-counter drugs, and most therapeutic biologics. Examples of therapeutic biologics regulated by CDER include monoclonal antibodies and cytokines. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that bind to specific substances in the body and can carry drugs or toxins. An example is infliximab, used to treat various conditions like Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis. Cytokines are proteins that control the immune system. Cytokines, growth factors, enzymes, and immunomodulators are proteins and substances that regulate the immune system, cell division, and chemical reactions in the body. Enzyme inhibitors may be used in cancer treatment to block enzymes needed for cancer cell growth. Biologics and biosimilars are specialty drugs that stimulate or suppress the immune system to help fight cancer, infection, or other diseases. They require special handling and are usually administered via injection or infusion. Specialty drugs are expensive due to the need for special handling. The cost of specialty drugs, including biologics, can be very high, with some medications exceeding $250,000 per patient annually. Spending on biologics in the United States reached $105.5 billion in 2016, a 13% increase from the previous year. Biologics subject to biosimilar competition accounted for $3.2 billion of this spending, with $2.9 billion on original biologics and $0.3 billion on biosimilars. According to a December 2016 report by the Department of Health and Human Services, spending on biologics in the Medicare Part B program has been increasing, with biologics accounting for 63% of prescription drug spending in 2014. Biologic drugs are more expensive in the US compared to Europe and Canada. In Europe, biosimilars have reduced biologics prices by up to 33%, with one drug in Portugal seeing a 61% price reduction. Congress passed the Hatch-Waxman Act in 1984 to allow FDA approval of generic chemical drugs, providing lower-cost alternatives for biologics. The Hatch-Waxman Act, passed in 1984, allows FDA approval of generic chemical drugs, offering lower-cost alternatives to brand-name products. Generic medications can decrease prices by 60% to 90% on branded oral-solid medications, saving costs by avoiding clinical trials and initial research expenses. Generic drug companies must demonstrate to the FDA that their product is identical to the original before marketing approval. The Hatch-Waxman Act, passed in 1984, allows FDA approval of generic drugs by demonstrating their sameness to the original product. Generic drugs are considered interchangeable with brand-name drugs and other generics using the same reference. The sponsor must meet manufacturing standards and reporting requirements. The biotechnology industry was developing biologics for human therapeutic use during this time. The biotechnology industry developed human therapeutic agents like insulin, growth hormone, interferon, tissue activator, and erythropoietin, which are regulated by the FDA through a biologics license application under the Public Health Service Act. Regulatory responsibility was transferred from the NIH to the FDA in 1972. After the transfer of regulatory responsibility to the FDA in 1972, all chemical prescription drugs are regulated and approved for marketing via new drug applications. The Hatch-Waxman Act allowed for the approval of generic drugs but did not include a mechanism for follow-on biologics. Companies were limited in submitting follow-on biologics applications for FDA review. The FDA historically regulated insulin as a drug under the FFDCA, despite its similarity to biologics. Insulin is a small protein that regulates carbohydrate metabolism and was obtained from animals in the 1940s. The FDA historically regulated insulin as a drug under the FFDCA, despite its similarity to biologics. Other natural source biological products like glucagon, human growth hormone, infertility hormones, menopause and osteoporosis hormones, and certain medical enzymes were also regulated as drugs. FDA lacked clear regulatory authority to approve biosimilars for therapeutic biologics even as patent protection for specialty biologic drug products was expiring. The FDA lacked clear regulatory authority to approve biosimilars, leading to advocacy for establishing a regulatory system. In contrast, Europe had fewer barriers, with the European Medicines Agency authorizing the marketing of the first biosimilar product in 2006. In Europe, the first biosimilar product, Omnitrope, a human growth hormone, was authorized in 2006. The United States FDA approved Omnitrope in June 2006 after a court ruling in favor of Sandoz, the sponsor. Sandoz alleged that the FDA had not acted on their application submitted in 2003, presenting Omnitrope as \"indistinguishable\" from Genotropin. The 505(b)(2) pathway, created by the Hatch-Waxman Act, was used to approve Omnitrope by Pfizer. Sandoz alleged that the FDA violated its obligation to act on the application within 180 days. The FDA indicated that the approval of Omnitrope did not establish a pathway for other follow-on biologic drugs. Congress established a new regulatory authority for the FDA in March 2010. In March 2010, Congress established a new regulatory authority for FDA through the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) of 2009, allowing for an abbreviated licensure pathway for biosimilar and interchangeable biological products. FDA was also authorized to collect user fees from industry for this purpose. Under the BPCI Act, a sponsor may seek approval of a \"biosimilar\" product under new section 351(k) of the PHS Act. A biological product may be demonstrated to be \"biosimilar\" if data show that the product is \"highly similar\" to the reference product with no clinically meaningful differences in safety, purity, and potency. To meet the higher standard of interchangeability, a sponsor must demonstrate that the biosimilar product can produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient. The FDA held a public meeting in 2010 to gather input on biosimilars pathway. Three draft guidance documents were released in 2012 based on public feedback. Interchangeable products can be substituted for the reference product by a pharmacist without the intervention of the prescribing health care provider. The FDA released draft guidance documents in 2012 and held a public meeting for feedback. Final guidance was released in 2015, with additional guidance on biosimilars available on the FDA website. Companies must submit an application demonstrating biosimilarity for marketing in the US under Section 351(k) of the PHSA. The FDA requires biosimilarity based on data from analytical, animal, and clinical studies for biosimilar applications. Any changes to the manufacturing process must demonstrate comparability of product quality attributes to maintain safety and effectiveness. The FDA requires biosimilarity based on data from analytical, animal, and clinical studies for biosimilar applications. Brand-name biologics and biosimilars can be effectively managed for batch-to-batch and lot-to-lot variability. FDA has approved seven biosimilars for marketing in the United States, but sales of five biosimilars have been delayed or impacted. Sales of three U.S. biosimilars are delayed due to patent infringement lawsuits by brand-name manufacturers. Pfizer has FDA approval for biosimilar Inflectra but has sued Johnson & Johnson for anticompetitive tactics. These actions could negatively impact sales of other approved biosimilars. The high costs of pharmaceuticals, especially biologics, have sparked interest in the government's role in developing new therapeutics. Six out of seven biosimilars were originally discovered by scientists at public-sector research institutions. Brand-name biologics like Remicade, Enbrel, Humira, and Avastin are among those discussed. In March 2015, FDA approved Zarxio (filgrastim-sndz), the first biosimilar product in the US, marketed by Sandoz Inc. It is biosimilar to Neupogen (filgrastim) by Amgen Inc., originally discovered at Sloan Kettering. Zarxio is approved for the same indications as Neupogen. In April 2016, FDA approved a second biosimilar, Inflectra (infliximab-dyyb), which is biosimilar to the brand-name drug Remicade (infliximab) by Janssen Biotech, Inc. Pfizer began marketing Inflectra in the US at a price 15% below Remicade in late November 2016. In September 2017, Pfizer filed a lawsuit against J&J for anticompetitive practices related to biosimilar drugs like Inflectra. J&J allegedly used exclusionary contracts with insurers to block coverage for Inflectra and other biosimilars. Pfizer claimed that J&J threatened to withhold rebates unless insurers agreed to these contracts. The rebate offered by brand-name manufacturers like J&J for their biologic drug Remicade creates a financial incentive for insurers to prefer it over biosimilars like Pfizer's Inflectra. This tactic, known as a \"rebate trap,\" involves withdrawing rebates on the brand-name drug if a biosimilar manufacturer offers a significant price discount to insurers. The \"rebate trap\" occurs when a payer's cost for a patient using a branded biologic doubles once the rebate is withdrawn. Even with a 60% lower price for biosimilars, if only 50% of patients switch, payer costs increase. Switching to biosimilars requires a near-complete patient user conversion to avoid the rebate trap. Switching to biosimilars requires a near-complete conversion of patient users from branded biologics. Pfizer's lawsuit highlights that many healthcare providers have been reluctant to purchase Inflectra, even for patients covered by insurance plans that include the product. Pfizer's lawsuit states that as of September 1, 2017, only 10% of healthcare providers using infliximab had bought Inflectra, with minimal insurance coverage. Inflectra had a small market share in the U.S. despite FDA approval in April 2016. J&J raised Remicade's price and government reimbursement, leading to concerns about anticompetitive practices in the biologic market. The president of J&J's Janssen Biotech, Scott White, stated that Pfizer has failed to demonstrate sufficient value with their biosimilar competition. FDA approved a third biosimilar, Erelzi, in August 2016, which is biosimilar to the brand-name drug Enbrel. Erelzi, a biosimilar to Enbrel, was approved by the FDA in August 2016. Enbrel, originally discovered by scientists at Massachusetts General Hospital, is a top-selling drug in the world. Erelzi is approved for all indications included on the label for Enbrel. Erelzi, a biosimilar to Enbrel, was approved by the FDA in August 2016 based on nonclinical and clinical data confirming its similarity to the reference product. Clinical studies included comparative PK studies in healthy volunteers and a confirmatory study in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. A release date for marketing has not been set due to a lawsuit filed by Amgen against Sandoz and Novartis, with a trial scheduled for April 2018. In September 2016, FDA approved Amjevita, a biosimilar to Humira (adalimumab) manufactured by Amgen. Amjevita was approved for 7 indications, while Humira is approved for 10 indications. Humira is a top-selling drug globally and in the United States. In April 2017, FDA approved Renflexis, a biosimilar to Remicade, made by Samsung Bioepsis. Remicade was originally discovered by scientists at New York University. In August 2017, FDA approved Cyltezo, a biosimilar to Humira, manufactured by Boehringer Ingelheim. Humira was originally discovered by scientists at Rockefeller University and Scripps. In 2002, Abbott Laboratories was licensed by FDA to market Humira, one of the top-selling drugs globally and in the United States. AbbVie filed a lawsuit against BI in 2017 for alleged patent infringement on Humira. FDA approved Mvasi, a biosimilar to Avastin, in September 2017. Genentech received a license from FDA to market Avastin in 2004. The proprietary name of a drug product is the trademarked name used for marketing, usually capitalized with a superscript R in a circle. The Purple Book lists biological products licensed by FDA under the PHS Act, including biosimilar and interchangeable products. Appendix D provides a list of CDER and CBER licensed biological products. The FDA released guidance on the nonproprietary naming of biological products in August 2015, finalized on January 12, 2017. The guidance provides the FDA's rationale for naming conventions for biosimilars. The FDA guidance on naming conventions for biosimilars uses the term \"proper name\" instead of \"nonproprietary name\" as per the PHSA. The nonproprietary name for each biological product will be a combination of a core name and a four-letter suffix for identification. The FDA is still considering the suffix format for interchangeable products. The FDA is considering the appropriate suffix format for interchangeable products. For originator biological products, the FDA plans to use a core name from the USAN Council. In Europe, reference drugs and biosimilars share the same INN selected by the WHO. The WHO released its voluntary Biological Qualifier (BQ) proposal for biosimilar naming in January 2016. The BQ is a code formed of four random consonants used to uniquely identify biological substances for prescription and dispensing of medicines. Biosimilar industry groups support the shared use of a nonproprietary name, while innovator companies prefer a naming scheme that distinguishes between the reference biologic product and the biosimilar. The Federal Trade Commission expressed concern that the FDA's naming proposal could lead to physicians incorrectly believing biosimilars differ significantly from reference biologics, potentially hindering market competition. Historically, all originator biologics meeting the same identification tests received the same nonproprietary name. The FDA's proposal for biosimilar naming could lead physicians to mistakenly believe that products have clinically meaningful differences, despite sharing the same nonproprietary name. This could hinder market competition, as historically all originator biologics with the same identification tests received the same nonproprietary name. Participants at an FTC workshop on biosimilars argue that differences in nonproprietary names could lead to misunderstandings about the similarity between biosimilars and reference biologics. The term \"identical\" is misused to create fear, despite the inherent variability in biologics. Physicians need to understand that variability is normal in biologics, even within the same product batches. The labeling of prescription drug products provides crucial information on safety and effectiveness. The FDA issued a final rule in 2006 on the content and format of labeling for prescription drug products, including biological products. The FDA approved labeling provides information about the product's safety and effectiveness based on a thorough analysis of the new drug application or biologics license application. The labeling in a new drug application (NDA) or biologics license application (BLA) is crucial for safe and effective use by healthcare practitioners. It includes warnings, indications, dosage, contraindications, precautions, adverse reactions, drug interactions, and use in specific populations as required by the FDA. The FDA recommends that biosimilar labeling should include a \"Biosimilarity Statement\" in the highlights section, describing the relationship to the reference product. The biosimilar product may not have the same labeling as the reference product, including the number of approved indications. Comparative data demonstrating biosimilarity is also recommended by the FDA. The FDA recommends including a \"Biosimilarity Statement\" in biosimilar labeling, but comparative data should not be included to avoid confusion. There are differing views on the amount of information in biosimilar labeling, with the generic industry wanting less and the brand-name industry wanting more. BIO, representing brand-name pharmaceutical companies, believes more information in biosimilar labeling is necessary for prescribers to access all relevant data. The BPCIA will transition biologics approved as drugs under the FFDCA to biological licenses under the PHSA in March. The BPCIA provision will transition biological products approved as drugs under the FFDCA to biological licenses under the PHSA in March 2020. This affects a small set of products including hormone insulin, glucagon, human growth hormone, infertility treatments, menopause and osteoporosis hormones, and certain medical enzymes. FDA released draft guidance on this provision in March 2016. Biological products must be submitted under section 351 of the PHS Act, with an exception until March 23, 2020. An application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act by March 23, 2020, if a biological product in the same class was approved under section 505 by March 23, 2010. However, an application cannot be submitted under section 505 if there is another biological product approved under section 351(a) of the PHS Act that could be a \"reference product.\" As of March 23, 2020, applications for biological products approved under the FD&C Act will no longer exist and will be replaced by approved BLAs under the PHS Act. FDA will not approve any pending applications for biological products subject to the transition provisions under the FD&C Act after March 23, 2020. It is suggested that such applications be withdrawn and resubmitted under the new regulations. The FDA suggests that applications for biological products approved under the FD&C Act be withdrawn and resubmitted under the PHSA by March 23, 2020. Industry representatives are concerned about delays in the review and approval of biosimilars. Any unexpired exclusivity associated with approved NDAs for biological products would cease to have effect under the FDA's interpretation. The FDA policy on exclusivity raises legal and trade issues for industry groups. Orphan drug exclusivity will continue to apply after March 23, 2020. Transitional biological products will not be eligible for the 12-year biologics exclusivity period. The FDA states that biological products approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act, some of which were approved decades ago, will not receive a 12-year exclusivity period under the BPCIA. This decision aims to prevent hindering competition from biosimilar or interchangeable products until 2032. Interchangeable products can be substituted for the reference product by a pharmacist without the prescribing health care provider's intervention. Generic drugs are considered interchangeable with brand-name drugs and other generics using the same reference drug. The Hatch-Waxman Act allowed pharmacists to substitute generics for brand-name drugs, leading to cost savings. The FDA released draft guidance on interchangeability of biosimilar drugs in January 2017, with the comment period extended to May 19, 2017. The EMA in Europe evaluates biosimilar medicines for authorization but does not make determinations on interchangeability. Individual member states decide their own policy on interchangeability of biosimilar drugs. Some countries, like Denmark, consider all originators and biosimilars interchangeable unless proven otherwise, while Ireland allows a single switch but not multiple switches. In the United States, the FDA regulates the drug product, while states regulate pharmacies. Patients should consult their doctor and pharmacist for questions about switching between biological medicines. According to the NCSL, 37 states have considered legislation for biosimilar substitution standards. 27 states and Puerto Rico have enacted legislation with varying provisions. FDA gained authority to collect user fees from manufacturers in 1992 through the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA). Performance goals were agreed upon by FDA, industry, and Congress. The FDA gained authority to collect user fees from manufacturers in 1992 through the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA). Performance goals were agreed upon by FDA, industry, and Congress, focusing on target completion times for review processes and the use of fees to support new product application reviews. User fees made up 43% of the FY2016 FDA budget, allowing for increased staff and reduced review times. The FFDCA was amended to include user fees for medical devices, animal drugs, and generic human drugs. The FDA collects user fees from manufacturers to support new product application reviews. The Biosimilar User Fee Act of 2012 allows FDA to collect fees for biosimilar review activities. Fees are based on PDUFA human drug application fee amounts and include fees for products in the development phase. The Biosimilar Product Development (BPD) program generates fee revenue for early development of biosimilar products. There are 64 BPD programs for 23 reference products. Companies can discontinue participation but must pay a reactivation fee. The biosimilar biological product application fee may be waived for small businesses in the first application. The FDA provides information on BsUFA fees collected each fiscal year and how they are spent. The five-year biosimilars user fee authority was set to expire on October 1, 2017. Negotiation sessions with industry were held for the reauthorization of the program BsUFA II from March 2016 to May 2016. The draft BsUFA II agreement for FY2018 through FY2022 was posted on the FDA website in September 2016. The biosimilar user fee program was reauthorized through the Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act of 2017 after a second BsUFA II public meeting in October 2016. FDA faced challenges in meeting BsUFA I goals due to staffing issues. The FDA anticipates using new hiring authorities from the 21st Century Cures Act to strengthen staff capacity for biosimilar review, modernize hiring systems, and establish clear goals for recruitment and retention of scientific staffing. These enhancements aim to help FDA meet performance goals, encourage price competition, and lower healthcare costs. Under BsUFA II, fees have been adjusted to encourage price competition and lower healthcare costs. The product fee is now called the BsUFA Program fee, with a limit of five fees per application per fiscal year. The FDA and industry estimate a need of approximately $45 million in FY2018 to cover program costs. The federal government, including NIH, focuses on basic and preclinical research, while the pharmaceutical industry prioritizes clinical trials over discovery. Assigning credit for therapeutic advancements is challenging, as major advances like recombinant DNA enable the development of new drugs. Concerns exist over the high costs of pharmaceuticals and biologics. Concern over high pharmaceutical costs has led to scrutiny of the federal role in developing new therapeutics. Studies show a small percentage of new drugs originate from non-industry sources, highlighting the contribution of publicly funded research. Between 1990 and 2007, 9.3% of drugs approved by the FDA resulted from research conducted in publicly funded labs. Between 1990 and 2007, 9.3% of FDA-approved drugs resulted from research in publicly funded labs. Out of 1,541 drug applications, 348 received priority review from the FDA, with 19% of these stemming from publicly funded research. Public-sector research institutions had a higher rate of priority reviews at 46.2% compared to 20% for private-sector research. Priority review is granted for drugs that offer significant improvements in treating serious conditions. The data suggests that Public Sector Research Institutions (PSRIs) tend to discover drugs with significant clinical impact. A 2011 study by Stevens considered PSRIs to have played a role in drug discovery if they created intellectual property transferred to a company through a commercial license. The study excluded the contribution of PSRIs to platform technologies. PSRIs have played a significant role in drug discovery by developing platform technologies that led to the creation of new classes of drugs. Several platform technologies, such as recombinant DNA technology and methods for producing antibodies, were excluded from a study on PSRI contributions to drug development. The development of platform technologies by PSRIs has been crucial in creating new classes of drugs. Despite not being used to develop specific drug candidates, these technologies have been essential in the discovery of many new drugs. According to Stevens et al., 2011, 36 biologic drugs were discovered at least in part by PSRIs in the past 40 years. Biological products are regulated under the Public Health laws. The regulation of biological products falls under the Public Health Service Act, while chemical drugs are regulated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act by the FDA. The Biologics Control Act of 1902 marked the beginning of federal regulation for biologics. The Biologics Control Act of 1902 was the first national regulation for pharmaceutical products, focusing on premarket approval and shifting to pre-market government review. It was passed in response to deaths from tetanus contamination in vaccines and antitoxins, requiring facilities to be inspected before federal licenses were issued. The Pure Food and Drugs Act of 1906 did not have premarket control over new drugs for safety, unlike the Biologics Control Act. It was replaced by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in 1938, which required drug manufacturers to submit a new drug application demonstrating safety before marketing. The Biologics Control Act of 1906 required premarket control over new drugs for safety, unlike the Pure Food and Drugs Act. The Public Health Service Act of 1944 specified that licensed biological products are subject to regulation under the FFDCA. The Public Health Service Act (PHSA) regulates biological products for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in humans or animals. The PHSA aligns with the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) which exempts licensed biological products from requiring an approved application under certain conditions. The PHSA was amended to require a single BLA for biological products, suspending licenses immediately in case of public health danger. The BPCIA of 2009 created a licensure pathway for biosimilar products. The BPCIA of 2009 established a licensure pathway for biosimilar products deemed \"highly similar\" or \"interchangeable\" with FDA-approved biological products, allowing the FDA to collect fees. It also created regulatory exclusivity periods for certain brand-name biologics and biosimilar products, along with procedures for resolving patent disputes. Regulatory responsibility for biologics was initially under the Hygienic Laboratory and later transferred to the NIH Division of Biological Standards in 1972. In 1982, the FDA's Bureau of Drugs and Bureau of Biologics merged to form the National Center for Drugs and Biologics. In 1988, the Center for Drugs and Biologics split into CDER and CBER. CBER moved to the new FDA headquarters in 2014. Jurisdictional status of biotechnology products has been challenging. The FDA struggled to determine the jurisdictional status of drugs, devices, and biologics due to overlapping definitions. In 1991, an agreement stated that traditional biologics and most biotechnology products would be regulated by CBER, while a small set of biologics regulated as drugs would be overseen by CDER. In 2002, the FDA announced plans to reorganize review responsibilities. In 2002, the FDA reorganized review responsibilities, transferring most therapeutic biologics from CBER to CDER. CDER now regulates products like monoclonal antibodies, immunomodulators, growth factors, and cytokines, while CBER oversees traditional biologics such as vaccines and allergenic products. Remaining at CBER are traditional biologics such as vaccines, allergenic products, antitoxins, antivenins, venoms, and blood products, including recombinant versions of plasma derivatives."
