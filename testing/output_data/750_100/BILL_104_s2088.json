Additionally, a facility cannot be considered a qualified child care facility for a taxpayer unless enrollment is open to the taxpayer's employees and it is not the taxpayer's principal trade or business. The taxpayer can receive a credit for employer-provided child care expenses if at least 30 percent of the facility's enrollees are dependents of the taxpayer's employees. The facility cannot discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees. If the requirements are not met, the acquisition and construction credit may be recaptured at the end of the taxable year. If a recapture event occurs with a qualified child care facility, the taxpayer's tax for the year will increase by the applicable recapture percentage multiplied by the decrease in credits allowed for prior years if child care expenditures were zero.

The recapture percentage for a qualified child care facility is determined from a specific table, with varying percentages based on the year of the recapture event. The recapture percentage for a qualified child care facility is determined based on the year of the recapture event: 25% in Year 8, 10% in Years 9 and 10, and 0% in Years 11 and thereafter. Year 1 begins on the first day the facility is placed in service by the taxpayer. A recapture event is defined as the cessation of operation of the facility as a qualified child care. The disposition of a taxpayer's interest in a qualified child care facility may trigger recapture liability, except if the person acquiring the facility agrees to assume the liability. The person acquiring an interest in a facility must agree in writing to assume the recapture liability of the person disposing of the interest before such disposition. The acquiring person will be treated as the taxpayer for assessing any recapture liability, with special rules applying. Special rules apply to the tax liability of credits allowed by this section if not used to reduce tax liability. Any increase in tax under this subsection is not considered a tax credit. The increase in tax under this subsection shall not be considered a tax credit for determining credits under subpart A, B, or D. No recapture applies if a qualified child care facility ceases operation due to a casualty loss that is restored within a reasonable period. Special rules apply for the allocation of tax credits among partners in partnerships, as prescribed by the Secretary. All persons treated as a single employer are considered a single taxpayer. No double benefit is allowed under this section. The Secretary prescribes regulations for tax credit allocation among partners in partnerships. No double benefit is allowed, with the basis of property reduced by the credit amount determined. The basis of property reduced by a tax credit must be increased by the recapture amount. No other deductions or credits are allowed for the credit amount determined. The employer-provided child care credit determined under section 45D is subject to termination for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1999. Conforming amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 include adding this credit as a new paragraph under section 38(b).
