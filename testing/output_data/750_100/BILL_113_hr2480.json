The Act titled \"Nurse and Health Care Worker Protection Act of 2013\" highlights the high number of musculoskeletal disorders among healthcare workers, particularly nurses and nursing assistants, due to patient lifting and transferring injuries. The physical demands of the nursing profession lead many nurses to leave due to chronic back pain and injuries, impacting their health and ability to work. Patients are also at risk during manual lifting, transferring, or repositioning, but appropriate lift programs can help reduce these risks. Assistive patient handling technology and lift programs can reduce skin tears, pressure ulcers, and patient dropping incidents, promoting safer patient care. The use of patient handling technology has made manual patient handling outdated in nursing care, leading to positive results in healthcare facilities. Implementing safe patient handling technology in healthcare facilities has led to a significant decrease in injuries among nursing staff and healthcare workers. This has resulted in a reduction in lost work days due to injury and staff turnover. Studies have also shown that assistive patient handling technology helps reduce workers' compensation costs for musculoskeletal disorders. Several States have adopted safe patient handling standards, demonstrating success at both facility and State levels. Establishing safe patient handling standards for healthcare workers is crucial for protecting their health and safety, addressing the nursing shortage, and improving patient safety. The Safe Patient Handling, Mobility, and Injury Prevention Standard is established to protect healthcare workers' health and safety, address the nursing shortage, and improve patient safety in facilities receiving Medicare and Medicaid funds. The Secretary of Labor must issue an interim final standard on safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention within 1 year of the Act's enactment to prevent musculoskeletal disorders for healthcare workers. A safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standard must be established within 2 years of the Act's enactment. It will require the use of engineering controls and mechanical technology to reduce injuries from manual patient handling by healthcare workers. The standard for safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention will require alternative controls like trained lift teams to minimize risks to healthcare workers. It applies to all healthcare employers and aligns with national safe patient handling standards. The final standard for safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention requires healthcare employers to implement a program within 6 months that includes hazard identification, risk assessments, and control measures. Additionally, within 2 years, employers must purchase and provide safe patient handling equipment and technology as determined appropriate by the Secretary. The final standard for safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention mandates healthcare employers to involve health care workers in developing and implementing the program, including purchasing necessary technology and equipment. The health care employer must establish a review program to analyze data relevant to the safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention program. They should account for instances where the program was not followed, and provide findings and data upon request to health care workers. The health care employer must consider incorporating safe patient handling technology into new facility design or remodeling. They are also required to provide education and training to health care workers on safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention policies, technology, equipment, and devices. The health care employer must provide training to health care workers on safe patient handling, including identifying and controlling musculoskeletal hazards. Training should be interactive and hands-on, conducted by knowledgeable individuals. Health care employers must post a notice explaining safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention policies, training, reporting procedures for injuries, and workers' rights under the Act. Annual evaluation required for health care employers to assess safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention program implementation, including procedures, technology, equipment, injuries assessment, and new technology development. Nurses and other health care workers must be involved in the evaluation process. Health care employers must involve nurses, other health care workers, and their representatives in the evaluation of safe patient handling programs. Corrective action should be taken based on the evaluation. Employees have the right to refuse unsafe assignments if they believe it violates safety standards. The Secretary of Labor conducts unscheduled inspections to ensure compliance with safe patient handling standards to prevent injuries to healthcare workers, other staff, and patients. If a healthcare worker has safety concerns that are not addressed by the employer, they have the right to refuse unsafe assignments. SEC. 3. APPLICATION OF SAFE PATIENT HANDLING, MOBILITY, AND INJURY PREVENTION STANDARD TO FACILITIES RECEIVING MEDICARE AND MEDICAID FUNDS. The amendment to the Social Security Act includes the application of safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standards to facilities receiving Medicare and Medicaid funds. The amendments to the Social Security Act require health care facilities receiving Medicare and Medicaid funds to comply with safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standards. The effective date for these amendments is 1 year after the final standard is issued. The amendments to the Social Security Act require health care facilities to comply with safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standards. Nonpreemption is specified in Section 4. The Act does not preempt state laws unless they conflict with it, and it does not diminish states' authority to enact laws providing equal or greater protections for employees. Health care workers' rights are not reduced by the Act. The Act does not diminish the rights, privileges, or remedies of health care workers or employees under any Federal or State law, or under any collective bargaining agreement. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms such as \"direct-care registered nurse,\" \"employee,\" and \"employment.\" The term \"employment\" includes providing services under a contract. \"Handling\" includes actions like lifting, transferring, or moving patients. \"Health care employer\" refers to facilities like hospitals and nursing homes. A health care worker is an individual assigned by a health care employer to engage in patient handling. This includes direct-care registered nurses, independent contractors, or individuals who perform the duties of health care workers. A lift team consists of healthcare workers trained in safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention practices and technology."
