    "title": "SB 1073",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 17052 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to allow an earned income tax credit against the \"net tax\" for taxable years starting January 1, 2015. The credit amount is determined based on Section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted by a factor for the taxable year. The earned income tax credit adjustment factor for taxable years starting January 1, 2015, is 0 percent unless specified in the annual Budget Act. The credit is only available when resources are allocated in the Budget Act for oversight and audits by the Franchise Tax Board. The credit percentage and phaseout percentage are determined based on the number of qualifying children. The earned income tax credit percentages vary based on the number of qualifying children: 7.65% for no qualifying children, 34% for 1 qualifying child, 40% for 2 qualifying children, and 45% for 3 or more qualifying children. The earned income amount and phaseout amount for eligible individuals are also specified. Section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code is modified for joint returns and state-specific provisions. Withholding requirements under the Unemployment Insurance Code are specified for eligibility. Section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code is modified for joint returns and state-specific provisions, including changes to withholding requirements under the Unemployment Insurance Code. Specific modifications include adjustments to income thresholds and inflation recalculations for taxable years starting in 2016. The excess credit under this section can be used to offset other amounts due and any remaining balance will be refunded to the taxpayer. The Franchise Tax Board has the authority to establish rules and procedures for implementing this section. Amounts refunded under this section will be treated like federal earned income refunds for determining eligibility for benefits under the Welfare and Institutions Code. The Franchise Tax Board is exempt from certain reporting requirements for implementing the credit for the 2015 taxable year. The California Earned Income Tax Credit aims to reduce poverty among the state's poorest working families and individuals. The Franchise Tax Board will incorporate the scope, costs, and schedule changes related to the credit in its next Special Project Report. Annual reports will be prepared to measure the credit's effectiveness in achieving its intended purpose. The Franchise Tax Board will report on the number of tax returns claiming the California Earned Income Tax Credit, individuals represented, average credit amount, and distribution of credits by dependents and income ranges. (E) Data from tax returns claiming the credit will include estimates of the federal tax credit under Section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code. It will also estimate the number of families lifted out of deep poverty by the credit alone and in combination with the federal tax credit. Families are considered in \"deep poverty\" if their income is less than 50% of the federal poverty threshold. The Franchise Tax Board will provide a written report to various Senate and Assembly committees regarding the California Earned Income Tax Credit. The amendments to this section will apply to taxable years starting from January 1, 2016."
