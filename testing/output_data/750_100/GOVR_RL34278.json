    "content": "During the first session of the 110th Congress, the Administration requested $196.5 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for FY 2008, with $189.3 billion for military operations and $6.9 billion for international affairs. Congress had approved $86.8 billion for defense and $1.5 billion for international affairs by December 2007. $102.5 billion for defense and $5.4 billion for international affairs are still pending approval. Congress is expected to address these requests in a spring 2008 supplemental appropriations bill. In spring 2008, Congress considered requests for emergency supplemental appropriations for military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere, including funding for MRAP vehicles. The Administration had initially requested funding in February 2007, with additional requests in July and October 2007. A key issue was the impact of delays in funding on the Army and Marine Corps. The regular FY2008 defense appropriations act, P.L. 110-116, provided funding for overseas military operations for the Army and Marine Corps. The high pace of operations in Iraq quickly drained the base budget for Army and Marine Corps operation and maintenance. Without supplemental funding, the Army would run out of money by February and the Marine Corps by early April. The Defense Department faced challenges in extending Army and Marine Corps operations due to funding constraints. Options included transferring funds from other accounts, invoking the \"Feed and Forage Act,\" or using other measures. A $70 billion \"bridge fund\" approved by Congress temporarily resolved the issue, providing about 37% of the requested amount for military operations. The Defense Department could extend Army and Marine Corps operations by transferring funds from other accounts or using available authority. Funding provided in the FY2008 appropriations act will last until mid-June for personnel and end of June or early July for operation and maintenance. Up to $11.4 billion could be transferred to the Army for further operations. The Administration has available authority to transfer funds to the Army, with up to $11.4 billion in transfer authority. Requests for FY2008 emergency supplemental appropriations were submitted in three blocks, totaling $141.7 billion for the Defense Department, $3.3 billion for the State Department, and $325 million for other agencies. The Administration complied with Section 1008 of the FY2007 national defense authorization act by including a request for estimated full year costs of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in the President's FY2008 budget. The Defense Department estimated the full-year costs of continuing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan at the same pace as in 2006, acknowledging it was a rough projection. The budget did not reflect the proposed surge in troops to Iraq. The Administration proposed a surge in troops to Iraq not reflected in the budget. On July 31, 2007, an additional $5.3 billion was requested for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles. On October 22, an amendment requested $45.9 billion for military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. The Administration requested $195.6 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for FY2008, mainly for military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other countries, as well as for foreign affairs programs. The focus of congressional debate in early 2007 was on supplemental appropriations for FY2007, with a revised request submitted in March and a veto by the President in May. In May 2007, Congress approved a compromise FY2007 supplemental appropriations bill, H.R. 2206, which the President signed into law as P.L. 110-28. The bill allocated $99.5 billion for the Department of Defense, $6.1 billion for international affairs, and $14.5 billion for domestic programs. Congress approved a $99.5 billion FY2007 supplemental appropriations bill in May 2007, which included defense funding in addition to a $70 billion \"bridge fund.\" Congressional action on FY2008 emergency supplemental funding began in September and was completed shortly before Christmas, with funds provided for MRAP vehicles. In September 2007, the President signed a provision for FY2008 defense appropriations. The bill allocated $460 billion for Defense Department activities, including funds for Army and Marine Corps operations. An additional $11.6 billion was provided for MRAP vehicles. The bill allocated $460 billion for Defense Department activities, including funds for Army and Marine Corps operations. An additional $11.6 billion was provided for MRAP vehicles. The bill did not include funding for ongoing military operations, except for the MRAP money. On November 14, 2007, the House approved a bill to provide $50 billion for U.S. military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere, with enough money to sustain operations through April 2008. The bill also required the President to begin withdrawing U.S. forces from Iraq. The Senate refused to close debate on a motion to proceed to consideration of H.R. 4156 as passed by the House, effectively killing the measure in April 2008. The legislation required the President to withdraw U.S. forces from Iraq within 30 days and provide a plan to withdraw most troops by December 15, 2008. Remaining forces were limited to force protection, training, and pursuit of international terrorists, with prohibitions on deploying units that are not fully trained and equipped. Additionally, the bill extended prohibitions on torture to all U.S. government agencies. The Senate rejected a motion to consider H.R. 4156, killing the measure. They also rejected a substitute bill by Senator McConnell for $70 billion for the Defense Department without requiring withdrawal from Iraq. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates warned of limiting operations without additional funding. Without additional funding, the Army would have to cease operations at all bases by mid-February 2008, leading to furloughs of about 100,000 government employees and contractors. The Defense Department transferred $4.5 billion to extend Army operations until February 23. The House approved amendments to the foreign operations appropriations bill, H.R. 2764, providing $485 billion in regular and emergency funding for FY2008. The House approved $485 billion in regular and emergency appropriations for FY2008, excluding defense. A $31 billion emergency defense appropriations amendment was approved for Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) in Afghanistan and other areas. Army and Marine Corps operation and maintenance funding was restricted to OEF, with some allocation for force protection. The Senate later adopted the House-passed bill with an amendment by Senator McConnell. The Senate adopted an amendment by Senator McConnell to delete the House-passed $31 billion for OEF and provide $70 billion for the Department of Defense for overseas operations without limits on where the money could be used. The House approved the Senate amendment to the bill, clearing it for the President who signed it into law on December 26, 2007. Congress passed an appropriations bill, P.L. 110-161, on December 26, 2007, providing $70 billion for overseas military operations. This resolved a funding dispute that had threatened to shut down Army and Marine Corps operations in early 2008. Secretary of Defense Gates warned that without supplemental appropriations, Army operations would run out of money by the end of February and Marine Corps operations in March. The $70 billion in funding from the appropriations act prevented a shutdown of Army and Marine Corps operations until at least June 2008. This funding included $35.2 billion for the Army and $4.0 billion for the Marine Corps, in addition to previous appropriations. It allowed for the continuation of Army operations until the end of June 2008 and Marine Corps operations until the end of August. The Army and Marine Corps operations were funded until June 2008 and August 2008 respectively. The Army will exhaust its military personnel funds by mid-June, potentially requiring transfers from other accounts to extend operations. The Defense Department has $11.4 billion available for fund transfers. The Defense Department has $11.4 billion available for fund transfers to extend Army operations for up to another month without slowing down operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Defense Department has $11.4 billion available for fund transfers to extend Army operations for up to another month without slowing down operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Congress's agreement to provide a $70 billion FY2008 bridge fund temporarily resolved the debate over funding flexibility, but the underlying controversy remains. Congress has been concerned about the Defense Department's ability to delay or avoid shutting down operations without full-year defense appropriations. The Defense Department has $11.4 billion available for fund transfers to extend Army operations for up to another month without slowing down operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. In FY2008, CRS calculated that funds would be exhausted by February for the Army and by early April for the Marine Corps. DOD's proposed transfer of $4.1 billion to the Army would have extended its operations for another two to three weeks. Without supplemental appropriations, the Defense Department could have extended operations for about another month by transferring limited additional amounts to the Army and Marine Corps. The Defense Department could have extended operations for about another month by transferring limited additional amounts to the Army and Marine Corps and slowing down spending. Alternative measures like invoking the Feed and Forage Act or assigning the Navy and Air Force to pay for Army support operations abroad could have also been considered, but each has limitations and disadvantages. These options would reduce financial flexibility and disrupt day-to-day operations. The FY2008 state department, foreign operations appropriations bill, part of the consolidated appropriations act, raised concerns about using Navy and Air Force funds for Army operations, potentially weakening congressional controls. The bill's impact on military operations and personnel furloughs must be carefully weighed. The consolidated appropriations act, H.R. 2764, P.L. 110-161, provides regular FY2008 appropriations for international affairs and emergency supplemental funds totaling $1,473.8 million. $965 million is allocated for the State Department and $508.8 million for foreign operations. $5.4 billion of the Administration's emergency request is still pending consideration. Supplemental funds for State Department accounts include $781.6 million for Diplomatic and Consular Programs. The consolidated appropriations act, H.R. 2764, P.L. 110-161, provides regular FY2008 appropriations for international affairs and emergency supplemental funds totaling $1,473.8 million. $781.6 million is allocated for Diplomatic and Consular Programs, including operations and worldwide security protection. Additionally, there are funds for Contributions to International Peacekeeping in Darfur, International Broadcasting, Global Health & Child Survival, International Disaster Assistance, USAID Operating Expenses for Iraq, and Economic Support Fund. The FY2008 appropriations act provides $1,473.8 million for international affairs and emergency supplemental funds. This includes funding for Diplomatic and Consular Programs, Contributions to International Peacekeeping, Global Health & Child Survival, and various other programs such as USAID Operating Expenses for Iraq, Economic Support Fund, Migration and Refugee Assistance, Foreign Military Financing, and Peacekeeping Operations. See the summary table in the Appendix for a comparison of funding in the House bill to the request. Table 2 summarizes FY2008 defense supplemental appropriations proposals, including the Administration request, House-passed bills, and the final $70 billion emergency funding legislation. The original House bill required a plan to withdraw U.S. military forces from Iraq by December 2008. The $70 billion emergency funding legislation included reporting requirements but no change in Iraq policy. The original House bill mandated troop withdrawal from Iraq by December 2008, with a target completion date of December 15, 2008. The $70 billion emergency funding legislation included reporting requirements but no change in Iraq policy. H.R. 4156 stated the sense of Congress that the war in Iraq should end quickly and safely, troops brought home, extended prohibitions on torture to all government agencies, and prohibited deployment of units abroad without presidential certification. The bill required the President to certify 15 days in advance before deploying any unit abroad, set a goal of completing the transition of U.S. forces from Iraq by December 15, 2008, and restricted post-transition missions to protecting U.S. facilities and providing limited training assistance to Iraqi security. The bill required quarterly reports on plans for transitioning the U.S. mission in Iraq, with funding consideration delayed until the first report is submitted. A comprehensive regional stability plan for the Middle East was also required by February 15, 2008, along with additional quarterly reports throughout the fiscal year. The bill required quarterly reports on transitioning the U.S. mission in Iraq, with a regional stability plan for the Middle East. Senators proposed an amendment to shift the U.S. mission in Iraq to training Iraqi security forces by the end of 2008. The Senate failed to approve a measure to transition the U.S. mission in Iraq to counterterrorism operations and training Iraqi forces by the end of 2008. The vote reflected no change in Senate support or opposition to the war in Iraq. The Senate failed to approve an amendment to withdraw troops from Iraq within 90 days and cut off funding after nine months. The $70 billion \"bridge fund\" for FY2008 did not include language for troop withdrawal. The FY2008 funding bill did not include language for troop withdrawal from Iraq. Instead, it required the Secretary of Defense to provide regular reports on progress in Iraq. The Administration requested $196.5 billion in additional funds. The Administration requested $196.5 billion in additional funds for military operations, international affairs, and other activities in FY2008, including $141.7 billion for military operations abroad. The White House requested $5.3 billion for MRAP vehicle procurement and deployment, along with an additional $45.9 billion for military operations abroad and international affairs programs in FY2008. The total requested amount for military operations was $189.3 billion, with $6.9 billion for international affairs programs and $325 million for other agencies. The Administration requested funds for military operations abroad and international affairs programs in FY2008, designating them as \"emergency\" spending to bypass spending caps. The terms \"emergency\" or \"emergency appropriations\" may not technically apply. The Senate may not apply the terms \"emergency\" or \"emergency appropriations\" to all the money provided by Congress, especially for ongoing war-related expenses. S.Con.Res. 21 exempts emergency amounts from spending caps but includes a restrictive definition that could raise a point of order in the Senate. The budget resolution allows for adjustments of up to $124.2 billion for overseas deployments and related activities, rather than designating funds as \"emergency\" appropriations. The Senate may use a designation other than \"emergency\" appropriations to allow some requested spending without exceeding budget limits. Supplemental appropriations bills often exceed White House requests and can include significant legislative initiatives. For example, the FY2007 supplemental bill, H.R. 2206, P.L. 110-28, included funds for disaster relief, farm programs, energy assistance, SCHIP, and a minimum wage increase. The appropriations committee did not wait for the war supplemental bill and instead provided funding for non-defense programs in the second FY2008 continuing resolution. This CR funds government activities from November 17 through December 14, 2007, and was attached to the FY2008 defense appropriations bill. The appropriations bill, H.R. 3222, P.L. 110-116, signed into law on November 13, included additional funds for veterans health programs, community development funds for Louisiana, FEMA Disaster Relief Fund, and wildfire management. Congress also provided $16.8 billion for MRAPs in previous resolutions. The FY2008 defense appropriations bill, H.R. 3222, P.L. 110-116, signed into law on November 13, included $5.2 billion for production and deployment of Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles for the Army and Marine Corps, almost meeting the requested amount. Additionally, the omnibus appropriations bill signed on December 26 allocated $70 billion, with $39 billion for Army and Marine Corps operation and maintenance, $11 billion for other components, and funds for training Afghan and Iraqi security forces. In FY2008, the defense appropriations bill allocated $1.35 billion for Afghan security forces, $1.5 billion for Iraqi forces, $3.7 billion for the Iraqi Freedom Fund, $4.3 billion for joint IED defense, and $6.1 billion for weapons procurement. The bill also allows up to $4 billion to be transferred between accounts for future operations. The total requested amount for military operations was $189.3 billion. The Defense Department has seen a trend of increasing supplemental appropriations in addition to growing base budgets. These funds have risen from $62.6 billion in FY2003 to $171.3 billion in FY2007, with further increases. The rise in funding is not solely due to military operations' pace. The Defense Department has seen a trend of increasing supplemental appropriations in addition to growing base budgets, rising from $62.6 billion in FY2003 to $171.3 billion in FY2007. Troop levels in Iraq and Afghanistan have remained stable, with increases in funding for weapons procurement, equipment repair, and training. The Defense Department has seen a trend of increasing supplemental appropriations for equipment repair, training, and reorganizing forces. Funding has also increased for Afghan and Iraqi military forces, as well as for increasing troop levels by 92,000 by 2011. The largest increases have been for \"reconstitution\" according to DOD's functional breakdown. The Defense Department has seen a trend of increasing supplemental appropriations for equipment repair, training, and reorganizing forces. Secretary Rumsfeld preferred to use the term \"reset\" instead of \"reconstitution\" to describe the process of restoring the force to its pre-war condition. The Defense Department has resumed using the term \"reconstitution\" to describe the process of restoring the force, which now encompasses more than just returning it to its pre-war condition. The Defense Department's reconstitution process includes substantial upgrades for the Army and Marine Corps, addressing equipment shortfalls, enhancing transportation and communications, and equipping units with the latest gear for improved training. Guard and reserve units are also receiving better equipment to align with active duty forces. The Defense Department is upgrading older equipment for overseas operations, leading to increased spending. Congress generally supports upgrading ground forces and questions only a small portion of equipment funding requests. For example, there were questions about Air Force's request for F-35 Joint Strike Fighters and Navy's request for V-22 tilt rotor in the FY2007 war supplemental. The Administration withdrew requests for F-15 and F-16 aircraft and a Navy request for a V-22 tilt rotor aircraft in a budget amendment to realign funding for the troop surge. The amended defense request includes funding for MRAPs, additional Army brigade combat teams, and Marine regimental combat team in Iraq through December 2007. The budget assumes withdrawal of additional units in Iraq and Afghanistan, with increases in funding for Iraqi security forces, factories in Iraq, and construction projects in both countries. The October budget amendment includes $8.8 billion for repairing and replenishing equipment in Iraq and Afghanistan, with $1 billion allocated for Navy P-3 aircraft radar detection equipment. Additionally, $5.4 billion is designated to restock equipment inventories of combat support units. The budget amendment includes $2.5 billion for various initiatives, such as fuel price increases, accelerating construction of facilities to replace Walter Reed Army hospital, and improving other Army medical facilities. The Administration's FY2008 budget included $35.1 billion for international affairs, with an additional emergency supplemental request of $3.301 billion. This request was later amended to include $3.596 billion, bringing the total emergency supplemental request for international affairs to $6.897 billion. The request for international affairs spending is $6.897 billion, with the largest portion allocated for State Department operations and foreign assistance in Iraq and Afghanistan. Additional funding is also requested for programs in Mexico, the West Bank and Gaza, North Korea, Sudan, and Pakistan. The State Department estimates emergency supplemental funding needs of $3.220 billion for various programs in Iraq, Afghanistan, and international organizations. The State Department requested $6.897 billion for international affairs spending, with $2.1 billion for Iraq Operations. Foreign Operations included $3.678 billion, with $350 million for P.L. 480 food assistance. Nearly half of the foreign operations package was for Iraq and Afghanistan. The Bush Administration has been criticized for relying too heavily on emergency supplemental funds for international affairs budgets. The Administration argues that emergency supplemental requests are necessary for unforeseen expenses, with the original FY2008 State Department portion totaling $1.882 billion for operations in Iraq. An additional $1.3 billion was later added, including funds for Diplomatic and Consular Programs and Embassy Security. The State Department requested $3.220 billion in emergency funds for FY2008, including $2.283 billion for Diplomatic and Consular Programs, with $2.120.6 billion for emergency needs in Iraq. The Mission in Iraq includes 1,000 direct-hire Americans from 12 U.S. government agencies. The State Department requested $3.220 billion in emergency funds for FY2008, with $2.523 billion allocated for Iraq operations. $978.7 million would cover security needs, including local guards, compound guards, regional security, personal security details, armored vehicles, physical and technical security equipment, support for special agents, and counterterrorism training. The State Department requested $3.220 billion in emergency funds for FY2008, with $2.523 billion allocated for Iraq operations. This includes funding for security needs such as local guards, compound guards, regional security, personal security details, armored vehicles, physical and technical security equipment, support for special agents, counterterrorism training, overhead cover protection for rooftops, Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs), worldwide security upgrades in Afghanistan, and high threat protection teams. The FY2008 emergency supplemental request for the Department of State includes funding for high threat protection teams, security costs for agencies, armored vehicles for the embassy and PRTs, U.S. staff housing in Afghanistan, U.S. assessments for U.N. activities related to combat terrorism, and U.S. Contributions for International Peacekeeping activities in Darfur. Congress provided $1.262 billion in supplemental funding for the Department of State and the Broadcasting Board of Governors in the Consolidated Appropriation Act. The funding includes $781.6 million for State's Diplomatic and Consular Programs and $468.0 million for U.S. Contributions to International Peacekeeping, with specific allocations for Iraq operations and worldwide security protection. The amounts allocated are less than what the Administration had requested. The Consolidated Appropriation Act provided $206.6 million for worldwide security protection (WSP), with $162.4 million still pending for WSP in Afghanistan. The act also allocated $390 million for Darfur and $78 million for FY2008 U.N. Peacekeeping funds, with $333.6 million still pending for Darfur. Additionally, the act states that \"not less than $550.4 million be used to establish a new United Nations/African Union hybrid peacekeeping mission to Darfur (UNAMID).\" The Department sources indicate that $333.6 million is pending for Darfur. Emergency supplemental funds for the BBG total $12.0 million. The Administration did not request funds for international broadcasting in the emergency supplemental request. The Foreign Operations portion of the supplemental request, totaling $3.678 billion, was sent to Congress in two tranches. A $1.367 billion request was sent with the President's budget on February 6, 2007, and an amended request for $2.311 billion, including P.L. 480 food aid, was sent on October 22nd. $2.311 billion, including P.L. 480 food aid, was sent to Congress on October 22nd. One-third of the request was for Economic Support Funds (ESF) for Iraq, Afghanistan, West Bank and Gaza, North Korea, Sudan, and Pakistan. Anti-narcotics emergency supplemental funding for FY2008 totaled $734 million, with the largest portion for Mexico and Central America. Migration and Refugee Assistance (MRA) totaled $230 million, mainly for Iraqi and Palestinian refugees. International Disaster and Famine Assistance (IDFA) totaled $80 million. The request for International Disaster and Famine Assistance (IDFA) is $80 million to aid internally displaced persons in Iraq. Additionally, $5 million is allocated for the Afghanistan Presidential Protection Service from the Nonproliferation, Anti-terrorism, Demining and Related Programs (NADR) account. A $350 million request for P.L. 480 food aid will support programs in the Horn of Africa, Kenya, Sudan, and a $30 million contingency fund for future needs. Congress approved $1.123 billion in emergency supplemental funds for foreign operations in addition to regular FY2008 funding. The White House requested $2.2 billion in ESF funds, but Congress approved less funding with some discretion to the Administration. Approved funds include $115 million for Global Health & Child Survival, $110 million for International Disaster Assistance, and $20.8 million for USAID Operating Expenses. The White House requested $2.2 billion in ESF funds, but Congress approved less funding with some discretion to the Administration. Approved funds include $115 million for Global Health & Child Survival, $110 million for International Disaster Assistance, $20.8 million for USAID Operating Expenses, $542.6 million for Economic Support Fund, $200 million for Migration and Refugee Assistance, $100 million for Foreign Military Financing, and $35 million for Peacekeeping Operations. No supplemental funds were provided for counter-narcotics programs requested for Mexico and Central America, and the West Bank and Gaza. Until the passage of the omnibus FY2008 appropriations bill, nearly $42 billion in U.S. funds had been appropriated to support all facets of Iraq reconstruction. The Administration made no request for security assistance in its regular Defense budget proposal for FY2008, but asked for roughly $392 million under State and Foreign Operations appropriations. Congress rejected the Administration request for Iraq funding in both the House and Senate versions of the FY2008 State and Foreign Operations legislation. In FY2008, Congress rejected the Administration's request for Iraq funding, leading to reliance on an emergency supplemental measure for reconstruction. The revised emergency supplemental appropriations request included $4.9 billion for Iraq reconstruction, with $3.7 billion allocated for Department of Defense (DOD) reconstruction appropriations to train and equip Iraqi troops. The $4.9 billion emergency supplemental appropriations request for Iraq in FY2008 would mainly fund training and equipping Iraqi troops through the Iraq Security Forces Fund (ISFF) and reconstruction grants under the Commander's Emergency Response Program (CERP). CERP allows military commanders to support local economic activities with small grants, including infrastructure projects like repairing electric generators and constructing sewer systems. The Commander's Emergency Response Program (CERP) in Iraq provides aid with minimal bureaucratic hurdles. Recently, CERP has funded salaries for the Sons of Iraq, Sunnis working with U.S. forces for security. A $100 million request was added to the Iraq Freedom Fund for the Task Force to Improve Business and Stability Operations, aiming to stimulate the economy by rehabilitating state-owned enterprises. The FY2008 emergency supplemental request would direct $1.2 billion toward Iraq, with funds allocated to various programs including Economic Support Fund (ESF), International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INCLE), Migration and Refugee Assistance (MRA), and International Disaster and Famine Assistance (IDFA). The program faced challenges due to lack of electricity, security issues, and limited interest from U.S. companies. The International Disaster and Famine Assistance (IDFA) accounts have $80 million allocated for assistance provided by Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs), including newly established ePRTs embedded with U.S. combat battalions in Baghdad and Anbar province. The ePRTs aim to stabilize secured areas by supporting local economic projects with ESF-funded grants, job training, and micro-loan programs. PRTs also use ESF to enhance the capacities of local government officials to spend Iraqi-owned capital. The ESF is used to increase the capacities of local government officials to spend Iraqi-owned capital funds for infrastructure programs. At the national level, ESF supports Ministerial capacity development, agriculture and private sector reform, and democratization efforts. An additional $25 million was added to the ESF supplemental request in the October budget revision, proposing the establishment of a new Iraq enterprise fund modeled after those in east Europe and the former Soviet Union. Enterprise funds provide loans or equity investments to small and medium businesses. The enterprise funds in former communist countries supported the growth of the private sector by providing loans and equity investments to small and medium businesses. The Polish Fund was a successful example, making profitable investments to help companies grow post-communism. However, some funds were less successful due to poor investment risks or difficulty in finding promising businesses. The INCLE account would support rule of law and corrections programs, including prison construction and judicial reform. The MRA request aims to address the refugee crisis in the region caused by sectarian violence in Iraq. The IDA program aims to provide medical care, food, shelter, and relief to refugees and displaced people in Iraq. Congress provided $1.9 billion for Iraq reconstruction, with separate funding for security and economic aspects. Congress provided $1.9 billion for Iraq reconstruction, allocating funds for security and humanitarian programs, but rejected most economic assistance, only approving around $250 million for specific purposes like demining and refugee aid. Congress appropriated $16 million for refugees and disaster relief, $5 million for the Marla Ruzicka War Victims Fund, and $10 million for Iraqi scholars. This brings Iraq reconstruction funding since 2003 to $44.8 billion. The U.S. funding for PRT operations and programs, along with other programs to support the surge in Iraq, will rely on available FY2007 funds until the 2nd tranche of supplemental funding is considered in Spring 2008. Afghanistan completed its political transition in 2005, but faced escalating insurgent threats in 2006. In 2006, insurgent threats to Afghanistan's government escalated, raising doubts about the success of U.S. stabilization efforts. Despite this, political progress was made with the adoption of a new constitution in 2004, successful presidential elections in 2004, and parliamentary elections in 2005. The parliament has become a platform for factions to peacefully resolve differences, allowing Afghan citizens to enjoy new personal freedoms, especially in the northern and western regions previously forbidden under the Taliban. Women are also increasingly participating in economic and political life. In 2006, the insurgency led by remnants of the Taliban escalated despite recent successes in counter-insurgency operations. Slow reconstruction, corruption, and the failure to extend government authority into rural areas have contributed to the ongoing threat to peace and security in Afghanistan. Women are now participating in economic and political life, holding positions as ministers, governors, and in the new parliament. The Taliban resurgence in rural areas, particularly in the south and east, is fueled by slow reconstruction, corruption, and the failure to extend government authority. Concerns about distribution of reconstruction funding have been raised in the stable northern part of the country. Narcotics trafficking and independent militias pose challenges, while some Taliban commanders operate from across the border in Pakistan, beyond the reach of U.S./NATO forces. The Reconstruction Opportunity Zones (ROZ) initiative was unveiled in 2007 to address these issues. Opportunity Zones (ROZ) in Afghanistan and border regions with Pakistan aim to stimulate economic activity in underdeveloped areas. The US and partners focus on strengthening the central government, security forces, and reconstruction efforts. Weak provincial governance remains a key obstacle to Afghanistan's democracy and threatens stabilization. $339 million in ESF was requested for Afghanistan reconstruction assistance in FY2008. The Administration requested $839 million in FY2008 for Afghanistan reconstruction, including provisions for stabilization and economic efforts. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act funded government operations and military operations in Afghanistan. The FY2008 emergency supplemental requests included funding for the ESF, with $275 million allocated to strengthen provincial governance in Afghanistan. Funding of $285 million allocated for various programs in Afghanistan, including election preparation, National Solidarity Program, Afghanistan Reconstruction Fund, Provincial Governance Fund, basic social services, economic growth, and infrastructure development. The request includes funding for Reconstruction Opportunity Zones in economically isolated areas and support for Afghan leadership through the Presidential Protection Service. The Federally Administered Tribal Areas are strategically important in combating terrorism, with continued terrorist activities posing a threat to US interests in Afghanistan. The Government of Pakistan has a 10-year FATA Sustainable Development Plan supported by a $750 million development assistance strategy from the State Department and USAID. The aim is to improve economic and social conditions in the FATA to counter terrorism and militants. Programs will focus on governance, health, education, and economic development. On November 3, 2007, President Musharraf imposed emergency rule and suspended Pakistan's constitution. In February 2008, Pakistan held a credible national election, leading to a new civilian government. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice lifted coup-related sanctions on Pakistan in April 2008 after a democratically elected government took office on March 25, 2008. The Administration requested $60 million in FY2008 to fulfill the U.S. pledge of $150 million for Pakistan, focusing on governance, health, education, and economic development. The Administration requested $60 million in FY2008 for Sudan, mainly for humanitarian and peacekeeping support in the Darfur region. This emergency supplemental request is in addition to regular appropriations from various accounts in the FY2008 budget. Sudan also received $334.8 million in the regular FY2008 budget and $468 million for the African Union/United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur peacekeeping mission. The FY2008 amended emergency supplemental included a $70 million request in ESF for Sudan to support upcoming national elections as part of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. The United Nations estimates the elections could cost nearly $400 million due to logistical challenges in a post-conflict environment.
