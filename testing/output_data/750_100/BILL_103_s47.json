Chapter 154 of Title 28, United States Code, establishes special habeas corpus procedures for prisoners in State custody facing capital sentences. These procedures include the appointment of counsel, mandatory stays of execution, time requirements for filing habeas corpus petitions, evidentiary hearings, and limitations on successive petitions. Sec. 2256 of Title 28, US Code applies to State prisoners with capital sentences, requiring appointment of counsel in post-conviction proceedings if State rules or statutes are in place for counsel appointment and compensation. Sec. 2256 of Title 28, US Code mandates competent counsel for indigent prisoners with upheld capital convictions in State post-conviction proceedings. The appointment, compensation, and reimbursement of counsel must be provided for all State prisoners under a capital sentence.

The provision mandates competent counsel for indigent prisoners with upheld capital convictions in State post-conviction proceedings. Counsel may be appointed if the prisoner is indigent, unable to decide on legal offers, or has rejected counsel after understanding the consequences. Representation of a State prisoner under capital sentence must have been the same as at trial or on direct appeal unless otherwise requested. Ineffectiveness of counsel during post-conviction proceedings in a capital case is not grounds for relief, but different counsel can be appointed. Mandatory stay of execution is outlined with limits on stays. Sec. 2257 mandates a stay of execution for State prisoners with upheld capital convictions during post-conviction proceedings. The stay expires under certain conditions. A stay of execution granted to State prisoners with upheld capital convictions expires if a habeas corpus petition is not filed within the required time or if the petition for relief is denied after court reviews and no further appeals are pursued. The Supreme Court denied the petition or a timely petition for certiorari was filed and the capital sentence remained undisturbed; or a State prisoner under a capital sentence waives the right to pursue habeas corpus review in court. If any of these conditions occur, the stay of execution for State prisoners with upheld capital convictions expires. If one of the conditions in subsection (b) has occurred, no Federal court can enter a stay of execution or grant relief in a capital case unless the claim was not previously presented, or the failure to raise the claim was due to a violation of the Constitution or a new retroactively applicable Federal right recognized by the Supreme Court. Sec. 2258 outlines the time requirements and tolling rules for filing a habeas corpus petition under section 2254. The petition must be based on facts that could not have been discovered earlier and must undermine the court's confidence in the jury's determination of guilt in a death penalty case. The tolling rules for filing a habeas corpus petition under section 2254 require it to be filed within 180 days of an order issued in compliance with section 2256(c). The time requirements can be tolled from the filing of a certiorari petition in the Supreme Court until final disposition for State prisoners seeking review of a capital sentence. During post-conviction review, a State prisoner's habeas corpus petition filing deadline can be extended for up to 60 days if requested by the State prisoner's counsel in the Federal district court. The filing deadline for a State prisoner's habeas corpus petition can be extended for up to 60 days upon request by counsel in the Federal district court. The time requirement for filing is continuously tolled from the initial post-conviction review filing until final disposition by the State's highest court, as long as State filing rules are met. Tolling does not occur during a petition for certiorari before the Supreme Court.
