    "content": "Contemporary semantic parsing models struggle to generalize to unseen database schemas when translating natural language questions into SQL queries. A unified framework based on relation-aware self-attention mechanism addresses schema encoding, schema linking, and feature representation within a text-to-SQL encoder, boosting exact match accuracy on the Spider dataset to 53.7%. The release of large annotated datasets containing questions and corresponding database SQL queries has led to significant progress in translating natural language questions into executable queries. This has improved model accuracy to 53.7% on the Spider dataset, showcasing advancements in schema linking and alignment. The release of annotated datasets with SQL queries has advanced natural language question translation. New tasks like WikiSQL and Spider challenge generalization to unseen database schemas, posing schema encoding difficulties for text-to-SQL models. The challenge in developing text-to-SQL models lies in creating column and table representations for decoding SQL queries, encoding schema information, and aligning natural language references to database columns/tables. Schema linking, aligning question references to schema columns/tables, is a key aspect that requires attention. Schema linking, which aligns question references to schema columns/tables, is a crucial aspect in text-to-SQL models. Prior work addressed the schema representation problem by encoding foreign key relations with a graph neural network. The semantic parser must consider known schema relations and question context to resolve column/table references accurately. The approach of encoding foreign key relations with a graph neural network has limitations in contextualizing schema encoding with the question and restricting information propagation to predefined relations. Global reasoning is essential for effective representations of relational structures, as shown by self-attention mechanisms in natural language processing. In this work, a unified framework called RAT-SQL is introduced for encoding relational structure in the database schema and questions. It utilizes relation-aware self-attention for global reasoning over schema entities and question words, along with structured reasoning over predefined schema relations. RAT-SQL achieves 53.7% exact match accuracy on the Spider test set, currently the state of the art without pretrained BERT augmentation. Semantic parsing of natural language to SQL queries has gained popularity with the creation of WikiSQL and Spider datasets. RAT-SQL, a model unaugmented with pretrained BERT embeddings, achieves state-of-the-art results in this field. It enables accurate internal representations of question alignment with schema columns and tables. Schema encoding is less challenging in WikiSQL compared to Spider due to the absence of multi-table relations. Schema linking is relevant for both tasks but more challenging in Spider. Schema linking is more challenging in Spider compared to WikiSQL due to richer natural language expressiveness and less restricted SQL grammar. State-of-the-art models on Spider use attentional architectures for question/schema encoding and AST-based structural architectures for query decoding. IRNet achieves high accuracy by encoding the question and schema separately with LSTM and self-attention, using custom type vectors for schema linking. The AST-based decoder of Yin and Neubig (2017) is used for query decoding in an intermediate representation with higher-level abstraction structure than SQL. Bogin et al. (2019b) encode the schema with a graph neural network and a grammar-based decoder, emphasizing schema encoding and linking. RAT-SQL provides a unified way to encode relational information among inputs, contrasting with other approaches. Global-GNN, a schema linking approach for Spider, uses global reasoning between question words and schema columns/tables. Question word representations influence schema representations, and message propagation is limited to schema-induced edges like foreign key relations. The Table 1 relation-aware transformer mechanism encodes arbitrary relations between question words and schema elements using self-attention. It extends previous work by effectively encoding complex relationships within unordered sets of elements like columns and tables. The RAT-SQL framework applies relation-aware self-attention to joint representation learning with predefined and softly induced relations in database schema elements and question structures. It introduces a mechanism for encoding relational structure between the question and schema, specifically for schema encoding and linking in text-to-SQL semantic parsing. The RAT-SQL framework implements schema linking by jointly encoding relational structure between the question and schema in text-to-SQL semantic parsing. The goal is to generate SQL queries based on a natural language question and a relational database schema. The text discusses schema linking in SQL, where some columns are primary keys and others are foreign keys. The goal is to align question words with columns or tables in order to generate accurate SQL queries. This process is crucial for parsers to generate the correct output. The text discusses representing database schema using a directed graph, with nodes representing tables and columns labeled with their names. It also describes the relationships between nodes in the graph using edges with specific labels. The text discusses representing a database schema using a directed graph, with nodes representing tables and columns labeled with their names. It also describes the relationships between nodes in the graph using edges with specific labels. The decoder in the approach uses tree-structured self-attention layers to obtain initial representations for nodes in the graph and words in the input question. A bidirectional LSTM is used for both the graph nodes and the question, with the output concatenated to form the node embedding. The text discusses using self-attention to imbue initial representations with schema graph information. Self-attention is relation-aware and transforms input elements into new representations. The text describes the application of self-attention in constructing initial representations with schema graph information. It involves using a stack of relation-aware self-attention layers with separate weights for each layer to process the input elements. The directed graph created represents edge types in the encoder. The directed graph represents edge types in the schema, including SAME-TABLE, FOREIGN-KEY-COL-F, FOREIGN-KEY-COL-R, PRIMARY-KEY-F, PRIMARY-KEY-R, BELONGS-TO-R, FOREIGN-KEY-TAB-F, and FOREIGN-KEY-TAB-R. In the schema, various relation types are defined, such as FOREIGN-KEY-TAB-F, FOREIGN-KEY-TAB-R, and FOREIGN-KEY-TAB-B. A discrete set of relation types is mapped to embeddings to obtain values for pairs of elements in x. The label on edges between nodes in the graph G is used to determine r ij, but this method is not always sufficient. In the schema, relation types like FOREIGN-KEY-TAB-F, FOREIGN-KEY-TAB-R, and FOREIGN-KEY-TAB-B are defined. These relation types are mapped to embeddings to get values for pairs of elements in x. However, determining r ij using the label on edges in graph G is not always enough. Additional types are added to define relations between question words, schema nodes, and self-edges. This includes COLUMN-IDENTITY, TABLE-IDENTITY, and other types like COLUMN-COLUMN, COLUMN-TABLE, TABLE-COLUMN, or TABLE-TABLE. Relation types are also defined to align column/table references in the question to schema columns/tables. In addition to defining relation types for schema columns/tables, the text explains how to determine matches between question text and column/table names. Different types of matches (exact or partial) are identified for n-grams in the question, resulting in various types of relations (QUESTION-COLUMN-M, QUESTION-TABLE-M, COLUMN-QUESTION-M, TABLE-QUESTION-M). In the end, 33 types are added beyond the 10 in Table 1, using relation-aware attention to compute explicit alignment matrices for memory-schema alignment. The alignment matrix should resemble real discrete alignments and respect constraints like sparsity. An auxiliary loss is added to bias the soft alignment towards real structures, encouraging sparsity. The model's belief of the best alignment is treated as ground truth, and a cross-entropy loss is used to strengthen this belief. Relevant columns and tables in the SQL query are considered for the alignment loss. The decoder generates SQL queries using an LSTM to output decoder actions that expand nodes in the tree according to grammar rules. The final encoding of the question and schema, along with previous actions, are used to generate the SQL query. The LSTM's state is updated by incorporating previous actions and node embeddings. Multi-head attention is used to obtain z_t, and a 2-layer MLP with tanh non-linearity is applied. The model is implemented in PyTorch, with preprocessing involving input questions and columns. Within the model implemented in PyTorch, preprocessing involves tokenizing and lemmatizing input questions, column names, and table names using the StandfordNLP toolkit. GloVe word embeddings are used in the encoder, with dimensions of 300 and fixed in training except for the 50 most common words. The bidirectional LSTMs have a hidden size of 128 per direction and utilize the recurrent dropout method with a rate of 0.2. Additionally, 8 relation-aware self-attention layers are stacked on top of the bidirectional LSTMs, with specific parameters set for the attention layers. In the model implemented in PyTorch, parameters such as d x = d z = 256, H = 8, and dropout rate of 0.1 are set. The position-wise feed-forward network has inner layer dimension 1024. In the decoder, rule embeddings are of size 128, node type embeddings are of size 64, and LSTM has a hidden size of 512 with dropout rate 0.21. The Adam optimizer with default values in PyTorch is used. The learning rate is linearly increased during warmup_steps = max_steps/20 steps and then annealed. Default initialization method in PyTorch is used for all parameters. For experiments, default initialization method in PyTorch is used with a batch size of 20 and training for up to 40,000 steps on the Spider dataset. The training data includes examples from various datasets like Restaurants, GeoQuery, Scholar, Academic, Yelp, and IMDB. Test set access is limited to an evaluation server by Yu et al. (2018b). The evaluation server is used for most evaluations, except for the final accuracy measurement, using a development set with 1,034 examples. Results are reported using metrics from previous work, focusing on exact match accuracy. RAT-SQL outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches on the hidden test set. RAT-SQL outperforms other methods on the dataset leaderboard, even without BERT embeddings. It is close to beating the best BERT-augmented model. Performance drops with increasing difficulty, with a significant 15% accuracy drop on extra hard questions. Adding BERT augmentation to RAT-SQL may lead to state-of-the-art performance among BERT models. Schema linking significantly improves accuracy (p<0.001) on hard questions. Alignment between question words and table columns is explicitly represented for column selection during decoding. Model accuracy differs from the best single model in Table 2a as it gives the mean over ten runs. The alignment matrix allows the model to align words to columns during decoding, but in the final model, the alignment loss terms do not impact overall accuracy. Earlier, the alignment loss improved the model significantly, but hyper-parameter tuning may have eliminated the need for explicit alignment supervision. The alignment matrix in the final model allows for word-column alignment during decoding, with no impact on overall accuracy. Despite errors in alignment, the model correctly identifies key words referencing columns in the dataset. In this work, a unified framework is presented to address schema encoding and linking challenges in semantic parsing of text to SQL. The framework utilizes relation-aware self-attention to learn schema and question word representations based on their alignment with predefined schema relations, leading to significant state-of-the-art improvements. The RAT framework combines predefined schema relations and self-attended relations for text-to-SQL parsing, leading to state-of-the-art improvement. The joint representation learning can benefit various tasks with predefined structure. An oracle experiment was conducted to assess the decoder's ability to select the correct column. In an oracle experiment, the decoder is forced to make correct choices for SQL sketch and column/table selection, resulting in 99.4% accuracy. Without the oracles, accuracy drops to 70.9%, indicating incorrect selections in 73.5% of questions. In an oracle experiment, the decoder's accuracy is 99.4% when forced to make correct SQL sketch and column/table selections. Without oracles, accuracy drops to 70.9%, with incorrect selections in 73.5% of questions. RAT-SQL's accuracy is 67.6%, with 82.0% of wrong answers having incorrect structure. Most questions have both column and structure errors, highlighting areas for improvement."
