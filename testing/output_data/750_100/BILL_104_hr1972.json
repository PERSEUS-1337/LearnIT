    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Independent Contractor Tax Simplification Act of 1995\". The Congress finds that simplifying tax rules for independent contractors was a top priority at the 1995 White House Conference on Small Business. Delegates recommended recognizing the legitimacy of independent contractors and establishing realistic guidelines. It is important for taxpayers and the Federal Government to have fair rules for distinguishing between employees and independent contractors. SEC. 3. STANDARDS FOR DETERMINING WHETHER INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT EMPLOYEES. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to establish guidelines for distinguishing between employees and independent contractors. The text establishes rules that if certain requirements are met, the service provider, recipient, and payor will not be considered as employees or employers. The subsection outlines requirements for service providers, including significant investment, unreimbursed expenses, specific time or result agreements, commission-based payment, and product resale. The subsection outlines requirements for service providers, including having a principal place of business, not primarily providing services at the recipient's place of business, paying fair market rent, not being required to exclusively serve the recipient, and performing a significant amount of service. The subsection requires service providers to have a principal place of business, pay fair market rent, not exclusively serve the recipient, and perform a significant amount of service for other persons through various means like advertising or referrals. The subsection requires service providers to have a principal place of business, pay fair market rent, not exclusively serve the recipient, and perform a significant amount of service for other persons through various means like advertising or referrals. Written Document Requirements are met if services are performed under a registered business name with a State or political subdivision. The individual's services must be performed under a written contract stating they are not an employee for tax purposes. Special rules apply if reporting requirements are not met by the service recipient or payor. The section specifies that if a service provider is performing services through an entity they own, the entity can be included in the references. Definitions for this section are provided for clarity. The section provides definitions for key terms related to service providers, service recipients, and payors. The term \"in connection with performing the service\" refers to activities related to the service provided or the operation of the service provider's business. Exceptions include entities owned by the service provider. The table of sections for chapter 25 of the Code is amended by adding a new item related to activities performed by the service provider. The amendments made by this Act regarding standards for determining employee status will apply to services performed after December 31, 1995."
