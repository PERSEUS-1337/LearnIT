    "content": "The \"King Cove Road Land Exchange Act\" allows for a land exchange and the construction of a road corridor, deemed to be in the public interest by Congress. The Act defines \"Federal land\" as approximately 206 acres within the Refuge, including 131 acres in the Wilderness for road construction. \"Non-Federal land\" is also defined. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to land ownership and designations in the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, including \"non-Federal land,\" \"Refuge,\" \"road corridor,\" \"Secretary,\" \"State,\" and \"Wilderness.\" The curr_chunk defines the Izembek Wilderness as designated by the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. The Izembek Wilderness is designated by the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, with a requirement for a land exchange. The State can convey non-Federal land to the Secretary in exchange for Federal land for road construction in the Izembek Wilderness. Valuation and appraisals are required for the land exchange. Federal land will be exchanged under this section based on appraisals to ensure equality. Appraisals will be conducted by selected appraisers for Federal and non-Federal land in accordance with requirements. Appraisals for the land exchange must adhere to nationally recognized standards, including the Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions and the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice. If the appraised value of Federal land exceeds that of non-Federal land, equalization measures will be taken. Under the land exchange, the value of Federal and non-Federal land must be equalized through conveying additional non-Federal land, cash payment, or a combination of both methods. If the final appraised value of non-Federal land exceeds that of Federal land, equalization measures will be taken. If the appraised value of the non-Federal land is higher than the final appraised value of the Federal land in the exchange, the State can adjust the acreage of the non-Federal land to be conveyed. The Secretary has the authority to accept a payment exceeding 25% of the value of the Federal land. The land exchange under this section must be completed within 180 days of enactment. The Wilderness boundary will be modified to exclude Federal land and include non-Federal land, which will be administered according to the Wilderness Act and other laws. The land exchange must be completed within 180 days of enactment. The road corridor will follow the southern road alignment described in the final environmental impact statement. Requirements for usage, barrier cables, dimensions, and support facilities will apply to the road constructed in the corridor. The exchange of Federal land and non-Federal land and the construction of a road under this Act will not be considered a major Federal action under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969."
