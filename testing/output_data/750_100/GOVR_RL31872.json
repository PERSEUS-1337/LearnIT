    "content": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, are powered aerial vehicles that do not carry a human operator. They can fly autonomously or be piloted remotely, carry a payload, and use aerodynamic forces for lift. They are distinct from ballistic or semiballistic vehicles, cruise missiles, and artillery projectiles. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are designed to fly autonomously and can be single air vehicles or part of a UAV system (UAS) with multiple air vehicles. The military use of UAVs in recent conflicts has highlighted their advantages over manned aircraft, such as eliminating the risk to a pilot's life and their aeronautical capabilities. UAVs offer advantages over manned aircraft by eliminating the risk to a pilot's life and their aeronautical capabilities. They are cheaper to procure and operate, performing \"3-D\" missions that do not require a pilot in the cockpit. However, the lower cost must be weighed against the higher crash risk, and the minimized risk must be balanced with the dangers of unmanned vehicles sharing airspace with manned assets. Recent growth in UAV employment is due to advancements in navigation and communication technology. UAVs have a century-old history in aviation, first included in Jane's All the World's Aircraft in 1920. The AQM-34 Firebee was used in a surveillance role during the Vietnam War, showcasing the versatility of UAVs. The Firebee UAV, initially flown in the 1970s, was modified for armed capabilities in 2002. Israel's success with UAVs in the 1980s influenced the US to increase UAV funding in the Reagan Administration's FY1987 budget. The transition of UAVs in the United States from experimental projects to acquisition programs was marked by the success of the Pioneer UAV during Operation Desert Storm. The potential value of UAVs was recognized post-Gulf War, leading to the rapid development of the Air Force's Predator with new capabilities. The Predator was utilized in the Balkans conflict for surveillance missions and later in Afghanistan for various operations. The US has five major UAVs in inventory: Navy and Marine Corps's Pioneer, Air Force's Global Hawk and Predator, Army's Hunter and Shadow UAVs. Congress supports UAVs with increasing investment, from $667 million in FY2001 to over $1.1 billion in FY2003. Pentagon requested $1.6 billion for UAV procurement and development in FY2006. Congress has requested $1.6 billion for UAV procurement and development in FY2006, with concerns about the future path of UAVs. They have directed the formation of joint program offices to ensure commonality between services' UAV programs and have advocated for a more aggressive approach to fielding UAVs in some instances. The House Armed Services Committee supported legislation in 1996 to weaponize UAVs, but DOD opposed the initiative. Congress predicted that one-third of U.S. military deep strike aircraft would be unmanned within ten years. The pace of UAV development has accelerated, raising questions on cost-efficiency, effectiveness, and interoperability. The DoD's deployment of UAVs raises concerns about cost-efficiency, effectiveness, and interoperability. Congressional oversight is needed to ensure that UAV acquisition plans align with investment goals and strategies. Questions arise about the cost-effectiveness of UAVs compared to manned aircraft. UAV costs compared to manned aircraft costs are being questioned as UAVs are increasingly used in new roles. Analysts suggest that unmanned aerial platforms could potentially take over many missions currently done by manned aircraft. Congress may need to consider replacing a significant portion of manned aircraft with yet-to-be-designed unmanned aircraft. The defining characteristic of UAVs is that they are \"unmanned.\" The potential impact of widespread UAV deployment on military personnel and the industrial base needs to be considered. Concerns include recruitment and retention issues, as well as the erosion of skills and technologies needed for manned aircraft design if defense companies focus more on developing unmanned aircraft. The growing international UAV marketplace raises concerns about the proliferation of these systems. Congress may need to balance supporting U.S. exports with controlling the spread of UAV technologies to dangerous groups or countries. UAVs are being developed and fielded in increasing numbers with a variety of designs and applications. The diversity of UAV designs and applications is accelerating, raising questions for Congress about the management of UAV programs. From combat-tested models like Pioneer, Hunter, Predator, and Global Hawk to untested ones like the Air Force and Navy's Unmanned Combat Air Vehicles, the range of UAV sizes and capabilities varies greatly. The evolution of UAVs is evident in the increasing diversity of designs and applications. The inventory of UAVs has significantly expanded since February 2003, now including 604 UAVs with various platforms and non-traditional vehicles. The Global Hawk, with a combat radius of 5,400 nm, is a notable example of this advancement. The DoD's UAV inventory has increased due to rising demand for UAVs for various purposes. Inventory calculations were based on subtracting lost UAVs from total deliveries, with attrition numbers from reported accidents. The DoD's UAV inventory has expanded to meet the growing demand for UAVs in a variety of missions beyond ISR applications. Predator drones have strike capabilities, while the J-UCAS project aims to target air defenses. UAVs are increasingly used for roles such as mine detection, border patrol, medical resupply, and force protection. Funding for UAV research and development has also increased due to the industry's growth. R&D funding for UAVs has grown significantly due to the industry's expansion, with new technology aiding in the development of various UAV types. In FY2006, R&D funding for UAVs exceeded total procurement funding, indicating continued accelerated acquisition of UAVs in the future. Despite the increase in UAV production, manned aircraft still make up 95% of all DoD aircraft. Despite the recent acceleration in UAV production, manned aircraft still represent 95% of all DoD aircraft, suggesting that UAVs replacing manned aircraft in the foreseeable future is unlikely. UAV programs are often seen as complements to manned aircraft, with the pace of UAV production expected to either continue or accelerate in the coming years. The Defense Science Board recommends accelerating the introduction of UAVs into the force structure. The Military Balance 2004-2005 and 2005-2030 UAS Roadmap show plans to expand UAV operations in the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve. General John Jumper emphasized increased Predator production. Congress questions the pace of UAV development compared to manned aircraft. Congress has urged the Department of Defense to accelerate UAV acquisition and incorporate certain capabilities. In the past, there were challenges in meeting goals due to the lack of unmanned deep strike aircraft. In 1996, the House Armed Services Committee supported legislation to weaponize the Predator and Hunter, despite DoD's opposition. Some in the 109th Congress have called for increased UAV procurement. Some in the 109th Congress advocate increased procurement and use of UAVs for non-military roles, while expressing concerns about DoD's enthusiasm potentially leading to unclear future paths. Critics worry that a rushed pace could impact product quality and acquisition efficiency. Some in the 109th Congress advocate increased procurement and use of UAVs for non-military roles, while expressing concerns about DoD's rushed pace impacting product quality and acquisition efficiency. Representative Curt Weldon cautioned against aggressively fielding new types of vehicles prematurely, emphasizing the need for common standards in design and operations. Services are purchasing million-dollar UAVs using operations and maintenance funding without specific allocation. Some services are buying million-dollar UAVs using operations and maintenance funding without proper authorization or appropriations. Others are leasing UAV services for combat operations and reducing congressional oversight by incorporating UAV projects into larger program requests. The Global Hawk's rapid development may be hindered by a crowded production schedule and aggressive funding strategy, leading to technological immaturity according to a 2004 GAO report. The 2004 GAO report highlighted the Global Hawk program's funding strategy as a factor contributing to the technological immaturity of critical technologies. It suggests a potential slowdown or temporary production halt, along with management changes, to maintain quality and efficiency. Some argue that the pace is appropriate, citing past success with other UAV programs like the Hunter and Predator. Many in Congress support UAV programs but want assurances on taxpayer spending. Section 142 of the FY2006 Defense Authorization Act requires approval for new unmanned aerial vehicle systems. Congressional task includes evaluating DoD's administrative processes for effective UAV development. The acquisition process for UAV development and acquisition has received increased attention from Congress. Concerns have been raised about potential duplication of effort due to the accelerated rate at which UAVs are being acquired for various applications by multiple military services. Many call for centralization of UAV acquisition authority to prevent duplication of effort and reduce wasteful spending. However, centralization may stifle competition and innovation. UAVs are now rivaling manned aircraft in cost, with the Global Hawk program estimated to cost $6.5 billion. The GlobalHawk program is estimated to cost $6.5 billion for 51 aircraft, with a unit acquisition cost of $128 million per UAV. Development cost overruns of $194 million have led to concerns about cost growth due to factors like \"mission creep\" and inconsistent management practices. The Global Hawk program has increased costs by adding multiple sensors, larger wings, and more powerful engines. Originally intended to carry one sensor, it now carries two or more, making it more expensive. The Joint Unmanned Combat Air System (JUCAS) has also seen cost increases due to its evolution into a larger aircraft with a heavy payload. Additionally, over $1 billion has been cut from the JUCAS budget. The DoD has cut over $1 billion from the JUCAS budget and transferred management of the program from DARPA to the Air Force. This budget cut may reduce the total number of aircraft to be procured and increase the cost per aircraft. Changing management responsibility can lead to cost growth due to a lack of coherent direction and changes in requirements. The frequent organizational changes within DoD's UAV development roles highlight the challenges of establishing a comprehensive UAV management system. The management of UAV programs has shifted between military services, a Navy-run Joint Program Office (JPO), the Defense Airborne Reconnaissance Office (DARO), and back to the services under OSD. Congress criticized the JPO in 1992 for its management of UAV programs, leading to little progress in the past five years. The JPO was replaced by DARO in 1993 for better management. The Defense Airborne Reconnaissance Office (DARO) replaced the Navy-run Joint Program Office (JPO) in 1993 to manage DoD's airborne reconnaissance programs, including UAVs. DARO faced criticism and was disbanded in 1998, leaving no single procurement focal point for DOD UAV efforts. General oversight authority now resides within the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence. The OSD established the Joint UAV Planning Task Force in 2001 to increase joint coordination of UAV programs operated by the services. The task force standardizes payload development, establishes uniform interfaces, and promotes a common vision for future UAV-related efforts. It is viewed as the top rung in the defense community for UAV coordination. The Joint UAV Planning Task Force, established in 2001 by the OSD, is seen as the top authority for UAV coordination in the defense community. Dr. Glenn Lamartin from the OSD emphasized the task force's role in setting requirements and providing structure for UAV programs. Despite the task force's efforts, Congressional concerns regarding UAV acquisition management and interoperability persisted. In 2002, the House Committee on Armed Services expressed concerns about proper program management and adherence to standards in UAV programs. In 2003, the U.S. Joint Forces Command and DoD initiated management mechanisms for UAV interoperability and international cooperation. The Joint Requirement Oversight Council (JROC) established a UAV Special Studies Group to support systems development and international cooperation in UAV programs. OSD considered appointing one service as the executive agent for UAV programs, with the Air Force actively petitioning for the position. In late June 2005, the JROC announced that the DoD had abandoned the idea of an executive agent for UAV programs in favor of two smaller organizations focusing on interoperability. The Joint UAV Overarching Integrated Product Team (OIPT) addresses major interoperability and standardization issues, while the Joint UAV Center of Excellence works with the OIPT to enhance UAV applications through technology examination and training. The DoD has made management initiatives to increase system uniformity and interoperability for UAV intelligence collection assets. Recent establishment of Joint UAV OIPT and Joint UAV COE has raised concerns over the fluctuating organizational changes, indicating a lack of final UAV development and oversight structure. The GAO testimony in March 2005 criticized the DoD for lacking oversight in UAV development, leading to the creation of management groups by the OSD. The GAO envisioned a central authority for guidance, but DoD's purpose for this oversight body may differ. The DoD's oversight body for UAV development may differ from the GAO's vision, with questions arising about final management authority. The UAV Center of Excellence is described as a 'one-stop shop' for exploring common operating systems and UAV usage. The Joint UAV Task Force released the UAV Roadmap and the 2005-2030 UAS Roadmap to guide the future roles, technological progress, and investment needs of UAVs in U.S. warfighting. The GAO called on the Department of Defense to establish a binding framework for UAV integration. The GAO called for a binding strategic plan from the Department of Defense for UAV integration, citing the 2002 Roadmap's failure to outline inter-service goals and investment priorities. The 2005 UAS Roadmap reiterates this mandate, focusing on standards development and interoperability solutions without authorizing specific UAS or prioritizing requirements. The 2005 UAS Roadmap provides guidance on future technology availability for new capabilities in UAS development, without establishing a definitive plan. The discrepancy between the DoD's approach and the GAO's vision may lead to debates on future UAV management. Congress may revisit GAO recommendations and assess the Roadmap's adequacy in light of the Joint UAV OIPT and COE establishment. The GAO recommendations and the Roadmap mandate may be revisited to integrate UAVs into future warfighting capabilities. All military services, SOCOM, and the Coast Guard are developing UAVs. A coordinated DOD-wide UAV investment strategy is crucial to avoid duplication and maximize resources. Congress plays a role in arbitrating between competing UAV investments and impacting DOD's investment plan. Key questions include how UAV cost is quantified and the most effective spending balance. Quantifying UAV cost is a complex task for the UAV community, with different cost measurements such as flyaway cost and program acquisition unit cost (PAUC) being commonly used. The Air Force's System Command (AFSC) Cost Estimating Handbook provides guidance on assessing UAV cost efficiency. The Air Force's System Command Cost Estimating Handbook defines flyaway cost as including prime mission equipment, systems engineering, program management, and allowances for engineering changes and warranties. On the other hand, the Government Accountability Office describes PAUC as the total of all acquisition-related appropriations divided by the total quantity of fully configured end items, taking into account acquisition costs from previous years. The difference between Global Hawk's PAUC and flyaway cost highlights a significant discrepancy. The discrepancy between Global Hawk's flyaway cost and PAUC demonstrates the significant difference in costs. UAVs require supporting elements like ground control stations and crews, unlike manned aircraft. Analysts comparing UAV costs to manned aircraft need to consider these additional costs. The cost of unmanned aviation systems includes supporting elements and operational infrastructure. Budgeting conventions complicate monitoring UAV costs, as they may be found in different accounts and some costs are covered in the Intelligence budget. The cost of unmanned aviation systems is complicated by budgeting conventions, making it challenging to monitor UAV costs. Congress may need to find a balance between spending on UAVs and manned aircraft. If UAV funding continues to rise, DoD could spend over $18 billion on UAVs from 2001-2010. The funding for UAVs from 2001-2010 exceeded $3.5 billion, with the Joint Unmanned Combat Air System expected to break $1 billion by FY2011. Comparisons between manned and unmanned funding from FY2006 through FY2011 are illustrated. The funding for UAVs from 2001-2010 exceeded $3.5 billion, with the Joint Unmanned Combat Air System expected to break $1 billion by FY2011. Comparisons between manned and unmanned funding from FY2006 through FY2011 show that UAV funding remains under 10% of total military aviation spending, representing only three percent of all military aviation funding. Cost savings are a touted advantage of UAVs over manned aircraft. Critics argue that while unmanned aircraft offer cost savings in acquisition, the overall expenses may not be significantly lower due to the need for ground control station operations and training costs for UAV \"pilots\". Additionally, UAVs have higher attrition and lower reliability rates compared to manned aircraft, leading to increased operation and maintenance costs. The operation and maintenance costs of unmanned aircraft can be higher due to their lower reliability rate compared to manned aircraft. UAV ground control stations can fly multiple UAVs simultaneously, offsetting some cost advantages. Congress has noted that while acquisition costs per unit may be small, the overall acquisition cost rivals that of larger weapon systems. Studies have shown that replacing manned attack helicopters with UCAVs may not result in significant savings in procurement costs. The DoD studied comparative costs of manned vs. unmanned aircraft, finding similar development costs but savings in procurement costs for unmanned vehicles. Balancing cost and capability between manned and unmanned vehicles is a pressing challenge for the DoD, with concerns about rising prices of some UAVs. Members of the House Armed Services Committee expressed concern over cost growth of UAVs, including both high-tech and less technologically ambitious ones. Former Air Force Secretary James Roche noted that sensors have consistently increased the cost of UAVs. The design of small UAVs like Desert Hawk and Dragon Eye is inexpensive, but the cost of their sensor payloads is significant. The RQ-4 B Global Hawk's sensor payload is also costly. The sensor payload of the RQ-4 B Global Hawk represents a significant portion of the vehicle's cost, driven by increasing demand and lack of competition in the UAV sensor market. This has led to suggestions of equipping UAVs with self-protection devices, indicating a shift in their perceived expendability. One approach for UAV employment is to field smaller, less expensive UAVs controlled through a highly interconnected communications network, like the Army's Future Combat System. This network distributes mission duties among various UAVs to allow each platform to provide its specialized task. The Global Hawk is a high altitude surveillance platform that can stay airborne for days but operates independently from other UAVs. Both ends of UAV spectrum, from highly networked systems to standalone platforms, have faced delays and funding reductions since 2003. The Army's Future Combat System and the Global Hawk program have experienced delays due to management and technology issues. The Global Hawk and J-UCAS programs have faced rising costs and management struggles, leading to funding cuts. Key areas for investment in UAVs include interoperability, reliability, force multiplication/autonomy, and engine systems. The slow advancement of interoperability is a major concern, with the lack of it potentially causing the Department of Defense to lose interest in UAVs. The future plans for UAV usage in larger battlefield operations require seamless communication between UAVs and ground components, as well as compatibility with various ground control systems to enhance effectiveness. Lack of interconnectivity has complicated missions, potentially causing the Department of Defense to lose interest in UAVs. Advancing UAV interoperability is crucial for the Department of Defense's investment plans. Establishing inter-communication between UAVs aims to enhance situational awareness and facilitate interoperability among different categories. This could lead to better decision-making in response to specific threats in different areas. Advancing UAV interoperability is crucial for the Department of Defense's investment plans. The framework for interoperability includes position, payload composition, service operator, mission tasking procedure, surveillance data transfer, weapons coordination, and air vehicle control interface. However, technology development in this area has been slow. The House of Representatives version of the FY2006 Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 1815) included a clause requiring all tactical unmanned aerial vehicles to be equipped with the Tactical Common Data Link for improved communication. The 2005 Unmanned Aircraft Systems Roadmap aims to further enhance Common Data Link communications. The Common Data Link communications system is intended for all large UAVs, not just tactical UAVs, to achieve interoperability. Investment is needed to expedite development and address bandwidth limitations, which may hinder UAV applications and leave platforms grounded. The need for bandwidth increases with each U.S. war. The increased use of UAVs in the Iraq war highlights the growing need for a more robust information transfer system due to bandwidth limitations. Representative Curt Weldon noted that many UAVs sit idle on the ground due to inadequate bandwidth for downloading video and radar images. The use of UAVs in Iraq and Afghanistan is hindered by inadequate bandwidth, leading to many UAVs sitting idle on the ground. The Transformation Satellite Communications (TSAT) project aims to address this issue by providing unlimited communication capabilities to the U.S. armed forces. The Transformation Satellite Communications (TSAT) project aims to provide unlimited communication capabilities to the U.S. armed forces by sending and receiving critical information around the world without data traffic jams. The project, also known as \"the internet in the sky\", is facing funding cutbacks and is expected to be deployed between 2015 and 2016. One solution to alleviate the bandwidth problem is allowing UAVs to be operated from a manned stand-off aircraft. One solution to alleviate the bandwidth problem is allowing UAVs to be operated from a manned stand-off aircraft, reducing reliance on satellites for communication. This approach also addresses pilot manpower and retention issues by allowing pilots to \"fly\" while operating the UAV. Experimentation is ongoing, with the first step being controlling the UAV's sensor payload from the air. Investment in reliability upgrades is a high priority for UAVs. The Defense Science Board highlighted high UAV mishap rates in 2004, which could hinder their widespread use. The 2005 UAS Roadmap shows that UAV mishap rates are higher than those of manned aircraft. The Defense Science Board's recent UAV study notes the improvement in manned aircraft mishap rates over the past five decades. Aircraft have transitioned from high mishap rates to lower rates over the past five decades due to system design advancements, weather durability improvements, and reliability upgrades. However, UAVs, except for Predator, have significantly less total flight times than the 100,000 hours used to calculate mishap rates. Most aircraft experience higher mishap rates in their first 50,000 hours of flight compared to their second 50,000 hours. Some UAVs have flown numerous missions while still under development, such as Predator and Global Hawk being rushed into combat before their initial operational readiness. The DSB's report suggests that nominal upgrades and investments could reduce UAV mishap rates. The 2005 UAS Roadmap proposes investments in emerging technologies to enhance UAV capabilities. The incorporation of advanced materials and technologies in UAVs, such as flight control systems, heavy fuel engines, and cold weather tolerance designs, aims to enhance reliability and survivability in adverse environments. A key technological priority is enabling one ground operator to pilot multiple UAVs simultaneously to reduce workload. Mike Heinz emphasized the need to reduce operator workload in UAV operations by aiming for a 2:1 operator-vehicle ratio and increasing autonomy and interoperability. This advancement could significantly enhance UAVs as force multipliers on the battlefield. Investing in autonomous flight capabilities of UAVs is crucial to reduce operator workload and enhance combat capability. Significant time and investments are needed to achieve this goal, as noted in the 2005 UAS Roadmap. The Global Hawk and Scan Eagle already possess advanced autonomous flight capabilities, but further investment in control technologies is necessary for UAV teams to work together effectively. The Global Hawk and Scan Eagle UAVs have advanced autonomous flight capabilities, but operator intervention is still required in poor weather conditions. The OSD quantifies UAV autonomy on a scale of one to ten, with a level of at least eight needed for maximum use by a single pilot. The Global Hawk is considered one of the most autonomous UAVs. The Global Hawk UAV has an autonomy level of 2.5, with plans to increase it to 6. The FAA, UAV industry, and Department of Defense are collaborating on \"see and avoid\" technology to allow UAVs to operate autonomously and avoid other aircraft, potentially raising the standard autonomy level to 4. Inter-UAV communication and interoperability are crucial for matching autonomous flight capabilities. The Air Force is working on advancing the automation of sensor capabilities for intelligence collecting drones, aiming for one operator to control multiple UAVs. A recent Predator upgrade allowed one operator to pilot up to four UAVs using the Multi-Aircraft Control system. The next step is to consolidate the tasks of the mission payload operators. The Air Force is advancing automation for intelligence drones, aiming for one operator to control multiple UAVs. Investment interest in heavy fuel engines for UAVs is highlighted, with a focus on replacing gasoline-powered engines with heavy fuel engines for Predators, Shadows, Hunters, and Fire Scouts. The Defense Science Board urges DoD to invest in rapid development and acquisition of heavy fuel engines due to lack of commercial demand. The military has established a need for heavy fuel burning engines for UAVs like Predator, Shadow, Hunter, and Fire Scout. Industry has been slow to respond to this demand, despite the benefits heavy fuel engines offer in terms of faster climbing, operating at higher altitudes, and reduced maintenance time. The military has a need for heavy fuel engines for UAVs like Predator, Shadow, Hunter, and Fire Scout. Proponents argue that heavy fuel engines would increase performance, reduce servicing time, and lower maintenance costs. However, drawbacks may exist when applying heavy fuel engines to UAVs, particularly medium-sized and less complex ones. The initial acquisition cost of heavy fuel engines for UAVs is much greater than traditional engines, potentially burdening cheap UAVs with increased production costs. Developers are struggling to design engines light and small enough for lighter UAVs, but a modified fuel cell being developed by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory is also being considered. Fuel cell supporters believe they could double the efficiency of mid-sized UAVs and reduce their detectability and vulnerability. The Air Combat Command is sponsoring a project to use fuel cells in smaller UAVs to make them harder to detect and target. Questions arise about the DoD's plan for UAV roles and applications, including whether UAVs are being applied to new roles aggressively enough and if there are alternatives to consider for their missions. Most UAVs are currently used for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. The trend is expected to continue until at least 2014. ISR applications vary from high altitude missions by the Global Hawk to sniper spotting by the Army's Raven UAV. In 2005, 87% of major UAV programs are focused on ISR missions. In 2005, 87% of major UAV programs are designed for ISR missions, raising concerns about potential duplication and challenges in joint development among the Services. In 2005, concerns were raised about potential duplication and challenges in joint development among the Services regarding the need for new maritime surveillance UAVs. Congress may decide on the justification for new UAV programs based on performance specifications. The chart shows performance specifications of ISR-capable UAVs, with majority having endurance of 4 to 8 hours, altitude of 10,000-20,000 ft, max speeds between 105 and 125 knots, and radiuses of 100 to 150 nm. Critics question the need for multiple UAVs with similar capabilities, suggesting a consolidated inventory of specific models could fulfill the same duties. Critics argue that the necessity of UAVs goes beyond basic performance capabilities and should reflect specific mission needs. Factors such as landing/takeoff capabilities, durability, storage requirements, and cost also play a role. The role of UAVs in combat missions has increased significantly in recent years, with the first public acknowledgment of their use in combat operations in 2002. The use of UAVs for combat operations began in 2002 when a Predator UAV with a Hellfire missile killed Al-Qaeda operatives in Yemen. The UAV combat landscape has evolved with various UAV models being equipped with different munitions for offensive applications. UAVs offer the advantage of attacking targets without risking flight crew. The cost and effectiveness of using UAVs for combat operations compared to manned aircraft must be carefully considered. The MQ-9 Predator B costs $11.7 million, while the F-16 Falcon costs $35.5 million. The F-16 can carry four times the payload of the Predator B, making the cost per pound of munitions delivered lower for the F-16. The cost per pound of munitions delivered is $4,680 for the Predator and $3,302 for the F-16. The F-16 is a versatile combat aircraft that can perform missions the Predator B cannot. Manned aircraft may be more cost-effective for air-to-ground combat, while UAVs may be more valuable in niche circumstances. UAVs are useful for electronic attack and psychological operations. UAVs like the Army's Shadow and Coast Guard's Eagle Eye are being studied for delivering medical supplies and monitoring coastal waters for homeland defense and security. Congressional support exists for using UAVs such as the Predator for border security. Several members in a Services Committee hearing discussed the use of UAVs for domestic missions, such as law enforcement surveillance and security roles like following trucks with hazardous cargo. Interest is growing in utilizing UAVs for various non-defense purposes. The development of high-altitude instruments to measure radiation in the atmosphere is ongoing. The GoldenEye 100 UAV is a cost-effective option for medium-range transport and could be used by local law enforcement during civil unrest. UAVs may also be utilized in sparsely populated areas to search for forest fires and assist in disaster relief efforts. Countries like South Korea and Japan have been using UAVs for agricultural purposes for decades. Korea and Japan have utilized UAVs for agricultural purposes for years. UAV advocates emphasize the need for FAA regulations to align with homeland security goals. The FAA recently granted the Air Force authorization for national airspace operations, marking progress in reconciling safety requirements for UAVs. The FAA's Unmanned Aircraft Systems Working Group will collaborate with the Department of Defense to enhance UAV collision-avoidance capabilities and ensure safe UAV operations in the national airspace. Integration of UAVs into the airspace may face challenges, as highlighted in a 2004 Defense Science Board study urging unencumbered access for UAVs. NASA's decision to cancel funding for Access 5, a partnership to integrate UAVs into the national airspace system, has raised concerns among UAV advocates. They believe this move could hinder the development of UAVs and their global applications, including potentially taking on aerial refueling tasks currently performed by tanker aircraft. The DOD has not expressed plans for exploring the aerial refueling role, but it appears to be a mission well suited for unmanned aircraft. The flight profiles of KC-10 and KC-135 aircraft are relatively benign, operating far from enemy air defenses. The refueling crew's primary job is to keep the aircraft flying straight, level, and at a steady speed. The Global Hawk's trans-oceanic flights in 2001 demonstrate the ability of current UAVs to perform missions similar to aerial refueling. The DOD is experimenting with outfitting UAVs for air-to-air combat missions. A Predator engaged in air-to-air combat with an Iraqi fighter aircraft, launching a Stinger missile before being shot down. This marks a significant step towards UAVs performing challenging aerial combat missions. The recent Predator launch of an air-to-air missile is a significant development in the mission for manned aircraft to perform. UAV advocates are encouraged by this, but there are debates on whether UAVs are always the best choice for new roles. Other options like manned aircraft, blimps, and space satellites also have advantages and disadvantages. The OSD's 2005 UAS Roadmap includes a section on lighter-than-air blimps and tethered \"aerostat\" platforms, which are important for various roles such as psychological operations, missile spotting, and border monitoring. These platforms can offer similar services to border surveillance UAVs but with lower operational costs due to reduced fuel dependency. However, they lack maneuverability and speed compared to UAVs like the Global Hawk. Major UAV manufacturers aim to develop operational lighter-than-air systems capable of floating for months at 70,000 feet altitude and carrying 4,000 pounds of payload. The goal of major UAV manufacturers is to develop an operational system by 2010 for homeland security missions. Space satellites offer benefits but can be cumbersome to task and have limited capacity. Some lack the loitering capability of UAVs like Global Hawk, which are being considered for communication relays due to high space launch costs. Critics of mass UAV production warn that a reliance on unmanned vehicles degrades pilot skills and takes away the tactical flexibility and adaptability that manned aircraft bring to combat operations. Deputy Secretary of Defense Wolfowitz stated that an Air Force F-15 pilot had to be persuaded to forego flying aircraft from the ground. The Air Force is encouraging rated pilots to fly UAVs by offering incentives such as plum assignments and allowing them to maintain manned flying hours. This shift in mindset aims to redefine the role of piloting UAVs as a major mission and retain skilled pilots in the force. The impact of DoD's UAV programs on recruitment and retention is complex and varies among the services. While the Army is facing recruitment challenges, the Air Force and Navy are actively reducing their number of uniformed personnel. The potential decrease in enlistments due to increased UAV use may not have the expected impact. The Air Force requires Predator and Global Hawk operators to be pilot-rated officers, while other services do not have this requirement. This eliminates competition between manned and unmanned aircraft for pilots. Some individuals enlist in the military specifically to operate UAVs due to physical limitations or lack of interest in flying manned aircraft. The Air Force believes that operating UAVs, especially armed ones, may attract personnel who are interested in flying but prefer to avoid the hardships of manned aircraft deployments. Flying UAVs from control stations in the United States could be appealing to Reservists and Guardsmen. The Air Force believes that operating UAVs, especially armed ones, may attract personnel who are interested in flying but prefer to avoid the hardships of manned aircraft deployments. UAVs that are pre-programmed and operate autonomously do not require a pilot. The Air Force maintains that their UAVs are more technologically and operationally sophisticated than others, requiring a trained pilot for effective employment. As UAV autonomy matures, personnel issues may lead to a review by Congress. If the Air Force faces more issues, Congress may review the policy of requiring pilot-rated officers to operate UAVs. Increased use of UAVs could attract more enlistment in other specialties if they are seen as effective. Congress deals with defense industrial base issues, including concerns about U.S. industry dependence on foreign suppliers and foreign competitors receiving government subsidies. The Defense Department's pursuit of UAVs raises concerns about the defense industrial base, including dependence on foreign suppliers, competition with foreign subsidized firms, and potential impact on manned aircraft programs. Congress may need to consider steps to promote competition, discourage consolidation, and protect critical technologies for national defense. The pursuit of UAVs by the Defense Department raises concerns about the defense industrial base, with debates on the future of manned combat aircraft programs and the shift towards advanced UAV production. Some argue that the U.S. should protect its ability to produce world-class combat aircraft, while others believe that the industry is naturally evolving towards UAVs. There are concerns about the potential atrophy of the manned industrial base and the demand for tactical manned aircraft in the future. Some proponents argue that focusing solely on unmanned aircraft design could lead to the loss of crucial skills and technologies in tactical manned aircraft, potentially weakening U.S. dominance in this area. They believe that UAVs, while effective, are unlikely to replace manned aircraft soon. Others disagree, stating that there is commonality between manned and unmanned combat aircraft design, minimizing the risk to manned aircraft skills. Unmanned combat aircraft require stealthy airframes, advanced avionics, and high-performance engines like manned aircraft. Major defense contractors are shifting to unmanned aircraft design to stay competitive due to UAVs playing a prominent role in warfare. Skills and technologies for building manned aircraft can be applied to unmanned aviation design. Companies like Boeing are looking towards unmanned aircraft design after losing out in recent aviation contracts. Boeing and other major defense contractors are shifting towards unmanned aircraft design to stay competitive in the global UAV market. Northrop Grumman Corp. has established a new business unit to aggressively pursue UAV business. The global UAV market is growing rapidly, with an estimated doubling of expenditures from $2.1 billion in 2005 to $5 billion in 2014. Maintaining a healthy U.S. defense industrial base depends on how well U.S. firms compete for UAV contracts. Global UAV expenditures doubled from $2.1 billion in 2005 to $5 billion in 2014. The UAV market is projected to continue growing, with new business opportunities emerging. U.S. companies need to capture this market share to prevent competitors from countries like Europe, Russia, Israel, China, or South Africa from taking over. Industrial expertise in UAV technology areas such as autonomous flight and control of multiple vehicles is crucial for success in this market. The global growth of UAVs presents policy concerns regarding proliferation and export controls. Congress has expressed concerns about UAV and cruise missile proliferation due to difficulties in controlling their components. The global growth of UAVs raises concerns about proliferation and export controls. Many believe it is easy to divert aviation technology into covert UAV programs, making them accessible to countries or non-state actors. UAVs, if armed, are seen as cost-effective weapons, posing challenges for defense against these threats. The global growth of UAVs raises concerns about proliferation and export controls. Cruise missiles and UAVs could become the \"poor man's air force,\" with fears about their military effectiveness in the wrong hands. Foreign companies are gaining access to technologies that could enhance UAV capabilities, prompting policymakers to monitor potential exports of stealth technologies. Policy makers may need to address policy issues related to potential UAV proliferation and its consequences, ensuring that U.S. companies' pursuit of international UAV export success does not lead to the dissemination of critical UAV technologies. The balance between supporting military aid to U.S. allies, including UAVs, and concerns about UAV proliferation is a key issue. UAVs used for ISR can help identify enemy combatants and reduce collateral damage. Policymakers must consider the potential risks of enemy acquisition of UAVs and their use against the U.S., and may need to revise non-proliferation accords like the MTCR. The section addresses the status and funding of prominent UAV programs pursued by the DoD, without providing a comprehensive survey or classification system for different types of UAVs. The subsection \"Small UAVs\" discusses man-portable UAVs with short range and loiter time, not weaponized. These UAVs lack detailed cost documentation compared to major programs like Predator or Global Hawk. While popular with ground forces, they may compete for congressional attention and funding with larger UAV programs. The MQ-1 Predator, developed by General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, is a highly recognizable UAV with integrated surveillance and armament capabilities. It has received increased funding and accelerated development due to its success in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Predator has also paved the way for the development of other related UAVs for various missions. The MQ-1 Predator, developed by General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, is a medium-altitude, long-endurance UAV with long, thin wings and a tail like an inverted \"V\". It typically operates at 10,000 to 15,000 feet, with the ability to reach a maximum altitude of 25,000 feet. Each vehicle can stay on station for 24 hours over 500 nautical miles away from its base. The Air Force's Predator fleet is operated by the 11th Reconnaissance Squadron in Nevada. The MQ-1 Predator is a UAV used for reconnaissance and target acquisition. It is equipped with surveillance payloads including electro-optical and infrared cameras. The Predator is operated by the 11th Reconnaissance Squadron in Nevada and will soon be based at Indian Springs. The CIA also operates Predators for missions. The Predator UAV is equipped with a turret and Multi-Spectral Targeting System for tracking moving targets. It also has synthetic aperture radar for seeing through weather conditions and satellite communications for beyond line-of-sight operations. In 2001, it was upgraded to carry two Hellfire missiles for engaging targets directly. The MQ-9 Predator, or \"Predator B\", is General Atomic's follow-on to the MQ-1, or \"Predator A\". It is equipped with anti-tank ordinance for precision attacks on time-sensitive targets, controlled by a pilot on the ground using a joystick. The Air Force changed the Predator's military designation to MQ-1 for multi-mission capabilities. The Predator B is an upgraded version of the Predator A, designed for surveillance, target acquisition, and armed engagement. It is longer and has a larger wingspan, with a more powerful engine that allows it to reach higher altitudes, faster speeds, longer endurance, and a greater range. The Predator B has a maximum range of 2000 nautical miles and upgraded ordinance capacity, able to carry up to 16 Hellfire missiles or a mix of other weapons. Raytheon has also developed a mini-UAV called \"Silent Eyes\" to be launched from the Predator B for target identification. The Predator B-Extended Range, also known as \"Mariner,\" is a hybrid UAV created by General Atomics for the Navy's BAMS program. It combines the airframe of the Predator B with the 86 ft. wing from NASA's Altair UAV, increasing fuel capacity for extended range surveillance missions at altitudes of 50,000 feet with a flight endurance of 49 hours. General Atomic's Mariner UAV, developed for the Navy's BAMS program, features a maritime radar integrated by Lockheed Martin System and Sensors. It aims to compete with Northrop Grumman's Global Hawk, with a potential flyaway cost of $19 million per vehicle. Additionally, General Atomics is working on a third-generation Predator C with a turbo-jet engine for long-endurance, high-altitude surveillance missions. The Predator C, developed by General Atomics, is designed for long-endurance, high-altitude surveillance missions. It will use the fuselage of the Predator B but will have similar payload capacity and flight performance to Northrop Grumman's Global Hawk. The Predator C is not meant to directly compete with the Global Hawk. The I-Gnat-ER, used by the Army as a gap-filler for the RQ-5 Hunter, is described as a downsized version of the Predator UAV. The I-Gnat-ER, a reconnaissance platform manufactured by General Atomic Aeronautical Systems, is an upgraded version of the Gnat-750. It has similar characteristics to the MQ-1 Predator A but can stay aloft for 30 hours, lacks SAR and BLOS capabilities, and has a shorter flight radius. The Army owns three I-Gnat vehicles for ER/MP CONOPS development. The Army is set to receive I-Gnat UAVs equipped with SATCOM data links, MTS sensor/target designators, and Hellfire missiles by the end of 2005. The Predator UAV program includes four air vehicles, a ground control station, and a Predator Primary Satellite Link. The cost for a Predator A system in FY2005 was $18.0 million, while a Predator B system cost $46.8 million. The Air Force currently has 57 deployable MQ-1 Predators and 12 systems. The Air Force has 57 deployable MQ-1 Predators and 12 systems. The inventory of MQ-9 Predator Bs is currently at six vehicles, with plans to increase to 46 by the end of FY2011. Recent developments suggest that both Predators will remain valuable assets. Air Force Chief of Staff General John Jumper expressed the intention to maximize production of Predators. The Air Force aims to avoid logistical issues by carefully managing the initial operation capability of the Predator B. The Air Force has delayed the initial operation capability of the Predator B from FY2006 to FY2009 to ensure proper training, support, and operation strategies are in place. Congressional funding for Predator R&D and procurement was increased in FY2005 and FY2006, with Senate support for integrating \"Viper Strike\" munitions. See Table 7 for complete budget details. The Pioneer UAV, developed by Israeli Aircraft Industries, has served the Navy, Army, and Marine Corps for nearly twenty years since its acquisition by the U.S. Navy in 1986. It was jointly manufactured by Aircraft Armaments Incorporated and IAI for the military branches. The Pioneer UAV, acquired by the U.S. Navy in 1986, was used by the Navy, Marine Corps, and Army. It was employed during Operation Desert Storm in 1991 for reconnaissance and gun spotting missions. The Navy ended its use in FY2002, passing assets to the Marine Corps, which plans to use the RQ-2 until 2010 or until a VTUAV is ready. The Pioneer is known for its durability and performance upgrades, with the Marine Corps calling it \"Old Reliable.\" At 14 feet long, it is smaller than the Air Force's MQ-1 Predator A UAV. The Pioneer UAV, acquired by the U.S. Navy in 1986, is known for its durability and performance upgrades. It is roughly half the size of the Air Force's MQ-1 Predator A UAV, with a maximum altitude of 15,000 feet and a flight range of 100 nautical miles. The propeller-driven SF-350 piston engine allows the Pioneer to stay aloft for up to five hours. It can take off using rocket-assisted takeoff, a catapult launcher, or traditional runway takeoff, and can land on a runway or be recovered using a retrieval net. Since 1986, the Pioneer has flown over 36,500 hours in support of Navy and Marine Corps operations. The Pioneer UAV, acquired by the U.S. Navy in 1986, is known for its durability and performance upgrades. It has flown over 36,500 hours in support of Navy and Marine Corps operations, with a mission to provide real-time intelligence and reconnaissance capabilities. The 75 lb payload includes a combined E-O/IR camera, with additional payloads for meteorological, mine detection, and chemical detection sensors. The Navy had planned to retire the Pioneer in 2004 but gave all systems to the Marine Corps after discontinuing the replacement program. The U.S. Navy acquired the Pioneer UAV in 1986 known for its durability and performance upgrades. After discontinuing the program, the Navy transferred all Pioneer systems to the Marine Corps. The Marine Corps plans to keep the Pioneer UAVs flying for another 10 years through a product improvement program. Current procurement funds focus on post-production support, with FY2005 and FY2006 requests for upgrade kits only. The final year of production cost $17.2 million in FY2004 dollars for the system, which includes five vehicles, a ground control station, and launch/recovery devices. The Marine Corps currently operates 35 Pioneer UAVs. The Marine Corps currently operates 35 Pioneer UAVs, with Northrop Grumman's RQ-4 Global Hawk being the largest and most expensive UAV in operation for the Department of Defense. The Global Hawk has advanced surveillance capabilities that are crucial for future ISR missions. The RQ-4 Global Hawk, a crucial UAV for ISR missions, faces challenges in development due to cost concerns. Pentagon officials and Congressional members are slowing progress until program controls are in place. The Global Hawk is a large UAV, similar in size to a medium corporate jet, flying at high altitudes with advanced surveillance capabilities. The Global Hawk UAV can fly at high altitudes for long durations, covering long distances and monitoring large areas. Originally designed for autonomous operation, it now requires frequent intervention by remote operators. The RQ-4B model has a larger airframe compared to the RQ-4A. The RQ-4B model of the Global Hawk UAV has a larger airframe, with increased length and wingspan, allowing it to carry an extra 1000 lbs of surveillance payload. It provides persistent high-quality imagery for military commanders in surveillance and interdiction operations. The RQ-4B Global Hawk UAV has an integrated suite of sensors larger than the Predator, including SAR, MTI, E-O digital camera, and IR sensor. Northrop Grumman expanded the payload to make it a multi-intelligence air vehicle, with open-system architecture for multiple payloads like SIGINT and ELINT sensors. The MP-RTIP payload will be added to enhance radar capabilities. The Global Hawk UAV's payload will be expanded to increase radar capabilities, enabling operators to eavesdrop on radio transmissions and identify enemy radar from high altitudes. Future plans include adding hyper-spectral sensors for improved imagery precision and incorporating laser communications for enhanced information transfer. The ultimate goal is to create a UAV that works with space-based sensors to prevent enemies from establishing tactical surprises. In August 2003, the Federal Aviation Administration granted the Global Hawk authorization to fly in U.S. civilian airspace, expanding its mission potential. The Global Hawk UAV, developed by Northrop Grumman Corporation, has diverse surveillance capabilities and is considered for anti-drug smuggling and Coast Guard operations. It is expected to reach initial operational capability in 2006 and the Air Force plans to acquire 51 Global Hawks at a cost of $6.6 billion. The Air Force plans to acquire 51 Global Hawks at a cost of $6.6 billion. The program has experienced cost overruns due to the need for more sophisticated surveillance capabilities. The Air Force's acquisition of Global Hawks has seen cost overruns of nearly $900 million since 2001. Concerns over rising costs and mismanagement have led to a debate on the development strategy. The FY2005 Defense Authorization Bill criticized the Air Force for not using authorized funds for a counter-drug surveillance program. The Air Force diverted $18 million from a counter-drug demonstration fund in 2001 to the Global Hawk development program. This led to cuts in the R&D request for the Global Hawk, with the final appropriation bill reducing it by $6 million. In 2004, the House Appropriations Committee expressed concerns over the Air Force's development strategy, resulting in cuts to the president's budget request for advanced procurement by $21.3 million and current year procurement by $89.86 million. One RQ-4A was transferred to the Navy for FY2005 due to the procurement cut. In 2004, the House Appropriations Committee expressed concerns over the Air Force's development strategy, resulting in cuts to the president's budget request for advanced procurement by $21.3 million and current year procurement by $89.86 million. One RQ-4A was transferred to the Navy for FY2005. In December 2004, Michael Wynne emphasized that DoD would not purchase UAVs that cost as much as manned aircraft of equivalent capabilities. The Air Force planned to restructure the Global Hawk program in early 2005 to address increasing costs. The House Appropriations Committee cut the President's FY2006 procurement request for Global Hawk by $110 million and increased R&D funding by $21 million. Final appropriations and authorizations are pending Senate approval. Global Hawk was originally developed for a joint U.S. Army/Navy/Marine Corps UAV program. The Hunter system, developed by Northrop Grumman for the U.S. Army/Navy/Marine Corps, is a key unmanned platform used for tactical ISR in various ground operations. The Army initially planned to acquire 52 Hunter systems but faced program disruptions. Despite canceling full-rate production of the RQ-5A in 1996, the Army continued to use the seven systems already produced. It later acquired 18 MQ-5B Hunter IIs with improved endurance and the ability to carry anti-tank munitions. The Hunter system, developed by Northrop Grumman for the U.S. Army/Navy/Marine Corps, is used for tactical ISR in ground operations. The RQ-5A and MQ-5B variants are operated by different military intelligence battalions. The RQ-5A can fly at altitudes up to 15,000 feet, reach speeds of 106 knots, and stay airborne for up to 12 hours. The MQ-5B has an elongated wingspan of 34.3 feet and a more powerful engine, allowing it to stay airborne for three extra hours. The Hunter II has a High-Fuel Engine, enabling it to stay airborne for three extra hours and reach altitudes of 18,000 feet. The Army has used the Hunter system for surveillance and reconnaissance missions, but has also explored weaponization for tactical operations and border surveillance. The Hunter primarily uses a gimbaled E-O/IR sensor payload for ISR functions, with potential for new sensor technology showcased in 2003. The Hunter II is set to receive an advanced software architecture to ease integration of future payloads and extend its service-life. Northrop Grumman tested various munitions for the Hunter payload, with the Viper Strike precision guided munitions being the weapon of choice. This allows the Hunter to provide accurate strikes at targets that elude the Hellfire missile. The Army has halted production on the RQ-5 Hunter UAV and now uses the I-Gnat-ER to fill service gaps. All 32 Hunter UAVs are still operational and receive upgrades. The Hunter system includes eight aircraft, ground control systems, and support devices. In FY2004, a Hunter system cost $26.5 million. No funds were allocated for the procurement or R&D of any RQ-5 system in FY2005 and FY2006. The Army awarded General Atomic's Warrior UAV the contract for the Extended Range-Multi Purpose (ER-MP) UAV program over the Hunter II in August 2005. Despite the loss, Northrop Grumman plans to market the Hunter II to other services. The RQ-7 Shadow was selected by the Army for its tactical unmanned aerial vehicle (TUAV) program after a two-decade search for a suitable system. The Navy explored various UAVs for the TUAV program, including the cancelled RQ-6 Outrider system. The Army selected the RQ-7 Shadow for its tactical unmanned aerial vehicle program in 1997, after considering other alternatives. Built by AAI Corporation, the Shadow has a range of 68 nautical miles and an average flight duration of five hours. It has become the primary airborne ISR tool for Army units worldwide and is expected to remain in service through the decade. The RQ-7 Shadow UAV has a maximum altitude of 14,000 feet but operates best at 8,000 feet. It is launched from a rail-launcher and has automatic takeoff and landing capabilities. The upgraded RQ-7B version has a larger wingspan and fuel capacity, allowing for two extra hours of flight time. The Shadow provides real-time reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition information to the Army at the brigade level. It is being considered for a medical resupply mission. The Army is considering expanding the RQ-7 Shadow UAV's missions to include medical roles such as delivering blood, vaccines, and fluid infusion systems to troops via parachute. Unlike the RQ-5 Hunter, the Shadow will not have weapons capabilities. Its payload includes an E-O/IR sensor turret for surveillance and real-time data relay to ground stations. As part of the Army's Future Combat System plans, the Shadow will be equipped with the Tactical Common Data Link to network with battalion commanders and other air vehicles. The Army maintains an inventory of 100 Shadow UAVs at various military bases and National Guard units. The program cost for a Shadow UAV system reached $16.4 million in FY2005. The Army plans to use the Shadow as the interim Class III TUAV for the future combat systems project. The Army plans to use the Shadow UAV as the interim Class III TUAV for the future combat systems project. In FY2005, the Army procured eight TUAV systems and requested $26 million for retrofitting the existing Shadow fleet. Total RDT&E requests were $53.6 million in FY2005 and $139.6 million in FY2006. Funding for the Shadow UAV system reached $16.4 million in FY2005. In the mid-1990s, the Pentagon developed two separate Unmanned Aerial Combat Vehicles (UCAV) programs for combat missions, one for the Air Force and one for the Navy. The Air Force favored Boeing's X-45, while the Navy had Northrop Grumman's X-47 Pegasus and Boeing's X-46. In June 2003, the programs were merged to create the Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems (J-UCAS) project managed by DARPA, aiming to establish a flexible offensive network integrating air and ground elements. The Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems (J-UCAS) project aims to create a flexible offensive network integrating air and ground elements. DARPA was ordered to transfer administration of J-UCAS resources to the Air Force in 2004. The program will maintain competition between Boeing and Northrop Grumman's vehicles. J-UCAS consists of two variants from the Navy and Air Force's previous programs. The X-45C, part of the J-UCAS project, is a hybrid of previous Navy and Air Force programs. It has a length of 39 feet, a wingspan of 49 feet, and is powered by a General Electric turbojet engine. Capable of speeds up to 450 knots and altitudes of 40,000 feet, the X-45C can stay aloft for seven hours and operate at a range of 1,200 nautical miles. Boeing focused on maximizing stealth capabilities with the arrowhead design. The X-45C, part of the J-UCAS project, has a length of 39 feet, a wingspan of 49 feet, and is powered by a General Electric turbojet engine. It can reach speeds up to 450 knots and altitudes of 40,000 feet, with a range of 1,200 nautical miles. The UAV system features an arrowhead design for stealth capabilities. The X-47B, a competitor to the X-45C, has a larger wingspan of 62 feet, allowing for an endurance of nine hours and a range of 1,600 nautical miles. The X-47B also has folding wing-tips for storage aboard. The X-47B has folding wing-tips for carrier storage and a common operating system for Air Force and Naval technology. The Air Force's X-45 focuses on enemy air defense suppression, while the Navy's UCAV is for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. The X-45 and X-47B UCAVs are designed for armed intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. They will have internal weapons bays and carry guided weapons like the GBU-31 JDAM. Both will feature SARs, ESM sensor suites, GMTI, and the X-47B will have an E-O/IR camera for enhanced surveillance. The UCAV programs have undergone changes in administration and organization, affecting development pace. In 2003, the Air Force and Navy's projects were combined under the DARPA-controlled J-UCAS program for interoperability. DARPA hired Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory to promote cooperation. The Office of the Secretary of Defense instructed the Air Force to take action, seen as an abrupt reversal by observers. The Office of the Secretary of Defense instructed the Air Force to take control over the J-UCAS project, leading to management fluctuations. The development of combat UAVs has progressed through spiral development. The current J-UCAS aircraft inventory includes two X-45A and one X-47A air vehicles, with plans for three X-45Cs and X-47Bs by the end of 2006. Operational flight assessments are expected to start in 2007. The total spending on the program exceeded $1.45 billion in RDT&E funding. The FireScout, initially designed for the Navy, was revived by the Army in 2003 as the interim Class IV UAV. Despite the Navy canceling production in 2001, the Army's interest led to renewed funding. The total spending on the program prior to FY2006 exceeded $1.45 billion in RDT&E funding. The Army's interest in the Class IV UAV led to renewed funding for the Fire Scout, making it DoD's first joint UAV helicopter. Recent efforts have explored arming the Fire Scout and adding new mission capabilities. Designed based on a commercial helicopter, the Fire Scout features a four-blade rotor design to reduce acoustic signature and can stay aloft for up to 9.5 hours with a full sensor payload. The Fire Scout UAV can stay airborne for up to 9.5 hours, but this endurance decreases to around six hours with a full sensor payload. It has autonomous flight capabilities and a surveillance payload including a laser designator, IR camera, and multi-color EO camera. The vehicle currently has line-of-sight communication data links, with plans to expand to wideband data relay and satellite communications. The Fire Scout UAV is being considered for armament with rockets and missiles for strike missions. Future missions may include border patrol, search and rescue, medical resupply, and submarine spotting. Currently, five RQ-8A air vehicles and four ground stations are in the developmental testing phase. The Fire Scout UAV is in the testing phase of the acquisition process for low-rate-initial-production vehicles. The Army and Navy plan to have a future inventory of 192 vehicles. The Army aims for full-rate production by 2008 and IOC by 2010. The Fire Scout will be used by the Army for the Future Combat System program and by the Navy to support the Littoral Combat Ship class. Funding for the Fire Scout is spread across various Navy and Army programs. The Coast Guard selected Bell Helicopter Textron's TR911D Eagle Eye tiltrotor UAV for its Deepwater Modernization program. The $3 million Eagle Eye can take off vertically like a helicopter and fly like a plane by tilting its rotors. The Coast Guard plans to acquire 69 vehicles to enhance surveillance capabilities for patrolling the U.S. coastline. The Eagle Eye can transmit video and infrared images to cutters and command centers, aiding in monitoring drug smugglers, refugees, and distressed ships. Lockheed Martin's Force Protection Aerial Surveillance System (FPASS), also known as the Desert Hawk, is a battery-operated UAV used by the Air Force for airbase defense in Iraq and Afghanistan. It monitors the perimeter to prevent enemy incursions or terrorist attacks. Marine Corps officials are interested in the Eagle Eye UAV as a potential replacement for the RQ-2 Pioneer due to its superior performance capabilities. The Desert Hawk, a battery-operated UAV developed in 1999 for U.S. Central Command, is used for area surveillance, patrols, and aerial spotting. It is launched by a shoulder-mounted slingshot, flies preprogrammed paths for up to one hour, and lands through a controlled crash. The simple design allows for on-the-job repairs with tape or glue. The Desert Hawk is a battery-operated UAV used for area surveillance, patrols, and aerial spotting. It can fly preprogrammed paths for up to one hour and lands through a controlled crash. The Air Force has 126 Desert Hawks, each costing approximately $300,000. Dragon Eye is a backpack-carried UAV providing reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition capabilities with twin propellers and two camera ports. Dragon Eye is a UAV with autonomous GPS navigation, capable of supporting various cameras. It has a compact design, 45-minute endurance, and can travel up to 2.5 nautical miles. Low-rate initial production started in 2001, with full-rate production of 300 systems awarded to AeroVironment after a 2003 assessment. Each system includes three air vehicles and one ground station. The FY2006 Marine Corps procurement budget request anticipated the current unit cost per Dragon Eye system as $154,000. The FQM-151 Pointer is a short range reconnaissance and battlefield surveillance UAV developed by AeroVironment, currently in service in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF). It has a flight endurance of two hours and features a 9-foot wingspan, weighing nearly 8.5 lbs. The Pointer is part of a system of two air vehicles and a ground control unit, which decreases its portability. The Pointer system consists of two air vehicles and a ground control unit, requiring two personnel for transportation. The UAV carries either an IR or daytime E-O sensor and is used for short-range ISR by the Air Force and Special Operations Command. AeroVironment is developing the Puma as the successor to the Pointer, with an expected endurance of four hours and the ability to carry E-O and IR cameras simultaneously. The Raven, developed by AeroVironment, is a smaller and lighter version of the Pointer UAV. It is used for reconnaissance, sniper spotting, and surveillance scouting by Army and SOCOM personnel. The Raven is hand-launched and powered by an electric battery, providing 90 minutes of flight time. Deployed soldiers carry four batteries for recharging. The Raven UAV, developed by AeroVironment, is equipped with four auxiliary batteries that can be easily charged in a Humvee. It lands via a controlled crash, with a Kevlar-plated body for protection. The system allows for quick training of soldiers in-theater and can be deployed in different aircraft configurations. The Army, SOCOM, and Air Force have purchased multiple systems. The Silver Fox UAV, developed by Advanced Ceramic Research in collaboration with the Office of Naval Research, is a front propeller drone designed for tactical ISR support. It has a five-foot fuselage, an eight-foot wingspan, and houses both a daylight E-O and micro-IR camera for surveillance. The system costs approximately $250,000 and can achieve flight through a compressed air catapult or by hand. The Silver Fox UAV, developed by ONR and Advanced Ceramic Research Inc., supports U.S. forces in Iraq with undisclosed applications. The Scan Eagle, developed by Boeing, is known for its long endurance and low cost, with a wingspan two and a half times its fuselage length, reaching altitudes of 19,000 feet and flying for almost 20 hours. The Scan Eagle UAV, developed by Boeing and the Insitu Group, has a flight endurance of almost 20 hours and can be autonomously controlled by a ground operator. It uses a pneumatic launcher for takeoff and the Skyhook recovery system for landing. The vehicle is equipped with E-O and IR sensors for force-protection ISR missions for Marine Corps units in Iraq. The UAV's sensor data links have the \"Cursor-on-Target\" feature, allowing interoperability with other legacy UAV systems. The Marine Corps is evaluating two Scan Eagle systems under lease, with each system consisting of eight vehicles. The price of a single Scan Eagle is expected to be around $100,000."
