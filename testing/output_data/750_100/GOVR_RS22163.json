    "content": "The transatlantic partnership between the United States and Europe is based on common values, interests, and goals. Both sides are interdependent in terms of security and prosperity, facing challenges such as economic concerns, terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and armed conflict. They both support democracy, open societies, human rights, and free markets. Close U.S.-European cooperation is seen as essential to addressing a wide array of global issues. The United States and Europe emphasize the importance of cooperation in addressing global concerns together. They have a strong trade relationship and work on shared interests and challenges. U.S. Congress engages with European counterparts on various economic, security, and diplomatic issues. Members of Congress engage directly with European legislators and officials to discuss various topics related to U.S.-European cooperation. They consider the benefits and shortcomings, alignment and divergence, and partnership versus competition. Many support a close transatlantic relationship, viewing the EU, NATO, and a united Europe as advancing U.S. interests, especially during the Cold War. The U.S. Congress and Administrations have supported NATO and the EU, viewing a united Europe as beneficial for countering global challenges. Concerns have arisen when U.S. and European policies conflict, but overall, the Euro-Atlantic community has been successful in promoting prosperity and security in Europe. The relationship between the United States and the EU has been growing in significance, with the EU becoming an important partner for the US due to its common decision-making and policies across various areas. The EU is addressing economic, social, law enforcement, and judicial issues at the institutional level. Efforts are ongoing to strengthen the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP). NATO remains a key security institution in the Euro-Atlantic community, with the US playing a leading role. NATO has evolved significantly since the end of the Cold War, adding 12 new member states from Central and Eastern Europe. Members of Congress maintain a consistent interest in NATO. In 2014, leadership transitions occurred in Euro-Atlantic institutions, with German MEP Martin Schulz reelected as President of the European Parliament. Former Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg replaced. Discussions about NATO's future role and capabilities have been influenced by the conflict in Ukraine and tense relations with Russia. In 2014, leadership transitions occurred in Euro-Atlantic institutions. Jens Stoltenberg replaced Anders Fogh Rasmussen as NATO Secretary General. A new European Commission with 28 commissioners took office for a five-year term. Jean-Claude Juncker became President of the European Commission, Federica Mogherini replaced Catherine Ashton as EU's High Representative, and Donald Tusk became President of the European Council. European perceptions of U.S. foreign policy under the Obama Administration remain favorable, with transatlantic relations constructive over the past six years. Common global challenges have pushed the United States and Europe towards cooperative approaches, despite encountering frustrations and reality checks. The Obama Administration's \"re-balancing\" of U.S. foreign policy towards Asia caused anxiety in Europe, but the crisis in Ukraine has led to a reevaluation of European security. The United States continues to play a leading role in NATO and managing relations with Russia, while expecting Europe to share the burden of its own security amidst U.S. focus on Asia and the Middle East. Europe is expected to share the burden of its own security, take a leading role in regional and international issues, and be an effective partner in addressing common threats. Concerns remain about Europe's economic difficulties, defense spending, military capabilities, and common foreign policy coherence. U.S. officials and Members of Congress evaluating the partnership with Europe face complex challenges. The European financial crisis post-2008 global downturn has exposed unresolved issues in EU integration, causing tensions among member states. Despite some reforms, questions about the future of EU integration persist. The European financial crisis post-2008 global downturn has exposed unresolved issues in EU integration, causing tensions among member states. Basic questions about the future of further EU integration remain unanswered. Anti-establishment backlash among European voters has led to the rise of populist parties advocating far-right and far-left policies, many of which are anti-EU to some degree. The rise of Euro-skeptic parties in European elections, particularly in countries like Greece, Estonia, Finland, Denmark, Portugal, Poland, Spain, and the United Kingdom, has raised concerns about the future of EU integration. The UK elections, in particular, may lead to a national referendum on EU membership, impacting its relationship with the United States. The deteriorating U.S. and European relations with Russia since 2014 have transformed Russia from a strategic partner to a strategic problem. Some advocate for pragmatic cooperation with Russia, while others see it as a growing challenge. Relations between Russia and the West have been tense for over a decade, with resentment over NATO enlargement and conflicts like the 2008 war with Georgia. Despite efforts by the Obama Administration to improve relations through initiatives like the New START treaty, recent Russian actions have hindered progress towards cooperation. Despite initial efforts to improve relations through initiatives like the New START treaty, tensions between the U.S. and Russia persisted due to disagreements over various issues, including Russia's actions in Georgia and its suspension of obligations under the CFE Treaty. Criticism of Russia's elections in 2011-2012 further strained relations, leading to a negative reaction from Moscow when Vladimir Putin returned to the presidency. Russia strongly opposed the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012 and clashed with U.S. and European foreign policy on various issues, including the NATO operation in Libya and the conflict in Syria. The political crisis in Ukraine from late 2013 further strained relations, bringing U.S. and European relations with Russia to a low point. In November 2013, Russia pressured Ukrainian President Yanukovych to halt the EU Association Agreement in exchange for financial incentives. This led to protests, clashes in Kiev, and Yanukovych's ousting in February 2014. US and European leaders supported a new pro-Western government and elections. In February-March 2014, Russian forces seized Crimea, which was subsequently annexed by Russia. The annexation was justified as rectifying a historical transfer from Russia to Ukraine, protecting inhabitants, and responding to the will of the population in Crimea. The referendum and annexation are not recognized by most countries. The annexation of Crimea by Russian forces in 2014 is not recognized by the international community. The conflict in eastern Ukraine has resulted in over 4,300 deaths despite a ceasefire agreement. Western governments accuse Russia of involvement in the conflict. Western governments, including the U.S. and European countries, believe there is clear evidence of Russian military involvement in the conflict in Ukraine, providing direct support to separatists with personnel and heavy weapons. Despite Russian denials, U.S.-European coordination in response to the situation has been strong, with aligned analyses and efforts to maximize influence. The EU and the US have coordinated efforts to impose sanctions on Russia, with the EU expanding sanctions after the MH17 incident. Unlike the US, many European countries have significant economic ties with Russia. EU debates continue over the extent of sanctions. The EU and the US have imposed sanctions on Russia, with EU debates focusing on the economic value and political influence of their relationships with Russia. Despite varying attitudes, all 28 EU member states have unanimously adopted the sanctions as a deterrent to Russia's actions in Ukraine. The EU sanctions on Russia were based on a common assessment by member states, prioritizing a strong message to Russia's leadership over economic concerns. The sanctions package is reviewed monthly, requiring unanimous consensus to overturn it. Russia's economy has been impacted by recession, a weakened ruble, and high inflation, with analysts attributing this to a drop in oil prices and Western sanctions. The impact of Western sanctions on Russia's leadership and foreign policy remains unclear. Speculation about Russia's next steps in eastern Ukraine varies from maintaining a \"frozen conflict\" to seeking de-escalation. A massive Russian invasion is seen as unlikely but not entirely ruled out. EU High Representative Mogherini has expressed concerns about the situation. In January 2015, EU High Representative Mogherini proposed easing sanctions on Russia if they comply with the ceasefire agreement in Ukraine. However, a resurgence of combat in eastern Ukraine led to a backtrack, emphasizing that any proposal depends on Russia's full implementation of the ceasefire agreement. Relations with Russia are expected to remain a central topic as policymakers try to understand Russia's foreign policy intentions. Members of the 114th Congress are monitoring developments related to Russia and Ukraine to discern Russia's foreign policy intentions. They may consider adopting additional sanctions or deterrents and cooperating with European counterparts. Congress may also explore ways to support Ukraine, such as providing non-lethal aid and loans. The U.S. provided $291 million in non-lethal aid and a $1 billion loan guarantee for Ukraine in 2014. Additional support includes $139 million in bilateral assistance and $350 million in military assistance authorized by the Ukraine Freedom Support Act. The Administration has not provided lethal aid to Ukraine yet. The EU has provided over \u20ac11 billion in development assistance and loans to Ukraine between 2014 and 2020. International financial assistance is tied to Ukraine's economic reforms and anti-corruption efforts, sparking debates about NATO's future and impacting U.S. views on European defense issues. The EU has provided significant financial assistance to Ukraine, sparking debates about NATO's future and impacting U.S. views on European defense issues. Russia's actions in Ukraine have led to calls for NATO to focus on collective territorial defense, prompting European countries to increase defense spending and develop military capabilities. The Obama Administration has reassured European allies through the European Reassurance Initiative in response to Russian aggression. The European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) was proposed by President Obama in June 2014 to enhance security in Europe. Congress allocated $810 million for the initiative in December 2014. ERI involves troop rotations to Poland and the Baltic states, pre-positioning military equipment in Eastern Europe, and an increased U.S. military presence in Europe on a rotational basis. There are no plans to permanently increase the number of U.S. military personnel in Europe. The United States plans to increase the number of military personnel in Europe, despite previous plans to close bases. Concerns about declining European defense budgets and a growing military capabilities gap could impact alliance unity. The United States plans to increase military personnel in Europe despite previous base closures. Concerns about declining European defense budgets and a growing military capabilities gap could undermine NATO unity by increasing reliance on U.S. military capacity. European militaries lack key capabilities like strategic air- and sealift, aerial refueling, helicopters, and intelligence. Integration initiatives like NATO's \"Smart Defense\" have had limited success in developing shared capabilities. NATO's relevance post-Cold War depends on its ability to conduct operations. The 2010 NATO summit adopted the latest Strategic Concept, emphasizing three core tasks: collective defense, crisis management, and cooperative security. NATO's primary role is ensuring collective defense and security, with a focus on developing capabilities for expeditionary operations. The 2010 NATO summit adopted the latest Strategic Concept, emphasizing collective defense, crisis management, and cooperative security. Member states are urged to develop capabilities for expeditionary operations and address new security challenges like terrorism, weapons proliferation, cybersecurity, and energy security. However, concerns exist about public opposition, political will, and resource shortages hindering Europe's willingness to engage in large-scale overseas missions. The security outlook in many European countries has shifted towards increased vigilance. The security outlook in many European countries has shifted due to increased perceptions of the threat posed by Russia. Some officials in countries like Poland and the Baltic states have called for permanent basing of U.S. and NATO forces. The European Reassurance Initiative includes rotating forces, increased exercises, and pre-positioning of assets to bolster security. NATO has tripled the number of fighter aircraft for the Baltic Air Policing mission. At NATO's 2014 Summit in Wales, member countries agreed to a \"Readiness Action Plan\" for enhanced defense measures in Central and Eastern Europe, including a new Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF) capable of rapid deployment. At NATO's 2014 Summit in Wales, member countries agreed to a \"Readiness Action Plan\" for enhanced defense measures in Central and Eastern Europe, including a new Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF) of about 4,000 soldiers with air, maritime, and special operations support. Allied leaders also pledged to increase defense spending to 2% of national GDP within a decade. Tensions between the EU and Russia have raised concerns about European energy security due to the region's heavy reliance on natural gas imports. The EU is heavily reliant on Russia for gas imports and energy supplies, with expectations of increased dependence in the next 20 years. Russia has used energy supplies as leverage in foreign policy, acquiring ownership of European energy infrastructure without applying Western standards of transparency and reciprocity. Many U.S. officials and Members of Congress are concerned about European energy security due to Russia's lack of transparency and market reciprocity in business practices and investment policies. The possibility of gas cutoffs, similar to past disputes between Russia and Ukraine, has raised alarm for countries dependent on Russian natural gas. The influence of Russian energy dominance on transatlantic unity is also a worry for the United States. Europe faces challenges in diversifying its energy supply, with North Africa and Central Asia seen as potential alternative sources. Political and economic instability in North Africa hinders its role as a gas supplier, while Central Asia's supply is reliant on new pipeline construction. Europe has faced challenges in diversifying its energy supply, with a focus on new pipelines and renewable energy. European leaders aim to develop a common energy strategy and integrate the internal energy market. European countries have taken steps to enhance energy security by expanding grids and pipelines, including LNG terminals and pipeline interconnectivity. There is a proposal for an EU \"energy union\" to centralize natural gas purchases for all members. The EU is considering an energy union to centralize natural gas purchases for member states and introduce solidarity mechanisms for supply disruptions. Legislation has been adopted to increase competition and transparency in the energy sector, which has led to criticism from Russia and the cancellation of the South Stream project. In December 2014, Russia canceled the South Stream project, a pipeline intended to transport gas to Europe, citing EU bureaucratic obstacles and criticism of its actions in Ukraine. This move was seen as a way to abandon a costly project and Russia is now focusing on diversifying its markets by partnering with China for pipeline construction. The United States and Europe are concerned about the emergence and expansion of the Islamic State (IS) terrorist organization in Iraq and Syria. The US is leading a coalition to combat IS through military action and targeting their financial support. NATO member countries have participated in coalition airstrikes against IS in Iraq. European countries have provided assistance to Iraqi forces in the fight against IS, including trainers, advisers, weapons, and humanitarian aid. However, European military action against IS has been limited to Iraq due to political and legal challenges in Syria. European policymakers are concerned about the civil war in Syria, where over 191,000 people have died since 2011. The EU has been vocal in condemning the Assad government, alongside the United States. The EU has imposed sanctions on the Assad government and recognized the Syrian National Coalition as the legitimate representative of the Syrian people. They have provided non-lethal equipment, humanitarian aid, and training to opposition forces. The January 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris heightened concerns about Europe's vulnerability to terrorism. Authorities conducted raids to break up an Islamic State-linked terrorist cell in Belgium. Analysts and European governments are worried about \"foreign fighters,\" European citizens or residents of Muslim background traveling to Syria or Iraq to join the group. Recent estimates from Europol suggest that 3,000 to 5,000 individuals from Europe and other Western countries have engaged in conflicts in Syria and Iraq. Concerns arise about these fighters returning home with extremist views and the intention of carrying out terrorist attacks in Europe. Countries of origin include Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, the Balkans, and Russia. Some experts question the widespread threat of returning foreign fighters carrying out terrorist attacks in Europe. European governments are taking security measures such as increasing surveillance, combating recruitment, and prohibiting travel. Authorities in EU countries have arrested individuals suspected of planning to travel to Syria or recruiting others, detained returning fighters under laws, and confiscated passports to prevent travel to conflict zones. European governments are taking security measures to prevent foreign fighters from traveling to conflict zones, including confiscating passports and detaining returning fighters. However, challenges remain in tracking and preventing the flow of European fighters to Syria and Iraq due to differing views among EU member states on issues such as intelligence-sharing and data privacy. The Paris attacks have led to new debates on enhancing security and surveillance powers in the EU, particularly regarding the creation of an EU airline passenger name record system. Transatlantic cooperation on counterterrorism has been strong since 9/11. Transatlantic cooperation on counterterrorism has been strong since the 9/11 attacks. U.S. and European officials maintain regular dialogues on homeland security and counterterrorism issues. Agreements on extradition, mutual legal assistance, container security, and airline passenger data sharing have been reached to strengthen aviation, transport, and border security. The United States and the EU collaborate to track and counter terrorism financing through forums like the Financial Action Task Force. The EU and US collaborate on counterterrorism through forums like the Financial Action Task Force and the U.S.-EU \"SWIFT agreement,\" allowing access to financial data for the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program. Bilateral intelligence sharing is also crucial in disrupting terrorist plots. European policymakers have concerns about data adequacy. European policy makers have concerns over data privacy safeguards in U.S.-EU information-sharing arrangements, leading to delays in adopting agreements. Negotiations for a Data Privacy and Protection Agreement have been ongoing since 2011. The EU views data privacy as a fundamental right and has strict regulations in place. The United States and the EU have worked to align their lists of designated terrorist entities over the past decade. In July 2013, the EU added Hezbollah's military wing to its terrorist list, aligning with the United States. However, critics argue that listing only the military wing is insufficient as Hezbollah can still fundraise in Europe. In December 2014, the General Court of the European Union ruled that Hamas should be removed from the EU's terrorist list. The European Union ruled to remove Hamas from the EU's list of designated terrorist organizations due to procedural issues. The EU External Action Service clarified that it was not a political decision and sanctions against Hamas will continue during the appeal process. The US and Israel urged the EU to maintain sanctions. Members of Congress are interested in international efforts to ensure Iran's nuclear program remains peaceful. Europe has been closely involved in efforts to ensure Iran's nuclear program is peaceful, working with the US, Russia, and China in the P5+1 group. The EU and US pushed for UN sanctions on Iran from 2006 to 2010, with the EU later adopting independent sanctions. The EU has adopted sanctions on Iran independently, aligning with U.S. policy. This includes an embargo on Iranian oil, restrictions on nuclear technology, arms embargo, and financial transaction restrictions. Following the EU's adoption of sanctions on Iran, including an embargo on Iranian oil and restrictions on nuclear technology, the United States also imposed restrictions on transactions and business activities with the Iranian government, Central Bank, and financial institutions. Sanctions were placed on Iranian cargo vessels and aircraft, a visa ban and asset freeze were implemented on individuals involved in Iran's nuclear program, and over 480 entities supporting Iran's nuclear program had their assets frozen. These concerted sanctions by the US, EU, and other international partners successfully isolated Iran, exerted economic pressure, and influenced Iran's stance on negotiations after the election of Hassan Rouhani. Following the election of Hassan Rouhani as Iran's president in June 2013, tensions eased, leading to the P5+1 and Iran agreeing to a Joint Plan of Action (JPA) in November 2013. The JPA aims to reach a comprehensive agreement on Iran's nuclear program, requiring Iran to freeze some nuclear activities and cooperate with monitoring by the IAEA in exchange for limited sanctions relief, including allowing Iran to repatriate $700 million per month from oil sales. The Joint Plan of Action (JPA) was agreed upon in November 2013, allowing Iran to repatriate $700 million per month from oil sales and suspending various sanctions. The terms of the JPA have been extended twice, with negotiations ongoing to reach a final agreement. The EU-3 foreign ministers and EU High Representative oppose new U.S. sanctions during negotiations with Iran, fearing it could jeopardize talks and fracture the international coalition. The diplomatic quartet, including the U.S., EU, Russia, and the UN, has been mediating the discussions. The EU, along with the U.S., Russia, and the UN, has been part of the diplomatic quartet trying to mediate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. They advocate for a two-state solution and urge greater U.S. engagement. Talks have been unsuccessful, and recent conflicts have dimmed prospects for a near-term settlement. Several European countries have shown support for the Palestinians, causing Israeli concerns about international isolation. Sweden recognized a Palestinian state in 2014, and other European countries followed with non-binding resolutions in support of recognition. Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman identified this growing European support as a top diplomatic challenge. Israel has concerns about reduced economic cooperation with the EU, their largest trading partner, due to international debates on European recognition of Palestinian statehood and potential ICC investigations of Israeli actions in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The EU has taken measures against Israeli organizations in West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Golan Heights settlements, with potential labeling of settlement products. Analysts believe these actions do not pose a significant economic threat to Israel, as no European government supports boycotting Israel. There is speculation about another U.N. Security Council resolution by Palestinians and Arab states. The EU has considered measures against Israeli organizations in West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Golan Heights settlements, including potential labeling of settlement products. High Representative Mogherini stated that there are no current plans for sanctions, but rather a focus on motivating peace talks. Reports suggest the EU may offer financial incentives and upgraded ties in the event of a successful peace agreement. The US and EU have a significant trade relationship, generating $5 trillion annually and supporting up to 15 million jobs. The trade relationship between the US and EU generates $5 trillion annually, supporting 15 million jobs. Merchandise trade totaled $787 billion in 2013. U.S. companies invest heavily in Europe, with 56% of global investment going there since 2000. In 2012, Europe accounted for over 70% of foreign investment in the US, totaling $1.9 trillion. Total assets of European affiliates in the US were $8.7 trillion in 2012, while U.S. corporate assets in Europe exceeded $13 trillion. The US and EU together make up 50% of global GDP by value. The transatlantic economic relationship between the US and EU, comprising 50% of global GDP by value and 40% in purchasing power parity, is influential in shaping standards and regulations. The US and EU have been negotiating a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) since July 2013 to boost jobs and growth by reducing trade barriers. Reducing tariffs and non-tariff barriers in the US-EU trade relationship could significantly boost GDP. Harmonizing regulations and standards could help define global standards. The TTIP is crucial for strengthening the transatlantic relationship. The US-EU trade relationship could benefit from the TTIP agreement, but there are concerns about potential obstacles and opposition. Initialing a draft agreement by the end of 2015 is the goal, but objections have been raised regarding provisions for investor-state dispute settlement. European political and public opposition to TTIP has increased and become more organized in 2014. Critics in Europe are concerned that including investor-state dispute settlement provisions in the TTIP could limit the EU's regulatory abilities. Europeans are also worried about the impact of TTIP on data privacy, food labeling, and geographic protections for products like Champagne and Black Forest ham. Congress is considering reauthorizing Trade Promotion Authority at the request of President Obama. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) is being considered for reauthorization by Congress at the request of President Obama. TPA is essential for setting trade negotiating objectives and expediting the consideration of implementing bills for reciprocal trade agreements. Critics in Europe have concerns about including investor-state dispute settlement provisions in the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) and its impact on regulatory abilities, data privacy, and product protections. The Eurozone's sustainable structure as a currency area is doubted due to the lack of fiscal union. Despite predictions of countries exiting the euro during the crisis, EU leaders took unprecedented steps to address the situation by tightening fiscal rules, strengthening the banking sector, and creating sovereign rescue funds. The European Central Bank also intervened by purchasing sovereign debt and incentivizing bank lending. Many analysts note improved market confidence and stabilized conditions since 2013. However, doubts remain about the crisis being definitively over, with concerns about the effectiveness of austerity efforts and economic reform programs in various countries. Economic growth forecasts for 2015 are 1.4% in the EU and 1.1% in. Forecasts predict economic growth of 1.4% in the EU and 1.1% in the Eurozone for 2015, with unemployment expected to be 10% across the EU and 11.2% in the Eurozone. Concerns about potential triggers for market unease, such as a stand-off between the EU and the Syriza-led government in Greece, have led some analysts to warn about long-term economic stagnation in Europe. The ECB announced a massive stimulus program in January 2015 with the purchase of \u20ac1.1 trillion. The ECB announced a \u20ac1.1 trillion stimulus program in January 2015 to purchase government and private bonds over a 19-month period starting in March. Analysts were initially concerned about the Eurozone crisis affecting U.S. growth, but the U.S. economy continued to progress despite Europe's difficulties. Congress may still have worries about the impact of European economic conditions on the U.S. and global economies, as well as on U.S. export, banking, and investment interests. Press reports in 2013 revealed U.S. NSA surveillance programs in the United States and Europe. The NSA surveillance programs in the United States and Europe, based on leaked documents from Edward Snowden, caused tensions in the transatlantic relationship. Allegations included spying on EU offices in Washington, DC and German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone, raising concerns about U.S. surveillance operations and European intelligence involvement. The extent of U.S. surveillance operations and European intelligence involvement raised concerns about the balance between security and privacy rights. European leaders and citizens were dismayed by the reports, fearing violations of privacy rights and compromise of personal data security. Germany has seen the most pronounced criticism due to the broad scope of disclosed NSA activities. The NSA activities in Germany have raised strong concerns due to historical surveillance legacies. The fallout could impact U.S.-European cooperation on counterterrorism and data privacy agreements. The European Parliament has raised concerns about U.S. data protection safeguards and access to European citizens' personal data, leading to calls for the suspension of the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor agreement. There are suggestions that U.S. surveillance activities could impact economic relations, including negotiations on the proposed TTIP, but tensions have been manageable so far. Tensions over U.S. surveillance activities in Europe have been manageable and do not pose a sustained threat to the transatlantic relationship. European leaders' outrage may be more for domestic consumption, as many are aware of their own security services' surveillance operations and cooperation with U.S. intelligence. Cooperation between the U.S. and Europe is crucial in light of the threat posed by the Islamic State and returning foreign fighters. Cooperation between U.S. and European intelligence and security services remains strong despite political tensions. The melting Arctic ice is increasing human activities in the region, with implications for fisheries, tourism, and resource exploration. The United States will assume the chairmanship of the Arctic Council in May 2015, a forum for cooperation among the eight Arctic countries on issues like regional development, environment, emergency response, climate change, and resource extraction. This comes as increased human activities in the region pose risks to the environment. The Arctic Council consists of eight countries with territory in the Arctic Circle: US, Canada, Russia, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and Iceland. While not focused on security, the Arctic is seen as geopolitically important. Coastal states are willing to establish military presence in the region. Five Council members are also in NATO, but there is no consensus on military roles. Five of the eight Arctic Council members, including Russia, have shown interest in protecting their Arctic interests. There is no consensus within NATO regarding its role in the Arctic, and China has also displayed a growing interest in the region. Tensions over Ukraine could potentially impact Arctic cooperation. The Arctic Council member countries have voting rights, while European countries have permanent observer status. The EU was denied full observer status in 2009 and 2013. In 2014, John Kerry appointed Robert J. Papp, Jr. as the first U.S. Special Representative for the Arctic. The U.S. appointed Admiral Papp to lead the 2015-2017 U.S. chairmanship of the Arctic Council with a focus on stewardship of the Arctic Ocean, climate change, and economic issues."
