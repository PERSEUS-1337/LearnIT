    "content": "Most of the funding for HUD comes from discretionary appropriations provided by Congress. Programs focus on housing issues for low-income households, including rental assistance for the poor, elderly, and disabled. Public Housing, Section 8 Vouchers, and Section 8 project-based rental assistance are the main programs. HOME and Community Development Block Grants are also important block grant programs. HUD receives funding from Congress for housing programs, including rental assistance for low-income households. Two block grant programs, HOME and Community Development Block Grants, help finance housing and community development activities for low-income families. Other grant programs assist homeless individuals, including those with AIDS. FHA insures mortgages for lower-income home buyers and developers of affordable rental buildings. FHA fees sustain the insurance fund and cover administrative costs. Surplus funds have been used for various purposes. The HUD budget has received emergency supplemental funding in recent years, including $20 billion for recovery assistance after Hurricane Katrina. The economic stimulus legislation provided over $13 billion to HUD's programs. Total enacted appropriations for HUD have increased by 57% in the past nine years. Total enacted appropriations for HUD, including emergency supplemental funding, have increased by 57% in the past nine years. The rate of growth has been on the rise in recent years, with year-over-year increases of 5% or more each year, peaking at nearly 12% in FY2010. Adjusting for inflation, the \"real\" funding growth has been less robust, with a 17% increase over the same period. HUD's funding growth has been increasing in recent years, with most of the growth occurring in the last two years. The components of HUD's annual funding include regular annual appropriations, emergency appropriations, rescissions, and offsets, with programs funded mainly through discretionary appropriations. Congress determines the amount of funding obligated for HUD's programs and activities each year. Congress provides funding for HUD's programs through regular annual appropriations and emergency appropriations, often in response to disasters. Emergency funds are typically provided outside of regular appropriations acts, in addition to annual appropriations. Congressional appropriators are limited in the amount of new discretionary funding they can provide each year, leading them to either reduce regular appropriations or find offsets. The cost of HUD's regular annual appropriations acts is offset through rescissions and offsetting receipts and collections. The total net budget authority for HUD is determined by the interaction between new appropriations and offsets. Net budget authority is the estimated cost of the HUD budget provided each year. The net budget authority provided to HUD each year is not the best measure of funding for its programs. Despite a 57% increase in net non-emergency budget authority from FY2002 to FY2010, there are important trends masked by this overall increase. The 57% increase in net non-emergency budget authority from FY2002 to FY2010 is not solely due to increased appropriations for HUD programs. Regular annual appropriations grew by only 37%, while offsetting receipts and collections declined significantly. This resulted in a partial increase in net non-emergency budget authority during this period. During FY2002-FY2010, the 37% growth in regular appropriations was mainly due to the expansion of HUD's Section 8 voucher and project-based rental assistance programs, which are the largest components of the HUD budget. Appropriations for the Section 8 programs increased by over 70%, while funding for other HUD programs only grew by 8% during this period. During FY2002-FY2010, Section 8 programs accounted for a significant portion of HUD's regular appropriations, increasing from 46% to 57%. While Section 8 funding grew, funding for other HUD programs declined. However, in FY2009 and FY2010, funding for other HUD programs began to grow as well. The decline in offsetting receipts was mainly due to decreases in receipts from FHA mortgage insurance programs. The offsetting receipts available from FHA to offset the cost of new HUD appropriations declined significantly from FY2004 to FY2010. The annual appropriations process starts with the President's budget request, followed by hearings and crafting of appropriations legislation by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. Legislation must be enacted before September 30 to avoid a government funding lapse. The FY2011 appropriations process for HUD began with the President's budget release in February 2010 and ended with the signing of P.L. 112-10 in April 2011. Congress enacts short-term continuing resolutions to continue funding at prior levels until final actions are taken. The process spanned two calendar years and two Congresses. The President's FY2011 budget requested about $45.6 billion in net new budget authority for HUD, a 1% decrease from FY2010. However, this decrease would actually result in a 3% increase in appropriations for HUD programs overall. The budget proposed offsetting the increase with a substantial rise in offsetting collections from changes to FHA mortgage insurance programs. The President's FY2011 budget requested funding increases for Section 8 programs, homeless programs, and HUD's research needs. Decreased funding was requested for programs for the elderly, persons with disabilities, and public housing repairs. No new funding was requested for the brownfields redevelopment program. The House approved the FY2011 HUD funding bill on July 29. The FY2011 HUD funding bill approved by the House on July 29, 2010 (H.R. 5850) would have provided about $1 billion more for HUD than requested by the President. The bill rejected proposed cuts to housing programs for the elderly and persons with disabilities, public housing capital funding, and the brownfields program. It also rejected funding for initiatives like Choice Neighborhoods and Transforming Rental Assistance. The bill was not enacted. The Senate bill, like the House bill, would have provided about $1 billion more for HUD than requested by the President. It included a 1% increase in net new budget authority and a 5% increase in appropriations for HUD programs. The Senate bill also rejected proposed cuts to housing programs for the elderly and persons with disabilities, as well as public housing capital funding. The Senate committee bill, unlike the House bill, would have funded the President's Choice Neighborhoods Initiative and other programs for the elderly, persons with disabilities, and public housing capital funding. The bill was not enacted before the end of the 111th Congress, leading to a series of continuing resolutions to maintain funding at FY2010 levels. The first continuing resolution in the federal budget for HUD's accounts lasted from October 1, 2010, until December 3, 2010. Subsequent CRs extended the original one through December 18, 2010, and December 21, 2010. The last CR approved before the end of the 111th Congress was set to expire on March 4, 2011, leaving funding decisions for the remainder of FY2011 to the 112th Congress. This CR also extended FHA mortgage limit increases through the end of FY2011. The House approved a year-long continuing resolution, H.R. 1, to fund the federal government through the end of FY2011. This bill would have provided about $5 billion less in aggregate appropriations for HUD programs compared to FY2010. The Senate failed to pass H.R. 1 and a Senate Amendment that would have increased funding for HUD by nearly $6 billion without rescinding any FY2010 funding. It would have reduced net budget authority from FY2010 by over $1 billion (under 3%) but increased by about $900 million. The 112th Congress approved a short-term CR (H.J.Res. 44, P.L. 112-4) to fund the government through March 18, 2011, maintaining most accounts at FY2010 levels but reducing funding for some accounts. The Community Development Fund (CDF) account, which funds the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, was reduced by approximately $195 million under H.J.Res. 44. This reduction eliminated funding for congressional earmarks through Economic Development Initiatives (EDI) and Neighborhood Initiatives (NI) in FY2010. Congress then passed another short-term CR (H.J.Res. 48, P.L. 112-6) to continue funding through April 8, 2011, maintaining most HUD accounts at FY2010 levels but continuing the reduction in funding for the CDF. H.J.Res. 48 provided no funding for HUD's Brownfields Redevelopment account, which had been funded at $17 million in FY2010. A final short-term CR, P.L. 112-8, extended funding through April 15, 2011, while work on a final FY2011 year-long funding bill was completed. It reduced funding for the public housing operating fund and specified that no CDF funds could be used for EDI and NI earmarks. On April 15, 2011, the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act of 2011 (P.L. 112-10) was signed into law, providing year-long FY2011 appropriations. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act of 2011 (P.L. 112-10) provided year-long FY2011 appropriations for HUD and other government agencies. It funded some HUD programs at FY2010 levels, reduced funding for some programs, and increased funding for Section 8 programs. The law included an across-the-board 0.2% rescission from non-defense discretionary accounts, resulting in a decrease of about 11% in net new budget authority for HUD. The FY2011 appropriations for HUD under the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act of 2011 reduced funding for some programs and increased funding for Section 8 programs. There was an 11% decrease in net new budget authority for HUD due to a 0.2% rescission from non-defense discretionary accounts. The requested decrease in net new budget authority would only represent a 4% decrease in appropriations for HUD programs in aggregate, with a substantial increase in offsetting collections and receipts from the FHA mortgage insurance programs. The FHA insures mortgage loans to make credit more widely available at a lower cost. The FHA home loan insurance programs, administered through two program accounts in the HUD budget, make credit more widely available at a lower cost. The Mutual Mortgage Insurance (MMI) Fund is the largest of the FHA insurance funds, focusing on single-family home loans. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 also impacted the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-289) moved the FHA's reverse mortgage program into the MMI Fund, creating two risk categories: MMI Purchase and Refinance, and MMI HECM. The MMI Fund provides insurance for single-family loans, while the GI/SRI Fund covers riskier mortgages and special-purpose loans. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA) determines the cost of federal loan insurance in a fiscal year based on the net present value of expected cash flows from insured loans. Cash inflows come from insurance premiums, while outflows are for payments to lenders for loan defaults. The subsidy rate is the net value of these cash flows as a percentage of insured loan volume. The subsidy rate is calculated based on the net present value of cash flows from insured loans, expressed as a percentage of loan volume. It is shown as a negative number if cash inflows exceed outflows, and as a positive number if outflows exceed inflows. This rate determines the credit subsidy needed for federal credit programs over the life of the loans. Actual cash flows may differ from the projected subsidy amount. The MMI Fund historically has a negative subsidy rate, generating money for the government by making more in fees than paying out in claims. This has allowed the fund to operate without needing an appropriation from Congress. The MMI Fund historically operates without needing Congress's appropriation, generating money through fees. It is divided into two risk categories: Purchase and Refinance, and HECM. The Purchase and Refinance category is estimated to have a negative subsidy rate of -2.59% for FY2011, generating $5.8 billion in negative credit subsidy. The MMI Fund is projected to have a negative credit subsidy of $5.8 billion in FY2011, partly due to proposed FHA reforms. The Congressional Budget Office estimates a smaller negative credit subsidy of around $1.9 billion for the Purchase and Refinance risk category. The Congressional Budget Office projected a negative credit subsidy of around $1.9 billion for the MMI Fund in FY2011, with $960 million without FHA's proposed changes and an additional $902 million with HUD-proposed program reforms. Despite differences with the Administration's projections, CBO anticipated this category of the MMI Fund to generate more revenue than losses in the upcoming year, eliminating the need for a positive credit subsidy in FY2011. The discrepancies between the President's budget request and CBO's re-estimate are detailed in Table 3. FHA's estimates of negative credit subsidy for FY2011 were revised upward after the full-year appropriations law was enacted in April 2011. In 2011, FHA's estimates of FY2011 negative credit subsidy were revised upward due to an increase in the annual premium charged by FHA. The change resulted in a -3.92% subsidy rate for the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund's Purchase and Refinance risk category for FY2011. FHA's estimates of offsetting receipts for this category in FY2011 increased to nearly $10 billion by the time the FY2012 budget was enacted. The refinance risk category in FY2011 increased to nearly $10 billion by the time the FY2012 budget was released, from an estimate of $5.8 billion when the FY2011 budget was released. CBO also increased its estimate of FHA receipts for FY2011 by over $1 billion. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 moved the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage program into the MMI fund separately. The MMI HECM risk category is estimated to have a positive credit subsidy of 0.83%. In FY2011, HUD proposed changes to the HECM program to reduce the need for positive credit subsidies. This included increasing borrowers' annual insurance premiums and adjusting the formula for initial loan sizes. These changes aimed to decrease the need for a $250 million positive credit subsidy. The FY2012 appropriations law aimed to reduce the need for credit subsidies for HECMs by making adjustments to the program to result in a zero credit subsidy. This was in response to the increasing demand for FHA-insured mortgages due to tightening lending standards in the private market. The demand for FHA-insured mortgages has been increasing in recent years, with FHA insuring 18.7% of new single-family mortgages in FY2009, up from about 2% in FY2006. The average credit score on FHA-insured loans has improved to the 690s, indicating better credit quality. However, the default rate on past FHA-insured loans is still rising, putting strain on the MMI Fund. Congress addressed this issue in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-508). The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 mandated that the MMI Fund must have a capital reserve ratio of at least 2% within 10 years. By FY2009, the capital reserve ratio was only 0.53%, the first time it fell below 2%. FHA announced measures to address concerns over the fund's financial stability. FHA has proposed changes to its single-family mortgage insurance programs, including increasing the annual mortgage insurance premium. Congressional action may be required for some changes. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 mandated a 2% capital reserve ratio for the MMI Fund, which fell below that in FY2009. After the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 mandated a 2% capital reserve ratio for the MMI Fund, FHA increased annual mortgage insurance premiums for borrowers with downpayments of 5% or less. The premiums were raised to 1.15% of the loan balance for downpayments of 5% or less and 1.10% for downpayments greater than 5% starting on April 18, 2011. Congress also set a statutory cap on the upfront premium. FHA raised the upfront mortgage insurance premium to 2.25% for loans endorsed on or after April 5, 2010, but lowered it to 1% for loans endorsed on or after October 1, 2010, after P.L. 111-229 was enacted. FHA proposes changes to downpayment and credit score requirements, with borrowers between 500-579 needing a 10% downpayment and those with 580+ requiring 3.5%. Seller concessions may be reduced from 6% to 3%. FHA plans to reduce seller concessions to 3% from 6% and increase oversight of FHA-approved lenders, requiring Congress to grant authority for additional enforcement actions. The FHA Reform Act of 2010 (H.R. 5072) aimed to give FHA more authority to require lenders to indemnify for claims on non-compliant mortgages, terminate lenders with high default rates, and establish a Deputy Assistant Secretary for Risk Management. The FHA Reform Act of 2010 aimed to abolish the position of FHA chief risk officer and give FHA authority to contract with outside credit risk analysis sources. Authorized appropriations were provided for staff to review lender performance from FY2010 through FY2014. HUD provides capital grants and rental assistance through programs like Section 202 and Section 811 for elderly and disabled residents. In the Section 202 program, property owners may provide supportive services to residents, while in the Section 811 program, supportive services are mandatory. HUD has funded over 106,000 units of Section 202 housing and 30,000 units of Section 811 housing. The President proposed no new funding for these programs in FY2011 to allow for program redesign. The President's proposal would have reduced funding for Section 202 and Section 811 programs for low-income elderly residents. Section 202 and related programs would have been funded at $274 million, compared to $825 million in FY2010. The Section 811 program would have received $90 million in FY2011, compared to $300 million in FY2010. Neither the House-passed appropriations bill (H.R. 5850) nor the Senate committee-passed bill (S. 3644) followed the President's recommendations to redesign the programs or stop producing new units. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 proposed maintaining funding levels for Section 202 at $825 million and for Section 811 at $300 million. The difference in funding levels was due to the treatment of Section 811 vouchers, with S. 3644 allocating $200 million. Both bills would have moved funding for Section 811 vouchers to the Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance account. In FY2011, nearly $114 million was allocated for voucher renewals. Congress appropriated $400 million for Section 202 programs and $150 million for Section 811 programs. Funding for Section 811 vouchers was split between Section 811 and Section 8 tenant-based accounts, with \"up to\" $32 million for Section 811 renewals. In FY2011, $67 million was allocated for Section 811 voucher renewals, $20 million less than in FY2010. $89 million was provided for Service Coordinators and $39 million for the Assisted Living Conversion program within the Section 202 funds. The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program is funded through the tenant-based rental assistance account and is the largest assistance program administered by HUD. The rental assistance account is the largest program administered by HUD, funding vouchers for housing subsidies and administrative costs for PHAs. Funding comes from current year appropriations and advance appropriations for the following fiscal year. Since FY2004, funding for voucher renewals and allocation to PHAs have been debated in the HUD appropriations process. Questions involve funding sufficiency for leased vouchers and efficient allocation to serve families while controlling costs. In FY2010, Congress provided over $16 billion for the program. In FY2010, Congress allocated over $16 billion for voucher renewals to PHAs based on their prior year costs and utilization. The funding was sufficient for over 99% of PHAs' formula eligibility, but some PHAs did not lease all their vouchers in FY2009. HUD's data showed that PHAs had about 94% of their vouchers under lease in FY2009. In FY2010, PHAs had 94% of their vouchers under lease. CY2010 funding was based on FY2009 utilization, resulting in insufficient funding for all vouchers. Only PHAs with decreased costs or reserve funding could increase utilization. The President's FY2011 budget requested $17 billion for voucher renewals, enough to fund about 95% of all vouchers in use. HUD's Congressional Budget Justifications indicated the requested amount would cover all vouchers. The President's budget for FY2011 requested $17 billion for voucher renewals, with funding allocated based on prior year costs and utilization. The Secretary would have the authority to reallocate funding to PHAs with lower reserves, potentially allowing them to serve more families. The budget also requested Congress to lift the ban on \"over-leasing\" to facilitate additional increases in leasing. The President's FY2011 budget requested $17 billion for voucher renewals, with a request to lift the ban on \"over-leasing.\" The House bill allocated $150 million less for renewals than the budget request, citing lower inflation estimates. The committee report on H.R. 5850 stated that less renewal funding would be needed due to lower inflation estimates. The bill included sufficient funding for voucher renewals and followed the President's formula, but did not include the reallocation authority requested. The committee believes the program is in need of major changes. The committee report on S. 3644 suggests major authorization changes for the program, including a shift to basing PHA funding on prior calendar year spending. The bill would fund renewals below the President's request, citing revised estimates of need and using the same formula as H.R. 5850. The Senate bill for funding PHAs did not include reallocation authority requested by the President, citing concerns about potential cost increases. The committee report also directed HUD to improve monitoring of PHAs' financial management. No changes were made to the funding allocation formula from FY2010 in H.R. 1 or the final FY2011 appropriations law. The FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) did not change the funding allocation formula from FY2010. Both the House and Senate bills allocated less for renewals than requested by the President but more than in FY2010. The President's budget requested funding for mainstream vouchers for persons with disabilities in the Section 8 account, with HUD requesting $114 million for this purpose. Both the House and Senate bills supported this request, but H.R. 1 did not explicitly include funding for tenant-based rental assistance. The final FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) appropriated less than a third of the amount requested by the President for Section 811 renewals. Each Public Housing Authority (PHA) has a contract with HUD for authorized vouchers, totaling around 2.3 million vouchers. Congress can create additional vouchers in some years, increasing the total number available. In recent years, Congress has created additional vouchers, including replacement vouchers for families displaced from HUD programs and new incremental vouchers for special populations or purposes. For example, in FY2010, $15 million was allocated for child welfare system vouchers and $75 million for homeless veterans. In FY2011, $85 million was requested for new vouchers for supportive housing for at-risk families and individuals. The House and Senate bills from the 111th Congress included funding for homelessness programs, such as vouchers for homeless veterans and families displaced by hurricanes. The Senate bill also allocated funds for the Family Unification Program. The bill would have provided $16 million for the Family Unification Program (FUP), which offers vouchers to families in the child welfare system. H.R. 1 did not include funding for new vouchers, but the final FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) allocated about $50 million for VASH vouchers. The project-based rental assistance account funds existing Section 8 rental assistance contracts between HUD and private property owners, providing subsidies to eligible low-income families. The program allowed tenants to live in subsidized units at 30% of their incomes with previously agreed-upon rent. Contracts funded by Congress for 20- to 40-year periods require new annual appropriations once expired. More appropriations are needed as contracts expire and owners choose to renew. Some contracts lack funding to finish terms, requiring new funding for completion. In FY2011, the President requested over $9 billion for project-based rental assistance, with $662 million needed for amendment funding. HUD aims to provide full-year funding for all contracts and renew expiring ones. Funding for the account has been a mix of current year and advance appropriations since FY2009. In FY2011, the President requested funding for project-based rental assistance. Both the House and Senate bills proposed to adopt the President's funding level, with some variations. President Obama's budget also included $350 million for a new \"Transforming Rental Assistance\" initiative. The \"Transforming Rental Assistance\" initiative aims to streamline HUD's rental assistance programs and increase residential mobility options for HUD-assisted tenants. It involves transferring HUD-assisted housing units to a new form of project-based rental assistance that allows families to take their subsidies with them if they choose to move. The President's budget aims to transfer 300,000 units of public and multifamily housing properties to a new form of project-based rental assistance, allowing tenants to take their subsidies with them if they choose to move. The President's budget aims to transfer 300,000 units of public and multifamily housing properties to a new form of project-based rental assistance, allowing tenants to take their subsidies with them if they choose to move. HUD would select properties for participation, with most of the funding used to cover the difference between current and new subsidy levels. The President's budget proposes transferring 300,000 housing units to project-based rental assistance, allowing tenants to move with their subsidies. $50 million would be used for PHA activities and landlord outreach, $10 million for technical assistance. HUD will submit legislation for the Preservation, Enhancement, and Transformation of Rental Assistance Act. H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 did not include funding for the President's initiative. The President's proposal for funding the Transforming Rental Assistance initiative was rejected by committees due to concerns about incomplete development and unknown future costs. The initiative was not included in the final FY2011 appropriations law. Public housing program, established in 1937, provides rental units for low-income families, with Congress continuing to allocate funds despite no new developments in recent years. Despite no new developments in recent years, Congress continues to provide funds to over 3,100 Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) that own and maintain 1.2 million units. HUD offers operating funds to fill the gap between rent contributions and maintenance costs, as well as capital funds for large projects. The HOPE VI program supports the redevelopment of distressed public housing, focusing on creating mixed-income communities. The President's FY2011 budget requested increased funding for the Public Housing operating fund and decreased funding for the public housing capital fund. HUD's Congressional Budget Justifications state that the operating fund request would fully cover PHAs' eligibility, considering the capital funding received from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. PHAs can transfer up to 20% of their capital funding. The Administration proposes fully funding the operating fund to allow more capital funds for capital needs. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 support this proposal with a $500 million increase for the capital fund. The Senate bill includes a $50 million set-aside for early childhood education and care facilities in public housing. The final FY2011 funding law (P.L. 112-10) funded the public housing capital fund higher than H.R. 1 but less than FY2010, and funded the operating fund at about $10 million less than H.R. 1. The reduced appropriations for the operating fund may be voluntarily offset by PHAs' use of program reserves. The President's FY2012 budget requested $250 million for the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative, a new proposal modeled after the HOPE VI program. This initiative aims to revitalize severely distressed neighborhoods, not limited to public housing, by offering competitive grants to PHAs, local governments, and nonprofits. The funding for the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative is aimed at transforming, rehabilitating, and replacing HUD public and assisted housing. In FY2010, Congress allocated $200 million to the HOPE VI account, with $65 million set aside for a Choice Neighborhoods demonstration. The House and Senate in the 111th Congress had differing positions on funding for HOPE VI and Choice Neighborhoods in FY2011. H.R. 5850 proposed $200 million for HOPE VI but no funding for Choice. In FY2010, Congress allocated $200 million to the HOPE VI account, with $65 million for a Choice Neighborhoods demonstration. H.R. 5850 proposed $200 million for HOPE VI, while S. 3644 offered $250 million for Choice Neighborhoods. HUD circulated draft legislation for the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative, and the House Financial Services Committee discussed it in March 2010. The Public Housing Reinvestment and Tenant Protection Act of 2010 (H.R. 5814) included authorization for the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative, but it was not enacted in the 111th Congress. In the 111th Congress, H.R. 1 proposed no funding for HOPE VI or Choice Neighborhoods. The final FY2011 funding law provided just under $100 million for HOPE VI and did not modify the $65 million set-aside from FY2010. The Housing Trust Fund, authorized in the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, aims to provide a permanent source of funding for affordable housing activities. The Housing Trust Fund, established in the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, aimed to provide grants for affordable housing activities, focusing on rental housing for extremely low-income families. Funding from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was suspended in 2008, leaving the Trust Fund without a dedicated funding source. The Housing Trust Fund, established in 2008, has not received any funding despite requests in the FY2010 and FY2011 budgets for $1 billion each. No funding has been directed to the fund from sources other than Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The Housing Trust Fund, established in 2008, has not received any funding despite requests in the FY2010 and FY2011 budgets for $1 billion each. Congress did not include funding for the Housing Trust Fund in the final FY2011 appropriations law. However, there were legislative proposals in the 111th Congress to provide funding for the fund, but none were enacted before adjournment. President Obama's FY2010 budget request included the Transformation Initiative to strengthen HUD's research and technological capacities. The fund may be used for research, evaluation, program demonstrations, technical assistance, and information technology. Funding request involves appropriations for reducing mortgage fraud and authority for the Secretary to transfer up to 1% from HUD's budget to a transformation fund. In FY2010, Congress provided $20 million for mortgage fraud and authorized a 1% transfer, but not from all accounts. If the full transfer request had been provided, the fund could have received more. In FY2010, the President's full transfer request could have provided the fund with $435 million, but it only received $239 million due to restrictions. In FY2011, the President requested $20 million for combating mortgage fraud and a 1% transfer authority, which could have resulted in the fund receiving almost $470 million. H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 included the $20 million for mortgage fraud, but with a more limited transfer authority. The House and Senate bills from the 111th Congress proposed limits on the Department of Housing and Urban Development's discretion in allocating funds for eligible activities. The Transformation Initiative funds were restricted to the core needs of the Department, as flexibility was not seen as the primary challenge. The Senate report emphasized the importance of oversight for Transformation Initiative funds allocated to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Committee recommended minimum funding levels for IT modernization and technical assistance, limiting the flexibility to use these funds as requested by HUD. H.R. 1 did not include the authority for transfers under the Transformation Initiative, instead allocating $71 million for modernizing FHA's systems and updated computer programs. The final FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) included $71 million for modernizing FHA's systems and updated computer programs for the Section 8 voucher program. The law permits HUD the requested transfer authority under the transformation initiative, but from a more limited number of accounts than requested by the President. The Administration's budget for FY2011 included community development initiatives to transform the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and related programs. The Administration's FY2011 budget request proposed funding for various community development programs, including the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) at its FY2010 level. It also sought to eliminate funding for the Rural Innovation Fund, Neighborhood Initiative, and Economic Development Initiative, while introducing new initiatives like Catalytic Competition Grants and Capacity Building Clearinghouse. Additionally, the budget aimed to revamp programs such as the University Community Fund and the Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program. The Administration's budget for FY2011 proposed a reduction in funding for Community Development Fund activities, defunding Neighborhood Initiative and Economic Development Initiative grants to fund Sustainable Communities Initiative and University Community Fund. The Administration's budget for FY2011 proposed a reduction in funding for Community Development Fund activities, defunding Neighborhood Initiative and Economic Development Initiative grants to fund Sustainable Communities Initiative, University Community Fund, and Catalytic Investments Competition Grants. The President's budget requested no new funding for the Brownfields Economic Development Initiative Account, arguing duplication with other federal programs. The House bill recommended a $4.382 billion appropriation for CDF activities. The House bill, H.R. 5850, recommended a $4.382 billion appropriation for CDF activities, including $89.3 million for congressional earmarked funds for EDI and NI projects. The Senate Appropriations Committee bill, S. 3644, recommended a $4.450 billion appropriation for CDF activities, with $193 million for EDI and NI projects. Both bills also recommended funding for the Sustainable Communities Initiative and University Community Fund. The final FY2011 appropriations law, P.L. 112-10, allocated $3.501 billion for the CDF account, a 21.2% decrease from FY2010 funding levels. This included a 16.4% reduction in funding for CDBG formula grants and no funding for the proposed Catalytic Investments Competition Grants. The FY2011 appropriations law reduced funding for the Community Development Fund (CDF) by 21.2%, excluding the Brownfield Economic Development Initiative program. The CDF supports various community development programs, including the Community Development Block Grant program. The Community Development Act of 1974 provides federal financial assistance for neighborhood revitalization, housing rehabilitation, and economic development. CDBG formula funds were awarded to various communities in 2010 to benefit low- and moderate-income individuals, eliminate blight, or address health and safety threats. The Administration proposed freezing funding for the CDBG formula-based component of the program at its FY2010 level of over $3.9 billion for FY2011. Additionally, funding was allocated for Sustainable Communities Initiatives, Catalytic Competition Grants, and support for Indian tribes, insular areas, University Partnerships, and the Transformation Initiative. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 proposed slightly higher funding for the CDBG formula grant program compared to the President's request and the program's FY2010 funding level of $3.943 billion. The House passed H.R. 1, reducing the CDF account by 66.3% below its FY2010 funding level of $4.450 billion. It prohibited funds for earmarks and the Sustainable Communities Initiative. No instructions were included on fund allocation among CDBG program components. The House-passed H.R. 1 reduced CDF account funding by 66.3% below FY2010 levels. No instructions were given for fund allocation among CDBG program components, which typically allocate 70% to entitlement communities and 30% to states and Puerto Rico. The final FY2011 appropriations law allocated $3.508 billion for CDF activities, with $3.343 billion for CDBG formula funds. A 0.2% mandatory cut reduced the CDF account to $3.501 billion, and a 1% discretionary transfer moved $35 million to HUD's Transformation Initiative. The Administration requested $148.5 million for a new initiative called the Catalytic Competition Grants Program (CCGs) to support economic development projects in distressed areas. Unlike CDBG funds, CCG program funds would be awarded competitively to various entities for development projects. The Administration requested $148.5 million for the Catalytic Competition Grants Program (CCGs) to support economic development projects in distressed areas, including reclaiming vacant property for green infrastructure and economically sustainable projects, assisting small businesses, and covering administrative costs. Neither the House-passed nor the Senate Committee-passed bills included funding for the program. The Administration requested $148.5 million for the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) in FY2011, with funds appropriated by P.L. 112-10. The SCI aims to fund four components, including Regional Integrated Planning Grants for metropolitan areas to develop sustainable community models. The Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) collaborates with federal agencies to award grants for metropolitan areas to improve housing, transportation, energy, and land use planning. Grants average $3 million for larger areas and $500,000 for smaller ones. Community Challenge Grants (CCGs) are competitively awarded as part of SCI. Community Challenge Grants (CCGs) are competitively awarded as part of the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) to reform building codes and zoning ordinances for sustainable growth. HUD proposed a maximum grant award of $2 million, with Congress appropriating $40 million in FY2010. Additionally, the Administration requested funding in FY2011 for a joint HUD-Department of Transportation research initiative to evaluate the benefits of housing-transportation integration efforts. The proposal for the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) included allocating funds to evaluate the benefits of Regional Integrated Planning Grants and Community Challenge Grants. Congress appropriated $10 million in FY2010 for research efforts. Additionally, a new component of the SCI focused on capacity building to improve technical capacity of various organizations and lenders. The Administration proposed four initiatives to be administered through the Office of Sustainable Housing and Communities within HUD. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 recommended continued funding for the Sustainable Communities Initiative at $148.5 million. They also suggested allocating $25 million for Regional Integrated Planning Grants to smaller metropolitan areas and $25 million for the Rural Innovation Fund to assist state housing finance agencies. The Rural Innovation Fund (RIF) received increased funding to assist various organizations in addressing housing and poverty-related issues. Provisions included setting aside $5 million for rural Indian tribes and supporting HUD's Transformation Initiative. H.R. 1 also prohibited the use of Community Development funds for certain purposes. The FY2011 funding level for the Section 108 loan guarantee program represents a 33% reduction below FY2010. States and entitlement communities can borrow up to five times their annual CDBG allocations for redevelopment activities. The Section 108 loan guarantee program allows states and entitlement communities to borrow up to five times their annual CDBG allocations for qualifying activities, with a term of up to 20 years. The Administration's budget proposed doubling the program's loan commitment ceiling to $500 million in FY2011 to help finance large-scale projects in the credit market difficulties. The Administration proposed revamping the Section 108 loan guarantee program by charging a fee-based assessment to borrowers, eliminating the need for an appropriated credit subsidy. Congress rejected this proposal and recommended continuing the program as currently structured. H.R. 5850 suggested a loan commitment ceiling of $427 million with a credit subsidy of $10 million, while S. 3644 recommended a ceiling of $275 million with a subsidy of $6.4 million. P.L. 112-10 continued the program. The Capacity Building for Community Development and Affordable Housing Program was continued at a commitment level of $275 million with a credit subsidy of $5.988 million in FY2011. The program aimed to provide technical assistance and funds to local housing and community development organizations through national intermediaries. The Capacity Building for Community Development and Affordable Housing Program, funded by the Enterprise Community Partners and Habitat for Humanity, supports training and financial assistance for CDCs and CHDOs. The Administration's budget request proposed a $10 million increase in funding for capacity building, from $50 million to $60 million. The Administration proposed a $10 million increase in funding for capacity building, establishing a stand-alone account for competitively awarded grant funds to national and regional intermediaries with expertise in housing and community development. Technical and financial assistance would support CDCs, CHDOs, and local governments in developing community development capacity. The Administration proposed a $10 million increase in funding for capacity building to support CDCs, CHDOs, and local governments in undertaking community development and affordable housing activities for low- and moderate-income individuals. Successful grantees would need to meet a 3:1 match from private sector sources. The House-passed and Senate Committee-passed bills did not include funding for this initiative. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 recommended continuing funding for capacity building activities by organizations like Local Initiative Support Corporation, Enterprise Community Partners, and Habitat for Humanity under the Self-Help and Assisted Homeownership Opportunity Program account. P.L. 112-10 also supported capacity building through this program. HUD provides grants through the Self-Help and Assisted Homeownership Opportunity Program (SHOP) to organizations for self-help homeownership opportunities. This program also funds Capacity Building for Community Development and Affordable Housing Program and the Housing Assistance Council (HAC) for technical assistance and support to local housing organizations. The Housing Assistance Council (HAC) supports local organizations in developing housing opportunities for the rural poor through loans, research, and technical assistance. The President's FY2011 budget did not allocate funding for the SHOP account, stating that activities funded through SHOP are eligible for the HOME Investment Partnerships Program block grant. The President's budget did not allocate funding for the SHOP account in FY2011, as activities funded through SHOP are eligible for the HOME Investment Partnerships Program block grant. However, both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 included $82 million for the SHOP account, with $27 million for SHOP itself, $50 million for capacity building, and $5 million for HAC, maintaining the same funding levels as FY2010. Total FY2011 funding for account activities was $81.8 million, with $26.9 million for SHOP, $49.9 million for Capacity Building, and $4.9 million for Housing Assistance Council. HUD planned to transfer $818,360 to the Transformation Initiative account. HUD annually provides competitive grants to HUD-approved housing counseling agencies through its Housing Counseling Assistance Program. These agencies offer various counseling services for homeowners, renters, and seniors. Congress has increased funding for this program in recent years due to concerns about rising mortgage default and foreclosure rates. The Housing Counseling Assistance Program received increased funding from $39 million to $87.5 million between FY2003 and FY2010 due to concerns about rising mortgage default and foreclosure rates. In FY2011, the program was allocated $88 million, which was consistent with the President's budget request. In the 111th Congress, both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 proposed funding levels of $88 million and $100 million, respectively, for the program. In FY2011, funding for HUD's housing counseling program was eliminated, resulting in an $87.5 million decrease from FY2010 and an $88 million decrease from the President's budget request. Some argue that this funding is duplicative of the NeighborWorks National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program. In addition to HUD's housing counseling program funding being eliminated in FY2011, Congress has also allocated separate funding for foreclosure mitigation counseling to NeighborWorks America since FY2008. This funding is criticized for being slow to distribute. NeighborWorks America, an independent nonprofit corporation, receives funding for foreclosure mitigation counseling through the National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program (NFMCP). In FY2008, NeighborWorks received just under $120 million for community reinvestment activities, including funding specifically for mortgage foreclosure. NeighborWorks received $180 million for mortgage foreclosure counseling in FY2008, with additional appropriations in subsequent years. The President's budget requested $113 million for the NFMCP in FY2011, and both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 included funding for the program. S. 3644 included $125 million for the NFMCP, $12 million more than the President's request and the House-passed bill. The final FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) maintained funding for the NFMCP at the FY2010 level of $65 million. Many housing counseling agencies support the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) by providing counseling to eligible troubled borrowers with high debt-to-income ratios. Recipients of funding through the NFMCP can use up to 30% of their grants for counseling these borrowers. All borrowers eligible for HAMP are encouraged to contact housing counselors for assistance. Native American Housing Block Grants (NAHBGs) are formula-based grants for Indian tribes to provide housing assistance primarily to low-income American Indian and Alaskan Native households. This account also includes set-asides for technical assistance and loan guarantees. In FY2010, Congress provided $700 million for the NAHBG account, with set-asides for technical assistance and loan guarantees. The President's FY2011 budget requested $580 million for Native American Housing Block Grants, a decrease of $120 million from the previous year, without any set-asides for technical assistance. The President's budget did not request set-asides for technical assistance or the National American Indian Housing Council. Both the House-passed H.R. 5850 and Senate Committee-passed S. 3644 included $700 million for the NAHBG account, with set-asides provided in FY2010. The final FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) allocated nearly $650 million to this account, slightly lower than FY2010 but higher than the President's FY2011 request. The enacted FY2011 appropriations law allocated nearly $650 million to the NAHBG account, slightly lower than FY2010 levels but higher than the President's FY2011 request. The annual budget resolution sets enforceable levels of spending, revenue, and public debt, providing spending allocations to House and Senate committees. The Appropriations Committees divide their allocation among 12 subcommittees responsible for regular appropriations bills. The House and Senate budget committees began considering the FY2011 budget resolution after receiving the President's budget. They gather information from various sources to formulate the budget resolution, with a target completion date of April 15. The Senate Budget Committee reported a budget resolution for FY2011 (S.Con.Res. 60) on April 22, 2010, but no further action was taken. The House adopted a budget enforcement resolution (H.Res. 1493) on July 1, 2010, establishing spending levels for the House Appropriations Committee. The Senate did not agree to enforceable spending allocations but provided \"subcommittee spending guidance.\" The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act included $1 billion in funding for the Community Development Fund for a third round of Neighborhood Stabilization Program grants. The funds will be available starting October 1, 2010. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act allocated $1 billion for the Neighborhood Stabilization Program, with funds available from October 1, 2010. HUD was authorized to provide up to $1 billion in mortgage assistance to homeowners at risk of foreclosure due to income loss. The Emergency Homeowners Loan Program (EHLP) is utilizing $1 billion in mandatory budget authority for foreclosure prevention initiatives. The Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2010 allocated $100 million for CDBG disaster relief funding for areas affected by severe storms and flooding from March 2010 through May 2010. In FY2010, emergency funding was provided for disaster relief under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. This funding covered a major disaster in multiple counties within a State or States. For more information on CDBG disaster recovery assistance, refer to CRS Report RL33330."
