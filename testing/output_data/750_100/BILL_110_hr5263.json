    "content": "The Forest Landscape Restoration Act may be cited as the short title. The purpose of the Act is outlined in section 2. The Forest Landscape Restoration Act aims to promote collaborative ecosystem restoration in priority forest landscapes by encouraging sustainability, leveraging local and national resources, reducing wildfire management costs, and demonstrating the effectiveness of ecological restoration techniques. The Forest Landscape Restoration Act promotes collaborative ecosystem restoration in priority forest landscapes to achieve ecological health objectives, impact wildfire activity and management costs, and utilize forest restoration byproducts to offset treatment costs and benefit rural economies. The Forest Landscape Restoration Act defines key terms such as covered Federal lands, Fund, Program, and Secretaries. The Forest Landscape Restoration Act defines key terms for the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program is established by the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture to fund ecological restoration treatments for priority forest landscapes in compliance with relevant laws. Eligibility criteria are set for selection and funding under the program. To be selected for funding under the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program, a proposal must have a complete landscape restoration strategy that prioritizes ecological treatments over a 10-year period on a landscape of at least 50,000 acres, primarily forested federal lands but may include other federal, state, tribal, or private lands in need of ecosystem restoration. The proposal for funding under the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program must prioritize ecological treatments over a 10-year period on a landscape of at least 50,000 acres. It should focus on areas in need of active ecosystem restoration and be accessible to wood-processing infrastructure for using woody biomass. The proposal should incorporate the best available science and tools for ecological restoration strategies, including requirements for old-growth. The proposal for funding under the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program must prioritize ecological treatments over a 10-year period on a landscape of at least 50,000 acres. It should focus on areas in need of active ecosystem restoration and be accessible to wood-processing infrastructure for using woody biomass. The proposal should incorporate the best available science and tools for ecological restoration strategies, including requirements for old-growth maintenance, restoration, and management direction. The plan must be developed and implemented through a collaborative process involving multiple interested persons representing diverse interests. The proposal for funding under the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program must prioritize ecological treatments over a 10-year period on a landscape of at least 50,000 acres. It should focus on areas in need of active ecosystem restoration and be accessible to wood-processing infrastructure for using woody biomass. The plan must describe using fire for ecological restoration, improving fish and wildlife habitat, and have a record of successful ecological restoration projects on Federal lands. The proposal for funding under the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program aims to improve fish and wildlife habitat, maintain water quality, control invasive species, manage roads, utilize woody biomass, and report on performance annually. The proposal aims to develop small business incubators and provide employment and training opportunities in rural communities through local entities, Youth Conservation Corps crews, and small businesses. The proposal aims to develop small business incubators and provide employment and training opportunities in rural communities through local entities, Youth Conservation Corps crews, and small businesses that will hire or train a significant percentage of local people to complete contracts. It also includes analyzing cost savings from reduced wildfire management costs and estimating the decrease in unit costs of implementing ecological restoration treatments over time. The proposal includes estimating the annual Federal funding needed for ecological restoration treatments, determining the amount of new non-Federal investment leveraged by Federal funding, and complying with additional requirements set by the Secretaries for program administration. The nomination process involves submission by a collaborative forest landscape. The nomination process for collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals involves submission to the Bureau of Land Management Director and Regional Forester, with nominations made by State Directors or Regional Foresters for selection by the Secretaries. The nomination process for collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals involves submission to the Bureau of Land Management Director and Regional Forester, with nominations made by State Directors or Regional Foresters for selection by the Secretaries. Documentation for each proposal includes a plan to use Federal funds for ecological restoration treatments. The proposal involves ecological restoration treatments on Federal lands consistent with a landscape restoration strategy, using funds transferred to the Secretaries from the Fund. The collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal must include activities on non-covered Federal land with evidence of the owner's intent to participate and provide funding. The Secretaries will select collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals that have been nominated and meet eligibility criteria after consulting with advisory panels. The Secretaries will give special consideration to ecological, collaborative, cost-reducing, and effectiveness factors when selecting forest landscape restoration proposals. The Secretaries will consider factors like cost reduction, effectiveness, and non-Federal investment when selecting up to 10 collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals annually. The Secretaries will establish a scientific advisory panel of experts in ecological forest restoration and fire ecology to evaluate and provide recommendations on collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals. The Secretaries may establish a technical advisory panel of experts in rural business development and woody biomass to evaluate and provide recommendations on landscape restoration proposals for reducing long-term wildfire management costs. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Fund is established to cover up to 50% of the cost of ecological restoration treatments on Federal lands, focusing on reducing costs through the use of woody biomass and small-diameter trees while providing local economic benefits. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Fund covers up to 50% of ecological restoration treatments on Federal lands, funded by appropriations and interest earned on investments. The Secretary of the Treasury transfers necessary amounts from the Fund to carry out treatments as requested by the Secretaries. The Secretaries will establish an accounting and reporting system for the Fund and authorize $40,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2008 to 2018. Within 180 days of selecting a collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal, a work plan will be created for implementation and monitoring. The Secretaries will collaborate with interested parties to create an implementation work plan and budget for a forest landscape restoration proposal. This plan will include details on ecological and economic benefits, capacity building, and cost reductions over 10 years. The forest landscape restoration proposal will include details on cost reductions over 10 years, infrastructure costs, sustainability of woody biomass supply, local economic benefits, and documentation of non-Federal investments in the priority landscape. The Secretaries will use funds from the Fund for ecological restoration treatments consistent with the landscape restoration proposal and identified through a collaborative process. They will prepare an annual report on the accomplishments of each selected collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal. The restoration proposal includes a description of treated acres, progress evaluation with performance measures, community benefits achieved, and results of the monitoring process. The Secretaries will use a multiparty monitoring process to assess the effects of collaborative forest landscape restoration projects for at least 15 years, including costs of treatments and fire management activities. The Secretaries will submit a report every 5 years on the ecological restoration program to relevant Senate and House committees to assess its effectiveness in fulfilling the purposes of the Act. The Secretaries will submit a report every 5 years on the ecological restoration program to relevant Senate and House committees, including the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives."
