    "content": "The NTSB, established in 1967 under the DOT, investigates civil aviation and other transportation accidents to identify safety improvements. In 1974, it became independent of DOT through the Independent Safety Board Act, allowing unbiased investigations and safety recommendations. The NTSB's main role is determining accident causes. The NTSB investigates accidents to determine causes and make safety recommendations. It also assists victims' families and serves as an appeals board for certain transportation regulatory actions. The agency lacks authority to enforce its recommendations or regulate safety practices in the transportation sector. The NTSB consists of a five-member board and approximately 420 staff, with most located at the headquarters in Washington, DC. It also has regional offices in Ashburn, VA; Denver, CO; Federal Way, WA; and Anchorage, AK, as well as a training center in Ashburn, VA. The NTSB Reauthorization Act of 2006 requires the agency to have at least one full-time employee in states located more than 1,000 miles from a regional office for initial investigative response to accidents. The NTSB has regional offices in various states, with one aviation safety investigator in Hawaii. The five Safety Board members serve five-year terms and must be appointed from different political parties. The NTSB members are appointed from different political parties, with three members chosen based on technical qualifications. Investigative and support staff are organized by transportation mode, with the Office of Safety Recommendations and Communications handling safety issues and appeals for airmen and mariners. The Office of Safety Recommendations and Communications at NTSB tracks responses to safety recommendations, coordinates communications with Congress and stakeholders, and investigates various transportation accidents and safety issues. The NTSB investigates transportation accidents in the United States and its territories, including highway, railroad, pipeline, and marine accidents, as well as other catastrophic incidents. The NTSB relies on manufacturers, transportation providers, and regulatory agencies for expertise in investigations through the \"party process.\" Safeguards are in place to prevent external influence on NTSB findings. Interested parties can provide technical expertise in the fact-finding phase of an investigation and submit their own analyses for consideration by NTSB investigators. NTSB bases its conclusions strictly on analysis and recommendations by NTSB staff. Formal procedures allow parties to petition NTSB to reconsider or modify investigative findings after the final report is adopted. No party, other than the FAA in aviation cases, has a specific right to hold party status in an investigation; parties can be sanctioned or lose their status for non-compliance with assigned duties and rules of conduct. Despite safeguards in place, the potential for outside influence on NTSB investigations still exists, which could impact the agency's credibility. Balancing allowing parties to provide expertise with maintaining impartiality is crucial for the NTSB. Balancing parties' unique data and technical expertise in investigations while preventing influence is a challenge for the NTSB. Evaluating competing perspectives can prolong complex accident investigations, aligning with international aviation investigation standards. The NTSB collaborates with the ICAO in foreign aviation accident investigations involving U.S.-manufactured or -registered aircraft. They may assist in foreign investigations upon request, potentially being reimbursed for costs by outside entities. The NTSB collaborates with the ICAO in foreign aviation accident investigations involving U.S.-manufactured or -registered aircraft, potentially being reimbursed for costs by outside entities. P.L. 109-443 designated receipts from foreign activities as offsetting collections available until expended, expanding the types of reimbursements credited. The NTSB has recovered costs from foreign aviation accident investigations through DOT's Safe Skies for Africa program, with annual costs ranging from under $1 million to almost $2.4 million between FY2012 and FY2015. The NTSB issues safety recommendations to improve transportation safety, with over 14,300 recommendations issued since 1967. They do not have direct authority to change regulations but work with regulators, operators, and users to make safety improvements. Annual costs for foreign aviation accident investigations have ranged from $1 million to $2.4 million, with some costs covered under the Safe Skies for Africa program. The NTSB issues safety recommendations to improve transportation safety, with a high implementation rate. DOT agencies must respond to recommendations within 90 days. Public support is sought for transportation safety improvements. The NTSB issues safety recommendations for transportation safety improvements, seeking public support. Implementation may be delayed due to rulemaking processes and concerns about feasibility, costs, and benefits. The NTSB does not consider benefit/cost in its recommendations and highlights key safety recommendations on a \"Most Wanted\" list. The NTSB issues safety recommendations for transportation improvements, including reducing fatigue-related accidents, improving rail transit safety oversight, promoting collision avoidance technologies, strengthening occupant protection, minimizing operator distractions, preventing loss of control in flight, promoting completion of rail safety initiatives, ending substance impairment, and requiring operators to be medically fit for duty. These recommendations are part of the \"Most Wanted\" list for transportation safety improvements. The NTSB issues safety recommendations for transportation improvements, including requiring operators to be medically fit for duty. These recommendations influence regulatory agendas and congressional decision-making, leading to changes in legislation and regulations for transportation safety. The NTSB influences safety regulations for transportation, including laws on distracted driving, helicopter air ambulance safety, and pipeline safety. The FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016 incorporates NTSB recommendations for airline pilot training and records database implementation. The NTSB raised concerns about pilot understanding of automated systems and erosion of flying skills after the 2013 Asiana Airlines crash. FAA directed to assess mental health screening recommendations for pilots. International focus on pilot mental health after the 2015 Germanwings crash, following NTSB investigations into the 1997 SilkAir crash. The FAA was directed to evaluate and update standards for crash-resistant helicopter fuel systems following investigations into previous air crashes. This mandate was in response to a NTSB safety recommendation from July 2015. The Pipeline Safety Act of 2011 included provisions to enhance pipeline safety, such as increasing federal inspectors, requiring automatic shutoff valves, verifying operating pressure, raising penalties for violations, and reviewing diluted bitumen pipeline regulations. The Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 mandated positive implementation measures. The Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (RSIA08; P.L. 110-432) mandates positive train control on railroads carrying passengers or high-volume freight with hazardous materials. Positive train control is a technology to prevent incidents caused by operator or dispatcher errors, reducing speed-related incidents and engineer failure to obey signals. The NTSB has identified minimizing operator distractions as a key safety improvement, with Congress establishing a distracted driving incentive grant program in 2012. This program encourages states to prohibit texting for all drivers and cell-phone use for drivers under 18, with specific requirements for violations and fines. Only one state qualified for a grant under this program in FY2014 and FY2015. In December 2015, a provision in the FAST Act deleted the requirement for increased fines for repeat offenders, allowing more states to qualify for grants. The status of agency actions on transportation safety mandates may be of interest during NTSB reauthorization proceedings. Funding for the NTSB includes a base authorization amount and an emergency fund for unforeseen accident costs. The NTSB has an emergency fund for unforeseen accident costs like wreckage recovery and investigations. The fund has a $2 million maintenance balance with authorization to increase it to $4 million, but has not been used in over a decade. The NTSB has an emergency fund for unforeseen accident costs, with a $2 million maintenance balance that can be increased to $4 million, but it has not been used in over a decade. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) evaluates the NTSB's operations and activities, with the NTSB being responsive to GAO findings and fully implementing recommendations. In 2013, GAO revisited NTSB management practices, finding improvements but highlighting the need for further enhancements in training center utilization, safety recommendation close-out processes, interagency communications, financial management, and workforce diversity. GAO recommended developing a strategy for maximizing the utility of the NTSB's cost accounting system. Legislation reauthorizing the NTSB and congressional oversight focus on staffing resources, management of the NTSB Academy, safety issues like data privacy and recorder data use. Railroad safety legislation in the 114th Congress addresses NTSB funding for accident investigations. In 2008, the NTSB requested a staff increase. The NTSB requested a 22% staff increase in 2008 to enhance its accident investigation resources. Despite a 12% increase in staffing since then, limited resources have led to prolonged investigations and some cases going uninvestigated. The NTSB requested a 22% staff increase in 2008 to enhance accident investigation resources, but limited resources have led to prolonged investigations and uninvestigated cases. Congress may debate the need for additional staffing to investigate all fatal railroad accidents and consider options to recruit and retain field investigators and specialists. The NTSB faces staffing challenges in critical science and engineering fields, with concerns about potential shortages due to retirements and skill gaps. The most acute challenges are in the Office of Railroad, Pipeline, and Hazardous Materials. The NTSB was granted authority to enter agreements for facilities, technical services, and training under the National Transportation Safety Board Amendments Act of 2000. The NTSB was authorized to enter agreements for facilities and training under the National Transportation Safety Board Amendments Act of 2000. A 20-year contract was awarded to George Washington University for a training site in 2000. The NTSB Training Center was completed in August 2003 on GWU's Loudon County Campus in Ashburn, VA. Despite efforts to achieve financial self-sufficiency, the center operates at a deficit. The NTSB Training Center was established in 2003 at George Washington University's Loudon County Campus in Ashburn, VA. It aims to train NTSB staff and industry personnel for accident investigations and victim assistance. Despite efforts for financial self-sufficiency, the center operates at a deficit due to inadequate revenues from training fees and meetings. The NTSB Training Center, established in 2003, aims to train staff and industry personnel for accident investigations. Despite efforts for financial self-sufficiency, the center operates at a deficit due to inadequate revenues. The GAO study in 2006 highlighted challenges in recovering training center costs and noted violations of the Anti-Deficiency Act related to lease negotiations. Language to address this was not included in NTSB reauthorization legislation. The GAO identified possible remedies for the NTSB Training Center's financial deficit, including renegotiating the lease, terminating it, or vacating the space. However, the potential benefits of the facility were not fully considered in the analysis. Congressional oversight is needed to weigh the costs and benefits of maintaining the training center. The NTSB Training Center's financial deficit has improved with increased utilization and lease revenue, resulting in a reduced operating deficit. However, the facility still does not fully recover all operating costs, prompting the need for congressional oversight to assess the benefits of maintaining the training center. The NTSB Training Center's financial deficit has improved with increased utilization and lease revenue, resulting in a reduced operating deficit. Congress may have limited ability to make significant changes before the expiration of the NTSB's lease agreement. Data recorders are crucial investigative tools in aviation, but issues exist with prompt recovery after accidents and concerns about privacy and public disclosures. Issues exist with prompt recovery of recorders after accidents, especially for non-accident related uses. Recent incidents include Air France flight 447, EgyptAir flight 804, and Malaysia Airlines flight 370, where recorders were difficult to recover and extract data from. The NTSB issued aviation safety recommendations after the Malaysia Airlines flight 370 incident in 2014, urging for improved technology to transmit data and recover flight recorders without underwater retrieval. They also called for harmonization of regulations with foreign aviation authorities to prevent disabling of flight recorders. The NTSB issued safety recommendations after the Malaysia Airlines flight 370 incident, calling for improved technology to transmit data and recover flight recorders. The Safe Aviation and Flight Emergency Tracking Act of 2015 aims to equip large passenger aircraft with continuous tracking technology and deployable flight recorders. The sinking of the U.S.-flag cargo vessel El Faro in October 2015 raised concerns over locating and recovering maritime voyage data recorders. The recorder, affixed to the mast, was recovered 10 months later at a depth of 15,000 feet. Certain passenger and large cargo vessels are required to carry voyage data recorders under SOLAS regulations, which can be fixed-mount or float-free units. Updated regulations from 2014 specify the types of recorders that must be carried. Revised regulations from 2014 require new ships to have both fixed-mount and float-away voyage data recorders, with additional parameters and longer data capture. Concerns over data recovery may lead to congressional interest in assisting investigators with data retrieval from lost vessels. The Driver Privacy Act of 2015 (S. 766) aims to restrict access to data from event data recorders in passenger vehicles to only the owner or lessee, unless authorized by a court. The Driver Privacy Act of 2015 restricts access to data from event data recorders in passenger vehicles to the owner or lessee, unless authorized by a court or for specific purposes like vehicle diagnostics, service, repair, or emergency medical response to a motor vehicle crash. The bill requires the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to study and regulate the amount of time event data recorders should capture vehicle-related data for crash investigations. Increased interest in railroad accident investigations and safety recommendations has been prompted by recent train derailments. The NTSB lacks resources to investigate all railroad accidents as required by statute. The Comprehensive Transportation and Consumer Protection Act of 2015 specifies funding for NTSB railroad accident investigations and addresses safety recommendations. The Comprehensive Transportation and Consumer Protection Act of 2015 addresses NTSB railroad safety recommendations by requiring specific plans for positive train control systems, granting authority for implementation, and conducting a study on their effectiveness in reducing highway-rail grade crossing accidents."
