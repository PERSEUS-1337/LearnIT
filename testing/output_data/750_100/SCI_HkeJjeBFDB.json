    "content": "Knowledge distillation is a model compression technique where a smaller model mimics a larger pretrained model. To deploy compact models effectively, reducing performance gap and enhancing robustness to perturbations is crucial. Noise plays a significant role in improving neural networks training by addressing the goals of generalization and robustness. Inspired by trial-to-trial brain variability, introducing noise at input or supervision levels improves model generalization and robustness. Techniques like \"Fickle Teacher\" using dropout and \"Soft Randomization\" enhance output distribution matching. Adding Gaussian noise to the student model's output from the teacher on the original image enhances adversarial robustness significantly. Random label corruption also has a surprising impact on model robustness. Incorporating constructive noise in knowledge distillation frameworks can lead to improved performance. Designing Deep Neural Networks for real-world deployment requires consideration of memory, computational requirements, performance, reliability, and security, especially in resource-constrained environments. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) deployed in resource-constrained devices or applications with strict latency requirements need compact models that generalize well. Performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data is crucial, along with robustness to malicious attacks. Various techniques like model quantization and pruning have been proposed for achieving high performance in compressed models. In the study, the focus is on knowledge distillation, a method where a smaller network is trained under the supervision of a larger pre-trained network. This interactive learning approach aims to bridge the performance gap between the student and teacher models. An optimal method of transferring knowledge from a larger network to a smaller model is still a challenge despite performance gains. Incorporating methods to improve the student model's robustness to perturbations is crucial for real-world deployment. Inspiration is drawn from neuroscience studies on human learning to enhance knowledge distillation techniques. Neuroplasticity is essential for learning, as connections between neurons constantly change. Learning in children occurs through collaboration, interaction with the environment, and observations of others. Cognitive bias and trial-to-trial response variation are key learning theories. Human decision-making often deviates from rationality due to heuristics, leading to sub-optimal outcomes. Introducing constructive noise in collaborative learning can deter cognitive biases like memorization and over-generalization in neural networks by mimicking trial-to-trial response variation in humans. Introducing noise in knowledge distillation can improve learning by preventing memorization and over-generalization in neural networks. The study explores the effects of different types of noise on model generalization and robustness in the teacher-student collaborative learning framework. The study introduces novel approaches for improving generalization and robustness in the teacher-student learning framework by using noise. One method, \"Fickle Teacher,\" transfers uncertainty from the teacher model to the student using Dropout. Another method, \"Soft Randomization,\" utilizes Gaussian noise in knowledge distillation to enhance adversarial robustness while limiting the drop in generalization. Random label corruption is also discussed as a way to prevent cognitive bias. The presence of noise in the nervous system affects its function. Noise is a common regularization technique used to improve generalization performance in deep neural networks. Various noise techniques have been shown to enhance performance. Many noise techniques, such as Dropout and gradient noise injection, have been proven to improve generalization in non-convex optimization. Randomization techniques that inject noise during training and inference have shown effectiveness against adversarial attacks. Randomized smoothing can transform any classifier into a new smooth classifier with certifiable l2-norm robustness guarantees. Label smoothing improves deep neural network performance, but it may impair knowledge distillation. Adding constructive noise to the knowledge distillation framework could lead to lightweight models with improved robustness. CIFAR-10 was chosen for empirical analysis due to its relevance in knowledge distillation and robustness research. In the study, CIFAR-10 was selected for its relevance in knowledge distillation and robustness research. The experiments focused on noise addition in the knowledge distillation framework using the Hinton method. Wide Residual Networks (WRN) were used for experimentation with normalization of images and standard training schemes. To evaluate the generalization of models, ImageNet images from the CINIC dataset were used. Adversarial robustness was tested using the Projected Gradient Descent attack and robustness to corruptions and perturbations in CIFAR-C was assessed. Details of the methods can be found in the appendix. In this section, different types of noise are injected in the student-teacher learning framework of knowledge distillation to analyze their effect on model generalization and robustness. Signal-dependent noise is added to the output logits of the teacher model, with zero-mean Gaussian noise proportional to the output logits in each sample. The study explores noise levels ranging from 0 to 0.5 in steps of 0.1, showing that random signal-dependent noise improves generalization to the CIFAR-10 test set compared to the Hinton method without. Our method introduces noise during knowledge distillation to improve model generalization and adversarial robustness, contrasting with M\u00fcller et al.'s findings on the impact of noise on distillation effectiveness. Our method introduces noise during knowledge distillation to improve model generalization and adversarial robustness. Dropout is used in the teacher model to add variability in the supervision signal, leading to different output predictions for the same input image. This approach contrasts with previous findings on the impact of noise on distillation effectiveness. Our method introduces noise during knowledge distillation to improve model generalization and adversarial robustness. Gurau et al. utilize knowledge distillation to calibrate a student model with the same architecture as the teacher model using soft target distribution obtained by averaging Monte Carlo samples. Our method differs by using dropout for uncertainty encoding noise and training the student for more epochs to capture teacher uncertainty directly. Training the student model with dropout using our scheme significantly improves both in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization over the Hinton method, even when the teacher model's performance decreases after a dropout rate of 0.2. The proposed method compares generalization and robustness for dropout rates in the range [0 \u2212 0.5] at intervals of 0.1. The model's performance improves with dropout rates up to 0.4, increasing both PGD Robustness and natural robustness. Adding trial-to-trial variability helps distill knowledge to the student model, improving adversarial robustness with noise injection but at the cost of generalization. Our method involves adding Gaussian noise to input images in the knowledge distillation framework to improve adversarial robustness while mitigating the loss in generalization. Adding Gaussian noise to input images in the knowledge distillation framework improves adversarial robustness and reduces generalization loss. The proposed method surpasses the compact model trained with Gaussian noise alone, achieving higher generalization and robustness. This method enhances adversarial robustness even at lower noise levels, with a significant performance increase compared to the student model trained without teacher assistance. Our method enhances adversarial robustness by achieving 33.85% compared to 3.53% for the student model trained alone with \u03c3 = 0.05. It also improves robustness to common corruptions, such as noise and blurring, weather corruptions except for fog and frost, and digital corruptions except for contrast and saturation. The robustness varies at different intensities, allowing for the use of lower noise intensity to increase adversarial robustness. Our method proposes a regularization technique based on label noise to increase adversarial robustness while maintaining low generalization loss. By randomly changing target labels with a certain probability during training, we aim to address over generalization in deep neural networks. The curr_chunk discusses the use of random label noise as a source of constructive noise to improve model generalization. Previous studies have focused on improving DNN tolerance to noisy labels, but not specifically explored random label noise for this purpose. The curr_chunk extensively studies the effect of random label corruption on model generalization, including various types of noise such as Gaussian noise, impulse noise, and blur. The study examines the impact of label corruption on teacher and student models during knowledge distillation. The study explores the impact of random label corruption on model generalization, showing that knowledge distillation outperforms the teacher model for high levels of corruption. Training with random labels significantly increases adversarial robustness, with a notable improvement even at 5% corruption. The study introduces variability in the knowledge distillation framework through noise at different levels, improving generalization and robustness. The Fickle teacher method enhances in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization while also slightly boosting robustness to perturbations. Soft randomization significantly enhances the adversarial robustness of the student model trained with Gaussian noise, reducing the drop in generalization. Random label corruption alone also boosts adversarial robustness and generalization. Injecting noises to increase trial-to-trial variability in knowledge distillation shows promise for training compact models with good generalization and robustness. In this section, Hinton et al. proposed a method for training compact models with good generalization and robustness by using the final softmax function with a raised temperature and smooth logits of the teacher model as soft targets for the student model. The method involves minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between output probabilities, with hyperparameters \u03c4 and \u03b1 representing temperature and balancing ratio. In the real world, models often face domain shift, affecting their generalization performance. Test set performance alone is not enough to evaluate generalization. Out-of-distribution performance was measured using ImageNet images from the CINIC dataset. The performance of models trained on CIFAR-10 on 2100 images from the CINIC dataset can approximate out-of-distribution performance. Deep Neural Networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing a threat to their real-world deployment. Robustness to these attacks has gained significant attention in the research community. The research community has focused on evaluating and defending models against adversarial attacks. The Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attack is used to assess adversarial robustness by adding random noise within an epsilon bound to the original image. The research community evaluates and defends models against adversarial attacks using the Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attack. This attack adds random noise within an epsilon bound to the original image, moving in the direction of loss with a step size and clipping it within the valid image range. The model needs to be robust to both adversarial attacks and naturally occurring perturbations for overall security and performance. Recent studies have shown that Deep Neural Networks are vulnerable to commonly occurring perturbations in the real world, which can significantly degrade classifier accuracy. Gu et al. (2019) found that state-of-the-art classifiers are brittle to minute transformations in video frames, referred to as natural robustness. They also identified robustness to synthetic color distortions as a good proxy for natural robustness. In the study, robustness to common corruptions and perturbations in CIFAR-C is used as a proxy for natural robustness. It is important to balance generalization and adversarial robustness in model training to avoid negative impacts on natural robustness. Ding et al. (2019) demonstrated the adverse effects of adversarially trained models on natural robustness. Adversarially trained models have a negative impact on natural robustness, as shown by Ding et al. (2019). These models improve robustness to mid and high frequency perturbations but worsen performance with low frequency perturbations. There is a trade-off between adversarial robustness and generalization, as highlighted in various studies. The studies by Tsipras et al. (2018), Ilyas et al. (2019), and Zhang et al. (2019) were conducted under an adversarial setting and may not apply to the general robustness of models. To address the uncertainty of the teacher model, a random swapping noise method is proposed, which swaps softmax logits based on a probability threshold. Two variants are suggested: Swap Top 2 and Swap All, where logits are swapped if the difference between them is below a certain threshold. Training scheme for distillation with dropout involves training the student model for more epochs to capture the uncertainty of the teacher model. Dropout rates of 0.1 and 0.2 are used, with training for 250 epochs and reducing the learning rate at specific intervals. This method aims to improve in-distribution generalization without significantly impacting robustness. For dropout rates of 0.3, training is extended to 300 epochs with learning rate reductions at 90, 180, and 240 epochs. Dropout rates of 0.4 and 0.5 require training for 350 epochs with learning rate reductions at 105, 210, and 280 epochs. Adversarial Robustness techniques improve student accuracy on unseen data but not generalization to out-of-distribution data. Various types of noise are explored for supervision enhancement. The curr_chunk discusses various types of blurs, noise, and transformations used in image processing, such as Gaussian blur, motion blur, zoom blur, brightness, fog, frost, snow, and contrast adjustments. It also mentions compression techniques like JPEG compression and pixelation."
