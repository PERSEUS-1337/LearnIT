The Biodiesel Promotion Act of 2002 incentivizes biodiesel use through a biodiesel fuels credit based on the biodiesel mixture credit, which calculates the credit amount for each qualified biodiesel mixture. The Biodiesel Promotion Act of 2002 offers a biodiesel mixture credit of 1 cent for each whole percentage point of biodiesel in a qualified biodiesel mixture, not exceeding 20 percentage points. A qualified biodiesel mixture is a blend of diesel and biodiesel sold by the taxpayer producing it for use as fuel. The Biodiesel Promotion Act of 2002 provides a 1 cent credit for each percentage point of biodiesel in a qualified mixture, up to 20 percentage points. Biodiesel used in the production of a qualified mixture must be sold or used in the taxpayer's trade or business for the credit to apply. The Biodiesel Promotion Act of 2002 provides a 1 cent credit for each percentage point of biodiesel in a qualified mixture, up to 20 percentage points. The credit does not apply to casual off-farm production of biodiesel mixtures. The credit amount may be reduced to account for any benefit received from other tax exemptions. Definitions and special rules apply for the credit. The term 'biodiesel' is defined as monoalkyl esters of long chain fatty acids from virgin vegetable oils for use in diesel engines.
