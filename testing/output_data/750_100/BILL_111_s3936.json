    "content": "The \"States as Energy Leaders for the Future Act\" or \"SELF Act\" defines terms like \"eligible entity\" and \"Secretary\" for the Clean Energy Grant Program. The Department of Energy established a program to provide grants to eligible entities for clean energy and carbon reduction measures, including renewable electricity standards, climate action plans, use of alternative fuel vehicles, energy efficiency in public buildings, and participation in greenhouse gas reduction programs. The Department of Energy program provides grants for clean energy initiatives such as renewable electricity standards, climate action plans, alternative fuel vehicles, energy efficiency in public buildings, on-bill financing for energy improvements, State tax incentives for clean energy components, innovative financing for clean energy technologies, best management practices for public utility commissions, and grid technology updates. The Department of Energy program offers grants for clean energy initiatives, including grid technology updates and implementation of carbon efficiency standards. Eligible entities must meet requirements set by the Secretary and submit an application containing necessary information. The Secretary determines grant recipients and amounts based on application information and criteria. Grant funds must be used for eligible purposes specified by the Secretary. Regulations for the program will be developed by the Secretary. The Secretary will issue regulations establishing criteria for grants under this Act, including eligible measures, application criteria, and a point system for reviewing applications, taking into account regional energy disparities. The Secretary will publish an explanation of how grants awarded under the Act will be evaluated based on criteria regulations. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal year 2011 under this Act is $5 billion, to be used by the Secretary. Additionally, a cost offset for clean energy grant program and deficit reduction is proposed by denying deductions for major integrated oil companies related to domestic production of oil, gas, or primary products. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 includes a provision for major integrated oil companies to qualify for oil-related production activities deductions. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows major integrated oil companies to qualify for oil-related production activities deductions, effective for taxable years starting after December 31, 2010."
