Section 17 of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 is amended to include pilot projects aimed at increasing work effort and reducing dependency in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The pilot projects for public assistance, such as the supplemental nutrition assistance program, will be selected based on criteria set by the Secretary. Criteria include enhancing employment and training programs, participating in evaluations, and providing data on participants' employment outcomes and public benefit receipt. The pilot projects for public assistance will be selected based on criteria set by the Secretary, including enhancing employment and training programs, collaborating with job training programs, replicability, and targeting various populations of work registrants. The curr_chunk describes how work registrants, including childless adults, parents, and individuals with low skills or limited work experience, are selected from various employment and training programs such as section 20 workfare, skills development, and post-employment support. The curr_chunk discusses post-employment support services for maintaining employment and education leading to a recognized credential. It emphasizes the need for geographic diversity and includes participants who are exempt. The Secretary will conduct an independent evaluation of pilot projects to measure their impact on participants' ability to find and retain employment, leading to increased household income and reduced dependency. A report to Congress is due by September 30, 2017. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress detailing the results and costs of pilot projects, as well as the dissemination of findings to State agencies. The Secretary will allocate $10,000,000 annually from 2014 to 2016 for pilot projects that show increased employment and earnings, with funds remaining available until used. These funds are designated for incorporating successful project components into State employment and training programs. The pilot projects funded under this Act must comply with its provisions, cover project costs and administration, provide information for independent evaluation, and cover evaluation costs. Federal funds allocated for pilot projects cannot replace non-Federal funds. Federal funds allocated for pilot projects under this Act may not replace non-Federal funds used for existing employment and training activities."
