    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Faster Access to Specialized Treatments Act\" or \"FAST Act\". Congress finds that the FDA plays a crucial role in ensuring the safety and effectiveness of new medicines. Regulatory innovation is key to addressing serious medical conditions by promoting investment in innovative treatments. Advances in medical sciences have led to a better understanding of diseases over the past two decades. Advances in bioinformatics have led to a deeper understanding of disease mechanisms. New targeted medicines are being developed using biomarkers and predictive toxicology. FDA should implement these innovations more broadly. Advances in bioinformatics have led to a deeper understanding of disease mechanisms, resulting in the development of new targeted medicines using biomarkers and predictive toxicology. FDA should implement more effective processes for expedited development and review of innovative new medicines for serious or life-threatening diseases, including rare conditions, using modern scientific tools earlier in the drug development cycle. This could lead to fewer, smaller, or shorter clinical trials without compromising FDA's high approval standards. The existing statutory authority governing expedited approval of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions should be amended to enhance FDA's authority to consider appropriate scientific data and expedite access to novel treatments for patients with a broad range of serious or life-threatening diseases. The FDA should apply accelerated approval and fast track provisions to expedite the development of treatments for serious or life-threatening diseases while maintaining safety standards. Section 506 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to allow expedited approval of drugs for serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. The Secretary can designate a new drug as a Fast Track Product to expedite its review if it is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease and addresses unmet medical needs. The sponsor of a new drug can request the Secretary to designate it as a fast track product, which must meet specific criteria within 60 days of the request. The Secretary can designate a drug as a fast track product if it meets specific criteria, expediting the development and review process for approval. The Secretary can designate a drug as a fast track product under specific criteria, expediting the approval process based on surrogate or clinical endpoints predicting clinical benefit. The Secretary can designate a drug as a fast track product based on endpoints predicting clinical benefit, supported by various types of evidence. Approval may be subject to specific requirements. The sponsor of a fast track drug must conduct post-approval studies to verify its effects on morbidity or mortality and submit promotional materials for review before dissemination. The Secretary may withdraw approval of a product approved under expedited procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct required post-approval studies diligently or if a study fails to verify predicted effects on morbidity or mortality. The Secretary may withdraw approval of a product if the sponsor fails to verify predicted effects on morbidity or mortality, if the product is not safe or effective, or if false promotional materials are disseminated. The Secretary can evaluate and start reviewing parts of a fast track product application before it is complete if the applicant provides a submission schedule and pays the required fee. The Secretary can evaluate and start reviewing parts of a fast track product application before it is complete if the applicant provides a submission schedule and pays the required fee. Any agreed time period for review of human drug applications does not apply until the application is complete. The Secretary is responsible for developing and distributing awareness efforts to various stakeholders. The Secretary is responsible for developing a program to encourage the development of surrogate and clinical endpoints, biomarkers, and scientific tools to predict clinical benefit for serious medical conditions with unmet needs. SEC. 4. GUIDANCE; AMENDED REGULATIONS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must issue draft guidance within one year of the enactment of the Act, followed by final guidance after public comment, to implement the amendments and amend regulations for accelerated approval. The Secretary must develop guidance to implement amendments for accelerated approval regulations, considering issues related to fast track processes for drugs designated for rare diseases and novel approaches to reviewing surrogate endpoints. The guidance for accelerated approval regulations includes considerations for surrogate endpoints based on pathophysiologic and pharmacologic evidence, especially for diseases with low prevalence. The issuance of guidance or regulations should not delay the review or approval of requests or applications. SEC. 5. INDEPENDENT REVIEW. The Secretary will contract an independent entity to evaluate the FDA's application of new drug review processes and their impact on innovative treatments for serious conditions. Consultation with regulated industries, patient advocacy groups, disease research foundations, and academic medical centers is required for any evaluation of new drug review processes by the FDA. The amendments to section 506(b) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act encourage innovative approaches for product assessment under accelerated approval, while maintaining safety and effectiveness standards."
