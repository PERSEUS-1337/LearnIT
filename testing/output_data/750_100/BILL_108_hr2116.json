The Tar Creek Superfund Site in Ottawa County, Oklahoma, was a lead and zinc mining area from the early 1900s to the 1970s. It is part of the Tri-State Mining District and is prone to flooding due to its location. Mining companies had to pump water from the Boone Aquifer. Mining at the Tar Creek Superfund Site on Indian land controlled by the Bureau of Indian Affairs during World War I accounted for a significant portion of the Nation's wartime lead and zinc consumption. The mining operations generated millions of tons of waste tailings, known as chat, which in 1923 led to the recommendation of stockpiling aboveground for future reprocessing. During World War II, the Department of the Interior recommended stockpiling chat aboveground at the Tar Creek Superfund Site. In 1960, Congress passed an act to encourage lead and zinc production at the site. By the early 1970s, as mining decreased, underground mine workings began to refill with water, leading to the creation of acid mine water from dissolved sulfide minerals. In 1979, acid mine water started discharging at the surface from multiple locations at the Tar Creek Superfund Site. By 1983, the Site was added to the National Priorities List, and in 1984, the Environmental Protection Agency initiated efforts to remediate the acid mine water. Despite spending millions of dollars, in 1994, the EPA determined it was nearly impossible to remediate the water due to the presence of over 1,300 mine shafts and 100,000 boreholes at the Site. The Tar Creek Superfund Site has at least 100,000 boreholes and open mine shafts that recharge underground mine workings. Millions of tons of chat, laced with toxic heavy metals like lead, scar the surface area. The stockpiled chat contributes to flood problems in the area and stores water that recharges the underground mine workings. The stockpiled chat at the Tar Creek Superfund Site has been used in construction, contaminating residential areas with heavy metals like lead. The Environmental Protection Agency started remediation work in 1994 due to unsafe lead levels in residential yards. Studies show many children at the site have elevated blood lead levels. The stockpiled chat at the Tar Creek Superfund Site poses health risks, including elevated blood lead levels in children and cave-ins due to underground cavities left by mining. Despite scientific studies highlighting the danger of chat dust, no government agency has taken action to address the hazards. The Tar Creek Superfund Site poses subsidence dangers and cannot be made safe for human habitation. No comprehensive epidemiological studies have been conducted at the Site. The Tar Creek Superfund Site poses subsidence dangers and cannot be made safe for human habitation. No comprehensive epidemiological studies have been conducted at the Site. Assistance. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will provide assistance under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 to residents in the 17 square mile area identified in Governor Keating's Tar Creek Superfund Task Force Final Report. This includes the communities of Picher and Cardin in Oklahoma. The EPA will be considered the displacing agency for the application of the Act. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will work with other officials to address environmental and health issues at the Tar Creek Superfund site, without relieving any agency of cleanup responsibilities under the law."
