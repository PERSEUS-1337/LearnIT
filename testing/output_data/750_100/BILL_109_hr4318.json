    "content": "The \"Outer Continental Shelf Natural Gas Relief Act\" allows for the termination of prohibitions on expenditures for offshore gas leasing. The \"Outer Continental Shelf Natural Gas Relief Act\" terminates prohibitions on expenditures for offshore gas leasing and revokes withdrawals of Federal submerged lands for leasing purposes. SEC. 10 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act requires state approval for gas leasing. The Secretary cannot grant gas leases within 20 miles of a state's coastline without the state's approval. Additionally, at least 75 percent of lease sales in each 5-year program must be for gas leasing. The amendment requires offering at least 75 percent of available unleased acreage for gas leasing in each Outer Continental Shelf planning area. This applies to the 5-year Outer Continental Shelf gas leasing program in effect and future programs. SEC. 4. SHARING OF REVENUES. Section 8(g) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act is amended to include provisions regarding bonus bids and royalties for new Federal gas leases on submerged lands after September 30, 2006. Federal gas leases on submerged lands within a State's seaward boundaries result in 40% payment to the State and 10% for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program. Amounts received by the US from bonus bids and royalties under existing gas leases are also specified. Under the Outer Continental Shelf Natural Gas Relief Act, States receive 10% of amounts from bonus bids and royalties in the first full fiscal year after enactment, and 10% in the second year. In the third full fiscal year after enactment, 30 percent of amounts received increase to 40 percent in the fourth year and each year thereafter for leased tracts partially within state seaward boundaries. The text discusses the distribution of bonus bids and royalties for leased tracts partially within a state's seaward boundaries based on the percentage of surface acreage within those boundaries. The definitions in this paragraph distinguish between existing federal gas leases granted before the Outer Continental Shelf Natural Gas Relief Act and new federal gas leases granted after the Act's enactment. The Natural Gas Relief Act applies to bonus bids and royalties received by the United States after September 30, 2006. The State Seaward Boundaries are established under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, with extended lines indicated on maps for each outer Continental Shelf region. The State Seaward Boundaries are established under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, with extended lines indicated on maps for each outer Continental Shelf region, including the Region State Adjacent Zones and OCS Planning Areas in the Pacific, Gulf of Mexico, and Atlantic OCS regions dated September 2005. SEC. 5. NATURAL GAS-ONLY LEASING. Section 8 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act is amended to allow the Secretary to issue leases for natural gas and associated condensate production only, with specific regulations to be followed. The Secretary can issue leases for natural gas and associated condensate production, with regulations on rights, obligations, and procedures for oil deposits. The Secretary can issue natural gas-only leases for the outer Continental Shelf, with regulations similar to oil and gas leases. Existing oil and gas leases can be restricted to natural gas and associated condensate development upon request. The Secretary may also implement oil and gas leasing programs. The Secretary may issue natural gas-only leases for the outer Continental Shelf without amending the existing leasing program, with public notice and comment required. The Secretary may issue natural gas-only leases in the outer Continental Shelf leasing program for the 5-year period starting in 2007, regardless of any previous draft proposals."
