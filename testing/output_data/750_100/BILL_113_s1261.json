The National Energy Conservation Policy Act is amended to include a Federal Implementation Strategy for Energy-Efficient and Energy-Saving Information and Communications Technologies, requiring collaboration between Federal agencies and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. The National Energy Conservation Policy Act is amended to include a Federal Implementation Strategy for Energy-Efficient and Energy-Saving Information and Communications Technologies. Federal agencies collaborate with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to develop flexible, cost-effective strategies based on agency requirements and missions. The Federal agencies are required to consider information and communications technologies (ICT) and related infrastructure and practices, such as advanced metering infrastructure, ICT services and products, efficient data center strategies, and power management. The Federal agencies must consider ICT and related infrastructure, such as advanced metering infrastructure, efficient data center strategies, and power management. They should also focus on building information modeling, secure telework tools, and travel substitution tools to increase efficiency and savings. Performance goals need to be established within 180 days of the enactment of this subsection. The Director, in consultation with the Secretary, will establish performance goals for evaluating Federal agencies' efforts in improving energy-efficient ICT systems and practices, including specifications for data center operators to make informed energy decisions. The Director, in consultation with the Secretary, will establish performance goals for evaluating Federal agencies' efforts in improving energy-efficient ICT systems and practices, including specifications for data center operators to make informed energy decisions, focusing on energy efficiency, cost savings, asset utilization, and best practices for achieving benchmarks. The Director, in consultation with the Secretary, will establish performance goals for evaluating Federal agencies' efforts in improving energy-efficient ICT systems and practices, including specifications for data center operators to make informed energy decisions. Performance goals will measure information technology costs over a specific time period of 3 to 5 years and cost savings attained via energy-efficient solutions. The Director will maintain a Governmentwide Data Center Task Force comprised of Federal data center program managers, facilities managers, and sustainability officers to provide a complete picture of all costs and savings, including energy costs and savings. The task force members are responsible for sharing progress towards agency and Federal energy efficiency goals and exchanging best practices with the private sector. Each Federal agency must include reports on their energy efficiency efforts. The agency must report its efforts and results under a specific subsection in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The Director of OMB will also include a description of agency efforts in the annual report and scorecard required by the same Act. The agency must report its efforts and results under a specific subsection in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The Director of OMB will include a description of agency efforts in the annual report and scorecard required by the same Act. \"Energy efficient data centers are addressed in Section 3.\" Section 453 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to designate an information technology industry organization to coordinate the program described in subsection (b) within 30 days of the Energy Efficient Government Technology Act's enactment. The designation must be made public, including on a website. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to require a study on server and data center energy efficiency updates by December 31, 2013, comparing original estimates with new data from 2007 to 2012. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to require a study on server and data center energy efficiency updates by December 31, 2013, comparing original estimates with new data from 2007 to 2012. The study includes an analysis of the impact of information and communications technologies asset utilization solutions, virtualization, and cloud computing-based solutions in both public and private sectors, along with updated projections and recommendations for best practices. Collaboration with a designated organization is also mandated for report preparation. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 requires a study on server and data center energy efficiency updates by December 31, 2013. This includes an analysis of the impact of technology solutions in public and private sectors. Additionally, a Data Center Energy Practitioner Program is established for evaluating energy usage and efficiency opportunities in data centers every 4 years. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 mandates a study on server and data center energy efficiency by December 31, 2013. A Data Center Energy Practitioner Program is established for assessing energy usage and efficiency in data centers every 4 years. The Secretary, in collaboration with designated organizations, will establish an open data initiative for Federal data center energy usage data to promote innovation while safeguarding national security interests. The Secretary will establish an open data initiative for Federal data center energy usage data to promote innovation while safeguarding national security interests. Collaboration with designated organizations will harmonize global specifications and metrics for data center energy efficiency. The Secretary will establish an open data initiative for Federal data center energy usage data to promote innovation while safeguarding national security interests. This initiative will focus on improving the energy efficiency of data centers, including information and communications technology systems and related infrastructure."
