    "content": "The \"Biofuels Market Expansion Act of 2011\" ensures the availability of dual-fueled automobiles and light-duty trucks. The \"Biofuels Market Expansion Act of 2011\" mandates that manufacturers produce a minimum percentage of dual-fueled automobiles and light-duty trucks for sale in the United States. The \"Biofuels Market Expansion Act of 2011\" requires manufacturers to produce a certain percentage of dual-fueled vehicles for sale in the US, with 50% for model years 2014 and 2015, and 90% for model year 2016 and beyond. This does not apply to vehicles running solely on electricity. The \"Biofuels Market Expansion Act of 2011\" mandates the production of dual-fueled vehicles, with specific percentages required for different model years. The Secretary of Transportation must establish regulations within a year of the Act's enactment. Additionally, there is a provision for promoting blender pumps. Blender Pump Grant Program defines blender pump as a fuel dispenser for gasoline and ethanol blends, including E-85 fuel with 85% ethanol content. The term \"ethanol fuel blend\" refers to a mixture of gasoline and ethanol, with ethanol content ranging from 0% to 85%. A \"major fuel distributor\" is defined as a person who owns or markets the output of a refinery. The Secretary of Energy defines a \"major fuel distributor\" as a person who owns or markets the output of a refinery. The term \"distributor\" excludes those who market through less than 50 retail fueling stations. The Secretary will provide grants to eligible facilities for installing blender pump fuel infrastructure, including infrastructure for the direct retail sale of ethanol fuel blends like E-85 fuel. The Federal government provides grants and subgrants for installing fuel infrastructure, such as blender pumps and storage tanks, for direct retailers of ethanol fuel blends, excluding major fuel distributors. The Federal share of project costs can be up to 50 percent. The Federal government provides grants and subgrants for installing fuel infrastructure, such as blender pumps and storage tanks, for direct retailers of ethanol fuel blends. If a recipient does not offer ethanol fuel blends for sale for at least 2 years within a 4-year period, they must repay the grant amount. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorization of appropriations for installing blender pumps by major fuel distributors at owned and branded stations includes $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2012, $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2013, $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2014, $300,000,000 for fiscal year 2015, and $350,000,000 for fiscal year 2016. The Act is amended to include the installation of blender pumps by major fuel distributors at owned and branded stations, defining E-85 fuel as a blend of gasoline with approximately 85% ethanol content, and ethanol fuel blend as a blend of gasoline and ethanol with 0-85% ethanol content. The term 'major fuel distributor' refers to a person owning a refinery or directly marketing its output, excluding those marketing through less than 50 retail fueling stations. The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the EPA Administrator and the Secretary of Agriculture, will promulgate regulations for major fuel distributors selling gasoline in the US to ensure installation of equipment at owned or branded stations. The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the EPA Administrator and the Secretary of Agriculture, will promulgate regulations for major fuel distributors to install blender pumps dispensing E-85 fuel and ethanol blends at owned or branded stations for a minimum of 5 years. The applicable percentage for majority-owned and branded stations will be determined according to a specified table. The applicable percentage for majority-owned and branded stations is as follows: 10% in 2014, 20% in 2016, 35% in 2018, and 50% from 2020 onwards. The Secretary must ensure major fuel distributors install blender pumps dispensing E-85 and ethanol blends at a minimum percentage of their stations in each State. The Secretary mandates major fuel distributors to install blender pumps dispensing E-85 and ethanol blends in each State where they operate. Financial responsibility is also required for compliance. The major fuel distributors must take full financial responsibility for installing blender pumps and necessary equipment to ensure proper function. The major fuel distributor earns credits for installing blender pumps at majority-owned and branded stations, which can be used in the following three calendar years. A major fuel distributor can earn credits for installing blender pumps at their stations and sell these credits to another distributor. However, purchased credits cannot be used to fulfill the geographic distribution requirement. SEC. 4. LOAN GUARANTEES FOR PROJECTS TO CONSTRUCT RENEWABLE FUEL PIPELINES. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to include definitions for \"renewable fuel\" and \"renewable fuel pipeline.\" The term \"renewable fuel\" now includes all types of ethanol and biodiesel. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to include renewable fuel pipelines as eligible for guarantees under section 1703(b)(11). The guarantee amount for such projects is set at 80% of the project cost. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to include rapid deployment of renewable fuel pipelines as eligible for guarantees under section 1705. This includes installing infrastructure for cost-effective deployment of clean energy technologies in the United States. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to allow for the deployment of renewable fuel pipelines through loan guarantees. The Secretary of Energy must establish regulations within 90 days of the Act's enactment to implement these changes."
