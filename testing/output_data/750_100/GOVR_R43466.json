    "content": "Children in foster care have higher rates of mental health care needs and are more likely to be prescribed psychotropic medications. These medications are used to treat various mental health conditions, but there is limited evidence on their safety and efficacy in children. Congress is closely monitoring how states regulate the use of psychotropic medications for foster children. Congress is closely monitoring how states regulate the use of psychotropic medications for children in foster care, as required by federal child welfare law. Efforts by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services aim to assist states in ensuring appropriate use of these medications. Child welfare agencies investigate abuse or neglect of children by parents or guardians. Some children are placed in foster care for round-the-clock care. State monitoring of psychotropic medication use for foster children is discussed. The child was removed from their home due to welfare concerns and placed in foster care. Foster care is a temporary solution until reunification with parents or a permanent placement is found. During FY2015, 671,000 children spent time in foster care, with 243,000 leaving the system. Approximately 428,000 children remained in care by the end of the fiscal year, showing a decline in the national foster care caseload over the past decade. About 77,000 fewer children were in foster care on the last day of FY2015 compared to FY2006. Children in foster care have higher mental health service needs due to abuse or neglect before entering care, which can lead to difficulty regulating emotions and socialization issues. In a national survey conducted in 2008 and 2009, a significant number of children placed in foster care homes or institutions following allegations of abuse or neglect were found to be at risk of behavioral or emotional problems, requiring mental health services. Rates of at-risk children in foster care were much higher than those in the general population. Children in foster care, especially those with Medicaid eligibility, are increasingly being diagnosed with mental health issues such as attention disorders, anxiety, autism, bipolar disorders, conduct disorders, depression, and schizophrenia. Medicaid provides health care services for nearly all children in foster care. In 2002-2007, children in foster care with Medicaid eligibility saw an increase in mental health disorder diagnoses. Older children were more likely to be diagnosed with conditions like conduct disorder and attention disorders. In 2002-2007, children in foster care with Medicaid eligibility saw an increase in mental health disorder diagnoses, with older children more likely to be diagnosed with conditions like conduct disorder and depression. National standards recommend mental health screenings for all children placed in foster care. Children in foster care should receive mental health screenings and assessments within a month of placement, with coordinated services to meet their ongoing needs. Medicaid provides diagnostic and treatment services for children in foster care, with each state designing its own plan for medical assistance. Children in foster care are eligible for Medicaid, which covers necessary health screenings and services through the EPSDT program. The EPSDT program under Medicaid covers health screenings, assessments, laboratory tests, immunizations, health education, and vision, dental, and hearing services for children. States must provide treatment for children's identified health needs, including mental health, using Medicaid financing for services like case management and treatment by psychiatrists, psychologists, or clinical social workers. Children with mental health challenges may benefit from psychosocial treatment provided by mental health professionals like psychiatrists, psychologists, or clinical social workers. Psychosocial treatment interventions such as behavioral therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, family-focused treatment, and group-based treatment have been found to be moderately effective in responding to mental disorders in children. CBT activities like anger management, conflict resolution, and social skills training are effective for children who have experienced trauma. Psychotropic medications may be prescribed to children in foster care when psychosocial treatment alone is not effective. Psychotropics may be prescribed without psychosocial therapies due to lack of resources. Medicaid highlights the need for timely access to behavioral health care for children in care. Children entering foster care are more likely to receive mental health supports compared to those who remain in their own homes following an investigation of alleged abuse or neglect. This disparity highlights the need for timely access to evidence-based psychosocial therapies for children in care. Research shows that children in foster care have higher rates of receiving mental health interventions compared to those who remain at home after investigations. Medicaid data from 20 states revealed an increase in psychosocial interventions for foster children on antipsychotic medication, while non-foster children had lower rates. However, studies indicate that not all foster children in need of mental health services receive them. Among children in foster care for 18 months or less with mental health needs, 3 out of 10 did not receive specialty mental health services or psychotropics, and 9% received psychotropics without services. Rates of psychotropic medication use vary based on factors like age, placement setting, and length of involvement with the child welfare agency, with 16-33% of children in out-of-home care using psychotropic medication on any given day. Children in foster care receive psychotropic medication at much higher rates than children generally, with those on Medicaid due to foster care status receiving medication at three to nine times the rate of other children on Medicaid. Research shows that children in non-relative foster homes are not more likely than child-welfare involved children in their own homes to receive medication. Rates of psychotropic medication use among children involved with the child welfare system, including those in foster care, vary by state and over time. Research from the early 2000s found great variation in prescription of psychotropic medication for these children. The researchers found that state practices in prescribing psychotropic medication, rather than differences in risk for mental health services, were the primary factor leading to variation. A study of Medicaid claims data from 2002 to 2007 showed variation in psychotropic medication use among children in foster care, with an initial increase followed by some decline in most states, but an increase in the use of antipsychotic medications. The study found that 45 states saw an increase in the use of antipsychotic medications among children in foster care from 2002 to 2007, with rates ranging from 2.8% to 21.7% in each state. Another review of Medicaid claims data in 20 states also showed a rise in medication use among children in foster care. The analysis revealed a rise in antipsychotic use among children in foster care from 2005 to 2008, followed by a slight decrease by 2010. Non-foster care children with Medicaid or private insurance had lower antipsychotic use. Privately insured children saw an increase in antipsychotic use from 2005 to 2009, remaining steady through 2013. Data from the NSCAW II was used to discuss psychotropic medication use among foster care children. NSCAW II examined psychotropic medication use among children in foster care, funded by HHS. The survey included 5,872 children in contact with the child welfare system due to abuse or neglect, analyzing medication prescriptions for children in foster care and those remaining in their homes. The NSCAW II survey analyzed psychotropic medication use among children in foster care and those in contact with the child welfare system due to abuse or neglect. The children's ages ranged from 2 months to 20 years at different follow-up points. They may have entered and re-entered care during the 18- or 36-month period. The NSCAW II data show that children in foster care or living with their own parents following an investigation of child abuse or neglect had different rates of psychotropic medication use. Children in foster care, especially those in congregate care and school age, were more likely to be taking psychotropic medications. At 18 months following the investigation, children in foster care were significantly more likely to be taking psychotropic medications than those who remained in their homes. By the 36-month follow-up, about one out of three children in care was taking psychotropics, compared to children who remained in their homes. Children in foster care, especially those in group homes or residential treatment programs, had a significantly higher rate of psychotropic medication use compared to those in foster family homes or formal kin care. The prevalence of medication use was highest among children in group foster care settings, with 48.2% of children using psychotropics within six months of initial investigation of abuse or neglect. This rate decreased to 11.8% to 19.5% for children in other foster care settings. Approximately 18 months after the initial investigation of child abuse or neglect, children in group settings were most likely to be prescribed psychotropics (67.4%), compared to children in other foster care settings. This pattern continued 36 months after the investigation, with over half of children in group settings taking psychotropics (52%). Children in foster care group homes or residential settings were most likely to be taking more than one psychotropic medication, with about half of them taking two or more drugs. This was higher compared to children in other types of foster care settings, their own homes, or informal kin care. At 36 months following the initial investigation, children in group settings had the highest rate of taking two or more psychotropic medications, followed by children in foster care, formal kin care, informal kin care, and those in their own homes. Children in group settings were also more likely to be using three or more psychotropic medications compared to children in other settings. Children in foster care, especially those of elementary and secondary school age, were more likely to be using psychotropic medication. Youth ages 11 to 17 had the highest usage, followed by ages 6 to 10, 18 and older, and 1.5 to 5 years. The oldest youth, ages 18 and older, were less likely to be taking psychotropic medications compared to children ages 6 through 17. Research literature describes the prescribing patterns for foster children as \"too many, too much, and too young.\" An analysis of national Medicaid claims data from 2002 through 2007 found that polypharmacy, defined as concurrent use of three or more psychotropic medication classes for at least 30 days during a one-year period, was consistent at about 5.2% to 5.9% annually among children in foster care. In 2011, polypharmacy with three or more antipsychotic drugs for at least 90 days was comparable for children with foster care status (2.8%) and non-foster care status. Data from the NSCAW II study shows that children in foster care prescribed psychotropics had an average of 1.9 medications per child. Concerns have been raised about the use of certain classes of psychotropics, like antipsychotics, concurrently, especially in group or residential settings where more children are prescribed three or more psychotropics. Concerns have been raised about antipsychotic polypharmacy in foster children, with dosages exceeding recommendations and limited research on safety and efficacy for children. There are also concerns about very young children being prescribed psychotropics. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that 2.2% of children under 6 in out-of-home care were prescribed psychotropics, with rates increasing with age among children ages 3 to 6 in foster care. Health experts are concerned about the use of psychotropic drugs in infants and young children in foster care, as it can lead to serious health effects. Children in foster care may have greater mental health needs and could benefit from psychotropic medications, but they may not always be effective. The lack of psychosocial services available may result in children in care receiving psychotropics more readily. The lack of psychosocial services for children in foster care may contribute to the increased use of antipsychotic medications, despite a decrease in overall prescribing rates. This trend raises concerns about the appropriate use of these drugs in treating behavioral conditions in this population. The share of children in foster care prescribed antipsychotic medication increased from 2005 to 2008, with a slight decrease in 2010. This trend is attributed to limited research on medication efficacy in children and pharmaceutical companies marketing drugs. Policymakers and stakeholders are scrutinizing the use of psychotropics by children in foster care. Growing scrutiny by policymakers and stakeholders in the child welfare field due to limited evidence on the safety and effectiveness of psychotropic use among children with mental health disorders, particularly antipsychotics. HHS review found insufficient evidence for the safety of these drugs in addressing child mental health disorders, including conditions like disruptive behavior disorders, obsessive compulsive disorders, and eating disorders. The analysis highlighted concerns about the use of psychotropic medication in children, including high risk of bias in studies, potential harmful health outcomes like high cholesterol and weight gain, and insufficient evidence for long-term outcomes. Despite these issues, some children in foster care may still be prescribed these medications. Some children in foster care may benefit from psychotropic medication for managing symptoms and issues associated with mental health and behavior concerns stemming from exposure to complex trauma, particularly if coupled with psychosocial services. Stimulants, such as those used for ADHD, have been well researched and found to effectively reduce core symptoms like hyperactivity and inattention. Children in foster care may benefit from psychotropic medication to manage symptoms of ADHD, including hyperactivity, impulsivity, inattention, and aggression. Higher levels of psychotropic drug use may be appropriate due to the increased prevalence and severity of mental health conditions in this population. Multiple foster care placements and inconsistent state oversight practices may contribute to the use of psychotropics. Congress has shown interest in overseeing prescription medications for children in foster care, particularly regarding their enrollment in clinical drug trials. This was highlighted in a 2005 hearing by the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources. As part of the Child and Family Services Improvement Act of 2006, state child welfare agencies were required to properly oversee prescription drug use by children in foster care. In 2006, Congress mandated state child welfare agencies to consult with medical professionals for assessing and treating children in foster care. Oversight of psychotropic medication use for these children was discussed in congressional hearings in 2007 and 2008. In 2008, Congress expanded requirements for states to consult with medical professionals on the health and well-being of children in foster care, ensuring access to health and mental health services, and oversight of prescribed medications. The coordinated strategy for oversight of drugs prescribed to children in foster care was amended in October 2011 to include protocols for psychotropic medication use. In December 2011, the Senate held an oversight hearing on state policies and regulations for oversight. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reviewed state policies and regulations for oversight of prescribing psychotropic medications in six states. The study compared state policies against best practice guidelines developed by the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) with support from HHS's SAMHSA. GAO found that each of the six state programs fell short of providing comprehensive oversight as defined by AACAP, with only one state (Texas) fully implementing consent procedures. According to the report, only Texas fully implemented consent procedures for psychotropic medications, as recommended by AACAP. States not following these guidelines may lead to caregivers being unaware of risks and benefits. GAO recommended HHS endorse guidance for monitoring psychotropic medications in foster care. Witnesses discussed HHS and state Medicaid's roles in the hearing. Witnesses at a hearing discussed the need for increased cooperation between HHS and state Medicaid programs to improve oversight of psychotropic medications in foster care. A 12-year-old former foster youth shared his experience with multiple mental health diagnoses and side effects from psychotropic medications. He also mentioned the therapist who was most helpful to him. In 2013, the Senate Finance Committee held a roundtable discussion on psychotropic medications for children in foster care. Current and former foster youth shared their experiences, noting that therapy helped them transition from medications. The importance of an invested caregiver or knowledgeable professional in mental health treatment was highlighted. In May 2014, the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources discussed the use of psychotropic medications among children in foster care and the efforts of states and the federal government to ensure appropriate mental health treatment. The stakeholders addressed the prevalence of medication use, alternatives to psychotropics, tools for determining medication necessity, and the roles of schools, mental health systems, and foster parents in decision-making. In May 2014, the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources discussed the use of psychotropic medications among children in foster care. Witnesses included the Associate Commissioner of HHS's Children's Bureau, GAO, a researcher focusing on medication use among children in care, and Dr. Phil McGraw. GAO highlighted their work from 2011 to 2014 on psychotropic medication prescription among children in foster care. The GAO examined documentation supporting the use of psychotropics among children in foster care in five states. Experts found varying quality in the documentation, with issues regarding dosage amounts and concurrent use of multiple medications. GAO recommended actions to HHS. The GAO recommended that HHS issue guidance to states on oversight of medication for children in foster care, particularly regarding psychotropic medication use. However, the guidance did not address the role of third-party managed care organizations in overseeing psychotropic use among foster children. State officials in seven states developed practices to support mental health diagnoses and treatment for children in foster care, including guidelines on prescribing psychotropic medications and promoting the use of psychosocial services. State officials in seven states collaborated with child welfare, Medicaid, and other agencies to implement oversight practices for mental health treatment in foster care, including guidelines on prescribing psychotropic medications and promoting psychosocial services. Key factors for successful implementation included strong collaboration, state outreach to stakeholders, and gradual rollout of new practices. State officials reported using various measures to assess the effectiveness of their efforts, such as monitoring physician prescribing practices. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) examined measures used by state officials to monitor mental health treatment in foster care, including physician prescribing practices and state oversight practices. GAO found that HHS has not convened meetings with stakeholders involved in state oversight of psychotropic medication use for children in care since 2014. GAO recommended that HHS find cost-effective ways to facilitate collaboration among state stakeholders on psychotropic medication. HHS has implemented federal requirements for monitoring psychotropic medication use among children, including those in foster care. Federal agencies have collaborated to understand and promote best practices for oversight of psychotropic medication use in children with mental health needs. Obama administration has been involved in these efforts for multiple years. The Obama Administration has proposed expanding funding for oversight of psychotropic medications for children with mental health needs. States under the Stephanie Tubbs Jones Child Welfare Services Program must develop a coordinated strategy and oversight plan to ensure access to health care, including mental health services, for children in foster care. The coordinated strategy for oversight of psychotropic medications for children in foster care must be developed collaboratively between the state child welfare agency, Medicaid agency, and health care experts. It should include a schedule for health screenings, monitoring and treatment of health needs, and sharing of medical information for children in care. The oversight of prescription medicines for children in foster care includes protocols for appropriate use and monitoring of psychotropic medications. The state actively involves medical professionals in assessing and treating the health of these children. Steps are taken to ensure continuity of health care services and the development of transition plans. Federal child welfare law requires state child welfare agencies to have a written plan for each child in foster care, including health-related records such as names of health providers, immunization records, medication information, and other relevant health details. These records must be reviewed, updated, and provided to foster care parents or providers at each placement. States and jurisdictions report to HHS on their policies regarding oversight of psychotropic medications through the Child and Family Services Plan and Annual Progress and Services Reports. This reporting is required for jurisdictions seeking federal funds under various child welfare programs. States and jurisdictions must report on their psychotropic medication oversight policies in the Child and Family Services Plan and Annual Progress and Services Reports to comply with federal funding requirements. The APSR instructions outline specific requirements for state oversight protocols, including screening, consent to treatment, medication monitoring, mental health expertise availability, and information sharing mechanisms. Subsequent program instructions have been less detailed, with the most recent CFSP covering FY2015-FY2019. The recent five-year CFSP for FY2015-FY2019 required jurisdictions to report on oversight of prescription medicines, including protocols for appropriate use and monitoring of psychotropic medications. An interagency working group was convened in 2011 by HHS to address research on psychotropic medication use among children in foster care and support state efforts in implementing requirements on psychotropics. The group developed a plan to expand evidence-based screening, diagnosis, interventions, strengthen medication oversight, and expand research on medications and psychosocial treatments. The interagency working group led by ACF aims to expand research on medications and psychosocial treatments for children in foster care, with representatives from CMS and SAMHSA involved in Medicaid financing for services and prescription drugs. SAMHSA administers block grant funding for non-Medicaid covered treatment services and provides technical assistance related to trauma in children. A letter from ACF, SAMHSA, and CMS in November 2011 addressed managing prescription medication use for children in foster care. The letter from ACF, SAMHSA, and CMS in November 2011 emphasized the importance of collaboration between State child welfare, Medicaid, and mental health authorities to improve mental health services for children in foster care, including medication use and prescription monitoring. They also discussed raising awareness about psychotropic use among these children. In 2012, HHS agencies provided guidance through webinars and information memoranda on oversight of psychotropic medication use among children in foster care. They held webinars presenting data and practices, followed by question and answer sessions for state child welfare and mental health leaders to enhance monitoring. In August 2012, HHS convened state directors of child welfare, Medicaid, and mental health agencies to address the use of psychotropic medications for children in foster care and trauma-experienced children. The summit aimed to enhance collaboration on medication oversight, identify areas for improvement, and outline implementation steps, activities, challenges, partners, and timelines for change. In April 2012, ACF provided guidance to state child welfare agencies on monitoring the use of psychotropic medication, synthesizing information based on guidelines from child welfare and medical professionals. ACF issued guidance in April 2012 to state child welfare agencies on improving behavioral and social-emotional outcomes for children who have experienced abuse and neglect. This guidance focuses on coordinated planning, shared decision-making, medication monitoring, mental health expertise, and information sharing. States are required to report on the implementation of these elements in their monitoring of psychotropic drug use for children in foster care. ACF issued guidance in April 2012 to state child welfare agencies on improving outcomes for children who have experienced abuse and neglect, focusing on brain development's impact on social and emotional development. ACF also published guides on tools for youth in foster care to ask questions about medications and mental health issues for child welfare staff and foster parents. Additionally, FY2012 funds were awarded to support projects assisting youth in child welfare with mental health issues. ACF provided funds in FY2013 to support projects for youth in child welfare with mental and behavioral health needs. SAMHSA also funded the development of guidelines on prescribing medications for children and youth, focusing on clinical practice, monitoring, and research. SAMHSA funds a medical director position to work with child and adolescent psychiatrists on psychotropic medication issues. The network disseminates best practices through webinars and a community listerv. CMS issued a bulletin in 2012 to address psychotropic medication use in vulnerable populations. The bulletin in 2012 addressed the use of psychotropic medication in vulnerable populations, including children in foster care. States are required to have Drug Utilization Review programs to oversee drug prescribing for Medicaid beneficiaries, with examples of oversight methods such as automated system \"edit checks\" and multidisciplinary teams. In 2015, CMS assisted a working group of state Medicaid agencies to improve appropriate use of antipsychotic medications for children on Medicaid. A new measure was added to core measures for states to enhance healthcare delivery to children on Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program. The CMS, ACF, and SAMHSA issued guidance in July 2013 emphasizing the importance of providing psychosocial interventions to children who have experienced \"complex trauma.\" This includes children in foster care who may be more likely to receive psychotropic medication improperly due to the complexity of their symptoms. States can utilize existing federal funding and authority to offer these interventions. The guidance issued in July 2013 emphasized the importance of providing psychosocial interventions to children with complex trauma, including those in foster care who may be prescribed psychotropics improperly. It promoted the use of functional assessments, trauma screening, mental health assessment, and outcome measurement to ensure proper treatment services for children's well-being. President Obama's FY2017 budget proposed measures to address these issues. President Obama's FY2017 budget proposed a five-year joint initiative between CMS and ACF to reduce reliance on psychotropic medications for children in foster care and improve their well-being through performance-based incentive payments to state Medicaid agencies. This initiative would focus on improved care coordination and delivery of evidence-based psychosocial interventions to Medicaid-eligible children served by child welfare agencies, with a total of $500 million in incentive funding across five years. Incentive payments would be paid annually from the Medicaid program over a five-year period. States could also apply for competitive grant funding under the Title IV-E Foster Care program to implement alternative psychosocial interventions. ACF would support child welfare funding for capacity building and fidelity to evidence-based interventions, while evaluating this work. The research literature focuses on states overseeing psychotropic medication use for children in foster care, including obtaining consent and monitoring procedures. Surveys have been conducted to learn about state policies, but none address how states have responded to the federal provision on oversight added in September 2011. States have responded to the federal provision on oversight of psychotropic medications for children in foster care. A survey of 48 states found that over half rated psychotropic medication use as a high concern. At the time of the survey, 26 states had a policy on psychotropic medication use, 13 were developing one, and 9 had none. Over half of states used a \"red flag\" marker to identify issues with psychotropic drug use, such as in young children or multiple medications. Researchers found that various states had different approaches to psychotropic medication use in children in foster care, but there was little evidence of systematic implementation or study to determine which approaches were effective. Concerns have been raised about the availability of policies and procedures to address this issue. In a 2014 study, researchers reviewed oversight policies on psychotropic drug use among children in care from 16 states. Many policies were missing or underdeveloped, lacking key criteria for protecting children. Despite this, states have started to address oversight of psychotropic medication more systematically. States have taken steps to address oversight of psychotropic medication use among children in foster care, with representatives from various agencies collaborating to improve oversight. The Center for Health Care Strategies worked with six states from 2012 to 2015 in a collaborative effort to define common terms and measures for data on medication utilization. The Center for Health Care Strategies collaborated with six states to define common terms and measures for data on psychotropic medication use among foster youth. States implemented protocols for consent, real-time data collection, reviewing \"red flags,\" and tailored monitoring processes with support from SAMSHA. The National Survey of Child and Adolescent Wellbeing (NSCAW) II examined psychotropic medication use among children involved in child welfare due to abuse or neglect. Data was collected in 2008-2009, covering children aged 18 months to 17 years. The NSCAW II survey examined psychotropic medication use among children in child welfare due to abuse or neglect. Data was collected from children aged 18 months to 17 years, with follow-up surveys at 18 and 36 months. The analysis included children in foster care settings. The NSCAW II survey analyzed psychotropic medication use among children in child welfare settings, including those in foster care, kinship care, and group/residential settings. The initial survey did not show statistically significant differences in medication use between children in foster care and those not in foster care. However, significant differences were found at the 18-month and 36-month follow-up surveys. At 18-month and 36-month follow-ups, children in foster care were more likely to use psychotropic medications compared to those not in foster care. No significant differences were found for children under 6, while children aged 6-10 showed significant differences at 18 months but not at the initial survey or 36-month follow-up. Children aged 11-17 did not show statistical significance. For children ages 11-17, there was no statistical significance between in-home and foster care groups initially, but significant differences were found at 18-month and 36-month follow-ups."
