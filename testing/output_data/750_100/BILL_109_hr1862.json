Mandatory drug testing for athletes is required under this Act. The Secretary must issue regulations within 270 days of the Act's enactment, requiring professional sports associations to implement drug testing policies for athletes participating in their leagues. Athletes must be tested at least once a year during their participation in the association's activities. The Secretary will issue regulations for drug testing in professional sports associations. Tests will be conducted randomly throughout the year without prior notification to athletes. A list of prohibited substances will be determined by the World Anti-Doping Agency and the Secretary. Testing will focus on performance-enhancing substances deemed reasonable and practicable. Penalties for positive drug tests in professional sports include a minimum 2-year suspension from participation. Testing must be conducted by an independent party, and penalties are subject to appeal. An athlete who tests positive for drugs, especially if it's not the first time, will face permanent suspension from professional sports, with a loss of pay during the suspension. The athlete's name will be made public. There is an appeals process available for athletes facing penalties for positive drug tests. An athlete who tests positive for drugs has the opportunity for a prompt hearing and a right to appeal. The athlete must file an appeal within 5 days of learning about the positive test.
