    "content": "Services are a diverse group of economic activities that involve the provision of human value-added in various forms. They are intangible, cannot be stored, and must be consumed at the point of production. Rapid changes in technology are reducing these restrictions on services. Services are a significant sector of the U.S. economy, accounting for 83% of nonagricultural payroll jobs and 65% of GDP in 2010. Various industries fall under services, including wholesale and retail trade, transportation, information, banking, insurance, professional services, education, arts, health care, food services, construction, communication, and public administration. Financial services, delivery services, and distribution services play crucial roles in the economy by facilitating capital flow, ensuring goods availability, and making products accessible to consumers. Inefficiencies in these industries could have negative impacts on the overall economy. Inefficiencies in financial, delivery, and distribution services could harm the economy. U.S. trade in services is significant but smaller than trade in goods. Services accounted for 30% of total U.S. exports and 17% of imports in 2010. Many service providers need a presence in the consumer's country for direct contact. For example, legal, accounting, and construction services prefer a direct presence. In 2008, U.S. firms sold $1,137 billion in services to foreigners through their majority-owned foreign affiliates, providing a more accurate measurement of trade in services. In 2008, U.S. firms sold $1,137 billion in services to foreigners through their majority-owned foreign affiliates. This includes trade in services through various modes of delivery, with data on some modes not readily available. The seeds for multilateral negotiations in services trade were planted over 25 years ago during the Trade Act of 1974. Despite initial reluctance from developing countries, services were eventually included in international trade rules. During the Uruguay Round negotiations in 1986, services were included in international trade rules, leading to the creation of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) and the World Trade Organization (WTO) to administer the agreements. Trade scholar Geza Feketekuty highlights three main challenges in establishing rules for international trade in services. The challenges in establishing rules for international trade in services include distinguishing legitimate regulations for health and safety from protectionist measures, addressing the shift of once non-tradable services to tradable ones due to technology advances like the internet, and ensuring flexibility in rules to adapt to these changes. The GATS recognizes that most services transactions occur inside borders and barriers to trade in services are within customs barriers. Effective trade rules must consider different modes of delivery to identify barriers foreign service providers face. The GATS categorizes modes of service delivery into four categories. The GATS categorizes modes of service delivery into four categories: Cross-border supply (mode 1) involves services supplied from one country to another, Consumption abroad (mode 2) requires the consumer to travel to another country for the service. The GATS categorizes modes of service delivery into four categories: Cross-border supply (mode 1), Consumption abroad (mode 2), Commercial presence (mode 3), and Presence of natural persons (mode 4). These modes involve physical travel to another country for services, establishment of branches or subsidiaries in another country, and temporary travel of individuals to provide services. The GATS is an agreement among 153 WTO members representing various economic levels. The GATS is a multilateral agreement among 153 WTO members that sets out principles and rules for trade in services. It aims to promote economic development, liberalize trade progressively, preserve governments' right to regulate services, and support developing countries and least developed countries. The GATS is a multilateral agreement among 153 WTO members that sets out principles and rules for trade in services. Part I defines the scope of the GATS, including government barriers to trade in services at all levels, and the four modes of delivery. Part II presents principles and obligations that apply to all services sectors, regardless of whether they are listed in a member's schedule of commitments. These include unconditional most-favored-nation (MFN) non-discriminatory treatment. The GATS sets out principles and rules for trade in services among 153 WTO members. Part II outlines key principles such as unconditional most-favored-nation treatment, transparency, impartial administration of regulations, and requirements for monopoly suppliers. Exceptions include temporary trade restrictions for balance of payments difficulties. The GATS establishes market access and national treatment obligations for members, binding each member to its commitments. It prohibits less favorable treatment than committed to and limits on foreign service suppliers. The GATS establishes market access and national treatment obligations for members, ensuring that service suppliers from other member countries receive national treatment and allowing for further negotiations to reduce barriers to trade in services. The GATS establishes market access and national treatment obligations for members, applying only to listed services and modes of delivery in each member's schedule of commitments. National treatment and market access obligations do not extend to services sectors outside the schedule of commitments, following a positive list approach. Each member country's schedule of commitments is detailed in an annex to the GATS. The GATS requires WTO members to start new negotiations to expand coverage of the agreement within five years of its enforcement. Conflicts involving GATS implementation must be resolved through the WTO's dispute settlement mechanism. The agreement also includes annexes on various services such as financial, transportation, telecommunication, maritime, and mode-4 delivery. The GATS required ongoing negotiations on financial services, telecommunications, maritime services, and mode-4 delivery. Agreements were reached on basic telecommunications in February 1997 and financial services in December 1997. Negotiations on mode-4 ended in July 1995 with limited results. Negotiations on mode-4 and maritime services in the GATS ended with limited results. Commitments made by WTO members on national treatment and market access in specific service sectors are a significant part of their obligations. Each member must submit a schedule of commitments during negotiations. The GATS negotiations require new members to submit a schedule of commitments upon joining the WTO. These schedules outline restrictions on market access and national treatment for different sectors and modes of delivery. The schedules are more complex than tariff schedules and are divided into four columns. The GATS negotiations require new WTO members to submit a schedule of commitments outlining restrictions on market access and national treatment for different sectors and modes of delivery. The schedules are divided into two parts: horizontal commitments that apply to all services sectors and sector-specific commitments. The schedules are detailed documents where members identify trade liberalization commitments and exceptions for each service sector and subsector. The negotiations on services in the DDA aim to reform GATS rules, expand commitments, and reduce limitations on market access and national treatment. This section discusses the evolution, structure, and status of the negotiations, along with U.S. goals and those of other major trading partners. The negotiations on services in the DDA aim to reform GATS rules, expand commitments, and reduce limitations on market access and national treatment. Article XIX of the GATS required WTO members to begin new negotiations on services within five years of its entry into force, addressing issues like special treatment for least developed countries and government subsidies. The GATS mandates negotiations on government subsidies, emergency safeguard measures, and government procurement in services trade. The new services negotiations began in 2000 but progressed slowly due to the adverse political climate after the 1999 WTO Ministerial in Seattle. In March 2001, the WTO's Council for Trade in Services approved guidelines for the current negotiations. The guidelines for the current negotiations on services in the WTO incorporate mandates and procedures from the GATS. The main objective is progressive liberalization of trade in services while recognizing members' right to regulate the sector. All service sectors and delivery modes are subject to negotiations, with a deadline extended to the end of the DDA. The negotiations for services in the WTO aim for progressive liberalization while respecting members' regulatory rights. Special sessions of the Council for Trade in Services will be open to all WTO members and acceding countries. Negotiations will start from existing commitments, using a \"request-offer\" format. Developing countries' needs will be considered, and modalities for negotiating credit for autonomous liberalization will be discussed. The WTO members agreed on modalities for negotiating credit for autonomous liberalizations in services. The DDA was successfully launched in November 2001 after a false start in Seattle. The Ministerial Declaration incorporated services negotiation into the DDA agenda and set deadlines to prompt negotiators to submit their initial requests for market access and national treatment. The DDA negotiations faced challenges with services negotiations missing deadlines, leading to a potential collapse. However, a negotiating framework was established in July 2004 to revive the round after disagreements at the Cancun Ministerial in September 2003. The July 2004 framework aimed to revive the DDA negotiations by setting deadlines for initial and revised offers to ensure high-quality submissions. Services were briefly mentioned, signaling their importance to the U.S. business community. The DDA negotiators placed services on par with agriculture and non-agricultural goods in negotiations. Working groups handle rules negotiations, while national treatment and market access are addressed by all members through request-offer format. Members submit wish-lists and offers, continuing negotiations with responses to offers. The WTO services negotiations involve multiple rounds of negotiations where members submit commitment offers until consensus is reached. Unlike goods negotiations, services negotiations are conducted through bilateral, plurilateral, and multilateral discussions. All members must accept the final set of commitment offers to become part of the GATS. These negotiations have been ongoing for over five years. The WTO services negotiations have been ongoing for over five years, with slow progress and missed deadlines. In 2006, negotiations were suspended due to disagreements on fundamental modalities in agriculture trade. Despite efforts to reach a consensus on basic negotiating objectives, no agreement has been reached so far. The United States and its trading partners have not reached a consensus on negotiating objectives for the WTO services negotiations. The main goal of the United States is to secure market access commitments from as many trading partners as possible. The U.S. aims to secure market access commitments from trading partners in WTO services negotiations. They want countries to increase their level of bindings to prevent market openness from slipping. Government regulation is a significant factor in services trade. Regulation in services trade is more prevalent than in manufactured goods trade in developed and developing economies. GATS rules acknowledge the need for government regulation to ensure consumer health and safety, such as ensuring qualifications for professionals like lawyers and doctors. Different agencies regulate various service sectors, with some sectors being overseen by multiple government agencies at different administrative levels. The United States urges WTO member countries to establish transparent domestic procedures for licensing and regulatory processes to facilitate foreign trade in services. Lack of transparency in regulations is a major barrier for U.S. service providers in many markets, especially in developing countries. The United States encourages WTO members to implement transparent domestic procedures for informing the public of regulations and providing opportunities for feedback. U.S. service providers emphasize the importance of establishing a local presence to conduct business, and U.S. negotiators seek commitments to eliminate unnecessary restrictions on foreign direct investment. The United States is pushing for improved market access in financial services, transparency in regulations, and fairness in applying them. They are also seeking commitments to expedite new-to-market initiatives in insurance and increase market access in telecommunications services. The United States requested increased market access in telecommunications services, including value-added services, and privatization of carriers. They also asked for commitments on owning and leasing cable facilities, access for road freight transport, order processing services, and inventory management services. Additionally, they raised concerns about cross-subsidization of express delivery services. The United States has requested increased market access in energy services, including energy exploration, transmission, distribution, marketing, trading, conservation, and anti-pollution services. They also seek commitments on third-party access to energy transportation facilities and protection of the environment from degradation. The United States has requested increased market access in energy services, including exploration, transmission, distribution, marketing, trading, conservation, and anti-pollution services. They also seek commitments on third-party access to energy transportation facilities and protection of the environment from degradation. Additionally, the US has requested trading partners to provide increased access to markets for services related to wastewater treatment, waste management, soil and water cleanup, noise and vibration abatement, biodiversity protection, and landscape preservation. They also seek full market access to retail, wholesale, and franchising services, including direct delivery to customers or remote sales through various channels. The United States has requested increased market access for various services, including higher education, training, and testing services. This includes job-related courses but excludes primary and secondary education. They also seek increased market access for foreign professional services providers by removing citizenship requirements and ownership restrictions. The United States has requested increased market access for various services, including computer consulting, software development, data processing, systems integration, maintenance services, audiovisual, and advertising services. Initial offer presented on March 31, 2003, revised offer submitted on May 31, 2005. The United States submitted a revised offer on May 31, 2005, in response to the July 2004 Framework. The offer aimed to maintain national treatment and market access for foreign service providers without reducing current trade liberalization levels. The U.S. defends its offers by stating that its services markets are already open and expects other WTO members to meet its standards. The United States offers horizontal commitments in various areas, including temporary entry of personnel, in its revised offer to maintain national treatment and market access for foreign service providers. Some U.S. WTO-trading partners have concerns about the U.S. offers. The United States offers temporary entry for specific groups of personnel, including services sales persons, inter-corporate transferees, and personnel establishing a business entity. Fashion models and other specialty service providers are also allowed temporary entry. The United States allows temporary entry for fashion models, service providers in specialty occupations, and personnel acquiring land in scheduled services sectors. Foreigners providing scheduled services are taxed similarly to U.S. residents, with exceptions. The U.S. has offered commitments in business services, professional services, accounting, bookkeeping, and taxation services. The United States has offered commitments in business services, including professional services, accounting, bookkeeping, taxation services, and architectural and engineering services. WTO members must identify national treatment and market access exceptions for each delivery mode in scheduled sectors. Exceptions for business services mostly involve state restrictions on foreign service providers. Additionally, the U.S. has offered commitments in market research, public opinion polling, management consulting, computer services, and real estate services. The United States has offered commitments in various sectors including consulting, computer services, real estate services, agriculture services, delivery services, telecommunication services, retail trade services, higher education, environmental services, financial services, health and social services, travel and tourism, transportation services, energy services, and construction services. Developing countries have criticized the United States for these commitments. Developing countries criticize the United States for not offering broader commitments in sectors like maritime and postal services, focusing on restricted offers under mode-4 delivery. The European Union also criticizes the US for not opening up these services to foreign competition. India argues for access to software specialists, computer experts, and information technology engineers under Mode-4, a contentious issue in DDA negotiations. Deadlines for completing negotiations have been rescheduled due to the complexity of the process. The negotiations for the DDA have been slow due to various challenges. The US and EU proposed establishing \"benchmarks\" in specific sectors for commitments. The US suggested six core sectors while the EU proposed a smaller list. The EU proposed a smaller list of core sectors for commitments, meeting strong opposition from developing countries who argued that the established mandate for DDA negotiations requires the \"request-offer\" format to be used. Developing countries also expressed concerns that benchmarks would likely focus on sectors favored by developed countries. The U.S. services business community expressed concern that focusing on benchmarks could cause delays in negotiations. Canada, supported by the U.S. and other developed countries, proposed changes to the negotiating process to accelerate talks on services. The U.S. pushed for clearer identification of concessions before completing agriculture and non-agricultural negotiations to address frustrations. Developing countries reject a proposal to change the sequencing of negotiations in the WTO, insisting on maintaining the current order. The positive list approach for market access commitments is criticized for potentially hindering liberalization efforts. Sectors and subsectors are not covered by default unless specifically identified. The \"negative list\" approach is preferred by the United States in free trade agreements. Mode-4 delivery, temporary entry of supply personnel, is a contentious issue in services negotiations, dividing developed and developing countries. Developing countries criticize the United States over mode-4 delivery, causing tension with the U.S. business community and government. Despite accounting for less than 1% of world trade in services, mode-4 controversy is linked to immigration policies, especially after 9/11. Developing countries criticize the United States for not offering more on mode-4 commitments, particularly visa restrictions on temporary workers entering the country. The United States faces criticism from developing countries for visa restrictions on temporary workers, especially those not affiliated with U.S. companies. Congressional committees have raised concerns about changes in visa policies for workers entering the country. The United States faces criticism for visa restrictions on temporary workers. Congressional committees have concerns about changes in visa policies. Compromises were made to separate visa rules from trade legislation. The U.S. business community advocates for more flexibility in mode-4 offers to progress negotiations. Negotiations on subsidies, emergency safeguard measures, and government procurement in developing countries, particularly East Asian ones, have made little progress. Key questions remain unresolved, such as defining countervailable subsidies and measuring import surges for safeguards. Services negotiations have been slow despite over 10 years of discussions. Negotiations on services have not progressed much in over 10 years. Many WTO members, especially developing countries, have offers that are not reflective of their actual services market openness. The best offers are 1.9 times more restrictive than current policies, showing a reluctance to lock in trade commitments. Members want the option to impose more restrictions without violating WTO rules. Negotiations on services at the WTO have been slow for over a decade. Members, especially developing countries, have offers that do not reflect their actual market openness. The best offers are significantly more restrictive than current policies, indicating a reluctance to commit to trade agreements. There is a possibility of imposing further restrictions on services trade without breaching WTO rules. Negotiations on services at the WTO have been slow due to the division between developed and developing countries. The lack of progress is attributed to differences in market openness and protectionism. The agriculture and NAMA negotiations in the DDA have also hindered progress in services negotiations. The slow progress in services negotiations at the WTO is due to developed countries linking their offers to reductions in agriculture subsidies by the US and EU. Developing countries are being pressured to reduce the \"water\" in their commitments. The complexity of the services agenda and the variety of players involved are additional obstacles. Exporters in services sectors face challenges with trade rules formulation due to differences. Services negotiations involve various participants, including trade ministers and regulatory agencies. The evaluation of negotiation prospects is complex, with factors like political will affecting completion. Participants often wait until crucial deadlines to reveal negotiating positions. The completion of services negotiations depends on various factors, including WTO members' political will. The WTO Ministerial in Hong Kong in December 2005 aimed to accelerate DDA negotiations by addressing obstacles and reaching agreements through compromise. Resolving issues in agriculture and market access quickly would allow negotiators to focus on services negotiations. The Hong Kong Ministerial Declaration in 2005 aimed to accelerate DDA negotiations by addressing obstacles and reaching agreements through compromise. In September 2007, the chairman of the trade in services negotiations began developing a draft text of an agreement, but by the end of 2007, countries were still divided on basic objectives. Developed countries, including the United States, were involved in the negotiations. In July 2008, WTO General Director Lamy called a ministerial meeting in Geneva to try to hammer out the modalities for agriculture and NAMA negotiations. A \"signaling\" conference was held with 32 representatives, including the United States and two from the EU, to ascertain countries' commitments on trade in services. The conference in 2008 aimed to determine participants' trade offers and expectations. Despite some progress, negotiations were slow. In 2009, \"cluster\" meetings were held with limited results. Services negotiations in 2010 were hindered by agriculture and NAMA talks, with participants hesitant to increase liberalization levels. Senator Charles Grassley expressed reluctance to increase liberalization levels in the Doha services negotiations, emphasizing the need for a strong services package for his support."
