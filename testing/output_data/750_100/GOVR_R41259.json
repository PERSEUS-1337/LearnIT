    "content": "North Korea's development of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, along with illicit activities, has been a persistent challenge for U.S. foreign policy since the post-Cold War period. Despite efforts through negotiations, aid, and sanctions, North Korea's capabilities have continued to grow. The United States has never established formal diplomatic relations with North Korea since its creation in 1948. North Korea's weapons programs pose a threat to U.S. interests in security, politics, and human rights. The U.S. has military alliances with South Korea and Japan, obligating defense against North Korean attacks. U.S. troops and civilians in these countries are within range of North Korean missiles, putting the U.S. homeland at risk. The conflict on the Korean peninsula or the collapse of the government in Pyongyang would have severe implications for the regional\u2014if not global\u2014economy. Negotiations and diplomacy surrounding North Korea's nuclear weapons program influence U.S. relations with major powers in the region, particularly China and South Korea. Dealing with a totalitarian regime that is unfettered by international norms is a complex task. North Korea, founded on the philosophy of juche (self-reliance), poses a significant threat. North Korea's regime, based on the philosophy of juche (self-reliance) established by Kim Il-sung, has maintained near-totalitarian control to resist outside influences and uphold its rule. Despite being a small country, North Korea has built one of the world's largest militaries as a deterrent against military intervention, giving it leverage over foreign powers in diplomatic negotiations. North Korea's militarization provides leverage over foreign powers, allowing the regime to extract concessions. However, this behavior has stunted economic growth by limiting interactions with the outside world. Despite signs of economic strengthening, the population remains impoverished, with limited access to outside information. Increasing access to information from the outside world could lead to greater public discontent with the regime if growth does not continue. Congress has direct and indirect influence on U.S. policy towards North Korea through sanctions legislation and the North Korean Human Rights Act. Congress has authorized millions of dollars in energy assistance under past nuclear agreements. Under past nuclear agreements, Congress authorized millions of dollars in energy assistance, sometimes with conditions based on North Korean compliance. In future agreements, Congress will need to approve funds if the US provides aid for DPRK denuclearization. Congress oversees North Korea's capabilities, intentions, human rights record, sanctions evasion, and relationships with other governments through hearings. North Korea's rapid advances in missile and nuclear weapons capabilities have shifted U.S. policymakers' assessment of the regime's threat. Recent tests have shown that North Korea is close to being able to strike the continental United States with a nuclear-armed ballistic missile, making it a top U.S. foreign policy and national security concern. North Korea's threats have increased in various domains including nuclear weapons, long-range missiles, submarine-based missiles, short-range artillery, and cyberattacks. They conducted multiple nuclear tests and missile tests, with some demonstrating the capability to reach the continental United States. Pyongyang is also developing a submarine-based ballistic missile program to potentially evade U.S. missile defense systems. North Korea demonstrated its ability to use cyberattacks to disrupt critical operations, as seen in the \"WannaCry\" attack in 2017. The Trump Administration initially responded with a \"maximum pressure\" policy to coerce Pyongyang through economic and diplomatic measures, similar to the approach taken by the Obama Administration. The Trump Administration increased economic pressure on North Korea, urging China and others to do the same, and strengthened alliances with South Korea and Japan to counter North Korean threats. They successfully pushed for four new sanctions resolutions at the UN Security Council, expanding requirements for member states to cut ties with North Korea. Both the Obama and Trump Administrations urged countries worldwide to reduce or eliminate their connections with Pyongyang. The Trump Administration pushed for global cuts in ties with North Korea, including the option of a preventive military strike. Contradictory statements on U.S. conditions for negotiations and potential strikes have caused confusion about U.S. policy. In early 2018, North Korea accepted an invitation to attend the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea, leading to warmer North-South relations. This paved the way for a meeting between Kim Jong-un and President Trump at the June 2018 Singapore Summit. Kim Jong-un's diplomatic efforts were influenced by various factors, including harsh rhetoric from the Trump Administration, economic sanctions limiting North Korea's growth, Moon Jae-in's outreach, and Kim's confidence in securing limited gains. During the 2018 Winter Olympics, Kim Jong-un found willing counterparts in Moon, Xi, and Trump to discuss North Korea's nuclear program. Trump and Kim met in Singapore to address security guarantees and denuclearization. The Singapore document reaffirmed Kim's commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. It outlines principles for establishing new bilateral relations, building a lasting peace regime, working towards denuclearization, and recovering the remains of U.S. troops. No mention was made of North Korea's ballistic missile program. The Singapore agreement reaffirmed Kim's commitment to denuclearization but did not address North Korea's ballistic missile program. Trump announced the suspension of U.S.-South Korea military exercises, aiming to save money and potentially withdraw U.S. troops from South Korea. The Singapore agreement reaffirmed Kim's commitment to denuclearization but did not address North Korea's ballistic missile program. The Defense Department announced the cancellation of the annual U.S.-South Korea \"Ulchi Freedom Guardian\" exercises. Analysts noted similarities to previous agreements with North Korea, but critics pointed out the lack of a timeframe and verification mechanisms for denuclearization. The Singapore agreement reaffirmed Kim's commitment to denuclearization but did not address North Korea's ballistic missile program. Key details such as the definition of denuclearization, sequencing, peace regime, and normalization of ties were left uncertain. Analysts believe North Korea's push for a peace treaty before denuclearization talks may be a tactic to delay the process and gain recognition as a nuclear state. Some caution that North Korea could prolong negotiations to ease sanctions pressure. The UNSC adopted its first resolution in 2006 requiring member states to impose sanctions against North Korea for pursuing weapons programs in violation of international obligations. Maintaining political momentum to implement existing sanctions is challenging amid engagement initiatives. The UNSC has passed 10 sanctions resolutions between 2006 and December 2017, expanding requirements for member states to restrict interactions with North Korea following its nuclear tests. Initially targeting arms sales and materials for weapons programs, sanctions now also cover individuals involved in WMD activities and luxury goods transfers. Since 2006, the UNSC has passed 10 sanctions resolutions targeting North Korea's nuclear tests. The most recent sanctions in December 2017 ban financial interactions, trade in various sectors, and activities with North Korea, leading to a ban on major North Korean exports in international markets. The value of North Korean exports declined by over 30% in 2017 due to international bans. The US, under Obama and Trump Administrations, pushed for global ties with North Korea to be cut beyond UNSC requirements. It is uncertain if the Trump Administration has continued this approach since diplomatic outreach in 2018. In 2018, the United States imposed unilateral sanctions on North Korea, in addition to leading the effort in the UNSC. Presidents Bush, Obama, and Trump issued executive orders targeting North Korea. Congress passed two North Korea-specific statutes since 2015. U.S. sanctions on North Korea limit trade to humanitarian goods, prohibit financial transactions and new investments, and grant the President authority to restrict certain sectors. Foreign aid is minimal and emergency-based, administered through centrally funded programs. U.S. sanctions prohibit trade with North Korean individuals and entities designated by OFAC, restrict transactions with Kim Jong-un and the Korean Workers' Party, and limit travel to North Korea. North Korea's demands in negotiations for halting its weapons programs have varied, including recognition as a nuclear weapons state and a peace treaty with the U.S. as prerequisites for denuclearization. Pyongyang's behavior fluctuates between cooperation and provocations, such as testing missiles and nuclear devices over the past two decades. North Korea has conducted long-range ballistic missile tests and nuclear detonations in recent years, often using negotiations to secure aid. They exploit divisions among parties and political transitions to stall talks, leading to debates on the effectiveness of negotiating with them. Some analysts argue that negotiating with North Korea is necessary to reduce conflict and feasible due to Kim Jong-un's focus on economic development. A potential bargain could involve improved relations with the US, an end to the Korean War, economic benefits, and sanctions relief in exchange for nuclear disarmament. Kim Jong-un's emphasis on economic development in 2018 is seen as a positive sign for potential negotiations. Many analysts believe that North Korea will not voluntarily give up its nuclear weapons capability, viewing it as essential for regime survival. Pyongyang's demands are seen as tactical moves, with no intention of giving up nuclear weapons in exchange for aid and recognition. North Korea has repeatedly stated its determination to maintain its nuclear weapons program, casting doubt on the idea that the pledge at the Singapore summit has changed its intentions. Pyongyang demanded recognition as a nuclear weapons state in 2010 and has since described itself as a \"nuclear-armed nation.\" In 2013, North Korea declared its nuclear weapons are not negotiable. North Korea insists its nuclear weapons are not up for negotiation and will not be given up for any amount of money. The country declared completion of its nuclear force after a successful missile test in 2017 and stated it will only consider disarmament once all countries eliminate their nuclear weapons. The 2011 intervention in Libya, where nuclear disarmament led to sanctions removal, may have reinforced North Korea's belief in the value of nuclear arms. The 2018 Singapore summit conferred legitimacy on North Korea as a nuclear state, satisfying some of its demands such as canceling military exercises and easing sanctions. This reinforced the perceived value of nuclear arms for regime security, as North Korean leaders fear overthrow without them. The Trump Administration's efforts included engaging in formal nuclear and missile negotiations with North Korea, such as the Agreed Framework, bilateral missile negotiations, Six-Party Talks, and the Leap Day Deal. The proposed formula for these negotiations involved North Korea halting its nuclear or missile programs in exchange for economic and diplomatic concessions. U.S. intelligence detected North Korea's activities in 1986. In 1986, U.S. intelligence discovered North Korea's plutonium production reactor and reprocessing plant at Yongbyon, not monitored as required by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. North Korea obstructed IAEA inspections, leading to discussions of sanctions and a possible preemptive military strike on its nuclear facilities. The U.S. and North Korea engaged in negotiations following discussions of sanctions and a possible military strike on North Korea's nuclear facilities. The 1994 Agreed Framework was established, with the U.S. agreeing to provide North Korea with light water reactor nuclear power plants and fuel oil in exchange for freezing and dismantling its plutonium program under IAEA supervision. In 2002, the George W. Bush Administration confronted North Korea about a suspected secret uranium enrichment program, leading to the halt of heavy fuel oil shipments and construction of light water reactors. North Korea then expelled IAEA inspectors from Yongbyon. In response to opposition to the Agreed Framework's terms, the Clinton Administration began negotiations with North Korea in 1996 to curb its missile program and end missile exports. In 1999, North Korea agreed to a moratorium on testing long-range missiles in exchange for lifting U.S. sanctions and continuing talks. In 2000, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright visited Pyongyang to finalize a new agreement with North Korea, aiming to end ballistic missile development and exports in exchange for international assistance in launching North Korean satellites. Despite maintaining a moratorium until 2006, negotiations under the George W. Bush Administration involving China, South Korea, Japan, and Russia failed to reach a final agreement through six rounds of talks from 2003 to 2008. The \"Six-Party Talks\" from 2003 to 2008 aimed to resolve North Korean nuclear arms issue but ultimately failed. A breakthrough in 2005 led to a Joint Statement where North Korea agreed to abandon its nuclear weapons programs in exchange for aid and security guarantees. However, the process broke down due to disagreements on verifying North Korea's compliance. The Obama Administration's policy towards North Korea was one of \"strategic patience.\" The Obama Administration's policy towards North Korea, known as \"strategic patience,\" aimed to pressure Pyongyang to return to the Six-Party Talks and commit to denuclearization. The policy involved coordination with allies, efforts to convince China to take a tougher stance, and applying pressure through arms interdictions and sanctions. U.S. officials sought a comprehensive deal for North Korea's denuclearization in exchange for normalization of relations and aid, with a freeze on North Korea's nuclear activities. The Obama Administration's \"strategic patience\" policy towards North Korea aimed to pressure Pyongyang for denuclearization. This involved coordination with allies, urging China to take a tougher stance, and applying sanctions. The U.S. sought a deal for normalization of relations and aid in exchange for a freeze on North Korea's nuclear activities. Additionally, the administration issued executive orders to implement U.N. sanctions and impose unilateral sanctions on entities involved in illicit activities supporting North Korea's WMD programs. The Obama Administration implemented measures to pressure North Korea for denuclearization, including sanctions on illicit activities funding WMD programs. After the cyberattack on Sony Pictures, President Obama issued an executive order to seize assets of DPRK officials. Despite attempts at engagement, provocations by Pyongyang stalled negotiations, leading to a cycle of action and reaction. The United States focused on building consensus at the UNSC and pressuring North Korea through enhanced multilateral sanctions. The \"Leap Day Agreement\" in February 2012 committed North Korea to a moratorium on nuclear tests, missile launches, and uranium enrichment in exchange for nutritional assistance from the Obama Administration. The Obama Administration pledged nutritional assistance and increased cultural exchanges with North Korea, but the deal was scuttled after North Korea's long-range rocket launch and third nuclear test in 2013. US policy towards North Korea relies heavily on China, its largest trading partner and provider of food and energy aid. China also has limited diplomatic ties with Pyongyang. China's main priority is to maintain stability on the Korean Peninsula and prevent the collapse of North Korea. Beijing fears the effects of a humanitarian crisis, refugee flows, and uncertainty of other nations' actions in a power vacuum. China also values North Korea as a buffer between itself and South Korea. China often obstructs U.S. efforts to impose harsher punishments on North Korea in international forums like the U.N. due to its seat on the UNSC. Chinese companies have been found violating sanctions against North Korea, with uneven enforcement by the Chinese government. However, in 2017, China increased its enforcement of UNSC sanctions, possibly to dissuade the U.S. from following through on the Trump Administration's plans. Relations between Beijing and Pyongyang have deteriorated since Kim Jong-un came to power in 2011. China's trade and aid to North Korea are limited, likely to avoid appearing as an enabler of a rogue regime. This dynamic influences the U.S. and South Korean approach to not push China into providing more support to North Korea. Relations between Beijing and Pyongyang soured after Kim Jong-un took power in 2011. Beijing was unhappy with Kim's actions, especially after he executed his uncle Jang Song-taek in 2013, who had been a key figure in China-North Korea relations. Chinese President Xi Jinping held summits with South Korean leaders but did not meet with Kim. Chinese academics and public opinion started questioning China's friendly ties with North Korea, citing costs to China. In a Weibo poll, two-thirds of 8,000 respondents favored a U.S. preemptive airstrike on North Korea's nuclear sites. State censors regularly deleted content ridiculing Pyongyang's leadership. China implemented UNSC sanctions resolutions in 2017, restoring some closeness in the North Korea-China relationship in 2018. Kim traveled to Beijing before his meeting with Trump, seeking to reaffirm relations. Kim Jong-un, the third generation of the Kim family to rule North Korea, traveled to Beijing for the first time to reaffirm relations with China. This move followed achievements such as deescalation of hostilities and the cancelation of U.S.-South Korean military exercises, which improved his relationship with Beijing. Kim Jong-un emerged boldly on the global stage in 2018, reinforcing the impression of consolidated power at the apex of the North Korean regime. Analysts credit him with successfully pursuing a plan to ensure regime survival and boost the country's struggling economy through a two-track policy. Kim Jong-un has promoted a two-track policy of economic development and nuclear weapons development to strengthen North Korea's struggling economy. He has pursued better economic opportunities through a \"charm offensive\" with South Korea and China, while also achieving a temporary breakthrough with the United States to avoid harsher sanctions. Initially seen as a potential political reformer, Kim has focused on consolidating power and improving the country's economic situation. Since becoming supreme leader in late 2011, Kim Jong-un has shown a ruthless drive to consolidate power and maintain the dynastic dictatorship in North Korea. He has executed purges of senior officials, including his uncle by marriage, Jang Song-taek, in 2013. Kim's half-brother, Kim Jong-nam, was assassinated in 2017, with the attack believed to be authorized by Kim Jong-un. Kim Jong-un, known for his different ruling style from his father, has replaced over 300 senior officials in his first four years in office. Unlike his aloof father, Kim allows Western influences in public, such as clothing styles and Disney characters, and frequently appears informally in public. His wife has been introduced to the North Korean public, a departure from his father's era. Kim Jong-un's ruling style includes allowing Western influences in public, introducing his wife to the North Korean public, and making stylistic changes to appear young and modern. Analysts see these changes as an attempt to evoke his grandfather's \"man of the people\" image. North Korea, one of the world's poorest countries, has seen some economic growth under Kim's leadership. Kim Jong-un's economic reforms have spurred growth and improved living standards for many North Koreans. The country has managed to withstand international sanctions by increasing domestic production and engaging in sanctions-evasion activities. Market principles have been allowed to govern some sectors of North Korean business under Kim's changes. The government has partially legalized consumer and business-to-business markets, leading to an expansion in markets and ancillary services. Kim emphasizes domestic manufacturing and a shift to domestically produced goods. International trade with China accounts for over 90% of North Korea's trade, facilitating marketization. Since 2010, North Korea's agricultural liberalization and favorable planting conditions have led to larger harvests. Food prices have been stable since 2012, but over 10 million North Koreans still suffer from food insecurity. Kim's changes have improved conditions for the elite, but many others face tenuous food security. Analysts debate whether Kim's changes in North Korea can be considered \"reforms\" due to unclear extent compared to past socialist countries. The government's stance on marketization is conflicting, with periodic crackdowns on market activity. Many North Koreans have limited access to healthcare and face food insecurity and undernutrition. Many North Koreans lack access to quality healthcare and struggle with food shortages. The regime controls where families can live based on loyalty, limiting access to medical care. Pyongyang has better health facilities for the elite, but many cannot afford medications or bribes for doctors. The regime's control is weakening in the capital. North Koreans lack access to quality healthcare and face food shortages. The regime controls where families can live based on loyalty, limiting medical care access. Pyongyang is losing control over information flows, with citizens turning to outside news sources despite government efforts to jam foreign broadcasts. Some citizens have illegal radios to listen to foreign programs. According to a 2015 survey, 29% of North Korean defectors listened to foreign broadcasts while in North Korea. In 2009, North Korea restarted a mobile phone network with over 3 million subscribers in 2017. The regime allows increased mobile-phone use for surveillance purposes, with reports of cadres consuming foreign media and being involved in smuggling operations. Chinese cellphones are used despite being illegal. Chinese cellphones, although illegal, are used near the North Korean border for international calls. The spread of cell phones in North Korea enables faster dissemination of information, potentially leading to positive changes in the political system. A 2015 survey found that 28% of North Koreans owned domestic mobile phones, with 15% accessing sensitive media content. Increased access to information could be a vulnerability for the regime. Thae Yong-ho, a former North Korean deputy ambassador to Britain, believes that increased access to information could weaken the regime. The regime has indoctrinated its citizens to be loyal to the Kim family and view the outside world as inferior. Outside information could expose the reality of living conditions and encourage questioning of the regime. North Korea has a large military force of 1.28 million personnel. North Korea has a large military force of 1.28 million personnel, with significant reserves. Defense spending may make up 24% of the country's national income. The military is strategically positioned near the DMZ for rapid deployment in a conflict with South Korea. North Korea is focusing on developing its WMD capabilities to compensate for shortcomings in its conventional forces, particularly nuclear weapons. North Korea prioritizes developing nuclear weapons, long-range missiles, and cyber capabilities. It also possesses chemical and possibly biological weapons. Pyongyang has 6,000 cyber warfare troops and is considered a significant cyber threat by the U.S. intelligence community. North Korea's conventional military capabilities have declined since 1990 due to outdated weapons and training. Despite this, they could still cause significant damage to Seoul with artillery and rocket attacks. Experts believe the US and South Korea would ultimately prevail in a war, but at a high cost. North Korean artillery forces could fire thousands of rounds at Seoul in the first hour of a conflict. North Korean military equipment is outdated, based on Soviet designs from the 1950s-1970s. To compensate, they focus on improving asymmetric capabilities like UAVs, cyber operations, special forces, GPS jamming, and electromagnetic pulse. Recent advancements include long-range artillery, tanks, infantry weapons, and UAVs. North Korea's military possesses artillery, tanks, armored vehicles, infantry weapons, UAVs, surface-to-air missiles, ballistic missile-capable submarines, and special operations forces. The military's command and control structure is highly centralized, with scripted and inflexible war plans. North Korea's war plans are highly scripted and inflexible, with mid-level officers lacking training and authority to act independently. General resource scarcity affects military readiness, including fuel shortages for pilots, logistical issues for troops, lack of spare parts, and food shortages. U.S. analysts are concerned about North Korea's nuclear weapons development pace and success. The U.S. intelligence community is skeptical of North Korea's willingness to abandon its nuclear weapons program, despite ongoing talks about denuclearization. Pyongyang's commitment to possessing nuclear weapons for its survival raises doubts about its intentions. North Korean Foreign Ministry official Choe Son Hui stated in October 2017 that North Korea views its nuclear arsenal as essential for deterring US attacks, emphasizing that keeping the weapons is a matter of survival. The regime has focused on developing smaller, lighter, and more diversified warheads, indicating a shift towards producing and deploying nuclear weapons. North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests since 2006, including a hydrogen bomb test. North Korea conducted a hydrogen bomb test in September 2017, perfecting it for delivery on an intercontinental ballistic missile. The tests produced progressively higher magnitude blasts. In early 2018, North Korea announced the closure of its test site but continues fissile material production. The nuclear program began in the late 1950s with Soviet cooperation near Yongbyon. North Korea's nuclear program at Yongbyon began in the late 1950s with Soviet cooperation. A small nuclear reactor capable of producing plutonium started operating in 1986. The reactor and reprocessing facility have been alternately operational and frozen under safeguards since 1994 and 2007. Since the collapse of the Six Party Talks in 2008, North Korea has resumed its nuclear activities, including restarting its reactor and reprocessing plant, building a uranium enrichment plant, and constructing a new light water reactor. It is estimated that North Korea has produced 30 to 40 kilograms of plutonium for nuclear weapons. Additionally, intelligence suggests they are also pursuing a second route to a bomb using highly enriched uranium. North Korea openly acknowledged a uranium enrichment program in 2009, showing early construction of a light-water reactor and a gas centrifuge uranium enrichment plant in 2010. U.S. officials suspect other clandestine enrichment facilities exist, with one identified at Kangson in 2018. North Korea's uranium enrichment program was openly acknowledged in 2009, with a gas centrifuge uranium enrichment plant identified at Kangson in 2018. Estimates suggest North Korea could have 20 to 100 nuclear warheads by 2020, with a focus on developing ballistic missile technology. North Korea has prioritized the development of its ballistic missile technology, conducting over 80 test launches since Kim Jong-un took power in 2011. These tests aim to increase the range of offensive weapons and improve evasion of U.S. missile defense systems. In 2016, North Korea conducted 26 ballistic missile flight tests, followed by 18 tests in 2017, including suspected ICBM launches. North Korea also possesses around 700 nuclear warheads. North Korea's nuclear weapons program aims to develop a miniaturized warhead for long-range ballistic missiles. The Nodong missile poses a significant threat to other nations. North Korea's nuclear weapons program aims to develop a miniaturized warhead for long-range ballistic missiles, including the Nodong missile which could reach the Korean Peninsula, mainland Japan, and some U.S. military bases. Experts believe North Korea has the capability to mount a nuclear warhead on the Nodong missile, as well as on hypothetical ICBMs like the KN-08 and Taepodong-2. North Korea has displayed mock-ups of these ICBMs, and the intelligence community assessed in 2016 that North Korea has taken initial steps towards fielding them. North Korea has shown progress in its medium-range ballistic missile program, submarine-launched ballistic missile tests, and is moving towards solid rocket motors for its ballistic missiles. The intelligence community assessed that North Korea has taken initial steps towards fielding an ICBM system, which has not been flight-tested yet. Additional testing may be required as North Korea continues to develop its missile capabilities. North Korea has successfully tested the Pukguksong-2 solid fuel MRBM and announced plans for mass production. Recent missile tests focus on defeating missile defense systems like Patriot, Aegis BMD, and THAAD. Some 2016 tests had higher altitudes and shorter ranges than optimal ballistic trajectories. North Korea's missile tests aim to defeat missile defense systems like Patriot, Aegis BMD, and THAAD. In 2017, they demonstrated the ability to launch multiple missiles in quick succession, potentially making interception more challenging. Progress with SLBMs suggests a strategy to counter land-based THAAD defenses. Korea's progress with SLBMs may be aimed at countering land-based THAAD missile defenses by launching attacks from sea positions outside THAAD's radar range. Previous attempts by the US to negotiate limits on North Korea's missile program were unsuccessful despite talks and promises made by Kim Jong-il to lift economic sanctions. Despite promises made during negotiations with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, a deal could not be reached. The Bush Administration prioritized the North Korean nuclear program over ballistic missiles, which were not discussed in the Six-Party Talks. In response to North Korea's missile activities, UNSC Resolution 1718 was passed in 2006, followed by Resolution 1874 in 2009. The 2012 Leap Day Agreement included a moratorium on ballistic missile tests, but North Korea continued with satellite launches. Recent talks have not yielded significant progress. North Korea has active biological and chemical weapons programs, with one of the world's largest chemical weapons stockpiles. They possess mustard, phosgene, and sarin gas, with multiple facilities and storage depots for chemical weapons. North Korea has a significant chemical weapon production capability, with an estimated inventory of 2,500 to 5,000 tons. A RAND analysis warns that one ton of sarin gas could cause tens of thousands of fatalities. If North Korea were to use chemical weapons, South Korea and Japan would be the most likely targets. North Korea is not a signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention. North Korea's lack of adherence to the Chemical Weapons Convention has raised concerns about its chemical and biological weapons capabilities. The U.S. intelligence community believes North Korea has a longstanding biological weapons capability and the infrastructure to support it. South Korea's Ministry of National Defense estimated in 2012 that North Korea maintains an ongoing biological weapons production capability. North Korea possesses anthrax and smallpox, among other biological weapons agents. The country has also proliferated WMD and missile-related technology to various countries, generating hard currency for the regime. Additionally, North Korea assisted Syria in building a nuclear reactor that was destroyed by Israel in 2007. North Korea has cooperated with Iran on missile development since the 1980s, with assistance from China as well. Iran's ballistic missile research centers had advisors in North Korea before a successful launch in December 2012. Israel destroyed a Syrian nuclear reactor in 2007, part of a suspected nuclear weapons program. U.N. reports show transfers of chemical weapons materials from North Korea to Syria. The North Korean regime engages in illicit activities to earn hard currency, including selling heavy transport vehicles to North Korea for missile purposes. They use a global network of entities to support these enterprises, involving production and trafficking of drugs, counterfeit currency, cigarettes, and pharmaceuticals. North Korea's Office 39 oversees illicit activities like drug production and smuggling, generating $500 million to $1 billion annually. The regime produces methamphetamine and supplies international smuggling networks. In 2013, Thai authorities arrested individuals smuggling North Korean-origin methamphetamines. North Korea increased illegal narcotics production in 2017, possibly due to tighter sanctions. North Korea ramped up illegal narcotics production around August 2017, possibly due to tighter sanctions. It is unclear if these activities are directed by state authorities or local criminal gangs. North Korea also sells Cold War-era weapons to countries in the Middle East and North Africa, as seen in the seizure of a vessel with rocket-propelled grenades in August 2016. North Korea has been involved in illegal activities such as selling Cold War-era weapons to countries in the Middle East and North Africa. A recent seizure of a vessel revealed over 30,000 rocket-propelled grenades destined for the Egyptian military. The regime uses front companies based in China to mask its illicit dealings and access the international financial system. These companies, often set up with the help of North Korean diplomats, keep the regime's earnings in overseas bank accounts. The U.S. government has been sanctioning companies working on behalf of the North Korean regime, with a Chinese bank, Bank of Dandong, being banned from the U.S. financial system for acting as a conduit for illicit North Korean transactions. The Bank of Dandong was banned from the U.S. financial system for facilitating illicit North Korean financial activities. In the past, Banco Delta Asia in Macau was also involved in distributing North Korean counterfeit currency and money laundering. The Treasury Department froze $24 million in North Korean accounts, leading to a boycott of Six-Party Talks until the funds were returned. Previous administrations have highlighted North Korea's poor human rights record. North Korea's abysmal human rights record has drawn attention, with Congress passing bills and holding hearings on the topic. Reports from the State Department and private organizations highlight extreme human rights abuses by the regime, including a total denial of political, civil, and religious liberties. Freedoms of speech, press, and assembly are nonexistent, with no independent judiciary or right to choose government. Extensive ideological indoctrination is also documented. Reports detail severe physical abuse and the existence of prison camps housing political prisoners in North Korea. These camps, known as kwanliso, hold around 100,000 individuals, with harsh conditions leading to high mortality rates among inmates. Escapees from North Korean prison camps report harsh conditions leading to high mortality rates, with close to 400,000 prisoners perishing in captivity over a 31-year period. Starvation, disease, executions, and torture are common practices in the camps, with political prisoner numbers decreasing due to high mortality rates. The United Nations has been actively addressing human rights violations in North Korea, with the creation of the Special Rapporteur and the Commission of Inquiry to investigate grave violations. The Commission of Inquiry found that the North Korean regime committed \"crimes against humanity\" and recommended referring the situation to the International Criminal Court. However, no action has been taken due to resistance from China and Russia. The U.N. Human Rights Council established a repository to archive evidence of North Korea's human rights violations for potential future prosecution. Tens of thousands of North Koreans have fled to China to escape food shortages and persecution, facing further abuse and risks if repatriated. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has not been given access to conduct a systematic survey on North Korean refugees in China. Reports indicate that many women and children are victims of human trafficking, with some refugees making their way to Southeast Asia to seek passage to South Korea, where all North Korean defectors receive citizenship. The number of defectors has declined in recent years. In recent years, the number of North Korean defectors resettling in South Korea has decreased, with 1,127 defectors in 2017, a 21% drop from 2016. Elite defections in 2016, including senior officials, have highlighted the changing demographic profile of defectors. Despite the overall decrease, the number of defectors with good songbun has increased, possibly due to tighter border security. Since the late 2000s, diplomats in North Korea have been tasked with earning foreign currency and procuring illicit goods for the regime. Elite defectors face imprisonment or execution if caught, leading many to flee to China where thousands are in hiding. China has been criticized for repatriating defectors back to North Korea. China has been actively cooperating with the North Korean regime to repatriate defectors back to their country, despite criticism from the U.N. Human Rights Council. China's repatriation policy for North Korean defectors violates the 1951 U.N. Refugee Convention. The Chinese government considers defectors as \"illegal economic migrants\" and deports them, based on a repatriation treaty with North Korea. Assisting refugees in any way is also illegal in China. Beijing's policy towards North Korean defectors involves repatriation, despite facing imprisonment, torture, and executions back home. China fears allowing refugees in may lead to a floodgate of defections and maintains this stance to preserve ties with North Korea. The regime treats the refugee issue seriously, akin to how China views Taiwan. The North Korean Human Rights Act (NKHRA) was passed in 2004, authorizing funds for human rights efforts in North Korea and linking nonhumanitarian assistance to human rights improvements. This act was signed by President George W. Bush and aimed to improve information flow in North Korea. The North Korean Human Rights Act (NKHRA) was passed in 2004 to fund human rights efforts in North Korea and link nonhumanitarian assistance to human rights improvements. It required the appointment of a \"Special Envoy on Human Rights in North Korea\" and allowed North Koreans to apply for asylum in the United States. Congress reauthorized the NKHRA in 2008, 2012, and 2018, making adjustments each time due to slow implementation. The North Korean Human Rights Act (NKHRA) was reauthorized by Congress in 2018, emphasizing efforts to resettle North Korean refugees in the United States and third countries. The reauthorization bill also focused on increasing freedom of information into North Korea. President Trump signed the bill into law on July 20, 2018. Analysts have raised concerns about North Korea's overseas workers and their working conditions. The State Department's annual Trafficking in Persons Report has consistently cited North Korea's overseas-labor program, highlighting the laborers' working conditions and how the regime uses them to generate hard currency. Many North Korean laborers sent abroad face conditions of forced labor, living and working under exploitative conditions akin to \"state-sponsored slavery.\" The workers' families remain in North Korea, and government minders monitor them while they work between 12 and 16 hours a day. North Korea's overseas-labor program exploits workers who toil long hours, with the regime taking a significant portion of their earnings. This program has been ongoing for decades, with an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 North Koreans working abroad in countries like Russia and China. The Trump Administration has pressured foreign governments to expel North Korean laborers working in various countries, including Russia and China. A UNSC resolution in December 2017 mandates all member countries to send these workers home by 2019. The Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act prohibits North Korean goods from entering the US and sanctions foreign entities using North Korean labor, presumed to be forced labor. The United States provided over $1.2 billion in assistance to North Korea between 1995 and 2008, with the majority allocated for food and energy aid. However, aid has ceased since early 2009, following the breakdown of the Six-Party Talks. Technical assistance was also provided for nuclear disablement until April 2009, with Congress enabling expanded assistance in 2008. Following North Korea's actions in 2009, Congress rejected the Obama Administration's requests for additional funds for the Six-Party Talks. U.S. food aid ended in early 2009 due to disagreements with Pyongyang. North Korea has since appealed for international support. The abrogated Leap Day Agreement would have provided food aid. The abrogated Leap Day Agreement would have provided 240,000 metric tons of food and nutritional aid for young children, pregnant mothers, and the elderly. North Korea engaged with U.S. officials to discuss the recovery of U.S. prisoners of war-missing in action in the 1990s. In 1996, North Korea and the United States agreed to joint investigations to recover the remains of U.S. servicemen from the Korean War. Despite difficulties, 33 joint investigations were conducted until 2005, resulting in the recovery of 229 sets of remains, with 107 successfully identified. However, in 2005, the Department of Defense suspended all joint field activities due to challenges in operations and negotiations with North Korea. The Department of Defense announced the suspension of all joint field activities with North Korea due to concerns about North Korea's nuclear intentions, withdrawal from the NPT, and safety issues for U.S. search teams. Talks between the two countries resumed in 2011, leading to an agreement in October 2011 for joint recovery efforts. The Department of Defense suspended joint field activities with North Korea in 2012 due to Pyongyang's rocket launch and credibility issues. North Korea warned about the potential damage to U.S. POW-MIAs remains in 2014, signaling a desire for broader negotiations with the U.S. The Department of Defense prioritizes recovering remains of missing U.S. soldiers from the Korean War. Trump and Kim committed to repatriating POW/MIA remains at the 2018 Singapore summit. North Korea handed over 55 cases of remains for repatriation and examination by the DPAA. The United States has a policy of not paying for the repatriation of remains from North Korea, which caused a delay in the transfer of remains. Aid to North Korea has mainly come from government contributions to relief programs, with some NGOs involved in capacity building and people-to-people exchanges. Some U.S.-based NGOs maintain good working relationships with North Korean counterparts in various fields like agriculture, health, diplomacy, and education, despite turbulent government relations. NGOs have diverse aims, including joint ventures between academic and diplomatic organizations, as well as religious groups providing humanitarian aid on a small scale in North Korea. Religious NGOs in North Korea aim to provide aid to vulnerable populations and promote peaceful relations. Operations have been hindered by U.S. sanctions and travel restrictions imposed by the Trump Administration. Approaches to North Korea, including various reports and insights by different authors, discuss topics such as the Trump-Kim Jong-un Summit, nuclear negotiations, peace treaty possibilities, and North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Military options and legislative basis for U.S. involvement are also covered in these resources. The curr_chunk provides a list of CRS reports on various topics related to North Korea, including economic sanctions, cyber capabilities, foreign assistance, U.S.-South Korea relations, ballistic missile defense, and North Korea's nuclear weapons."
