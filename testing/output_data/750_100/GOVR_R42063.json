Unemployment may not immediately decrease when economic growth picks up after a recession due to firms keeping underutilized employees on their payrolls to avoid costs of layoffs and rehiring. This delay in unemployment reduction is why it is considered a lagging economic indicator. During an economic recovery, firms can increase output without hiring more workers by raising productivity. This temporarily boosts labor productivity growth above its trend rate. Output growth is determined by labor supply and productivity growth rates. If GDP growth exceeds labor productivity growth, employment will rise, leading to a decrease in the unemployment rate. Okun's law, named after economist Arthur Okun, highlights the negative relationship between real GDP growth rates and unemployment. It states that stable unemployment rates require real GDP growth to be about equal to potential output growth. This principle has been widely accepted in the economics profession since the 1960s. The key to the long-run relationship between GDP growth and unemployment is the rate of growth in potential output, which is the economy's capacity to produce goods and services when resources are fully utilized. High unemployment leads to an output gap where actual GDP falls short of potential GDP. The rate of GDP growth compared to the rate of labor force growth determines the unemployment rate. If GDP growth is lower than labor force growth, unemployment will rise. If GDP growth exceeds labor force growth, unemployment will fall. The unemployment rate is determined by the relationship between GDP growth and labor force growth. If GDP growth is lower than labor force growth, unemployment will rise. If GDP growth exceeds labor force growth, unemployment will fall. Policymakers can use the rate of GDP growth to implement stimulus policies to reduce unemployment. Between 1950 and 2000, the civilian labor force grew at an average annual rate of 1.6%, but it has since slowed down due to the aging of the baby-boom generation. The annual rate of labor force growth fell to 0.8% between 2000 and 2010 and is projected to further decrease to 0.7% per year between 2010 and 2020. Predicting productivity growth is more challenging than predicting labor force growth. Between 1947 and 1973, productivity in the private nonfarm business sector grew at 2.8% annually. From 1973 to 1995, it slowed to 1.4% per year, then accelerated to 2.9% between 1995 and 2005. Since 2005, productivity growth has slowed to 1.6% annually. Real GDP growth above 2.5% is needed to lower the unemployment rate. According to Okun's law, real GDP must grow 2 percentage points faster than potential GDP to decrease the unemployment rate by 1 percentage point in a year. It may take some time for the unemployment rate to decline after an economic recovery. Table 1 illustrates the time taken for the unemployment rate to decrease following 11 economic contractions. Table 1 illustrates the time taken for the unemployment rate to decrease following 11 economic contractions. Following the end of some recessions, it took well over a year for the unemployment rate to start declining, leading to jobless recoveries. In contrast, in earlier recessions, the unemployment rate began trending downward within five months. The current recovery is closer to the longer end of this range, with the unemployment rate experiencing two successive monthly declines 12 months after the start of the recovery from the 2007-2009 recession. After 12 months of the 2007-2009 recession recovery, it was also labeled a jobless recovery. The pace of decline in the unemployment rate varied after postwar recessions, taking at least eight months for a one percentage point drop in eight out of eleven cases. The slowest decline was seen after the 2001 recession, with the unemployment rate taking about 3\u00bd years to fall by half a percentage point. The expansion following the 1981-1982 downturn began with a high unemployment rate of 10.8%, dropping to 9.4% in eight months. There is a debate on Okun's law and its applicability to economic growth and unemployment rate changes. Despite high growth rates early in the recovery, the unemployment rate stalled at around 9.0% in 2011 due to slow GDP growth. In 2011, real GDP growth was slow with rates of 0.1%, 2.5%, and 1.3% in the first three quarters, but accelerated to 4.1% in the fourth quarter. Unemployment rate dropped to 8.5% in December 2011, despite GDP growth below 2%. This discrepancy was noted by the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board in March 2012. The U.S. economy's potential growth rate may have led to a temporary disconnect in the unemployment rate in 2009. Okun's law underpredicted the actual decline in unemployment during the recovery periods after previous recessions. Some economists suggest that the relationship between economic growth rates and unemployment can be unstable, with variations possibly due to the business cycle. Owyang and Sekhposyan caution against relying too heavily on simple calculations linking changes in unemployment to output growth. In contrast, Ball et al argue that increases and decreases in output have the same impact on unemployment, supporting Okun's theory. The rule-of-thumb applies equally well to recoveries and recessions, as demonstrated by Ball et al between 2009 and 2011. Large output gaps persisted into jobless recoveries from the 1990-1991, 2001, and 2007-2009 recessions. According to economist Robert J. Gordon, potential output growth has averaged 3.4% annually since 1875, but he predicts slower growth in the next 20 years due to diminishing gains from information technology investments. Economist Robert J. Gordon predicts a 2.4% growth in potential output over the next 20 years, leading to a declining unemployment rate. Economists Susanto Basu and John G. Fernald suggest that the drop in household net worth during the 2007-2009 recession may increase the supply of labor in the near term. The drop in household net worth during the 2007-2009 recession may increase the supply of labor in the near term, leading to temporarily higher growth in potential output. Disruptions in financial markets could constrain growth in potential output due to higher risks associated with investment spending. Estimates show that potential output growth was rapid during the initial expansions of the 1960s through 1980s. The potential output growth was rapid during the 1960s through 1980s expansions, estimated at 3.6%. However, it was more moderate at 2.5% during the recoveries from the 1990-1991 and 2001 recessions. The slow rate of labor force growth led to a sluggish 2.1% potential GDP growth at the start of the Great Recession recovery. Real economic growth above 2.1% could result in a decrease in the unemployment rate. The Congressional Budget Office projects a 2.2% average annual growth in potential output. The Congressional Budget Office projects that the potential output of the overall economy will grow at an average annual rate of 2.2% between 2012 and 2022. This lower projection is mainly due to reduced potential labor force growth, with the annual average rate of unemployment estimated to remain high until 2018. The Congressional Budget Office projects that the potential output of the overall economy will grow at an average annual rate of 2.2% between 2012 and 2022. The annual average rate of unemployment is estimated to remain above 8.0% through 2014, then fall to 5.9% by 2017 as the output gap narrows."
