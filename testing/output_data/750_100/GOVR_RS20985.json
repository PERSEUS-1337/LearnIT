    "content": "Federal agencies use procurement contracts for various tasks, including forest stewardship services like cutting trees and treating materials. Contracts typically outline tasks to be performed, such as cutting unmerchantable trees and treating materials in different ways. Agencies currently award contracts to the lowest bidder, but Congress could consider other factors for selection. Some have suggested that commercially valuable material could be collected under a procurement contract and sold separately, especially by the Forest Service, a practice known as log sales. This approach, common in Europe, has been discussed for national forests for decades, although the Forest Service has not extensively utilized this authority. Advantages of traditional procurement contracting for forest stewardship include simplicity, familiarity to agency personnel and contractors, and the opportunity for congressional control and oversight. A new oversight structure for federal forest stewardship could help Congress assess agency efficiency and target appropriations to areas in need. Traditional service contracting for forest stewardship has limitations, including high federal expenditures and ecological damage risks from wildfires in certain forest ecosystems. The potential cost of treating federal acres at risk of ecological damage from wildfires could exceed $20 billion for 75 million acres. Including lands at moderate risk could bring the total cost to around $70 billion. Suggested modifications to service procurement contracting for forest stewardship could hinder efforts. Efforts to improve federal forest health could be hampered by suggested changes to service procurement contracting for forest stewardship. Using desired conditions instead of tasks for contracting could enhance forest stewardship, but standardized measures for desired forest conditions are lacking. Advocates propose separate log sales for commercially valuable wood, but log values often depend on how the log is cut. To improve federal forest health, it is suggested to combine various activities like salvage sales with mixed-species planting or prescribed burning after precommercial thinning. The limitations of traditional service procurement contracting for federal forest health improvement include log values depending on how the log is cut and the agency's lack of experience with log sales. Independence of service contractors from potential log purchasers is important to avoid conflicts-of-interest. Some propose trading goods for services in forest stewardship contracts to reduce costs. These contracts require timber purchasers to perform additional services in exchange for lower timber prices. Federal laws restrict agencies from using proceeds from asset sales without authorization. In 1998, Congress established a test of goods-for-services contracting in the FY1999 Interior Appropriations Act. This authorized 28 \"stewardship end result contracting demonstration projects\" with specific guidelines. Additional projects were authorized in subsequent years. In 2002, goods-for-services stewardship contracting was considered in the 2002 Farm Bill. The House and Senate versions of H.R. 2646 differed on authorizing contracts for the Forest Service through FY2007, with varying requirements on traditional service contracts and reports comparing approaches. President Bush proposed goods-for-services stewardship contracting to reduce forest fuels after the 2002 fire season. The Senate debated this approach as part of wildfire management funding in the FY2003 Interior Appropriations Act, but the final bill (P.L. 107-171) did not include any provision on goods-for-services contracting. The debate over stewardship contracting and other provisions of the Healthy Forests Initiative delayed action on the bill, leading to Interior appropriations being included in continuing resolutions without these provisions. Interior appropriations for FY2003 were enacted as Division F of P.L.108-7, the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution. Section 323 of the FY1999 Interior Appropriations Act was amended to authorize \"stewardship end result contracting\" through FY2013, extend the program to BLM lands and national forests, modify cutting objectives, and allow selection of a contracting officer without constraints. The FY1999 Interior Appropriations Act was amended to authorize stewardship end result contracting through FY2013, allowing the selection of a contracting officer without constraints. The approach has been modified to allow agencies to impose non-timber harvesting requirements on purchasers in timber sales. It is unclear if stewardship contracts can be used in areas where commercial timber harvesting is prohibited. One advantage of goods-for-services contracting is increased efficiency and lower costs in forest stewardship activities. Using the same equipment and personnel for both timber harvesting and other tasks can reduce overall costs. Having one contractor for multiple related tasks can be more efficient than multiple independent contracts. Some proponents claim that goods-for-services contracting is beneficial for forest stewardship as it offers off-budget financing. Federal agencies could buy stewardship services with timber assets instead of appropriations. However, a limitation of this approach may be higher contracting costs. Contracts to improve forest stewardship may incur higher contracting costs by combining multiple activities into one contract. The Forest Service's procedures for pilot tests of goods-for-services contracting were criticized for being overly complex, leading to increased upfront effort and costs compared to separate contracts. Simplifying contracting procedures and providing longer-term authorizations were suggested to fully realize the benefits of goods-for-services contracting. The provision for goods-for-services contracting allows longer-term authorization but may lack congressional oversight. Other off-budget financing mechanisms have also faced minimal oversight. This could result in agencies using goods-for-services contracting for many years with little public or congressional control. Some interests have questioned the appropriateness of goods-for-services contracting due to the incentive it creates for managers to increase timber sales to provide services. This could lead to \"perverse incentives\" where environmentally damaging activities are supported to generate funds for other resource values. Exchanging timber for forest stewardship activities may create incentives for wildfire protection by cutting non-commercial woody biomass. This approach could emphasize stewardship on lands with commercial timber. Some observers question the appropriateness of a broad-scale, long-term program for goods-for-services contracts on federal forests. Evaluating the success of these contracts has been challenging, but they provide an experimental opportunity to test alternative contracting arrangements. The effectiveness and efficiency of goods-for-services stewardship contracting have not been adequately evaluated despite tests in the early 1990s and recent years. The effectiveness and efficiency of goods-for-services stewardship contracting have not been independently audited."
