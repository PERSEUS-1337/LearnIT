    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Historically Women's Public Colleges or Universities Historic Building Restoration and Preservation Act\". Definitions are provided in Section 2. The Act defines \"historically women's public college or university\" as a higher education institution established in the US between 1836 and 1908 for women's industrial education. \"Historic building or structure\" refers to a building listed on the National Register of Historic Places or designated as a National Historic Landmark. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior and applies to places designated as National Historic Landmarks or located within historic districts. Preservation and restoration grants are available for historic buildings and structures at historically women's public colleges or universities. Preservation and restoration grants are awarded to historically women's public colleges or universities for historic buildings and structures on their campuses. Grants are funded through appropriations for the National Historic Preservation Act for fiscal years 2002 through 2006. Grants awarded for historic buildings require the grantee to agree to specific conditions, including obtaining Secretary's approval for alterations and allowing public access for interpretive and educational purposes. The Secretary may use funds for a grant related to a historic building only if the grantee agrees to provide 50% of the program costs from non-Federal sources, with the Secretary funding the remaining 50%. The grant requires non-Federal interests to cover 50% of costs, which can include in-kind contributions. Funding provisions limit the availability to $16,000,000 annually from 2002 to 2006. For fiscal year 2002, $2,000,000 is available for grants under subsection (a) for specific universities in Mississippi, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Alabama. For fiscal year 2002, if less than $16,000,000 is available for grants, the amount given to specific universities in Alabama, Texas, Oklahoma, and Georgia will be reduced by the same amount. The Secretary will distribute funds for fiscal years 2003-2006 to eligible grantees on a uniform basis. Regulations will be promulgated to implement this Act."
