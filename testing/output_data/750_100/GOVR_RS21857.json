Its foreign investment policy aims to benefit both the U.S. and foreign investors, with considerations for national security risks. The Trump Administration has not yet outlined its specific foreign investment policy. The Trump Administration has not provided a formal statement on its foreign investment policy in line with the \"America First\" policy. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross mentioned at a 2017 investment summit that the Administration welcomes foreign investment in the U.S. The United States had a global inward foreign direct investment position of $6.4 trillion in 2016, with the total global inward direct investment position at $26.7 trillion. Other countries with significant inward investment positions include Hong Kong, China, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Switzerland. The United States has a global inward foreign direct investment position of $6.4 trillion in 2016, with significant investment positions in Hong Kong, China, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Switzerland. The Commerce Department uses three measures to publish data on U.S. direct investment position: historical cost, current cost, and market value. In 2016, foreign direct investment in the United States increased by $876 billion at market value and $390 billion at current cost. The total cumulative FDI reached $7.4 trillion at market value, $4.0 trillion at current cost, and $3.5 trillion at historical cost. The United Kingdom and Japan compete for position in FDI by country. Foreign direct investment in the United States fluctuates annually based on economic conditions. In 2014, there was a significant drop due to a $130 billion stock buyback between Verizon and France's Vodafone. Despite not reaching pre-financial crisis levels, foreign direct investment in the U.S. in 2015 remained substantial. Foreign direct investment in the United States rebounded in 2015 and 2016, surpassing 2007 levels despite the global financial crisis. Global investment flows grew by 38% in 2015 to $1.76 trillion, below the 2007 peak. Developed economies saw an 85% increase in foreign direct investment, while developing countries saw a 9.5% increase. Foreign direct investment in the United States increased by 9.5% in developing countries. The rise in foreign direct investment in the US in 2016 reflects a 10% drop in net equity investments by foreign-owned firms. Equity capital accounted for 53.0% of foreign direct investment in the United States, raising questions about the impact on the US economy. Foreign firms in the U.S. are increasingly relying on equity investments, accounting for nearly 67% of investment funds in 2016. Intercompany debt also shifted from a net outflow to positive inflows in 2016. This trend may be driven by efforts to boost stock value through share buybacks, similar to U.S. firms since early 2014. Total intercompany debt decreased by 18% in 2015 compared to 2014, while foreign reinvested earnings fell by 15% between 2014 and 2015. U.S. direct investment abroad increased by 1.5% in 2015 to $349 billion, with a projected 2.4% rise in 2016 to reach $357 billion. Foreign direct investment in the U.S. economy decreased to 8.2% in 2013 from 10.4% in 2012. Better credit conditions and economic growth boosted mergers and acquisitions. U.S. trade involves a significant amount of intrafirm transactions. In 2014, U.S. total trade amounted to $1.6 trillion in exports and $2.3 trillion in imports. Intrafirm trade, involving U.S. parent companies and their foreign affiliates, accounted for $315 billion in exports and imports, while foreign firms' affiliates in the U.S. accounted for $189 billion in exports and $521 billion in imports, totaling 31% of trade. Foreign investors from various countries have invested in a wide range of industries in the U.S., with developed economies contributing over 90% of all foreign direct investment. The manufacturing sector received the largest share of investments, totaling $1.2 trillion in 2015, representing one-third of all foreign direct investment. Foreign direct investment in the U.S. is concentrated in the industrial sector, with a significant portion in finance, insurance, wholesale trade, information, and banking sectors. Manufacturing sector sees heavy investment in chemicals and transport, while food sector receives about 6% of foreign direct investment. Labor productivity in some parts of the U.S. manufacturing sector is robust. Labor productivity in the U.S. manufacturing sector has been robust compared to other sectors and advanced economies. From 1993 to 2010, labor productivity in the sector doubled, while nonfarm business labor productivity increased by 50%. Unit labor costs in the U.S. decreased by 15% from 2002 to 2011, while rising in 18 other countries. Foreign direct investment in the U.S. is concentrated in the industrial sector, with significant investments in various industries. Foreign direct investment in the U.S. saw significant increases in the commercial real estate and manufacturing sectors in 2015, with a 10% decrease in the banking sector. The United Kingdom and Japan are the top foreign investors in the U.S., with investments of $484 billion and $411 billion respectively. In 2015, the United States saw increased foreign direct investment in commercial real estate and manufacturing sectors, with a 10% decrease in banking. Japan is the second-largest investor in the U.S. economy at $411 billion, followed by Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Canada, Switzerland, Germany, and France. Certain countries dominate specific industrial sectors, indicating international specialization in investment patterns. Netherlands and the United Kingdom accounted for the majority of foreign investments by year-end 2015. Foreign investments in the U.S. petroleum sector are mainly from the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, with Royal Dutch Shell and British Petroleum being key players. Japanese investments are significant in the wholesale trade sector, while European investors dominate the retail trade sector. German investors lead in the information sector due to media company acquisitions. French, German, and British investments are prominent in the banking sector, and Dutch, Canadian, British, and French investments make up a significant portion of overall foreign investments. Foreign direct investment in the U.S. manufacturing sector is dominated by Luxembourg, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Japan, Switzerland, France, and Germany, accounting for nearly 80% of the total amount. Canada's investment in the U.S. finance and insurance sectors surpasses Japan and Switzerland. Foreign direct investment in the United States totals $60 billion, with Swiss investments contributing significantly. Foreign firms in the U.S. employ over 6.6 million workers, with half of them employed by the top six countries. One-third of foreign affiliate employment is in the U.S. manufacturing sector. Greenfield investments, where foreigners establish new firms, are preferred at the local level. In 2015, new investments in the U.S. totaled $421 billion, a significant increase from the previous year. Foreign investors acquired 791 existing U.S. firms, accounting for 43% of foreign direct investment by number. However, acquisitions of existing U.S. firms made up over 96% of the total value of new foreign investments. In 2015, new foreign investments in the U.S. totaled $421 billion, with acquisitions of existing U.S. firms accounting for over 96% of the total value. U.S. affiliates of foreign firms typically make up more than 80% of total transactions, while other foreign direct investors account for the remaining 20%. Acquisitions of existing U.S. firms also accounted for 99% of employment associated with foreign investment in 2015, raising questions about the economic impact on U.S. employment. Over the past decade, national security concerns have led to increased restrictions on foreign investment in various countries. This has raised policy issues regarding the legitimacy of such restrictions. The United States addresses national security concerns related to direct investment. The United States addresses national security concerns related to foreign acquisitions through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews transactions to determine threats to national security, foreign government control, or critical infrastructure control. The President has the authority to block foreign investment transactions that threaten national security. The CFIUS process is voluntary but firms risk future review and possible divestiture if they do not notify CFIUS. In a 2016 report, CFIUS stated that 42% of notified foreign investment transactions from 2008 to 2014 were in the manufacturing sector, with finance, information, and services sectors accounting for another 31%. Investments in finance, information, and services sectors made up 31% of total notified transactions. In the manufacturing sector, over 40% of investments were in computer and electronic products. Transportation equipment and machinery sectors followed. Services sector accounted for half of investments in finance, information, and services category. Foreign government-owned firms are increasingly active in international investments. Foreign government-owned firms, known as state-owned enterprises (SOEs), are causing concerns due to their economic and security implications. The OECD reports that 22% of the world's largest 100 firms are effectively under state control. Policymakers worry that preferential treatment given to SOEs may lead to competitive advantages and anticompetitive effects in the global marketplace. State-owned enterprises (SOEs) are causing concerns due to their economic and security implications. Close associations between firms and governments may blur the distinction between commercial activities and those driven by public policy goals. Policymakers worry that SOEs may gain competitive advantages in the global marketplace. Some policymakers are concerned about state-owned enterprises (SOEs) engaging in foreign investments that could compromise national security. The OECD found little evidence that advantages given to SOEs affect their international economic performance. By the end of 2014, there were over 3,790 U.S. parent companies with more than 32,000. By the end of 2014, there were 3,790 U.S. parent companies with 32,000 foreign affiliates. U.S. parent companies employed over 26 million workers in the United States, while foreign firms employed 13.8 million workers abroad. U.S.-based affiliates of foreign firms paid nearly 80% more in aggregate employee compensation in the United States than did foreign affiliates of U.S. parent companies. The data shows that U.S. parent companies are more efficient than U.S. affiliates of U.S. firms or foreign firms in the United States, with higher output per employee. Foreign firms in the U.S. are more capital intensive, reflecting newer capital stock. U.S. affiliates of foreign companies had higher gross output than foreign affiliates of U.S. firms abroad. The foreign affiliates of U.S. firms have higher total sales compared to U.S. affiliates of foreign firms. They also pay more taxes to foreign governments and in relative terms than U.S. parent companies and foreign-owned affiliates in the U.S. Foreign firms have investments in every state, with varying levels of employment. In 2014, foreign firms employed over 699,000 people in California, with Texas, New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Florida, and New Jersey also having large numbers of foreign firm employees. Manufacturing sector accounted for 38% of foreign firms' employment, with average annual compensation per worker around $82,000. Retail and wholesale trade sectors each accounted for 8% and 9% of total affiliate employment. Dutch-affiliated firms are the largest employers in the retail trade sector. Foreign firms are significant employers in various sectors in the US. They make up a large portion of employment in retail, wholesale, professional services, information, finance, and real estate sectors. The Department of Commerce has withheld some industry-specific employment data. The finance sector offers the highest average employee compensation at $187,000. Foreign firms in the finance sector offer the highest average employee compensation at $187,000. These firms, mainly from Britain, Canada, Switzerland, France, and the Netherlands, account for three-fourths of the sector's employment. In 2014, foreign affiliates invested $248 billion in new plants and equipment, imported $735 billion in goods, and exported $434 billion in goods. Foreign direct investment in the US economy has increased significantly since 1980, nearly doubling as a share of GDP from 3.4% to 6.4%. Foreign-owned firms in the United States historically had lower rates of return compared to U.S.-owned firms, but the gap has narrowed over time. This narrowing is attributed to age effects and startup costs associated with acquiring or establishing a new business. Foreign-owned manufacturing firms in the U.S. outperform their U.S. counterparts with six times more value added and seven times higher value of shipments. The average plant size for foreign-owned firms is six times larger, attributed to the absence of small plants among them. Foreign-owned manufacturing firms in the U.S. have higher wages, productivity, and output compared to U.S.-owned firms. They also exhibit greater capital intensity across multiple industries. However, comparisons between the two groups should be approached with caution due to differences in firm composition. Foreign-owned firms in the U.S. are typically larger and more established, with proven technologies, compared to smaller ventures that are less likely to invest overseas due to the added risk. Foreign investors also tend to choose larger-scale and higher-capital-intensity plants to offset the risks of investing abroad. Foreign direct investment in the United States rose sharply in 2015, reflecting a growing economy and rising equity values. Globally, foreign direct investment inflows increased by 38% in 2015 to reach $1.7 trillion, but have not yet recovered to pre-financial-crisis levels. Many regions in Africa and parts of Latin America also experienced an increase in foreign direct investment. Foreign direct investment in the United States is expected to increase as the U.S. economy grows. In 2015, global foreign direct investment inflows reached $1.7 trillion, with some regions experiencing a slowdown. Estimates suggest that foreign direct investment in the U.S. economy may slightly increase in 2016. Public concerns over foreign direct investment in the economy are of particular importance. Public concerns over foreign direct investment in the economy, particularly related to globalization and its impact on jobs, are focused on potential job losses from mergers and acquisitions. These concerns are balanced by perceived benefits such as capital inflow and the creation of new jobs in local areas. Despite concerns about the impact on job security and national security, the U.S. economy remains a top destination for foreign direct investment, with some investments raising national security issues. As the nation's economy grows compared to foreign economies, foreign direct investment is likely to increase in the United States, attracting new investments and encouraging existing firms to reinvest profits in their U.S. operations."
