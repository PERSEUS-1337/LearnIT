    "content": "The Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides legal protection to identified species and their habitats. Administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), the ESA categorizes species as \"endangered\" or \"threatened\" based on their risk of extinction. Once listed, the ESA offers legal tools to aid in species recovery and habitat protection, including the prohibition of unpermitted \"take\". The Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides legal protection to identified species and their habitats, including prohibiting unpermitted \"take\" of endangered species. As of August 24, 2016, there were 2,266 species listed as endangered or threatened, with 1,593 in the United States and its territories. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) was passed in 1973 to protect species and habitats, with 1,156 U.S. species covered by recovery plans. The ESA has been amended multiple times since its inception, with funding authorization expiring in 1992 but appropriations continuing each fiscal year. The ESA's purpose is to conserve ecosystems for endangered and threatened species, with prohibitions and penalties remaining in effect regardless of funding. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) plays a crucial role in protecting species, but it can also spark debates over scarce resources. Economic interests often clash over vanishing species, which can signal resource scarcities and ecosystem changes. Examples include controversies like the Tellico Dam. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) sparks debates over resource controversies such as the Tellico Dam and Northwest timber harvest. The global climate change debate is exemplified by the polar bear. Tensions over the ESA have increased with species added to the protected list and growing economic demands. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) has sparked debates over resource controversies and global climate change, with tensions increasing as species are added to the protected list due to economic demands. Congress and the executive branch have tried to address these tensions by tailoring the ESA for specific circumstances, but critics argue that more needs to be done to accommodate needs other than species conservation. Supporters of the ESA argue that it balances a bias towards development in other governmental laws and policies. Debate on the ESA largely divides along demographic lines. Support for species conservation varies among demographic groups, with stronger support in urban and suburban areas compared to rural regions. Coastal populations show more support than those in central and mountain states. Sport hunters and anglers are divided on the issue, while Native Americans often support the survival of listed species due to their reliance on natural resources. Opponents of strong protections argue about potential job losses, while proponents claim the opposite. The debate surrounding species conservation continues. The debate over species conservation involves ethical, economic, and religious considerations. Some industries view the Endangered Species Act (ESA) as a hindrance, while others benefit from it. The ESA grants statutory authority for certain activities and authorizes appropriations. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) grants authority for activities and appropriations through FY1992. Questions arise about the act's prohibitions, House and Senate rules for appropriations without current authorization, and the impact of failing to appropriate funds for agencies like FWS and NMFS. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) remains authorized despite the expiration of appropriations in FY1992. The agencies still have the authority to carry out actions and enforce prohibitions outlined in the act, even without funding. The statutory obligations under the ESA continue to be in effect according to U.S. Supreme Court rulings. Despite the lack of funding, the Endangered Species Act (ESA) remains in effect, allowing citizens to file civil suits for violations. This means that parties violating the ESA could still face legal action, even if the agencies responsible for enforcement lack funds. The possibility of citizen suits under the Endangered Species Act could deter parties from violating the law due to lack of funds for enforcement. Congressional rules distinguish between authorizations and appropriations but do not affect a law's statutory force. House Rule XXI prohibits unauthorized appropriations in legislation. House rules, including Rule XXI and Rule XXII, prohibit unauthorized appropriations in legislation, amendments, and conference reports. These rules are enforced through points of order on the floor, but the House Rules Committee can set procedural parameters for consideration of appropriations measures, including waiving rules for unauthorized appropriations. House rules prohibit unauthorized appropriations in legislation, amendments, and conference reports. Special rules can waive points of order against provisions in a conference report on an appropriations measure. Senate rules also distinguish between authorizations and appropriations, prohibiting unauthorized appropriations in committee and floor amendments. This rule is enforced through points of order but can be waived by unanimous consent. During a lapse in funding, various activities may be affected, such as interagency consultations for agency actions, issuance of incidental take statements, and listing or delisting of species, potentially leading to increased lawsuits. During a funding lapse, activities like interagency consultations, species listing/delisting, critical habitat designation, permits for nonfederal actions, inspections for CITES violations, and monitoring of candidate species may be affected, potentially leading to increased lawsuits. During a funding lapse, activities like interagency consultations, species listing/delisting, critical habitat designation, permits for nonfederal actions, inspections for CITES violations, and monitoring of candidate species may be affected, potentially leading to increased lawsuits. No federal enforcement of prohibitions on taking listed species or adverse modification of critical habitat; no acquisition of habitat for listed species; no state grants for conservation of listed or candidate species; and no ability to exempt agency actions from jeopardy opinions under Section 7 (e)-(p). Last major effort to end all funding for the ESA occurred in the 104th Congress. The ESA in the 104th Congress aimed to eliminate conflicts in projects but was abandoned due to various effects. The ESA's goal is species recovery, but only 34 species have been delisted for recovery. Ten species have become extinct since listing, and 8 have been delisted for other reasons. Since the ESA's inception in the 104th Congress, its goal of species recovery has seen limited success, with only 34 species being delisted for recovery. Ten species have become extinct since listing, while 8 have been delisted due to scientific reclassification or improved data. The challenge lies in determining the status of extremely rare species, such as the ivory-billed woodpecker and Eskimo curlew, which are listed as endangered despite rare sightings suggesting possible extinction. The effectiveness of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) is difficult to measure due to the rarity of confirmed sightings of endangered species. Despite challenges in proving extinction, some studies suggest that the ESA has helped stabilize or increase populations of listed species. The ESA has been successful in improving or stabilizing the population levels of 41% of listed species. Some species like red wolves and California condors might not exist without ESA protection, showing its impact on preventing extinction. There is a lack of comprehensive studies on the status of rare species without the ESA, but some species like salmon populations, Florida panthers, and plants with narrow ranges could have declined further without its protection. The ESA has prevented the extinction of species like red wolves and California condors. Scientific analysis is crucial for ESA actions. The focus has shifted to understanding extinction causes and rates compared to historical levels. The debate used to center on over-exploitation, but now includes a broader range of threats to species. During the 20th century, a shift occurred in the endangerment of species, now primarily due to habitat loss, including tall-grass prairies, wetlands, old growth forests, rivers, coral reefs, and sandy beaches. Global climate change and nonnative invasive species also contribute to population decline. The introduction of nonnative invasive species, such as disease vectors, predators, and competitors, has led to the demise of many species. Some species are threatened by multiple factors, and some decline for no obvious reason. Extinction is considered normal by some, questioning the need for government intervention to halt this natural process. Geological evidence shows that most species that have ever lived on Earth are now extinct, a fact uncontested by paleontologists. However, the current rate of extinction is a concern as it exceeds background extinction rates. Estimating current rates of extinction is challenging due to uncertainty in the total number of species, which ranges from 3.5 million to 100 million. Scientists use conservative assumptions to estimate extinction rates due to uncertainty in the total number of species. Current extinction rates (e.g., 17,000 species per year) are believed to exceed background rates, with diverse methods supporting this conclusion. The public is often unaware of the vast number of species in less popular groups like beetles and marine invertebrates. Current extinction rates are believed to exceed background rates, with estimates ranging from 100 to 10,000 times higher. Critics question these calculations due to uncertainties in estimating the number of existing species. Some biologists argue that despite uncertainties in estimating species numbers, similar results are found across different studies and methods, indicating scientific validity. Extinct species cannot be revived, but new species may evolve to adapt to changing conditions, potentially leading to a form of recovery. Some scientists estimate that recovery from severe extinction events could take up to 25 million years, suggesting that the return to pre-historic species numbers would take several million years. The Endangered Species Act defines an endangered species as one in danger of extinction throughout its range. The Endangered Species Act defines a threatened species as likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future. The ESA protects all species and subspecies of animals, not just birds and mammals, with no reliance on a numerical standard. Protection can be extended for distinct vertebrates. The Endangered Species Act protects all species and subspecies of animals, not just birds and mammals. Further protection can be given for distinct population segments within a species. Limited protection is available for plant species, and there is no protection for organisms considered neither animal nor plant. The term \"take\" under the ESA includes actions like harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect. Controversy exists over whether the prohibition on taking may include habitat modification. The Endangered Species Act protects all species and subspecies of animals, including distinct population segments. Limited protection is available for plant species, and there is no protection for organisms considered neither animal nor plant. The term \"take\" includes actions like harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect. A 1995 Supreme Court decision interpreted \"harm\" to include significant habitat modification that kills or injures wildlife. The Secretary of the Interior manages most listed species through FWS, while marine species and anadromous fish are under the Secretary of Commerce through NMFS. The law assigns the major role to the Secretary of the Interior. The Endangered Species Act allows species to be listed based on scientific information and public input, without considering economic effects. This section is the only part of the ESA that addresses listing criteria. The Endangered Species Act prohibits economic considerations in determining critical habitat. Species can be classified as endangered or threatened based on their decline and survival threats. Endangered species are at risk of extinction, while threatened species are likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future. The Endangered Species Act defines species as endangered if they are at risk of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of their range. The interpretation of \"all or a significant portion of its range\" has varied, with the Department of the Interior previously requiring a species to be endangered throughout all of its range to qualify for protection. The Endangered Species Act defines species as endangered if they are at risk of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of their range. In 2014, FWS and NMFS issued a joint interpretation stating that a portion of a species' range is significant if its contribution to the species' viability is crucial, even if the species is not currently endangered throughout its entire range. This interpretation has been challenged in court, with most courts finding it in violation of the ESA. The Endangered Species Act defines species as endangered if they are at risk of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of their range. The interpretation clarifies that the range of a species is where it currently exists, not where it once existed. Listing determinations must be based on scientific factors and threats to the species' continuance, using the best available data without considering economic impacts. The decision to list a species as endangered or threatened should be based solely on biological criteria, without considering economic impacts. This ensures that non-biological factors do not influence listing decisions. The legislation requires the Secretary to base determinations on listing or delisting species solely on scientific and commercial data, excluding economic considerations. The focus is on the biological status of the species, with the only alternatives being listing as endangered, threatened, or not listed at all. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) emphasizes that species listing decisions should be based solely on scientific and commercial data, excluding economic factors. The focus is on determining if a species is endangered, threatened, or not listed, without considering economics. However, conservation methods can still be chosen to lower costs while achieving conservation goals. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) prioritizes scientific and commercial data for species listing decisions, excluding economic factors. Conservation methods can be chosen to lower costs while achieving conservation goals. Petitions to change species status are subject to specific standards and deadlines, with agencies required to make an initial determination within 90 days. If substantial scientific or commercial information is presented, the agency has 12 months to conduct a status review. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) requires agencies to make timely decisions on species listing petitions. Lawsuits have been filed for missed deadlines, leading to settlement agreements in 2011. As of August 2016, FWS had received over 160 ESA petitions. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) requires timely decisions on species listing petitions. By August 2016, FWS had received over 160 petitions, with more than 100 for listing. The federal government's responsibilities towards proposed but unlisted species may be significant, as agencies must confer on actions that could jeopardize a species' existence. The Endangered Species Act requires timely decisions on species listing petitions. Agencies must confer on actions that could jeopardize a species' existence. The conference process assists in resolving conflicts early in the planning process for proposed species. The Endangered Species Act requires agencies to confer on actions that could harm species to avoid adverse effects and duplication of effort later. Agencies should consider minimizing harm to species and potential liability at the proposed listing stage. The Endangered Species Act requires agencies to confer on actions that could harm species to avoid adverse effects and duplication of effort later. Agencies should consider minimizing harm to species and potential liability at the proposed listing stage. Arising from agency actions creating private rights that later cannot be exercised, the relevant Secretary must monitor candidate species to prevent a significant risk to their well-being. Candidate species are those being considered for listing as endangered or threatened, with 58 species identified as of August 24, 2016. Federal agencies and entities may work to improve a species' status to avoid future listing proposals. Federal agencies and nonfederal landowners may develop candidate conservation agreements (CCA) to improve a species' status and avoid future listing proposals under the Endangered Species Act. Landowners can pursue candidate conservation agreements with assurances (CCAA) to carry out specified actions for species conservation, with the assurance that no changes will be required if the species is listed as threatened or endangered. If a species is proposed for listing, the Secretary must publish the proposal. If a species is proposed for listing under the ESA, the Secretary must publish the proposed regulation in the Federal Register, notify state agencies and counties, invite comments, notify foreign countries, inform professional societies, publish a local summary, and hold a public hearing. As of August 24, 2016, 73 species were proposed for listing. Federal agencies must confer with the Secretary on actions that may harm candidate species. The Secretary must monitor candidate species for any emergencies that could endanger them, and may promptly list them if necessary. Special regulations can be implemented for threatened species to tailor protections and recovery measures to specific situations. A federal regulation clarifies that threatened species without special rules enjoy the same protections as endangered species. A distinct population segment (DPS) under the ESA refers to a genetically distinct and geographically separated portion of a listed species. Criteria for designating a DPS include population discreteness and significance. The protection status of a Distinct Population Segment (DPS) is determined based on criteria such as population discreteness and significance. Special rules may be written under Section 4(d) of the ESA if the DPS is found to be threatened. The designation of DPS, like the gray wolf, has led to legal disputes, with courts vacating DPS designations established by FWS. NMFS introduced the concept of evolutionarily significant units. The concept of evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) was developed by NMFS to interpret the \"distinct population segment\" language in the ESA. ESUs identify important groups of salmon populations, with 28 ESUs of salmon and steelhead trout listed as endangered or threatened along the Pacific coast. Some find the ESU concept problematic as it was not scientifically based before NMFS introduced it for policy and scientific reasons. The ESU concept was developed by NMFS to address the issue of distinct population segments in the ESA. It was chosen for practical reasons due to the large number of distinct stocks and the need to differentiate among different population segments. The controversial question of whether hatchery fish can be included in an ESU to increase population counts has been raised. Additionally, Congress added the concept of experimental populations to the ESA in 1982 to reintroduce species without severe land use restrictions. Experimental populations are reintroduced under specific criteria, including authorization from the service and geographical separation from other animals of the same species. The protected status of an experimental population is determined based on its risk of extinction, with essential populations receiving higher protection. Currently, no experimental populations are designated as essential, and nonessential populations are considered threatened. Special regulations are in place for nonessential experimental populations under the ESA, with rules for taking the species. No Section 7 consultation is required for agency actions unless the population is in a national wildlife refuge or park. Critical habitat is not designated for nonessential populations. The processes for delisting a species are the same as listing it. Plants can be delisted, downlisted, or uplisted based on scientific data. The Secretary of the Interior can initiate status changes or review petitions. Economic impacts are not considered in the decision-making process. Species status must be reviewed every five years. The Endangered Species Act mandates a review every five years to determine if a species should be removed from the list or its status changed. Critical habitat includes areas essential for conservation, even outside the species' current geographic range. The Secretary must designate critical habitat when a species is listed, unless it would harm the species to do so. The Secretary may choose not to designate critical habitat if it would harm the species, or postpone designation for up to one year if information is not determinable. Critical habitat had been designated for 47.5% of listed domestic animal and plant species as of July 25, 2016. Private land is affected by critical habitat designation only if federal action is involved. Federal agencies must avoid \"destruction or adverse modification\" of critical habitat, either through their direct action or activities that they approve or fund. The Secretary must designate critical habitat based on the best scientific data available, considering economic and relevant impacts. Areas may be excluded if benefits outweigh inclusion, based on scientific evidence. The designation of critical habitat must consider economic factors, and some areas may be excluded based on these concerns to prevent species extinction. Adverse modification of critical habitat is a federal agency obligation, and economic factors are not considered in listing a species as endangered or threatened. The ESA's critical habitat designation is often misunderstood as a major restriction on private landowners, but restrictions primarily come from the prohibition on taking listed species. P.L. 108-136 amended the ESA to specify that critical habitat shall not be designated on lands controlled by the Secretary. The ESA's critical habitat designation was amended by P.L. 108-136 to exclude lands controlled by the Defense Department with Integrated Natural Resource Management Plans under the Sikes Act. This change aimed to address concerns about interference with military activities and consider national security in critical habitat designations. The ESA's critical habitat designation has been restricted for over 20 years to accommodate military training and readiness activities. FWS prioritized areas not currently occupied by species for critical habitat designation, emphasizing their importance as connecting corridors or for reintroducing new populations. In 1999, FWS announced that critical habitat designation was a low priority due to budget constraints and an inability to meet all ESA requirements. The agency claimed budget constraints prevented full compliance with ESA demands, despite not requesting increased funds for listing. Funding restrictions on critical habitat designation have remained, leading to frequent lawsuits against FWS for failure to designate critical habitat. FWS believes critical habitat offers limited protection beyond listing. The designation of critical habitat under the ESA may provide additional protection for listed species in federal actions, but the expense and limited conservation benefit make it a poor use of budgetary resources. Federal agencies must consider the impact on critical habitat when taking actions that could harm listed species. The designation of critical habitat under the ESA may not provide additional protection from federal actions as the jeopardy consideration would already offer necessary protection for species. The FWS previously disagreed that extra protection is provided through critical habitat designation. The definition of \"destroy or adversely modify\" critical habitat under the ESA was changed in February 2016 after federal courts found it focused too much on species survival rather than recovery. This change led to guidance from the Services to discontinue the use of the 1986 definition. The definition of \"conservation\" in evaluating actions' effects on critical habitat now emphasizes recovery under the ESA. Destruction or adverse modification means altering critical habitat in a way that diminishes its value for species conservation. This includes changes to essential physical or biological features that are necessary for species conservation. Recovery plans must be developed by the appropriate Secretary. The appropriate Secretary must develop recovery plans for the conservation and survival of listed species, including birds and mammals. However, a 1988 ESA amendment prohibits favoring specific taxonomic groups in these plans. As of August 24, 2016, there were recovery plans for 1,156 U.S. species, and land acquisition may be used to conserve endangered and threatened species. Funding from the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) can be appropriated for this purpose. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) can provide funding for land acquisition to conserve endangered species. The appropriate Secretary must cooperate with states to conserve protected species and may enter into cooperative agreements to assist states in their endangered species programs. States may receive federal funds with a minimum 25% matching amount under these agreements. The 1988 ESA amendments created a fund for state grants, including land acquisition and planning assistance, with a minimum 25% matching amount required from states. Congress appropriated $53.5 million for cooperative activities with states and territories in FY2016. Federal action agencies must complete a biological assessment if actions may adversely affect a listed species. Federal agencies must complete a biological assessment (BA) to determine if formal consultation is needed based on the best available scientific data. This consultation, known as a Section 7 consultation, ensures that agency actions do not harm endangered species or critical habitats. Actions include any activity authorized, funded, or carried out by a federal agency. The Section 7 consultation is initiated by the action agency or at the request of FWS Regional Director or NMFS's Assistant Administrator for Fisheries. If a federal action is mandated by law, a consultation is not needed. The Secretary issues a BiOp if the action won't harm species or critical habitat, along with terms for incidental take. If the action poses a risk to species or habitat, a different course of action is taken. The Endangered Species Act requires the Secretary to suggest alternatives to avoid harm to listed species if the proposed action jeopardizes them. The BiOp must be based on the best available scientific and commercial data, as required by implementing regulations. The majority of consultations result in a BiOp with a summary of the information used. The Endangered Species Act mandates the Secretary to propose alternatives to prevent harm to listed species if the proposed action poses a threat. Consultations typically result in \"no jeopardy\" opinions or suggest reasonable alternatives for the project to proceed. The consultation process should be completed within 90 days for federal actions, but it may take longer with mutual agreement. Formal consultations can often extend for a year or more. Formal consultation for proposed actions under the Endangered Species Act may take a year or more. If no feasible alternatives exist, the agency must forego the action, risk penalties, or seek an exemption. Exemptions are only available for specific actions, not species. The Endangered Species Act allows for exemptions for specific actions, decided by a high-level Endangered Species Committee, known as the \"God Squad,\" consisting of federal officials and state representatives. The committee requires at least five votes to pass an exemption, with detailed rules and deadlines for the application process. The Endangered Species Act allows exemptions for specific actions, decided by the \"God Squad,\" with stringent rules and deadlines. The ESC must grant an exemption if deemed necessary for national security. The President may also determine exemptions for projects in disaster areas. The federal agency and nonfederal exemption applicant must conduct consultation processes under Section 7 of the ESA in good faith. They must also make efforts to consider modifications or alternatives that would not harm endangered species or critical habitats. Additionally, biological assessments must be conducted, and irreversible commitments should be avoided. The agency must avoid irreversible commitments of resources to ensure meaningful consideration of alternatives for an exemption. The ESC will grant an exemption if no reasonable alternatives exist. Additional requirements are outlined in relevant regulations. The ESC determines that there are no reasonable alternatives to the agency action, the benefits outweigh alternative courses of action, the action is of regional or national significance, and no irreversible commitments of resources were made. Special provisions apply in specific instances for granting exemptions under the ESA. The ESA has special provisions for granting exemptions in specific instances such as international treaty obligations, national security, and presidentially declared disasters. The exemption process is complex and could take 280 days. Any potential exemption applicant must fund any required actions. Any potential exemption applicant faces challenges such as funding required mitigation measures for the life of the action. The burden of conservation and recovery may fall heavily elsewhere, posing difficulties for governors balancing state interests. An exemption from the ESA for the action may not be feasible if conservation of a listed species is just one of various statutory obligations. An exemption from the ESA for an action may not be sufficient if other statutory obligations under federal or state laws are still required. Parties in a dispute may be hesitant to support the extinction of a species publicly. The consultation process allows federal agencies to modify actions to avoid harming species or their habitats while still moving forward. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) prompts agencies to consider consequences early to avoid conflict and the need for exemptions. Private parties can get permits for incidental take of species without federal nexus. Applicants must submit a habitat conservation plan showing impact, mitigation steps, funding, and alternatives. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) requires agencies to consider consequences early to avoid conflict and the need for exemptions. Private parties can obtain permits for incidental take of species without federal nexus by submitting a habitat conservation plan showing impact, mitigation steps, funding, and alternatives. The act also includes provisions for exemptions for raptors, regulation of subsistence activities by Alaskan Natives, and rules for controlling trade in parts or products of endangered species. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) prohibits various acts such as taking endangered species, possessing or selling unlawfully taken species, and violating regulations by FWS or NMFS. Threatened species receive similar protections as endangered species. Committing or soliciting prohibited acts is a violation of the ESA. Violating the ESA by committing prohibited acts is a broad prohibition that applies to anyone under US jurisdiction. Exceptions exist under Sections 9 and 10, such as incidental take permits. Section 11 allows for no civil penalties if a violation was done in good faith to protect oneself or others from harm by endangered species. Civil penalties may apply to those who violate the ESA, its regulations, or permits. Violators of the ESA or its regulations may face civil penalties, with higher fines for knowing violators. Criminal violations may also apply. The ESA allows for enforcement through lawsuits in federal court to stop violations or compel the Secretary to act on listing-related duties. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) allows for enforcement through lawsuits in federal court to compel the Secretary to act on listing-related duties. A person must provide written notice of intent to sue at least 60 days prior to bringing the action. The court may award litigation costs and attorneys' fees when appropriate. Citizen suit provisions have driven efforts to conserve species, with studies showing citizen groups pushing for listings of species at greater risk than proposed by FWS. Citizen proposals for species listings may be at greater risk than those proposed by FWS. ESA citizen suits challenging listing delays are common, leading to numerous lawsuits against FWS and NMFS. The ESA also implements CITES and the Western Hemisphere Convention for the United States. CITES, like the ESA, categorizes species based on extinction risk but uses three categories. Unlike the ESA, CITES focuses solely on trade and not habitat loss. Violations of CITES are violations of U.S. law if committed within the U.S. The Western Hemisphere Convention commits the U.S. to nature reserves, controlling wildlife trade, and protecting wildlife. The ESA designates the Secretary of the Interior as the Endangered Species Scientific Authority (ESSA) specified under CITES, ensuring that international trade of organisms does not harm the species. The Secretary enforces these determinations through FWS. The Secretary of the Interior, as the Endangered Species Scientific Authority (ESSA) under CITES, enforces export determinations based on biological information. The Management Authority ensures legal export and import of specimens, as well as proper shipping conditions. The ESA prohibits importing into the US. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) prohibits the import and export of listed species in the United States, with exceptions for scientific purposes or species survival. Importers and exporters of fish or wildlife must obtain permission, keep records, and use designated ports for trade enforcement. The Endangered Species Act prohibits import and export of listed species in the US, with exceptions for scientific purposes. An Endangered Species Committee granted an exemption for the Grayrocks Dam and Reservoir, which jeopardized the habitat of whooping cranes on the Platte River. The Endangered Species Committee granted an exemption for Grayrocks Dam and Reservoir on January 23, 1979, with specified mitigation measures for whooping crane habitat. Tellico Dam on the Little Tennessee River faced opposition and litigation due to the endangered snail darter. Litigation was filed to stop the construction of the Tellico Dam due to the endangered snail darter, leading to the landmark Supreme Court case TVA v. Hill. Congress passed P.L. 95-632, establishing an Endangered Species Committee (ESC) process. Despite the ESC denying an exemption for the dam, Congress passed P.L. 96-69 directing the completion of the dam. In 1992, the ESC granted exemptions for 13 Oregon timber sales in the habitat of the threatened northern spotted owl. However, controversy led to the sales being withdrawn during the Clinton Administration. In three instances, applications for exemptions were made but no ESC decisions were reached: Pittston Company applied for an exemption to build a refinery in Eastport, ME, due to concerns for bald eagles and whales; Consolidated Grain and Barge Company sought to build a docking area in Mound City, IL, for barges, facing issues with an endangered mussel habitat. The Suwanee River Authority's consulting engineer applied for an exemption to dredge Alligator Pass in Suwanee Sound, Florida, a habitat for endangered manatees. The project was denied a permit by the Army Corps of Engineers, and the engineer's application was later withdrawn in 1986. Despite attempts to continue the application, the withdrawal remained effective."
