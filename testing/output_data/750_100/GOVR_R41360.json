    "content": "One of the most controversial issues in U.S. foreign assistance is restrictions on funding for abortion and family planning activities abroad. The debate revolves around whether recipients of U.S. aid perform abortions or coercive sterilization with U.S. funds, and if funding should be withheld from them. Congress has debated the impact of withholding funds on population growth and reproductive health services in developing countries. Since the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling, Congress has debated abortion policy and funding restrictions. Opponents have introduced legislation to prohibit abortion and restrict federal funding for the procedure. Discussions on these issues have been ongoing in nearly every Congress session. After the Roe decision, debates in Congress expanded to include restrictions on international abortion funding, leading to the enactment of policies like the \"Mexico City policy\" by President Reagan in 1984. The Mexico City policy requires NGOs receiving USAID family planning assistance to certify they won't promote abortion. It was rescinded by President Obama in 2009 and reinstated by President Trump in 2017. Congress continues to debate abortion and family planning restrictions abroad. Some Members seek to address issues related to abortion and family planning activities in State-Foreign Operations legislation. Legislation has been introduced to make the Mexico City policy permanent law. Congressional interest in federal funding for abortion and family planning activities remains controversial. This report examines legislative and executive branch policies on U.S. funding restrictions for abortion and voluntary family planning. Legislation introduces restrictions on U.S. funding for abortion and family planning abroad, affecting various types of foreign aid. Some provisions are named after lawmakers, like the \"Helms amendment,\" while others address specific issues like \"involuntary sterilization.\" The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (FAA) is a key legislation that authorizes different types of foreign aid, including development assistance, military and security assistance, and debt reduction for developing countries with tropical forests. Congress has routinely amended the FAA since 1961. Since 1985, Congress has not comprehensively reauthorized most programs in the Foreign Assistance Act (FAA). Authorization bills have often stalled due to debates on controversial issues, tight legislative schedules, or foreign policy disputes. As a result, Congress annually considers appropriations measures to set spending levels for foreign assistance accounts, which have become increasingly significant in recent years. In recent years, Congress has focused on measures influencing U.S. foreign aid disbursement, including family planning and abortion-related restrictions. The links among these requirements are complex, with some amendments like the Helms and Biden provisions being added to other legislation for emphasis or broader application. The Leahy and Livingston amendments clarify and amend existing restrictions on U.S. foreign aid. Enacted legislative restrictions on funding abortion and voluntary family planning programs abroad are listed chronologically. The Helms amendment prohibits the use of U.S. foreign assistance funds for abortions or to motivate. The Helms amendment, introduced in 1973, prohibits the use of U.S. foreign assistance funds for abortions or to coerce individuals to practice abortions. It was adopted due to concerns about federal funds being used for abortions overseas. The amendment applies to all foreign assistance activities authorized by the FAA. The Helms amendment, introduced in 1973, prohibits the use of U.S. foreign assistance funds for abortions or to coerce individuals to practice abortions. It applies to all foreign assistance activities authorized by the FAA and is included in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act. In Title III, Bilateral Economic Assistance, U.S. foreign assistance funds cannot be used for involuntary sterilizations or coercion, as specified in the FAA amendment of 1978. This provision is also included in annual foreign operations appropriations, most recently in Section 7018. Since FY1979, annual foreign operations appropriations have included an abortion restriction on Peace Corps funding to prevent the use of funds for abortions for volunteers. This restriction, under the heading \"Peace Corps,\" states that \"none of the funds appropriated under this heading shall be used to pay for abortions.\" The FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act includes exceptions to the prohibition on funding abortions in cases of rape, incest, or endangerment to the mother's life. Peace Corps volunteers can receive funding for medical evacuation for abortions in locations where it is legally permissible. Congress passed the Biden amendment to the FAA, prohibiting the use of funds for biomedical research related to abortion or involuntary sterilization. This provision has been included in foreign operations appropriations acts, most recently in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act. The Siljander amendment, introduced in 1981, prohibits the use of U.S. funds for lobbying for or against abortion in foreign assistance activities authorized by the FAA. This provision has been included in annual foreign operations appropriations acts. The Siljander amendment, introduced in 1981, prohibits the use of U.S. funds for lobbying for or against abortion in foreign assistance activities. The FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act states that funds under this Act cannot be used for abortion lobbying. In 1985, Congress enacted a provision specifying that U.S. funding for family planning projects must offer a range of services. The amendment introduced by Senator Dennis DeConcini in 1985 requires U.S. funding for overseas family planning projects to offer a broad range of family planning methods and services to reduce reliance on abortion in developing nations. This provision has been included in annual foreign operations appropriations legislation since 1985, most recently in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act. The FY1986 Foreign Assistance and Related Programs Appropriations Act includes a provision that restricts funds under part I of the FAA if the President certifies that the funds violate certain amendments related to family planning assistance. The FY1986 Foreign Assistance and Related Programs Appropriations Act includes a provision that restricts funds under part I of the FAA if the President certifies that the funds violate certain amendments related to family planning assistance. The Kemp-Kasten amendment, introduced in 1985, prohibits the use of funds for any country or organization if it would violate provisions related to abortions or involuntary sterilizations. This provision is now incorporated into Section 7018 of the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act. The FY1985 Supplemental Appropriations Act includes the Kemp-Kasten amendment, which prohibits funds from supporting organizations involved in coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization programs. This provision was added due to concerns about the UNFPA's activities in China. The Kemp-Kasten amendment prohibits funding for organizations involved in coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization programs. It has been included in annual foreign operations appropriations legislation since FY1985. The provision applies to any organization supporting or participating in coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization, with a determination made only regarding UNFPA. The FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act includes a deadline for determinations and criteria for evidence. In 16 of the past 34 years, the United States has not contributed to UNFPA. The United States has not contributed to UNFPA in 16 of the past 34 years due to concerns about its program in China violating the Kemp-Kasten amendment. The Obama Administration supported funding for UNFPA, emphasizing its commitment to international family planning and women's health. Currently, the Trump Administration has withheld funding from UNFPA citing concerns about its involvement in certain activities. The Trump Administration determined that UNFPA supports coercive abortion and sterilization in China. Congress has imposed conditions on U.S. funding for UNFPA, with funds being redirected to global health programs if not allocated to UNFPA. The Trump Administration determined that UNFPA supports coercive abortion and sterilization in China. Congress imposed conditions on U.S. funding for UNFPA, requiring funds to be kept separate, not used for a country program in China, and not used for abortions. The Secretary of State must report on UNFPA's budget for China programs. In 1986, Representative Bob Livingston introduced an amendment prohibiting discrimination based on religious beliefs in awarding grants for natural family planning under the Foreign Assistance Act. The Livingston amendment prohibits discrimination based on religious beliefs in awarding family planning grants under the Foreign Assistance Act, ensuring that organizations supporting natural family planning methods are not excluded from funding. The DeConcini amendment requires organizations supporting natural family planning methods to comply with it when receiving family planning grants. The provision is included in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act and applies to family planning assistance from any account under that act. The Leahy amendment clarifies language in the Helms amendment regarding the use of funds for abortions. The Leahy provision clarifies that funds cannot be used for abortions as a method of family planning or to coerce anyone. It addresses concerns about violating the Helms amendment by providing information on legal pregnancy options. The amendment allows for the provision of information and counseling on all pregnancy options, without prohibiting assistance. It has been included in various foreign operations appropriations acts since 1998. The Tiahrt amendment in the Financing and Related Programs Appropriations Act requires voluntary family planning projects to comply with specific requirements, including not implementing quotas or numerical targets for births or family planning acceptors. The Tiahrt amendment in the Financing and Related Programs Appropriations Act prohibits the payment of incentives for family planning acceptors or program personnel based on numerical targets. The project must not deny any rights or benefits to individuals participating in family planning programs. The project must provide family planning acceptors with information on health benefits and risks of chosen methods, ensure experimental contraceptives are only provided in scientific studies, and not incentivize based on numerical targets. The Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development must report violations of family planning requirements to Congress, introduced amid concerns of governments offering incentives for sterilization quotas. The Tiahrt amendment was implemented to prevent financial incentives for sterilization quotas in Peru, where poor women were forcibly sterilized without proper information. USAID issued guidance on implementing the amendment in 1999 to ensure voluntary family planning projects followed the requirements. Despite this, violations have been reported in Peru, Guatemala, and other countries. The Tiahrt amendment was enacted to prevent sterilization quotas in Peru. USAID reported violations in Peru, Guatemala, and the Philippines. An audit in 2007 found no further violations. The amendment was included in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act. It applies to family planning assistance funded through all accounts under that act. The Mexico City policy and USAID Policy Determination 3 address abortion and voluntary family planning. The Mexico City policy restricts U.S. family planning assistance to foreign NGOs involved in abortion activities, while PD-3 focuses on voluntary sterilization. These policies are typically implemented and reversed by the executive branch, with actions often divided along party lines. The Mexico City policy, first issued by President Reagan in 1984, restricts U.S. family planning assistance to foreign NGOs involved in abortion activities. Recently expanded by the Trump Administration, it remains a controversial issue with Republicans supporting and Democrats opposing it. The Mexico City policy, implemented by President Reagan in 1984, restricts the use of U.S. family planning assistance for abortion or involuntary sterilizations. Foreign NGOs receiving USAID grants could use other funds for abortion-related activities, but had to maintain separate accounts to show compliance with U.S. restrictions. The Mexico City policy, implemented by President Reagan in 1984, restricted the use of U.S. family planning assistance for abortion or involuntary sterilizations. President George H. W. Bush maintained the policy, President Clinton rescinded it in 1993, and President George W. Bush reinstated and expanded it in 2001 and 2003. Exceptions were made for cases of rape, incest, life-threatening conditions, and postabortion care. President Obama revoked President Bush's policy in January 2009, citing overly broad conditions on grants and assistance awards that hindered family planning programs. In January 2017, President Trump reinstated the Mexico City policy, expanding it to include global health assistance. President Trump expanded the Mexico City policy to include global health assistance, directing the Secretary of State to ensure that U.S. taxpayer dollars do not fund organizations supporting coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. The policy, named \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance,\" was approved in May 2017. The \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance\" policy, approved by President Trump in May 2017, applies to approximately $8.8 billion in funding for international health programs. This funding includes initiatives for HIV/AIDS, maternal and child health, malaria, global health security, and family planning. The policy excludes assistance to national or local governments, public international organizations, and humanitarian activities. The \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance\" policy, approved by President Trump in May 2017, applies to approximately $8.8 billion in funding for international health programs, including HIV/AIDS, maternal and child health, malaria, global health security, and family planning. The policy includes exemptions for rape, incest, and life-threatening conditions for the mother, as well as postabortion care. In May 2018, the Trump Administration published a six-month review on the implementation of the policy, acknowledging it was too early to assess all benefits and challenges. The PLGHA policy for global health assistance identified challenges and action items to improve understanding and compliance. Some recipients refused to agree to the terms, and clarification on certain terms was sought by implementing organizations. A further review of implementation is planned by December 15, 2018. Policy Determination 3 on voluntary sterilization was issued by USAID. Policy Determination 3 (PD-3) on voluntary sterilization (VS) was issued by USAID in September 1982 to ensure that funded services protect individuals' needs and rights. PD-3 outlines requirements for USAID voluntary sterilization services, including informed consent. USAID funds ensure that voluntary sterilization procedures are only done with informed consent. Access to various family planning methods should be available at the same location. No financial incentives are given for sterilization over other methods. PD-3 provides guidance on payments to voluntary sterilization service acceptors, providers, and referral agents. Reasonable payments for legitimate extra expenses are allowed, based on country- and program-specific circumstances. Acceptors may receive recompense for expenses like transportation, food, medicines, and lost wages. Providers may receive per-case payment and compensation for anesthesia, personal costs, and transportation. PD-3 guidelines allow for reasonable payments to voluntary sterilization service acceptors, providers, and referral agents. Acceptors may receive compensation for expenses like transportation, food, medicines, and lost wages. Providers may receive per-case payment for anesthesia, personal costs, and transportation. VS service referral agents may also receive per-case payment for extra expenses incurred in informing or referring clients."
