Tangible personal property is deemed delivered to the purchaser's location upon shipment by mail or common carrier. The destination of real property or rents/leaseholds on real property is the state where the property is located. For other property, the destination is the purchaser's residence. Services are allocated based on where they are used, consumed, or enjoyed, with telecommunications services having specific destination rules. Telecommunications services are allocated based on the purchaser's residence, including telephone, telegraph, cable television, satellite, and computer services. Domestic transportation services are allocated based on the final destination within the United States. Financial intermediation services are allocated based on the purchaser's residence. A State Tax Administrator has jurisdiction over gross payments with a destination within the state. International transportation services have 50 percent attributed to the United States destination or origin.

The transition amount for the ten calendar years starting in 1999 is calculated as the unrecovered basis amount as of December 31, 1998 divided by ten. The unrecovered basis amount includes remaining income tax basis related to prior law section 167 property and inventory held at the end of 1998. The transition amount for the ten calendar years starting in 1999 is calculated as the unrecovered basis amount as of December 31, 1998 divided by ten, including any amounts capitalized in accordance with prior law section 263A.

SEC. 9. COMPENSATING PAYMENTS TO CERTAIN PERSONS ON FIXED INCOME. Compensating Payment: Eligible persons receive a compensating payment if they comply with the application requirements. The payment is calculated based on the qualified fixed income payment amount and the excess inflation rate. An eligible person is someone who receives Social Security benefits and qualified fixed income payments. A qualified fixed income payment is a payment received by a beneficiary under a defined benefit plan or by an annuitant pursuant to an annuity contract with a bona fide insurance company. Payments that vary with investment performance are not considered qualified fixed income payments. The qualified fixed income payment amount is \\1/12\\ of payments entitled to an eligible person during the calendar year, excluding payments from annuity contracts entered into after June 30, 1999, and defined benefit plans for beneficiaries with less than 5 years of participation. An eligible person is entitled to receive a qualified fixed income payment amount not exceeding $5,000 in the calendar year following the year for which the compensating payment is calculated. The excess inflation rate is defined as the difference between the consumer price index (all urban) during an 18-month period ending December 31, 2000, and the projected increase in the consumer price index reported in the Budget of the United States for Fiscal Year 1999. The baseline assumption for compensating payments in 1999 is half of the assumed increase for the entire year. Eligible individuals must apply for compensating payments as prescribed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Compensating payments will be received with Social Security benefits, funded by the general fund. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may require insurers and defined benefit plan sponsors to issue a statement to annuitants or plan participants for compensating payments, funded by the general fund.
