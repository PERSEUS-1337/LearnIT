    "content": "The Act titled \"Diabetic Retinopathy Prevention Act of 2003\" is cited as the short title. The findings section follows. The Congress finds that Type 2 diabetes affects 17,000,000 Americans, with over 1,000,000 new cases diagnosed each year, costing the Nation an estimated $138,000,000,000 annually. Diabetic retinopathy, the most common complication of diabetes, leads to visual acuity degradation and eventual blindness, being the top cause of blindness in individuals aged 20 to 74, with up to 24,000 diabetics becoming legally blind each year. Most diabetes patients will develop diabetic retinopathy. The risk of diabetic retinopathy increases with the duration of diabetes, especially as onset of type 2 diabetes occurs at younger ages. Early detection and treatment can reduce vision loss by 90%, and remote assessment has the potential to reach diabetic patients in underserved areas. Medicare coverage is expanded to include remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy, aiming to reach underserved diabetic patients. The term 'remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy' refers to a diagnostic examination of the retina for early detection of diabetic retinopathy, provided annually to individuals with diabetes, meeting technical standards set by the Secretary, and conducted via a telecommunications system by a physician or practitioner. The text chunk discusses the provision of remote healthcare services to eligible patients by qualified healthcare providers, regardless of their physical location. Payment for these services is allowed even if there are limitations on store and forward technology. The amendments allow for remote assessments of diabetic retinopathy using store-and-forward technologies for asynchronous transmission of health care information. Interim payment is permitted until the final regulation is published. The Social Security Act requires the Secretary to provide payment for retinopathy assessments and assign temporary HCPCS codes. A study on reimbursement for remote assessments of diabetic retinopathy costs will be conducted by the Secretary of Health and Human Services within a year of the Act's enactment. The Secretary will conduct a study on the costs of remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy, including per-patient and start-up/administrative costs. A report with recommendations on reimbursement adequacy under Medicare and the need for repeating the study will be submitted to Congress within 2 years. The amendments will apply to assessments performed 30 days after the Act's enactment. Medicaid will cover remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy. Medicaid will cover remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy, with amendments to the Social Security Act for effective implementation. The State plan must meet additional requirements imposed by amendments to the Social Security Act. Failure to meet these requirements before the first day of the first calendar quarter after the State legislature's session will not deem the plan non-compliant with the Act. Each year of a 2-year legislative session is considered a separate regular session of the State legislature. SEC. 5. MOBILE DIABETIC RETINOPATHY SCREENING PILOT PROGRAM. Amends Title III of the Public Health Service Act to establish a pilot program for mobile diabetic retinopathy screening. The Secretary will establish a grant program called the \"Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program\" to fund 5 eligible entities for mobile diabetic retinopathy screening programs. Grants can only be used for this purpose. The Secretary may not grant more than $1,000,000 per year. A notice for grant applications must be published within 90 days of funds availability. Eligible entities must submit applications to seek grants. Eligible entities must submit grant applications to the Secretary, with priority given to those with experience in evaluating diabetic retinopathy using telecommunications equipment and proposing to serve rural, impoverished, minority, and remote populations. The Secretary must notify Congress at least 3 days before granting funds for the Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program. An advisory committee will evaluate the program within 3 years of the first grant. The advisory committee will evaluate the effectiveness of the Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program in increasing early detection of diabetic retinopathy and decreasing its prevalence and severity. They will also assess if the program can be a model for similar screening programs for diabetes complications. The advisory committee will evaluate the Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program's effectiveness in detecting diabetic retinopathy early and reducing its prevalence and severity. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress within 42 months of the first grant, detailing the advisory committee's evaluation results. Definitions include \"advisory committee\" as the committee convened under subsection (b) and \"eligible entity\" as entities eligible for the program. The term 'eligible entity' refers to hospitals, States, institutions of higher education, local governments, tribal governments, nonprofit health organizations, or community health centers receiving assistance under section 330. The term 'mobile diabetic retinopathy screening program' includes programs offering remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy. The Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program offers remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy for patients primarily in rural, underserved, and remote areas. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the program. Authorized appropriations of $5,000,000 for fiscal years 2005 through 2009 for the Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program, with additional funding for evaluation and reporting purposes."
