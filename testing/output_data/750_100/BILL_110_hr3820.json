Congress finds that commercial motor vehicle crashes are a major concern in the United States, especially with the increasing number of trucks and their role in transporting hazardous materials. A 2004 report shows that large truck crashes are 2.6 times more likely to result in fatalities compared to passenger cars. These crashes account for a significant portion of all crash fatalities. Large truck-related crashes in the United States resulted in 5,212 deaths and 114,000 injuries in 2005, with a total of 25,533 fatalities from 2001 to 2005. These crashes also have a significant economic impact, costing society $230.6 billion annually. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's 2006 report found that crashes involving trucks over 10,000 pounds cost $91,112 each, with fatal crashes costing $3,604,518 on average. Investments in advanced safety systems by vehicle suppliers and manufacturers aim to address and reduce commercial vehicle crash scenarios. The Department of Transportation aims to reduce traffic fatalities by implementing advanced safety technologies on commercial motor vehicles to mitigate the societal cost of crashes. Congress aims to increase the deployment of advanced vehicle safety technologies on commercial motor vehicles in the domestic market by providing tax incentives to make these systems more affordable for businesses.
