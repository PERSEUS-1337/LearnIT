    "content": "A Retrospective of House Rules Changes Since the 110th Congress highlights the majority party's role in organizing the House, electing the Speaker, and making rules changes at the start of each new Congress. While the House largely maintains previous rules, changes are also adopted to reflect the majority's prerogatives. This process differs from the Senate's approach to rules. The House adopts rules changes at the start of each Congress, unlike the Senate. A Retrospective of House Rules Changes from the 104th to the 109th Congress analyzed extensive rules changes when Republicans took control from Democrats after 40 years. Changes were grouped into five areas: committees, chamber and floor, budget legislation, administration, and ethics standards. The report covers changes in House rules from the 104th to the 109th Congress, including committees, chamber and floor, budget legislation, administration, and ethics standards. It also discusses the Democratic critique of Republican management during these Congresses. The subsequent report focuses on the Democratic majority in the 110th and 111th Congresses and the Republican majority in the 112th to 115th Congresses. The report examines changes in House rules from the 104th to the 109th Congress, including committees, chamber and floor procedures, budget legislation, administration, and ethics standards. It also discusses the Republican critique of Democratic management during the 110th and 111th Congresses, as well as Democratic amendments to Republican rules packages in the 112th to 115th Congresses. The changes made in rules resolutions are grouped into five broad subject areas and further subdivided by subject or Congress. The report analyzes changes in House rules from the 104th to the 109th Congress, including committees, procedures, budget legislation, administration, and ethics standards. It also examines critiques by Democrats and Republicans of each other's management during different Congresses and how they influenced House rules changes. The report analyzes changes in House rules from the 104th to the 109th Congress, including committees, procedures, budget legislation, administration, and ethics standards. The second part of the report details changes made in rules resolutions from the 110th to the 115th Congresses, including changes affecting committees, the chamber and floor, and budgetary legislation. The report catalogs and briefly explains changes to House rules affecting committees, the House floor, budget legislation, administration, and ethics standards from the 110th to the 115th Congresses. It supplements the official House Rules and Manual. The House Rules and Manual, printed in each Congress, contains provisions of House rules along with the parliamentarian's notes on changes and decisions. Rules are arranged by number, and citations in the report refer to clause changes. The report catalogs changes made at the convening of a new House, including rules changes and separate orders in biennial resolutions and the Speaker's policies. Changes to rules and procedures are also made through rules resolutions. Changes to rules and procedures in the legislative branch are made through orders, freestanding legislation, bills, resolutions, and report language. These changes can be temporary or permanent and may include organizational and procedural adjustments. Fast-track House procedures are sometimes included in legislation addressing policy matters. Additionally, rules and decisions by the Democratic Caucus and Republican Conference also play a role in shaping procedures. Between the 110th and 115th Congresses, changes to House rules were influenced by Democratic Caucus and Republican Conference decisions, impacting procedures like suspension of rules and committee assignments. Special rules and unanimous consent agreements were also used to adapt House rules for specific measures or proceedings. During the Republican majority in the House from the 104th Congress (1995-1997) through the 109th Congress (2005-2007), Democrats criticized the management based on ethics and other concerns.

In the 104th Congress, Democrats criticized Republican management based on ethics and other concerns. Democrats made incremental rules changes in the 110th and 111th Congresses. Key issues included ethics, legislative management, and rules changes. The House rules package debated the time limit for the Ethics Committee to review ethics violations by Speaker Newt Gingrich. Republicans set a deadline, while Democrats wanted no time limit. In the 106th Congress, Democrats proposed new ethics clauses to prevent members from influencing hiring based on political affiliation and to stop leaders from threatening lobbying firms. In the 108th Congress, changes were made to ethics rules regarding lobbying firms and political contributions.

The rules package for the 109th Congress made changes to ethics rules, including allowing limited income from medical practice by Members who were doctors or dentists, permitting gifts of perishable food to House offices, and exempting charity travel from the gift rule under certain conditions. Republicans defended the changes as ensuring a right to counsel and presuming innocence for Members, while Democrats criticized them as weakening ethical standards. Democrats criticized the changes to ethics rules in the 109th Congress, arguing that they would weaken ethical standards and reduce the ethics committee's effectiveness.

Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi announced \"New House Principles\" and \"New Direction for America\" with proposals for House management. Regular consultations among elected leaders of both parties are necessary to discuss House scheduling, administration, and operations. The House should have a predictable, professional schedule to ensure timely legislative processes. Regular meetings between committee Chairs, Ranking Members, and staff are essential. The Minority should have control over one-third of committee budgets and office space. Democratic Members in the 109th Congress emphasized the need for \"regular order\" and \"transparency\" in legislation consideration. In proposals for legislative management, there were suggestions for bills to undergo full hearings, open markups, and 24-hour review before subcommittee consideration. The process should allow for open, fair debate with a full amendment process and Minority rights. The proposed legislative management process includes a full amendment process and Minority rights, with members having at least 24 hours to review bill text before floor consideration. Floor votes should be completed within 15 minutes, and House-Senate conference committees should hold regular meetings. The conference committee Members should hold regular meetings to inform all conferees of activities and allow input. The Suspension Calendar should only include non-controversial legislation, with minority-authored bills scheduled based on party ratio.

The Speaker's policy for the 115th Congress outlined the process for levying and collecting fines. The policy for levying and collecting fines in the 115th Congress included provisions for observing violations firsthand or through later discovery. The sergeant-at-arms would notify Members of violations on the floor and follow up with a letter detailing the offense. For violations discovered later, a letter would be sent to the offending Member.

This change recognized the practice of seeking information from the Budget Committee to determine if a legislative provision violated a budget enforcement rule. Additionally, a point of order was established against increasing direct spending for reported bills, joint resolutions, amendments, and conference reports.

H.Res. 5 introduced a new clause 11 to Rule XXI, requiring unreported measures to be available for three days before floor consideration. It also assigned the House Administration Committee the task of creating standards for making House and committee documents publicly available. The committee designated a location for items to be available to Members as required by House rules, meeting the \"availability\" requirement previously only met by printed items. An interim order stated that posting on the Committee on Rules website would fulfill the publicly available requirement for the House floor, and each committee's majority website would serve that purpose for a committee.

In previous Congresses, H.Res. 5 and H.Res. 6 addressed issues related to unfunded mandates and recorded votes. A sentence was added to Rule XX stating that a record vote by electronic device cannot be held open to reverse the outcome. Language about closing electronic votes quickly was removed, and new language was added to give Members a reasonable amount of time to vote accurately. Members in the House well would not be prevented from voting. In response to recommendations from the Select Committee to Investigate Voting Irregularities, the rules provision on holding votes open was repealed in the 111th Congress.

It also removed the ability to strike unfunded mandates from bills in the Committee of the Whole. The 112th Congress adopted separate orders related to budgetary legislation, instructing the Committee on the Budget not to include bills providing new budget authority designated as emergency provisions in budget calculations.

Amendments to a spending reduction account in a general appropriation bill were limited to transferring funds to the account, with no net increase in budget authority allowed. The point of order against changes in existing law in appropriations bills did not apply to a spending reduction account. The rules resolution in the 114th Congress added jurisdiction over bills related to new direct loan obligations and loan guarantee commitments to the Appropriations Committee. This change referenced Section 504(b) of the Congressional Budget Act. The Congressional Budget Act allows new direct loan obligations and loan guarantees to be incurred only with new budget authority or other authority from an appropriations act. House rules were amended to remove a requirement for a three-day waiting period before considering a general appropriation bill. H.Res. 5 replaced a rule for a macroeconomic impact analysis with a new provision for cost estimates in revenue legislation. The Congressional Budget Act requires cost estimates for major legislation to include budgetary effects of changes in macroeconomic variables. Major legislation is defined as bills with significant budgetary impacts on revenues, outlays, and deficits. The new rule provision established criteria for revenue legislation estimates by the Joint Taxation Committee. It also included a point of order against any bill that would reduce the actuarial balance. The new rule provision established criteria for revenue legislation estimates by the Joint Taxation Committee and included a point of order against any bill that would reduce the actuarial balance of the Social Security OASDI trust fund by at least 0.01% of the present value. Amendments to appropriations bills were restricted in a similar manner as in the 113th Congress. The Appropriations Committee chair had the authority to add a spending reduction account to a bill, which only included the amount by which the bill's budget authority exceeded the proposed amount. En bloc amendments transferring appropriations to the account were allowed, even for portions of the bill not yet read for amendment. Amendments transferring funds to a spending reduction account in a general appropriation bill were limited to the House or Committee of the Whole.

Amendments proposing a net increase in budget authority were not in order, unless offset by equal or greater decreases. A point of order against changes in existing law in appropriations bills did not apply to the spending reduction account. Another order gave effect to the House-passed concurrent resolution on the FY2014 budget in the first session of the 114th Congress. In the 114th Congress, titles III, IV, and VI of H.Con.Res. 25 from the 113th Congress are in effect, with adjustments made by the Budget Committee chair. In the 114th Congress, references to \"this resolution\" in titles IV and VI of H.Con.Res. 25 are considered to be related to the matter inserted by the Budget Committee chair in the Congressional Record of April 29, 2014. The Budget Committee chair may adjust allocations for bills or joint resolutions to maintain the solvency of the Highway Trust Fund without increasing the deficit from 2015-2025. The Budget Committee chair may revise allocations, aggregates, and levels for fiscal years 2015-2025 based on the most recent CBO baseline. H.Res. 5 in the 115th Congress introduced budget process rules changes and orders, converting a separate order from previous Congresses into a rule change. The rules resolution in the 115th Congress introduced changes to the budget process, including amendments to a general appropriation bill and reinstating the Holman rule. The Holman rule allows legislative text in appropriations bills to reduce spending by cutting funds, salaries, or compensation from the U.S. treasury. Amendments must comply with House rules and expire at the end of the first session. Another rule limits advance appropriations to $28,852,000,000 for new budget authority. In the 115th Congress, H.Res. 5 included a separate order prohibiting increasing direct spending on reported bills and joint resolutions, with exemptions for certain programs and activities of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The Congressional Budget Office was directed to estimate if a bill increased direct spending over $5 billion in consecutive 10-year periods. A point of order was established to prevent consideration of legislation exceeding this amount, except for bills repealing or reforming the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The rules resolution established a point of order against legislation reducing the actuarial balance of the Social Security OASDI trust fund by at least 0.01% of the present value of the fund. This point of order did not apply to legislation repealing or reforming the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or to legislation with adjustments made by the Budget Committee chair. The rules resolution established a point of order against legislation reducing the actuarial balance of the Social Security OASDI trust fund by at least 0.01% of the present value of the fund. This point of order does not apply to measures improving the actuarial balance of the combined balance in the OASDI trust fund and the Disability Insurance trust fund. Additionally, a final budgetary separate order in the rules resolution affected a bill, joint resolution, amendment, or conference report related to the conveyance of federal land to a state, local government, or tribal authority, which would not impact new budget authority, revenues, mandatory spending, or outlays. The rules resolutions for the 110th to 115th Congresses outlined administrative changes related to the House administration. Changes were made through the Committee on House Administration, House officers, and legislative branch appropriations bills. The 110th and 111th Congresses were organized by Democrats. The 110th to 115th Congresses saw administrative changes related to House administration. The Democrats organized the 110th and 111th Congresses, while the Republicans organized the following Congresses. The jurisdiction of the Committee on House Administration was expanded in the 111th Congress. The House Administration Committee oversaw audit work in business process improvements, efficiency of House support operations, and risk management assessments. They implemented guidance and standards from the Government Accountability Office. H.Res. 5 in the 112th Congress directed the committee to establish standards for making documents publicly available in electronic form and required committees to provide audio and video coverage of their hearings and meetings for public access.

It also eliminated outdated references to specific media entities and included an order of business to reduce House operation costs. The House made changes in H.Res. 5 in the 113th Congress, directing the inspector general to submit audit reports to key members. Record keeping requirements were also updated for members and staff. Changes in record keeping requirements were made in the 113th Congress, including the execution of non-disclosure oaths by members and staff to access classified information. Oaths executed by Members, Delegates, or the Resident Commissioner would be retained by the clerk, while oaths executed by officers and employees would be retained by the sergeant-at-arms. Additionally, a separate order in H.Res. 5 provided continuing authority for the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group in the 113th Congress.

In the 113th Congress, Members could transfer MRA funds to a CMO for an employee's salary and expenses, with the employee carrying out official duties under an agreement. The House Administration Committee had authority to regulate the use of transferred funds, disallowing them for franked mail, official travel, or leases. The committee also regulated the statutory limit on the number of employees in a Member's office. The House Administration Committee regulated the statutory limit on the number of employees in a Member's office, including shared employees under Member-CMO agreements. Funds for repayment of shared employees were transferred to the CMO's account for salary and expenses, to be used under the same terms as the employing Member's office. The House Administration Committee regulated the number of employees in a Member's office, including shared employees under Member-CMO agreements. Funds were transferred to the CMO's account for salary and expenses, to be used under the same terms as the employing Member's office.

The redrafted Rule VIII clarified procedures for responding to subpoenas without the need for a House vote, while maintaining the right to assert privileges in court. The redrafted Rule VIII clarified the process for notifying the Speaker when receiving a subpoena, requiring a determination of jurisdiction and consistency with House rights. Obsolete provisions were removed. The redrafted Rule VIII eliminated obsolete provisions, such as removing the requirement for the Clerk of the House to provide a court with a copy of the rule and deleting references to \"administrative subpoenas.\" The redrafted Rule VIII removed references to \"administrative subpoenas\" to avoid confusion about their mandatory nature. Additionally, in the 115th Congress, changes were made to designate the electronic document repository for public access. The House rules resolution in the 115th Congress renewed efforts to make legislative documents more accessible in machine-readable formats, following previous orders from the 114th Congress. The report analyzes rules, special orders, and Speaker's announcements at the start of a new Congress, focusing on ethics rules and laws. The rules, special orders, and Speaker's announcements at the convening of a Congress are highlighted, with changes affecting the organization of the Ethics Committee noted. The 110th and 111th Congresses were organized by Democrats, while the 112th, 113th, 114th, and 115th Congresses were organized by Republicans.

Gifts of tickets to events were to be valued at face value to ensure appropriate valuation. Prohibited gifts of privately funded travel from lobbyists or foreign agents, with exemptions for higher education institutions and one-day events.

Members must obtain prior approval from the Standards of Official Conduct Committee for any travel not funded by personal, official, or campaign funds. Expenses must be disclosed within 15 days, and authorizations made available for public inspection. Members are prohibited from using non-governmental airplanes not licensed by the FAA for travel. The provision added a new clause to prohibit Members from using non-governmental airplanes not licensed by the FAA for travel, while allowing commercial charters.

In the 110th Congress, the House Administration Committee was authorized to promulgate regulations regarding lobbyists and foreign agents. The separate order on access to House exercise facilities was extended in the 115th Congress. Changes in decorum rules and Ethics Committee duties were implemented by Democrats and Republicans in control of the House in the 110th and 112th Congresses. In the 110th and 112th Congresses, Democrats and Republicans made changes to ethics rules and legislative procedures in response to critiques of the other party's management of the House. The Jack Abramoff scandal highlighted the influence of lobbyists on Members and congressional staff, leading to reforms in ethics rules and laws. In response to calls for more transparency and time to review legislation, the House made changes to ethics rules and legislative procedures in the 112th Congress. This included posting legislative text in electronic format and implementing a new schedule with five-day work weeks. Most standing rules remained unchanged when Democrats or Republicans were in the majority. Rules in the House do not dictate how to run the House but facilitate the majority's organization. Changes in rules do not guarantee passing legislation or smooth operation with the minority. Each party's majority in the new millennium had to adapt to manage the House effectively. In managing the House in the new millennium, parties had to accommodate diverse perspectives among Members, balance governance with minority voices, increase structured rules, add a third day for legislation consideration, spend fewer days in session, face more committee jurisdiction competition, encounter challenges passing House measures in the Senate, and decrease conferences in favor of resolving differences through amendments. The motion to recommit was used to broadcast a message and offer an alternative, as party leadership increased control over committee agendas and drafting major legislation. There is less political overlap between parties, requiring leaders to build a majority within their own caucus for key votes. Leaders in the House have more influence over legislation due to turnover in membership, allowing them to build majorities within their caucus. This turnover brings new energy and ideas but also favors centralizing efforts of leadership. During the 109th to 115th Congresses, there was high turnover with a significant number of new Members elected. By the first session of the 115th Congress, over half of Representatives had been sworn in during the current decade. Since 2011, half of Representatives were sworn in, leading to an evolving role that prioritizes efficiency in floor proceedings to allow time for committee work, fundraising, and representational duties. Members now engage in multiple social media platforms and must stay responsive to a continuous news cycle, while also maximizing time spent meeting constituents and attending district events. The Washington-district schedule implemented in recent Congresses allows Representatives to engage with constituents, attend district events, and focus on political interests like home-state redistricting. Despite House rules changes, it remains an independent political institution designed by the Framers to balance interests, as highlighted in The Federalist Papers. The role of Congress is not only to make laws but also to evaluate proposals for laws, ensuring they have public support and can generate the necessary majorities. Chamber rules allow all Members to participate in the legislative process, following the system established by the Framers. In the legislative process, rules changes in Congress are likely to be incremental, considering the party majority's size and composition. The House majority party must also factor in Senate control and the effectiveness of the President and Congress. Over the past 30 years, Presidents have dealt with varying party arrangements in Congress. President Reagan started with a Republican Senate and Democratic House, while President George H.W. Bush faced a Democratic Congress. President Clinton began with a Democratic Congress and later worked with a Republican Congress. President George W. Bush mostly had a Republican Congress, with some Democratic control. President Obama had Democratic control initially, but later faced a Republican House and a narrower Democratic Senate majority. President Trump began his presidency with Republican control of both chambers in the 114th Congress. Both parties in the House focused on party rules to open up decision-making to more voices. Many Members in the Democratic Caucus are organizing under the \"progressive\" banner, while many in the Republican Conference are organizing under the \"very conservative\" banner. The congressional environment is influenced by various factors besides party control and the use of rules. Speaker Thomas Bracken Reed played a significant role in shaping the modern House with his rulings. The Corrections Calendar was created in 1995 but became inactive by the 109th Congress. Legislation under suspension of the rules has become a common procedure, with motions allowed on multiple days of House sessions. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 originally called for two budget resolutions each year, but the process was found to be impractical and time-consuming. The House rules are important for all Members to use, as the process of having two budget resolutions each year was found to be impractical and time-consuming."
