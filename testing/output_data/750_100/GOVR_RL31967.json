    "content": "The statutory debt limit applies to federal debt held by the public and the government's own accounts, including federal trust funds like Social Security and Medicare. Government surpluses or deficits determine changes in public debt, while the on-budget fiscal balance does not directly affect debt held in government accounts. Since the late 1950s, the federal government has increased borrowing from the public almost every year, except for FY1969 and FY1998-FY2001. Budget deficits have led to increased debt issuance to the public, while legal requirements and accounting practices also impact debt held in government accounts, such as the Social Security Trust Fund. The growth in federal debt held by the public and trust funds has led to periodic increases in the debt limit since 1983. Issues related to the debt limit since 2011 are discussed in detail in CRS Report R43389. Treasury's financing methods can be affected when federal debt approaches its limit. The U.S. Treasury's ability to manage cash flow is impacted when federal debt nears its legal limit, affecting monthly surpluses and deficits. Borrowing is crucial for handling fluctuations in revenues and outlays. The U.S. Treasury's financial management becomes complicated when the debt limit restricts borrowing, impacting its ability to meet legal obligations and manage cash flows effectively. The U.S. Treasury faces challenges when the debt limit restricts borrowing, affecting its ability to meet legal obligations and manage cash flows effectively. Delays in debt limit increases could have serious negative consequences for the Treasury market and increase borrowing costs, potentially leading to default and repercussions for economies and financial markets. Delaying payments to avoid default can have serious negative repercussions for economies and financial markets worldwide. This can result in interest penalties under statutes like the Prompt Payment Act and the Internal Revenue Code. The U.S. Treasury's ability to fund federal obligations is crucial to avoid default risks that could have significant effects on global capital markets. Past Treasury Secretaries have used special strategies to manage cash and debt responsibilities during near-binding debt ceiling situations. The Treasury Secretary has taken actions in the past to manage debt obligations, including suspending sales of nonmarketable debt and withholding receipts. Congress authorized the use of certain funds to ease debt constraints. Treasury responses to the credit crunch in 2007 created options for the Secretary, but would have minor effects on delaying federal debt reaching its limit. The U.S. Treasury sold off mortgage-backed securities to minimize market disruptions and has eliminated its MBS portfolio. Other asset sales are unlikely to sustain debt management operations without a debt limit increase. The U.S. Treasury sold off mortgage-backed securities to minimize market disruptions and has eliminated its MBS portfolio. Other asset sales are unlikely to sustain debt management operations without a debt limit increase. Some have suggested using the Fourteenth Amendment to bypass the debt limit, but President Obama and legal analysts have rejected this idea. Innovative strategies to overcome debt ceiling constraints have also been proposed. The federal government must take extraordinary measures when the debt is near its limit, causing inconvenience and uncertainty. The debt limit allows Congress to control spending and imposes fiscal accountability on both Congress and the President. The debt limit allows Congress to control spending and imposes fiscal accountability on both Congress and the President. Some experts argue for eliminating the debt limit, stating that other controls in the budget process have superseded its effectiveness. The Obama Administration has proposed allowing increases in the debt limit subject to congressional approval. The Obama Administration has proposed allowing increases in the debt limit subject to congressional disapproval. Congress delegates work to its committees, with Committees on Appropriations handling discretionary spending, authorizing committees managing mandatory program spending, and Committees on the Budget drafting an overall budgetary framework. Between World War I and World War II, Congress evolved statutory restrictions on federal debt into an aggregate limit that applied to nearly all outstanding federal debt, helping assert its constitutional powers over federal spending and taxation. Individual Members not belonging to specific committees often use measures involving the debt limit to influence federal fiscal policy. During World War I, Congress authorized borrowing for specific purposes like the Panama Canal construction, often specifying details of financial instruments Treasury could use. In times of war, Congress granted Treasury discretion within limits to choose debt instruments, raising concerns about affecting monetary policies. Proponents argued federal borrowing wouldn't disrupt previous monetary agreements. The establishment of the Federal Reserve System in 1913 rendered concerns about borrowing disrupting previous monetary agreements moot. The War Revenue Act of 1898 allowed the Treasury to use certificates of indebtedness for short-term borrowing and cash management. Treasury Secretary was authorized to have $100 million outstanding in certificates of indebtedness with maturities under a year, mainly sold to large investors, banks, and financial institutions. The War Revenue Act of 1898 allowed the Treasury to issue certificates of indebtedness for short-term borrowing, mainly sold to large investors, banks, and financial institutions. The act also permitted the Treasury to issue $400 million in longer-term notes and bonds for public subscription, enabling smaller investors to participate. The Second Liberty Bond Act of 1917, which helped finance the United States' entry into World War I, removed certain limits on bond maturity and redemption, incorporating unused borrowing capacity from the First Liberty Bond Act. The Second Liberty Bond Act of 1917 incorporated unused borrowing capacity from the First Liberty Bond Act and other previous borrowing acts. Separate limits for previous debt issues were retained, leading to an overall aggregated debt limit. Subsequent borrowing measures were drafted as amendments to the Second Liberty Bond Act until 1982, reflecting changes in legislative drafting practices. In the 1920s and 1930s, Congress granted the Treasury Secretary more flexibility in managing federal debt by allowing the issuance of notes and savings certificates for small investors. This shift towards aggregate constraints on borrowing gave the Treasury greater ability to respond to changing financial conditions. In the 1930s, Treasury Secretary Mellon and Secretary Morgenthau advocated for greater flexibility in issuing bonds and managing public debt. Congress granted the U.S. Treasury more freedom in determining the type and amount of securities to be issued, emphasizing the role of Treasury bonds. In the 1930s, Treasury Secretary Mellon and Secretary Morgenthau advocated for more flexibility in issuing bonds and managing public debt. Congress granted the U.S. Treasury greater freedom in determining the type and amount of securities to be issued, emphasizing the role of Treasury bonds. President Franklin Roosevelt and Secretary Morgenthau requested Congress to eliminate separate limits on bonds and other types of debt, leading to the approval of the measure (H.R. 5748) by the House and Senate. The amendment was withdrawn in the Senate on July 14, clearing the way for President Franklin Roosevelt's signature. The law (P.L. 76-201) created the first aggregate limit ($45 billion) covering nearly all public debt, allowing the Treasury to manage federal debt more effectively by issuing debt instruments with maturities that reduce interest costs and minimize financial risks. The debt limit was increased to $65 billion in 1941, consolidating borrowing authority for \"National Defense\" series securities. This gave the Treasury more independence before World War II, with the debt limit closer to total federal debt compared to the end of World War I. For example, the 1919 Victory Liberty Bond Act raised the federal debt limit to $43 billion, well above the $25.5 billion total federal debt at the end of FY1919. In contrast, the debt limit in 1939 was $45 billion, only about 10% above the total federal debt. During World War II, the debt ceiling was raised to $300 billion to cover accumulating costs. After the war, it was reduced to $275 billion. The limit remained unchanged until 1954 due to the Korean War being financed on a pay-as-you-go basis. Eisenhower requested an increase in 1953, but Congress only approved temporary raises in 1954. In August 1954, a temporary increase in the debt limit was approved, followed by two more temporary increases. The limit reverted to $275 billion in July 1957, and Congress raised it in February 1958 to promote better management of money and manpower in the defense program. By March 1962, the debt limit reached $300 billion, its level at the end of World War II. Since then, there have been 78 separate measures altering the federal debt limit, with most changes being relatively small except for some recent large increases in dollar terms. Since FY1996, the debt limit has seen significant increases, with debt held by intergovernmental accounts growing by $855 billion during surpluses in FY1998-FY2001. Debt held by the public decreased by almost $450 billion during this time. However, since FY2001, debt held by the public has grown due to persistent budget deficits. Table 1 and Figure 1 illustrate the components of debt in current dollars and as percentages of GDP. Since FY1996, federal debt held by government accounts has grown steadily, partly due to increases in Social Security taxes recommended by the 1983 Greenspan Commission. Debt held by the public has also increased as a share of GDP, with deficits shrinking after FY1992. Table 2 provides details on debt limit increases from 1993 to 2014. Since FY1996, federal debt held by government accounts has grown steadily, partly due to Social Security tax increases. Deficits shrank after FY1992, leading to surpluses from FY1998 to FY2001. However, deficits reemerged in FY2002, causing debt held by the public to increase again. This accumulation of debt put pressure on the debt limit in early 2002. Between FY1998 and FY2001, surpluses were seen, but there was an increase in federally held debt and a decrease in debt held by the public, resulting in a $405 billion net increase in total debt subject to limit. By the beginning of FY2002, the debt was close to the $5,950 billion limit, with a $217 billion increase in debt subject to limit. This increase was split between debt held by government accounts and debt held by the public. The Administration recognized the deteriorating budget outlook and growth in debt held by the public in the fall of 2001. The Administration recognized the deteriorating budget outlook and requested Congress to raise the debt limit by $750 billion to $6,700 billion in early December 2001. As the debt approached the limit in FY2002, the Administration repeatedly asked Congress to increase the limit, warning of financial consequences. On April 4, 2002, the Treasury avoided reaching the limit by suspending reinvestment of government securities in the G-Fund of the federal employees' Thrift Savings Plan. The Treasury avoided reaching the debt limit in FY2002 by suspending reinvestment of government securities in the G-Fund of the federal employees' Thrift Savings Plan. This allowed the Treasury to issue new debt and meet the government's obligations. By the end of April, debt subject to limit had fallen back $35 billion below the limit. By the middle of May 2002, debt subject to limit had again risen to within $15 million of the statutory limit. The Treasury avoided reaching the debt limit in FY2002 by suspending reinvestment of government securities in the G-Fund of the federal employees' Thrift Savings Plan. By the middle of May 2002, debt subject to limit had risen to within $15 million of the statutory limit, prompting the Treasury to request Congress to raise the debt limit or enact other changes to issue new debt. The Treasury suspended investments in trust funds to fund government operations until June 28, 2002, by replacing debt with non-debt instruments. If the debt limit was not increased by then, the Treasury would need to take further actions to avoid breaching the ceiling. By June 21, a regular securities auction was postponed, but no other actions were taken. The Treasury postponed a regular securities auction on June 21, with large payments due at the end of June and beginning of July. The government was on the verge of default as it would soon exhaust all options to issue debt. Congress took steps to increase the debt limit in May and June 2002. The Senate's supplemental appropriations bill (S. 2551) did not include debt-limit-increasing language. Instead, the Senate passed a bill (S. 2578) on June 11 to raise the debt limit by $450 billion to $6,400 billion. The House narrowly approved the $450 billion debt limit increase on June 27 to avoid default. The House passed a $450 billion debt limit increase by a single vote on June 27, which was signed into law by the President on June 28, ending the 2002 debt limit crisis. In late February 2003, the Treasury requested an increase in the debt limit as the $6,400 billion limit would be reached. The 108th Congress did not immediately respond, leading to repeated requests from the Treasury to raise the debt limit to avoid financial problems. The Treasury used measures to manage debt holdings of government accounts to avoid reaching the debt limit in 2003. This allowed them to issue additional debt to the public and federal accounts. The debt subject to limit was kept $15 million below the debt ceiling. The House adopted the conference report on the FY2004 budget resolution triggering the \"Gephardt rule\" to raise the debt limit. The Senate received the debt-limit legislation on April 11 but did not act until May 23, when the debt subject to limit was $25 million below the existing limit. The Senate adopted the legislation after rejecting eight amendments. In May 2003, the Senate adopted legislation to raise the debt limit to $7,384 billion, which was signed by the President. By October 14, 2004, the debt subject to limit reached $7,383,975 million, just $25 million below the existing limit. The Treasury used methods to keep debt under the legal limit, but Secretary of the Treasury John Snow warned Congress that measures would be exhausted by mid-November. Without an increase in the debt limit, the Treasury may not meet all obligations, affecting the U.S. government's reputation in capital markets and raising borrowing costs. The House passed a budget resolution for FY2005 in spring 2004 but did not reach final agreement. The House passed a budget resolution for FY2005 in spring 2004 but did not reach final agreement with the Senate on raising the debt limit. As the debt approached the limit, no legislation was moved to raise it, leading to concerns about meeting obligations and affecting the government's reputation in capital markets. The House passed a budget resolution for FY2005 in spring 2004 but did not reach final agreement with the Senate on raising the debt limit. Senator Frist introduced legislation to raise the debt limit by $800 billion, which was approved by the Senate and House before being signed into law by the President in November 2004. In November 2004, the debt limit was increased, allowing the Treasury to reschedule a debt auction and cancel a \"debt limit suspension period.\" Subsequent debt limit increases in 2005, 2006, and 2007 were less dramatic. The FY2006 budget resolution directed committees to report bills raising the debt limit to $8,965 billion, but no bill was reported. The Gephardt rule triggered a House Joint Resolution to raise the debt limit by $781 billion. The House Joint Resolution raised the debt limit by $781 billion to $8,965 billion. Secretary of the Treasury Snow informed Congress that the debt limit would be reached in mid-February 2006, requesting an increase in the limit to avoid breaching it until mid-March. In February and March 2006, Secretary Snow informed Congress of measures taken to avoid reaching the debt limit. The Senate passed a debt limit increase on March 16, 2006, raising it to $8,965 billion. In March 2006, the debt limit was raised to $8,965 billion. In May 2007, Congress passed a resolution raising the debt limit to $9,815 billion. In July 2007, the Treasury requested another debt limit increase due to reaching the limit in October 2007. The Treasury projected reaching the debt limit in late October or early November, prompting steps to avoid exceeding it. The Senate approved a resolution without changes on September 12, 2007, which was passed by the President on September 29, 2007. Financial markets showed signs of turmoil in mid-2007, leading to a serious recession that lasted until 2009. Federal actions were taken to stabilize the housing and financial sectors. The financial crisis and recession prompted federal actions to stabilize housing and financial markets. The economic slowdown began with a decline in housing prices and a reluctance of major financial institutions to lend. This led to unfreezing credit markets, boosting consumption, and increasing spending. Federal deficits spiked to 9.8% of GDP due to reduced revenues and increased spending. The economic recession led to a spike in federal deficit spending to 9.8% of GDP. Falling asset prices and job cuts reduced federal revenues, while unemployment insurance and income support programs paid out more money as unemployment rose. Deficit spending increases federal spending through income support programs during times of rising unemployment. It can provide a fiscal stimulus if the economy is below its potential output levels but may lead to inflation if output levels are already high. The CBO estimated a $396 billion deficit in FY2008, which actually reached $455 billion, and a $342 billion deficit in FY2009. The federal deficit reached $455 billion in FY2008 and was estimated to be $1,587 billion in FY2009. The federal debt limit was raised multiple times due to economic conditions. The House and Senate Concurrent Resolutions recommended policies resulting in a total debt of $10,200 billion and $10,278 billion in FY2009, respectively. The House and Senate recommended policies leading to a total debt of $10,200 billion and $10,278 billion in FY2009. The budget conference report passed the Senate on June 4, 2008, and the House the next day. The House legislation to increase the debt limit to $10,615 billion was automatically deemed passed, as the Senate did not take it up. The House passed a bill to increase the debt limit to $10,615 billion on July 23, 2008, which was later approved by the Senate on July 26. The President signed the bill on July 30 (P.L. 110-289), also authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to extend a line of credit to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 created the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to oversee Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. The act also allowed the Secretary of the Treasury to provide a line of credit to the mortgage guarantee agencies. The Congressional Budget Office estimated a 5% chance of a cost to taxpayers exceeding $100 billion. On September 7, 2008, FHFA placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in conservatorship, giving full control to FHFA. The government took action to stabilize financial markets by deprivatizing the firms. On September 20, 2008, the Treasury proposed buying mortgage-related assets to stabilize markets. The Treasury proposed buying mortgage-related securities up to $700 billion to stabilize financial markets. Representative Barney Frank's amendment to raise the debt limit to $11,315 billion was rejected by the House, but a different version of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 with the same debt limit increase was passed by the Senate and House. The House passed H.R. 1424 on October 3, 2008, raising the debt limit to $11,315 billion. Congress considered another economic stimulus measure, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which included tax cuts and spending increases. The Senate version of the Act proposed raising the debt limit to $12,140 billion. The final conference agreement on ARRA was passed by the House and Senate on February 13, 2009, and signed by the President on February 17, 2009 (P.L. 111-5), increasing the debt limit to $12,104 billion. The budget resolution recommended policies leading to a debt subject to limit of $13,233 billion in FY2010, requiring a statutory debt limit increase. The House Joint Resolution (H.J.Res. 45) raised the debt limit to $13,029 billion in April 2009. Treasury Secretary Geithner warned Congress in August 2009 that the debt limit would be reached in mid-October, but the U.S. Treasury later announced a possible postponement until December. The Treasury reduced loans available through the Supplemental Financing Program, extending the time until the debt limit would be reached. The Obama Administration considered scaling back the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which could lower federal debt subject to the limit. Repayments of TARP funds by financial institutions could also reduce the debt subject to the limit. The U.S. Treasury could lower debt subject to the limit by issuing nonmarketable securities and making interest payments. Without a debt limit increase, Treasury's debt management activities could be challenged. Senior Members of the House made decisions in mid-December. In mid-December, senior Members of the House opted for a smaller increase in the debt limit to allow normal debt management operations for two months. H.R. 4314 raised the debt limit to $12,394 billion, passing in the House on December 16 and in the Senate on December 24. The President signed the measure on December 28. On January 28, the Senate passed an amended version of H.J.Res. 45 to raise the debt ceiling to $14,294 billion. The debt ceiling would be raised by $1,900 billion to $14,294 billion. An amendment for PAYGO restrictions was approved. There were discussions about creating a national commission to address federal debt. An amendment to establish a Bipartisan Task Force for Responsible Fiscal Action was not approved. President Obama then charged a National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform. The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform (Fiscal Commission) was tasked with improving the fiscal situation and achieving sustainability. The House approved H.J.Res. 45, forwarding it to the President who signed the measure (P.L. 111-139) on February 12, 2010. The 2011 debt limit episode was longer and more contentious than previous ones. The 2011 debt limit episode was resolved by the Budget Control Act of 2011, reinstating caps on spending. Treasury Secretary Geithner announced a debt issuance suspension period, extending borrowing capacity until August 2, 2011. Treasury confirmed borrowing authority exhaustion on July 1, 2011. The extraordinary measures used by previous Treasury Secretaries may provide limited additional time before the federal government becomes unable to meet its financial obligations due to the size of the FY2011 federal deficit. Some commentators suggested cutting spending to slow the growth in federal debt as a means of avoiding an increase in the debt limit. The U.S. Treasury announced on July 15 that it had suspended reinvestment in the Exchange Stabilization Fund, one of the last available extraordinary measures before its borrowing authority would be exhausted on August 2. This could complicate funding federal operations without a debt limit increase. The U.S. Treasury suspended reinvestment in the Exchange Stabilization Fund, one of the last available extraordinary measures before its borrowing authority would be exhausted on August 2. Funding federal operations could become complicated without a debt limit increase. An analysis projects cash inflows of $174.4 billion, $134.3 billion less than projected outflows of $306.7 billion. Treasury estimates on the debt limit and extraordinary measures have shifted since January 6, 2011. Congress is requesting a debt limit increase due to higher individual income tax revenues and sales of mortgage-backed securities expanding federal debt headroom. Estimates on reaching the debt limit and extending borrowing capacity align closely with Treasury's projections, based on federal spending patterns and uncertainties in receipts. Treasury Secretary indicated in a letter to Congress dated May 2, 2011. The Treasury Secretary planned to declare a debt issuance suspension period on May 16, 2011, unless Congress acted earlier to extend borrowing capacity until August 2011. Measures like the draw-down of the Supplementary Financing Program had already been taken. The State and Local Government Series Treasury securities issuance was suspended on May 6, 2011. On May 6, 2011, the State and Local Government Series (SLGS) Treasury securities were suspended. Treasury Secretary Geithner requested an increase in the debt limit in January 2011, predicting federal debt reaching its limit between March and May 2011. A bill to raise the debt limit to $16,700 billion was introduced on May 24. A bill to raise the debt limit to $16,700 billion was introduced on May 24, 2011, but was defeated in a House vote on May 31. The Cut, Cap, and Balance Act of 2011 was passed by the House on July 19, but was tabled by the Senate on July 22. This measure aimed to increase the federal debt limit to $16,700 billion upon the proposal of a balanced federal budget amendment. On July 25, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was introduced by House Speaker Boehner and Majority Leader Reid. The Budget Control Act (BCA; P.L. 112-25) was signed into law by President Obama on August 2, 2011, after approval by the House and Senate. It included provisions for deficit reduction and allowed for increases in the debt limit up to $2.4 trillion. The Budget Control Act (BCA) signed into law by President Obama on August 2, 2011, imposed discretionary spending caps, enforced by automatic spending reductions (sequester), established a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, required a vote on a proposed constitutional amendment for a balanced federal budget, and allowed for the President and Treasury Secretary to raise the debt ceiling. The legislation provided a three-step procedure for increasing the debt limit, starting with a $400 billion raise to $14,694 billion on August 2, 2011. The debt ceiling was raised by $400 billion to $14,694 billion on August 2, 2011, and a second increase of $500 billion occurred on September 22, 2011. The Senate rejected a disapproval measure on September 8, 2011, while the House passed a disapproval measure on a 232-186 vote. In late December 2011, the debt limit came close to its statutory limit, triggering a provision for a $1.2 trillion increase subject to a joint resolution of disapproval. The President delayed the request to allow Congress to consider the disapproval measure. Another way to trigger a $1.5 trillion increase was through a balanced budget amendment, but the measure failed to pass. The debt limit increase failed to reach the required two-thirds threshold in the House in a 261\u2013165 vote on November 18, 2011. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction also failed to agree on recommendations for a debt limit increase between $1.2 trillion and $1.5 trillion. After failing to agree on recommendations for a debt limit increase, the third increase in the debt limit was $1.2 trillion, matching budget reductions through sequestration. Treasury Secretary Geithner used extraordinary measures expected to last until mid-February. On January 23, 2013, the House passed H.R. 325 to suspend the debt limit until May 19, 2013. The Senate passed the measure on January 31, and it was signed into law on February 4 (P.L. 113-3). This allowed the U.S. Treasury to replenish funds used for federal payments and reset its ability to use extraordinary measures. The debt limit was reset at $16,699 billion on May 20, 2013, $305 billion above the previous limit. On May 20, 2013, the debt limit was set at $16,699 billion, $305 billion higher than the previous limit. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew declared a new debt issuance suspension period (DISP) due to the close proximity of debt to the limit. He sent notices to Congress with updated forecasts on when the borrowing capacity would be exhausted, which was later postponed due to increased revenue collections and special dividends. The U.S. Treasury's borrowing capacity was expected to be exhausted by October 17, 2013, but Congress passed a resolution to suspend the debt limit until February 8, 2014, due to stronger revenue collections and special dividends. After the debt limit suspension ended on February 7, 2014, the U.S. Treasury reset the limit to $17,212 billion. Congress quickly addressed the issue by approving a measure to suspend the debt limit until March 15, 2015. The President signed the measure into law on February 15, 2014. Once the suspension expired on March 16, 2015, the limit was reestablished at $18,113 billion. Treasury Secretary Lew used extraordinary measures to manage the situation. Treasury Secretary Lew invoked extraordinary measures to manage the debt limit situation, extending until July 30, 2015. He later sent a letter to congressional leaders to extend these measures until the end of October. These measures would allow the Treasury to meet financial obligations for a brief period after October. Secretary Lew stated that these measures would be exhausted by November 3, 2015. Secretary Lew announced that extraordinary measures would be depleted by November 3, 2015, with a cash reserve of less than $30 billion on hand. Lower tax collections and higher trust fund investments reduced Treasury's headroom more than expected, pushing the exhaustion date closer to mid-November 2015. On October 26, 2015, a \"Bipartisan Budget Agreement\" was released addressing fiscal issues, including the debt limit. The agreement reset the debt limit on March 16, 2017, and increased statutory caps on discretionary spending for FY2016 and FY2017. The U.S. Treasury was prohibited from creating a cash reserve beyond what was necessary to meet federal obligations during the suspension period. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA 2015) was approved by the Senate and signed into law on November 2, 2015 (P.L. 114-74). It included measures to offset increases in discretionary spending for FY2016 and FY2017. In the early 2000s, the federal government experienced budget surpluses, leading to a reduction in public debt. The federal government experienced budget surpluses in the early 2000s, leading to a reduction in public debt. However, the surpluses turned into deficits due to increased military and security spending after 9/11, rising nondefense outlays, tax reductions, and the financial crisis of 2007-2009. The financial crisis of 2007-2009 and subsequent recession caused large federal deficits, leading to a growth in total debt and necessitating debt limit increases. The direct fiscal costs of a financial crisis are overshadowed by reduced tax revenues and increased social safety net benefits. Concerns about fiscal sustainability were highlighted during the 2011 debt limit episode, but have since become less prominent as federal deficits have decreased with economic recovery. For example, the FY2015 deficit was 2.5% of GDP compared to 9.8% in FY2009. The FY2015 federal deficit was 2.5% of GDP, while the FY2009 deficit was 9.8% of GDP. Federal health program costs and net interest expenses have risen less rapidly than expected. Without major policy changes, persistent deficits could substantially increase federal debt, leading to slower economic growth in the long run. Congress may need to raise the debt limit repeatedly to accommodate the growing debt. The federal government may need to raise the debt limit to accommodate the growing federal debt and meet financial obligations. Data shows an increase in total federal debt since FY2001, with monthly balances rising for debt held by government accounts and the public. Since FY2001, total federal debt has increased by $12,380 billion, with debt held in government accounts rising by $2,566 billion and debt held by the public increasing by $9,813 billion. Debt measures experienced periodic reductions, despite an overall increasing trend."
