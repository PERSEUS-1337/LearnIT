    "content": "Prescription drug affordability has become a major concern due to the rapid increase in retail drug spending. This rise is attributed to manufacturers introducing new drugs and raising prices for existing brand-name products. Additionally, fewer brand-name drugs losing patent protection has resulted in lower savings from generic substitutes. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services predict a 6.3% annual growth in retail drug spending from 2017 to 2026. Retail drug spending is expected to grow by an average of 6.3% annually from 2017 to 2026, outpacing other areas of medical spending. The report addresses government and private-sector policies affecting drug prices and availability, including federally funded research, regulation of advertising, legal restrictions on reimportation, and federal price negotiation. It offers a broad overview with references to more detailed CRS products. The appendix provides references to relevant congressional hearings. The National Health Expenditures (NHE) accounts track annual spending on prescription drugs in retail settings. NHE data exclude drugs dispensed in institutions and over-the-counter products. According to recent NHE data, the US spent $328.6 billion on prescription drugs in 2016 and is forecasted to spend $338.1 billion in 2017, accounting for 10% of national health care spending. Prescription drug spending is expected to increase to 11% by 2027. Retail drug spending has ranged from 5% to 10% of total health care expenditures since 1960. Analysts say data on retail drug sales do not provide a complete picture of U.S. drug spending. Various sources, including the Department of Health and Human Services, private consultants, and academics, offer different estimates of total prescription drug spending, taking into account factors like rebates, coupons, and retail versus institutional use. The pace of U.S. retail prescription drug spending has varied over the decades, with growth slowing from 2003 to 2013 due to various factors including a recession and fewer expensive new drugs entering the market. Retail prescription drug spending in the U.S. saw a significant increase in 2014, with a 12.4% jump, the largest in over a decade. Subsequent years showed slower growth, with a 1.3% increase in 2016 and a projected 2.9% increase in 2017. The growth is expected to continue at an average of 6.3% annually through 2027, driven by faster drug price growth, especially for specialty drugs. Retail prescription drug spending in the U.S. is projected to continue growing at an average of 6.3% annually through 2027, driven by faster drug price growth, particularly for specialty drugs. Congressional hearings have been held to address the sharp increases in drug prices and overall spending acceleration. Retail prescription drug spending in the U.S. is projected to continue growing at an average of 6.3% annually through 2027, driven by faster drug price growth, particularly for specialty drugs. The rapid increase in retail drug spending in 2014 and 2015 was driven largely by the introduction of new high-cost drugs, price increases for existing drugs, and the diminishing impact of generic substitution. The rate of prescription drug spending slowed in 2016, even though overall utilization rose during that year. The rate of prescription drug spending slowed in 2016 due to factors like fewer new drug approvals, less use of high-cost drugs, and decreased spending on diabetes treatments. Drug mix, which compares the cost of new drugs to older ones, plays a role in overall spending. The FDA has approved many new expensive specialty drugs in recent years. The FDA has approved numerous new expensive specialty drugs, including those for hepatitis C, cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. In 2016, over half of the growth in U.S. prescription drug spending came from drugs available for less than two years. The introduction of new hepatitis C drugs significantly contributed to increased drug spending in 2014 and 2015. The introduction of expensive specialty drugs, such as those for hepatitis C, cancer, diabetes, and heart disease, has led to a decrease in spending on brand-name drugs due to patents expiring and the availability of generic versions. Annual savings from brands losing patent protection have decreased since 2012. Changes in drug mix will continue to impact drug spending. Prescription drug prices have risen faster than overall U.S. inflation since 2014. The gap between prescription drug and overall inflation has narrowed. Biologics in the development pipeline often have high prices with limited lower-cost alternatives. FDA has approved biosimilar substitutes for some biologics, but they are not significantly lower-priced. The gap between prescription drug and overall inflation has narrowed significantly. U.S. retail drug inflation was 6.4% in 2014, 6.2% in 2016, and 2.8% in 2017. Drug inflation is driven by price increases for brand-name and generic drugs. The 2016 HHS study found that generic price increases were not a major contributor to inflation. Express Scripts analysis showed brand-name drug prices rose 10.7% from 2015 to 2016, while generic drug prices declined by 8.7%. Biologics and specialty drugs drove much of the price inflation. ACA expansion of prescription drug coverage boosted demand starting in 2014. The ACA expanded prescription drug coverage through tax credits and required private insurance plans to cover drugs as essential health benefits. Drug spending for insured consumers increased by 15% annually from 2014 to 2015, driven by higher utilization. Medicaid coverage also expanded under the ACA, leading to an 8% jump in Medicaid prescription drug claims in 2014. The aging population, particularly the baby boomers, has led to increased demand for prescription drugs. Patients aged 50 and older accounted for 70% of dispensed prescriptions in 2016. Consumer out-of-pocket spending for prescriptions has decreased over the years, with commercial payers and taxpayer-funded health programs covering a larger share of the retail drug bill. Consumer out-of-pocket spending for prescription drugs has decreased over the years, with commercial payers and taxpayer-funded health programs covering a larger share of the retail drug bill. Out-of-pocket spending is forecast to decline further to 12.1% of retail drug costs by 2026. Consumers may still face high out-of-pocket expenses depending on factors like the type of drug prescribed, insurance coverage, health plan policies, and eligibility for discounts or assistance programs. Health plans have increased cost sharing for prescription drugs, with a rise in drug deductibles and the use of formulary tiered pricing. Coinsurance is being imposed instead of flat co-payments for expensive drugs, especially in plans sold on ACA state exchanges. This has led to consumers facing higher out-of-pocket expenses, depending on their insurance coverage and eligibility for assistance programs. Tiered pricing in health plans has widened the cost differential between low-cost and high-priced drugs, burdening consumers. For example, in 2017, those in plans with multiple tiers faced a $110 co-payment for high-priced drugs compared to $11 for generics. Cost-sharing increases have been partially offset by other factors, including the ACA's cap on annual out-of-pocket spending. The ACA has capped annual out-of-pocket spending in health plans, reduced cost sharing for Part D enrollees, and increased patient assistance programs from pharmaceutical manufacturers. Generic drug use rates have risen, leading to a decrease in average out-of-pocket spending for retail drugs among insured consumers. The number of consumers facing high out-of-pocket costs has increased, with some spending over $1,000 in 2014. The share of people with high drug costs has tripled since 2004, particularly for outpatient specialty drugs. Out-of-pocket spending for outpatient specialty drugs increased from $24 to $35 per month from 2003 to 2014, a 46% rise. Out-of-pocket spending for nonspecialty drugs decreased from $14 to $6 per month during the same period. Per person out-of-pocket spending for retail prescription drugs declined from $146 in 2010 to $140 in 2016, forecasted to decrease to $137 in 2017 and gradually rise to $207 by 2026. Out-of-pocket spending is expected to continue declining as a share of retail drug expenditures in the next decade. The government's share of U.S. retail prescription drug spending has increased significantly, rising from about 25% in 2005 to an estimated 44.1% in 2017. It is forecasted to reach 47% by 2026. This growth is attributed to the expansion of subsidized drug coverage through programs like Medicare Part D and Medicaid under the ACA. Unlike other countries, the U.S. does not have a centralized system for administering drug coverage. Unlike other nations, the United States does not have a centralized system for administering government-sponsored drug benefits, procuring pharmaceuticals, or setting drug prices. Various federal health programs operate different drug discount and contracting systems, including market-based negotiations in Medicare Part D, direct procurement in the Veterans Health Administration, and a combination of mandatory rebates and negotiations in Medicaid. FDA regulates the safety and effectiveness of prescription drugs but does not have the authority to set drug prices or consider prices during the drug approval process. Federal agencies can secure pharmaceuticals through various means. Federal agencies in the United States do not have a centralized system for setting drug prices. Different federal health programs have varying discounts for prescription drugs, with Medicaid rebates being significantly higher than Part D rebates. There are legislative efforts to give the HHS Secretary more power to negotiate Medicare Part D drug prices. Medicare Part D drug prices are not centrally set by federal agencies in the US. Different federal health programs offer varying discounts for prescription drugs, with Medicaid rebates being higher than Part D rebates. Congress designed Medicare Part D as a market-oriented program where commercial health payers compete for enrollees based on drug coverage price and scope. Part D plan sponsors negotiate drug prices. The Medicare Part D program allows plan sponsors to negotiate drug prices with manufacturers and pharmacies, promoting market competition. The program includes a \"noninterference provision\" to prevent the HHS Secretary from intervening in these negotiations or requiring specific formularies. Congress has debated the effectiveness of this market-based model since its enactment in 2003. In the years since Part D was enacted, Congress has debated the effectiveness of the market-based model in controlling drug prices and enrollee costs. Program spending has been below initial budget projections, with rising drug rebates and lower premiums in areas with robust competition. However, Part D plans have higher average drug prices than Medicaid. Some studies found that Part D plans have higher drug prices than Medicaid, which has mandatory federal drug rebates. Lawmakers propose giving the Secretary authority to negotiate drug prices to leverage the purchasing power of Medicare beneficiaries. In 2007, the House approved the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act. The Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act of 2007, H.R. 4, aimed to allow the Secretary to negotiate Part D drug prices without creating a formulary. However, the Senate did not approve the measure. A CBO analysis suggested that the bill would only generate minimal savings unless the Secretary was granted additional authority to regulate prices or create a central formulary. Patient and consumer groups opposed giving the Secretary more control over the Part D formulary, fearing potential reductions in drug coverage. During recent sessions of Congress, bills were introduced to modify the noninterference provision for Medicare Part D drugs. The Obama Administration recommended giving the Secretary authority to negotiate prices for high-cost and biologic drugs, while the Trump Administration suggested requiring Part D plans to pass on more drug rebates to enrollees. Lawmakers also proposed applying some of Medicaid's mandatory rebates to certain drugs. Lawmakers have introduced legislation to apply Medicaid's mandatory rebates to Part D drugs for low-income enrollees, which could lower costs initially but lead to price increases over time. This change may also impact manufacturers' investment in research and development. State governments regulate prescription drug use and pricing, administer Medicaid with the federal government, and offer health insurance plans to state employees. Some states have patient assistance programs for low-income residents, with laws in California, Delaware, and Vermont capping drug costs and requiring price transparency. Vermont passed a law in 2016 mandating manufacturer disclosure for drugs with significant price increases. Vermont passed a law in 2016 mandating manufacturer disclosure for drugs that underwent large percentage price increases. State regulators compile a list of drugs with the largest annual price increases, and manufacturers must justify the price hikes to the state attorney general. Other states are also considering legislation to force drug companies to justify prices and prohibit gag clauses in pharmacy contracts that prevent pharmacists from informing consumers about cheaper prescription options. The United States spends more on prescription drugs than other industrialized nations, with a projected increase in global drug spending share. Maine allowed drug imports from certain countries, but a federal court deemed it unconstitutional. The United States spends significantly more on prescription drugs compared to other industrialized nations, with projections showing it will account for 12%-13% of global drug spending by 2021. Studies have shown that U.S. per capita spending on retail prescription drugs is much higher than the OECD average, with prices for specific drugs often double that of other countries. The U.S. spends significantly more on prescription drugs compared to other industrialized nations, with prices often double that of the European Union. Reasons for higher U.S. spending include faster adoption of new drugs, patent protections, and government-run health care systems in OECD countries that set price limits. EU nations use external reference pricing for medicines. Value-based pricing is used by national health programs to determine drug payment based on effectiveness. In Canada, the Common Drug Review evaluates new and existing drugs for reimbursement. In the U.S., alternative pricing methods are being explored, such as by Harvard Pilgrim Health Care. Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, a private health insurer, announced a deal with drugmakers Novartis and Eli Lilly for discounts based on drug performance. CMS encourages value-based purchasing in Medicaid programs, while ICER produces reports on drug effectiveness and cost. The pharmaceutical industry is concerned about the potential budget impact of newly approved drugs by the FDA. ICER has refined its methodology for valuing prescription drugs and has engaged with various segments of the healthcare industry. The federal government focuses on basic research, while the pharmaceutical industry prioritizes clinical trials over discovery activities. The pharmaceutical industry prioritizes clinical trials over discovery activities. Studies have shown that a small percentage of new drugs approved by the FDA originate from sources other than private industry. A 1993 study found that 7.6% of new drugs approved from 1981 through 1990 came from nonindustry sources. Another study in 2010 showed that 24.1% of innovative new drugs approved between 1998 and 2007 were publicly funded. The study by Ashley J. Stevens et al. in 2011 found that 9.3% of drugs approved by the FDA from 1990 to 2007 resulted from work in publicly funded labs. Additionally, 19% of drugs that received priority review were a result of publicly funded research. The study by Ashley J. Stevens et al. in 2011 found that 19% of drugs that received priority review were a result of publicly funded research, compared to 20.0% based on private-sector research, showing a 2.3 times increase. FDA priority review is for evaluating drugs with significant improvements in safety or effectiveness for serious conditions. Data suggests that publicly funded research institutions tend to discover drugs with important clinical effects. The Stevens study found that publicly funded research led to the discovery of a drug and creation of intellectual property transferred to a company through a commercial license. The study excluded the role of PSRIs in developing platform technologies that contributed to new drug classes approved by the FDA. The study excluded platform technologies developed with public funds, such as recombinant DNA technology and methods for producing antibodies, which were crucial for developing new drugs. A 2018 study found that public funding from the NIH was associated with every new drug approved by the FDA from 2010 to 2016. The study revealed that up to 20% of the NIH budget allocation, around $100 billion, contributed to the development of these new drugs. The NIH budget allocation from 2000 to 2016, around $100 billion, was linked to research contributing to new drug approvals from 2010-2016. This suggests a greater NIH contribution to drug research than previously thought. Pharmaceutical companies disclose overall research spending, but specific drug development costs are not widely available. Academic studies have tried to estimate average drug development expenses, with the Tufts Center being a prominent source. The Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development estimates the average cost of developing an FDA-approved prescription drug to be $2.6 billion in 2014, including clinical spending and time costs. This figure is based on data provided by 10 large drug manufacturers. The Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development estimated the cost of developing an FDA-approved prescription drug to be $2.6 billion in 2014, including clinical spending and time costs. However, academic and government research has challenged this figure, questioning the assumptions made in the study. A 2016 HHS study highlighted the high costs of new drug development, ranging from $1.2 billion to $2.6 billion. Transparency legislation aims to compel drugmakers to disclose research, marketing, and other costs for high-priced drugs or those with significant price increases. Price transparency legislation assumes that research and development costs are not the main factor in drug pricing. A Senate investigation found that Gilead Pharmaceutical's pricing strategy for hepatitis C drugs was focused on maximizing revenue rather than research costs. The pricing strategy of Gilead Pharmaceutical for hepatitis C drugs focused on maximizing revenue, rather than research costs. Pfizer's pricing strategy for the breast cancer drug Ibrance considered factors such as existing drug prices, reimbursement, and prescriber feedback. The United States allows direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs, regulated by the FDA to ensure accuracy and balance of benefits and risks. Pharmaceutical companies can take a federal tax deduction for advertising expenses, including direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs. This form of advertising is part of the industry's promotion efforts, alongside marketing to healthcare providers. Pharmaceutical advertising has evolved since 1962 when Congress gave the FDA authority to regulate it. Pharmaceutical advertising has evolved since 1962 when Congress gave the FDA authority over prescription drug advertising. In 1969, FDA issued regulations for true and balanced information in drug ads. By the 1980s, firms started advertising to consumers, addressed by FDA in 1985. FDA issued guidance on broadcast ads in 1999 and updated guidance on internet advertising. DTC prescription drug advertising has steadily expanded, reaching over $5 billion. DTC prescription drug advertising has been steadily increasing, reaching over $5 billion in 2006. Advertising dipped during the 2007 recession but rebounded to the peak in 2014. Recent data shows a rapid increase in DTC advertising, with pharmaceutical advertising rising 56% to over $6 billion from 2012 to 2015. Television and newspaper ads make up the majority of spending on pharmaceutical DTC advertising. Newspaper advertisements are the main spending area for pharmaceutical DTC advertising, but internet-based drug ads are growing rapidly. Federal regulations require drug companies to submit ads to the FDA for assessment. Internet prescription drug promotions are increasing, while television promotions remain flat. Pharmaceutical advertising data show submission frequency to FDA, not actual media appearance rates. Supporters claim ads inform consumers and improve involvement in treatment, while critics argue it may lead to inappropriate prescribing and higher drug spending. Brand-name drug ads could prompt consumers to choose higher-priced products over lower-cost alternatives. Recent studies suggest a link between drug advertising and increased use of prescription drugs, with a 2015 study indicating that a 10% rise in drug advertising views leads to a 5.4% increase in filled prescriptions for the advertised drugs. Additionally, a 2006 Government Accountability Office report found that while advertising may have direct benefits, it may also encourage the use of brand-name products over lower-cost alternatives. The Office report highlighted that advertising for drugs may have benefits but could also promote the use of specific drugs over potentially more suitable alternatives. A government survey revealed concerns from the public regarding the lack of information on drug benefits and risks in direct-to-consumer advertisements. Congress has previously discussed restrictions on DTC drug advertising to address public health and financial concerns. The American Medical Association recommended a ban on DTC drug ads in November 2015. The American Medical Association and the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists recommended a ban on direct-to-consumer drug ads in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Legislation in the 114th Congress proposed a moratorium on advertising for new drugs. Concerns exist about the promotion of new drugs to consumers without sufficient evidence of their safety and effectiveness. In 2006, the Institute of Medicine recommended that FDA restrict DTC advertising of new drugs for two years after introduction. Congress has debated but not approved a moratorium on advertising for new drugs. Legislation was introduced in the 114th Congress to disallow federal tax deductions for pharmaceutical DTC advertising. FDA regulates the sale of pharmaceuticals in the United States under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. In the United States, a manufacturer cannot sell a drug without an approved marketing application, which includes clinical data on safety and effectiveness, manufacturing procedures, reporting processes, and labeling. Imported drugs may not meet all approval requirements, such as FDA-approved labeling for U.S. sales. The Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 clarified that only the manufacturer of an FDA-approved prescription drug can legally bring it back into the United States. The Medicine Equity and Drug Safety Act of 2000 allowed pharmacists and wholesalers to import FDA-approved prescription drugs, but in practice, it has not been effective. The MEDS Act, part of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, has not been effectively implemented due to the HHS Secretary's failure to certify its safety and cost benefits to Congress. The importation provision in the MEDS Act, PDMA, and MMA legislation has never been implemented due to the HHS Secretary's failure to certify its safety and cost benefits. If implemented, a company could produce and package a drug outside the US according to FDA approval and bring it into the US for sale. Lawmakers have attempted this multiple times. Lawmakers have tried to use the agriculture appropriations bill to bypass restrictions on prescription drug importation into the US. FDA has been lenient in enforcing personal importation rules, allowing individuals to bring in a 90-day supply of drugs. The FDA allows individuals to bring a 90-day supply of non-FDA-approved drugs into the US for personal use, requiring written affirmation and physician information. This policy was not intended for importing lower-priced prescription drugs. The goal is to save FDA resources and permit medical treatments not otherwise available. The FDA allows individuals to bring a 90-day supply of non-FDA-approved drugs into the US for personal use, requiring written affirmation and physician information. This policy was not intended for importing lower-priced prescription drugs. Some states have tried to pass laws allowing drug importation, but the policy is now mainly used by consumers seeking lower prices for FDA-approved drugs available in the US. The Senate Committees have discussed drug importation and the FDA's role in the generic drug marketplace. The Senate Special Committee on Aging also examined Valeant Pharmaceuticals' business model and the repercussions for patients and the healthcare system. The Senate Committees have discussed sudden price spikes in decades-old Rx drugs and off-patent drugs, as well as examined the proposed Medicare Part B drug demonstration. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions examined the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report on the cost of prescription drugs. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions reviewed reports on the cost of prescription drugs and how the drug delivery system impacts what patients pay. This includes discussions on EpiPen price increases and regulatory barriers affecting pharmaceutical competition. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions discussed regulatory barriers inhibiting pharmaceutical competition in hearings on EpiPen price increases, Generic Drug User Fee Amendments, and Biosimilar Implementation. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions discussed regulatory barriers inhibiting pharmaceutical competition in hearings on EpiPen price increases, Generic Drug User Fee Amendments, and Biosimilar Implementation. Continuing America's Leadership: Advancing Research and Development for Patients, House Energy and Commerce Committee Examining the Drug Supply Chain, Examining How Covered Entities Utilize the 340B Drug Pricing Program, and Examining Patient Access to Investigational Drugs were also topics of discussion in congressional hearings. The House Energy and Commerce Committee held hearings on various topics including patient access to investigational drugs, modernizing FDA's regulation of over-the-counter drugs, FDA's prescription drug user fee program, and FDA's generic drug and biosimilar user fee program. The House Energy and Commerce Committee held hearings on topics such as patient access to investigational drugs, modernizing FDA's regulation of over-the-counter drugs, and FDA's prescription drug user fee program. The hearings also covered the Obama Administration's Medicare drug experiment, antitrust concerns in the FDA approval process, and the state of competition in the pharmacy benefit manager and pharmacy marketplaces. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform held hearings on federally funded cancer research coordination and innovation, as well as the impact of voluntary restricted distribution systems in the pharmaceutical supply chain. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform held hearings on the impact of voluntary restricted distribution systems in the pharmaceutical supply chain, including discussions on the rising price of EpiPens and developments in the prescription drug market."
