    "content": "The \"State Infrastructure Banks Act of 1995\" allows states to use infrastructure banks for financing transportation projects, providing more flexibility in developing public-private partnerships. Congress recognizes the need for new financial concepts in transportation programs that traditional federal reimbursement programs cannot accommodate. The \"State Infrastructure Banks Act of 1995\" defines key terms such as Secretary, State, and State infrastructure bank. State infrastructure banks are created at the State or multi-State level to finance transportation projects. Congress grants consent to States to establish State infrastructure banks and enter into interstate compacts to promote regional investment in transportation infrastructure. State infrastructure banks can provide loans, issue debt, and offer assistance to entities constructing transportation projects. State infrastructure banks can provide financial assistance to private entities for transportation projects eligible under title 23, United States Code. Assistance can include loans or other forms of support for the construction or capital costs of qualifying projects, which may be subordinated to other project financing. State infrastructure banks can offer financial assistance for transportation projects, including subordinated debt financing. To qualify as a State infrastructure bank, each participating State must meet specific requirements. State infrastructure banks must maintain an investment grade rating on debt issuances or have sufficient insurance. Investment income generated by deposited funds must be credited to the bank and used for providing loans to transportation projects. The State infrastructure banks invest in Treasury securities or bank deposits to earn interest for transportation projects. Loan repayments can be credited back to the bank for the same purpose. The State infrastructure bank must ensure that any loan will bear positive interest, repayment will start within 5 years of project completion, the loan term will not exceed 30 years, and the loan amount will not exceed what the State transfers. The State infrastructure bank must make an annual report to the Secretary by September 30 each year. The Secretary must ensure that Federal disbursements for capital reserves are consistent with historic rates and specify procedures for the bank's operations and loans. Contributions from Title 23 apportionments are limited. Contributions from Title 23 apportionments allow a State to transfer up to 15% of Federal funds to a State infrastructure bank, following specific guidelines. The State can disburse these funds at a traditional rate, not exceeding the Federal-aid highway program rate. The deposit of Federal apportionments into a State infrastructure bank does not create any obligation on the part of the United States. Any debt financing instrument issued by the bank must explicitly state that it is not guaranteed by the United States. Management of Federal Funds under this Act exempts certain sections of the United States Code. States can contribute up to 2 percent of Federal funds deposited into a State infrastructure bank for administrative costs."
