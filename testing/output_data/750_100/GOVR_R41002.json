    "content": "Increasing pressures on water supplies are leading to changes in operations at Corps facilities to meet municipal and industrial demands. Corps reallocations at Lake Lanier are causing conflict between Alabama, Florida, and Georgia. The agency is considering reallocating storage for M&I use at dams in various states, with more requests expected. Reallocation involves tradeoffs by shifting storage from current purposes like hydropower or navigation. The federal role in M&I water supply development is limited, with states and local entities playing a significant role. Congress acknowledged state primacy in developing M&I supplies in the Water Supply Act of 1958, emphasizing cooperation between the Federal Government, states, and local interests in water supply development. The federal government primarily invests in water infrastructure for flood control, navigation, irrigation, multipurpose dams, and diversion facilities. The largest projects are managed by the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army. The federal government invests in water infrastructure through projects managed by the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers. Construction of large federal dams has slowed since the 1960s due to cost, ecological impacts, and site availability. Reservoir planning now focuses on operating existing reservoirs and managing for new objectives. Congress authorizes the Corps to construct dams and other water projects. The Corps is authorized by Congress to construct dams and water infrastructure projects. Each dam and reservoir are operated to meet authorized purposes and comply with federal laws. Approximately 91 Corps reservoirs have M&I storage as an authorized purpose. Additional requirements are included through general legislation. The Corps is authorized by Congress to construct dams and water infrastructure projects for various purposes. Congress has given the Corps authority to provide additional benefits from its projects, such as recreation, and some limited authority to provide M&I water supply. This report does not analyze the Corps' use of the 1944 authority for M&I water supply as it is not likely to have a significant future role. The report focuses on the implementation of the 1958 Water Supply Act by the Corps, providing data on reservoirs with storage reallocated under this authority. For legal issues related to the 1958 WSA, refer to CRS Report R40714 by Cynthia Brougher. Congress granted the Corps M&I water supply authority in the 1958 WSA. In the 1958 Water Supply Act, Congress granted the Corps M&I water supply authority, but limited decision-making without congressional approval. Modifications to reservoir projects for water supply must be approved by Congress if they significantly impact the project's original purposes or require major changes. The 1958 Water Supply Act granted the Corps M&I water supply authority, but modifications to reservoir projects for water supply must be approved by Congress if they significantly impact the project's original purposes or require major changes. The Corps developed a guidance manual for implementing this authority, including provisions for determining when a reallocation does not require congressional approval. The Corps' authority to reallocate storage for water supply purposes is limited to 15% of total storage capacity or 50,000 acre feet, whichever is less. This criteria was not previously specified in guidance. In 2007, lawsuits related to Lake Lanier were consolidated and transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida. A 2009 court order addressed whether the Corps violated Section 301 of the 1958 WSA by not seeking congressional approval for changes in Lake Lanier operations for M&I water supply. The court largely agreed with Florida, Alabama, Alabama Power Company, and Southeastern Federal Power Customers. They argued that the Corps was obligated to seek congressional approval for the changes. The court found that the Corps had reallocated over 21% of Lake Lanier's storage without congressional approval since the mid-1970s, totaling roughly 260,000 acre-feet. Operational changes shifted storage from hydropower to M&I supply, with the Corps contracting with M&I water providers for withdrawals directly from the lake. The court determined that these actions exceeded the Corps' authorized purposes. The court found that the Corps had reallocated a significant amount of Lake Lanier's storage without approval, shifting storage from hydropower to M&I supply. This has raised questions about the Corps' reallocation of water at its other facilities, with 135 reservoirs holding M&I water authorized under project-specific authorities. Some reservoirs derive their M&I storage authority from the 1958 WSA, accounting for less than 640,000 AF of the Corps' M&I storage. The Corps has reallocated over 50,000 AF of storage space for M&I use at Lake Texoma, with four reallocations approved at the reservoir. One reallocation for 84,099 AF from hydropower to M&I was negotiated with stakeholders and approved in 1985. The Corps found that reallocation of storage space at Lake Texoma for M&I use would not harm authorized purposes and could be done under the 1958 WSA without congressional approval. The reallocation stayed below the 15% usable storage criterion, except at Cowanesque Lake where it exceeded 30% of storage. The Cowanesque reallocation under the 1958 WSA discretionary authority was mentioned in P.L. 99-88, the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1985. The Corps evaluates potential effects before recommending a reallocation to Congress. The 2009 court order raised concerns about the Corps' evaluations related to Lake Lanier operations and the sufficiency of reallocation analyses. Lake Lanier and Lake Cumberland are not included in the reallocation studies due to exceeding authorized purposes or lack of authorization for withdrawals. The Corps' operation of Lake Lanier for M&I water supply has been controversial, with concerns raised about unauthorized withdrawals at Lake Cumberland and other Corps facilities. The 2009 court order highlighted issues with reallocation analyses and the lack of authorization for withdrawals at these dams. The Corps' operation of Lake Lanier for M&I water supply has been controversial, with concerns about unauthorized withdrawals at Lake Cumberland and other Corps facilities. Most Corps reallocations have occurred without national attention or litigation like Lake Lanier, either through delegated authority or congressional direction. Existing reallocations under the 1958 WSA mostly met the Corps' criteria, raising questions about Congress' view on the Corps' discretionary authority. The discretionary authority for M&I reallocation at federal facilities is a growing policy issue. Questions include how multiple reallocations in a basin should be handled, the agency's discretion in agreements with stakeholders, and managing unauthorized withdrawals. Current policies reflect past decisions that may need reevaluation as more reallocations are requested. The federal government faces challenges in handling reallocations to M&I water supply at Corps facilities, including issues with stakeholder interests, pricing for storage space, and crediting for return flows. This raises broader questions about the federal role in municipal water supply and potential changes in response to reduced water supply in communities. The federal government faces challenges in reallocating water supply at Corps facilities due to stakeholder interests, pricing issues, and crediting for return flows. Questions arise about the national interest, infrastructure operations, and institutions in light of potential climate change effects on water supply. Addressing these complexities is hindered by differing opinions and the difficulty of enacting significant changes to federal facilities."
