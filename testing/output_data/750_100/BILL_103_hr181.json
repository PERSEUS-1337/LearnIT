    "content": "The \"Notch Baby Act of 1993\" establishes a new guaranteed minimum primary insurance amount for those eligible during a transitional period. Section 215(a) of the Social Security Act is amended to include a new provision for calculating the primary insurance amount for individuals described in paragraph (4)(B). This provision includes a transitional increase amount if applicable. The Social Security Act is amended to calculate the primary insurance amount for certain individuals, including a transitional increase amount based on specific criteria. The Social Security Act is amended to provide transitional benefits based on specific criteria, with varying percentages depending on the year of eligibility. The Social Security Act is amended to provide transitional benefits based on specific criteria, with varying percentages depending on the year of eligibility. In 1983, transitional benefits are calculated as 10 percent of the excess under former law, which is defined as the difference between the applicable former law primary insurance amount and the individual's primary insurance amount computed under the new law. The individual's primary insurance amount is computed or recomputed under specific criteria outlined in the Social Security Act, with modifications as provided by subparagraph (E). This calculation excludes certain subsections and applies section 215(b) as in effect in December 1978, with exceptions. The individual's computation base years for Social Security benefits are limited to calendar years after 1950 (or 1936 if applicable) until age 61, with an additional 3 years for highest earnings. Adjustments are made to the calculation method as specified in the Social Security Act. The paragraph applies to individuals if it results in a higher insurance amount than the calculation method without this paragraph. The effective date and related rules are outlined in Section 3. The amendments made by this Act are effective as if they were part of the Social Security Amendments of 1977, with no benefit increases before January 1994. Recomputation of benefits is required for individuals entitled to monthly insurance benefits under title II of the Social Security Act for December 1987. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will recompute the primary insurance amount for individuals entitled to monthly insurance benefits under title II of the Social Security Act for December 1987, taking into account the amendments made by the Act."
