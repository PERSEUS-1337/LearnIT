    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Business Supply Chain Transparency on Trafficking and Slavery Act of 2015\". It includes findings and the sense of Congress. Congress finds that in 2014, the Department of Labor identified 136 goods from 74 countries made by forced labor and child labor. The United States, as the world's largest importer, faces increasing demands for information on human rights impact of products. Consumers lack standing to enforce provisions of the Smoot Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 in US courts. The Smoot Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 prohibits importation of goods made with forced or convict labor, with exceptions for goods not produced in sufficient quantities in the US. There have been fewer than 40 enforcement actions in the past 80 years under this provision. Federal mechanisms to prevent and punish forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor in commerce are lacking. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003 and the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2005 aim to address severe forms of trafficking in persons and commercial sex acts in Federal contracts. The worst forms of child labor in the stream of commerce face challenges due to limited scope, broad expectations, and lack of information on goods produced along tainted supply chains imported by the United States. The Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2005 criminalizes severe forms of trafficking in persons and forced labor in Federal contracts. Executive Orders 13126 and 13627 prohibit the acquisition of products produced by forced or indentured child labor. Executive Order 13627 and the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 have banned Federal contractors from engaging in trafficking-related activities such as charging labor recruitment fees, confiscating passports, and using fraudulent recruitment practices. Federal contractors, subcontractors, and their employees must adhere to anti-trafficking compliance plans, including a complaint mechanism and measures to prevent trafficking in persons. Congress recognizes forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor as severe forms of abuse for profit. The legislative framework to prevent abuse for commercial profit is inadequate in the United States. Legislation is needed to inform consumers about products free of child labor, forced labor, slavery, and human trafficking. Public disclosures can help businesses and consumers avoid supporting these practices. Consumers can prevent supporting crimes by avoiding tainted products in the supply chains. SEC. 3.
