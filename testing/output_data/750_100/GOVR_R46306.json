    "content": "In recent years, there has been interest in increasing financial support for non-degree instructional and work-based learning programs for individuals beyond high school age. These programs include apprenticeships, college certificate programs, and courses leading to professional certifications or licensure. Demand for these programs is expected to continue. There is a demand for workers in jobs that do not require a college degree but need training or postsecondary education. The percentage of jobs requiring more than a high school diploma but not a degree is increasing. Federal financial aid for postsecondary education is not accessible to many pursuing non-degree programs. Some colleges are exploring new ways to attract students, including adults seeking short non-degree programs for quick entry into the workforce or higher earnings. Congress may consider providing federal support for students in non-degree programs to meet the demand for workers with specific credentials. Proposals have emerged to increase federal support for students in non-degree programs, including expanding Pell Grants eligibility. The College Affordability Act aims to reauthorize the Higher Education Act and broaden Pell Grant eligibility for non-degree programs. The President's Council of Economic Advisers suggested options to re-skill 25- to 64-year-olds for the workforce. The President's FY2021 budget proposed expanding Pell Grants to short-term programs for retraining displaced workers and increasing economic growth. Stakeholders support extending Pell Grants to shorter duration programs. Some stakeholders have concerns about promoting non-degree programs and increasing financial support for students pursuing them. There are worries about the quality of these programs, potential high federal costs, the need for student supports and business coordination, and the risk of perpetuating income inequalities. Some stakeholders have concerns about promoting non-degree programs due to worries about program quality, high costs, lack of employer preference, and difficulties in securing employment compared to degree holders. Non-degree credential holders may face challenges in finding long-term employment, as degree holders in non-degree required positions may be displacing them. In 2018, 28% of jobs required a degree for entry-level positions, while 42% of adults had a degree. This report outlines federal programs supporting individuals in non-degree training and work-based learning programs, suggesting potential policy changes to further support training efforts. The report discusses the need for policy changes to support non-degree training and education programs. It outlines employer demand for individuals with non-degree credentials and describes various non-degree programs. Additionally, it details six federal programs and three tax benefits that provide financial support to students in non-degree programs. The report highlights gaps and limitations in financial support for individuals pursuing non-degree programs, emphasizing the importance of employer demand and the payoff of non-degree credentials. The report provides data on the proportion of total employment and mean wages earned in occupations with non-degree postsecondary credential requirements. Approximately 6.2% of jobs in the national economy in May 2018 had this entry-level education requirement. The Bureau of Labor Statistics assigns entry-level education requirements for occupations it tracks, with mean annual wages varying across education categories. However, these wages do not capture differences within categories, leading to potential earnings differentials. Postsecondary non-degree programs offer training primarily to individuals beyond typical secondary education age, aiming to prepare them for specific occupations. Research shows earnings premiums for various certificate programs, including those in technical and health fields, as well as from community colleges. Non-degree instructional programs prepare individuals for specialized jobs and general employment. Upon completion, individuals receive a postsecondary educational certificate. In non-degree instructional programs, individuals receive a postsecondary educational certificate upon completion. These programs are pursued for various reasons such as expanding knowledge and skills, preparing for further education or employment, and seeking promotion. Transfer programs and postbaccalaureate certificates are excluded from non-degree instructional programs. Non-degree instructional programs provide education for at least two academic years and are acceptable for full credit toward a bachelor's degree. They do not award a certificate or degree but are different from certifications and licenses, which are occupational credentials. Certifications and licenses show competency in an occupation and may require completion of a non-degree instructional program. Various entities offer non-degree instructional programs. Non-degree instructional programs are offered by a variety of entities including traditional postsecondary educational institutions, trade schools, businesses, and professional organizations. In fall 2018, nearly 1.9 million non-degree seeking undergraduate students were enrolled in these programs. Additionally, there are over 4,500 for-profit non-traditional postsecondary educational institutions enrolling almost 670,000 students. Non-degree instructional programs vary in length and duration, influenced by curriculum requirements, industry expectations, and skills complexity. Program duration can be affected by federal, state, and private entities, with some designed in stackable units for flexibility. Non-degree instructional programs can be broken up into stackable units for flexibility. Programs can be offered in various formats and students are responsible for funding the program costs, living expenses, and potential lost wages. The average cost for tuition and fees for popular programs in AY2018-2019 was over $9,000 at public less-than-two-year colleges and around $15,000. In non-degree instructional programs, there is a difference between credit and noncredit courses. Completing credit courses allows for transferable credits towards other programs. Credit programs are approved by accrediting entities and have stringent entrance requirements. They can lead to various vocations. Noncredit programs may offer CEUs or vocational certificates but do not provide credits towards other programs. Noncredit programs are often more affordable, cover a wider range of topics, and can be advantageous for students and educational institutions. Noncredit programs, more affordable and flexible than credit programs, cover a broader range of topics and can be quickly modified to meet industry and student needs. They may include vocational, ABE, ESL, and GED courses, catering to career entry requirements, personal enrichment, and customized training. Data on non-degree instructional programs at the national level is incomplete. The universe of non-degree instructional programs, enrollment, and completions is incomplete as some states and the federal government do not collect data on noncredit programs. A 2016 survey found that 8% of adults aged 16-65 had a postsecondary certificate. Educational institutions participating in federal student aid programs awarded almost 1 million for-credit non-degree undergraduate credentials and approximately 3 million undergraduate degrees in AY2017-2018. Work-based learning encompasses various training and educational activities. Work-based learning includes a range of training activities to develop workplace skills, such as on-the-job training, apprenticeships, internships, and more. It can cater to different career stages and forms, from youth career exploration to specialized technical training for workers. Work-based learning programs, including on-the-job training, apprenticeships, internships, and cooperative programs, often provide wages and are known as earn and learn programs. Registered Apprenticeship (RA) programs are overseen by the Department of Labor (DOL) and must meet federal regulations, including submitting a work process schedule outlining the competencies and training methods. Work-based learning programs must be reviewed every five years for compliance. If there is a persistent failure, the program may be deregistered. Various entities can offer work-based learning experiences, including employers, labor unions, and external training providers. Work-based learning programs are offered by employers, labor unions, external training providers, and educational institutions. These programs are structured to meet the needs of the employer, potential employer, or trainee. RA programs typically require 2,000 hours of supervised on-the-job training and can last from one to six years, with most programs being four years in duration. Work-based learning programs, including RA programs, typically last four years and require 2,000 hours of on-the-job training. Programs can be time-based or competency-based, with related instruction included. Costs are primarily covered by the provider, but trainees may need to cover living expenses. The costs of work-based learning programs may include lost work time, fees for trainers, and trainee wages. Trainees may need to pay for related instruction or other costs. Those not receiving remuneration must provide for their own expenses. Data on employer-provided training is limited and methodologies vary. The data on employer-provided training is limited and methodologies vary. Different government surveys in the 1990s showed that while most establishments offer some training, the percentage of workers receiving training ranged from 16% to 70%. A 2016 survey found that 21% of adults aged 16-65 had completed a work-based learning program. Among adults aged 16-65, the most common work-based learning programs completed were in healthcare and teaching. The Department of Labor reported about 633,000 active apprentices in 25,000 programs in FY2019, with 81,000 apprentices completing a program that year. The construction industry has the largest share of apprenticeships, but they are also available in manufacturing and transportation. The federal government provides financial support for individuals pursuing training and education for entry into various fields. The federal government provides support for individuals seeking training and education to enter the workforce and realize their potential. Federal programs do not exclusively focus on non-degree programs, but they offer various benefits to support training and education. The design and implementation of these programs differ, including the choice and monitoring of non-degree programs. The federal government offers support for training and education through programs like the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) Title I, federal student aid programs, federal tax benefits, and veterans educational assistance. WIOA Title I, administered by the Department of Labor, subsidizes training costs for workforce development. Federal student aid programs, under the Higher Education Act, provide grants and loans for postsecondary education. The IRS administers tax benefits for post-education financial support, while the VA offers programs like the Post-9/11 GI Bill and VET TEC for direct financial assistance to students pursuing education and training programs. Additionally, there are programs that provide training and education assistance to needy families. The report discusses living supports for needy families and education assistance programs like SNAP E&T and TANF, which aim to provide training and education opportunities for individuals at risk of educational failure. These federal programs can support students in non-degree programs. The report highlights federal programs supporting students in non-degree programs, focusing on key design elements and differences among programs. WIOA Title I under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act is the primary legislation for workforce development, administered by DOL to increase employment and earnings. Under WIOA, services aim to increase employment, earnings, and credentials of participants, improving the workforce, reducing welfare dependency, and meeting employer skill needs. The Adult and Dislocated Worker program provides grants to states for local Workforce Development Boards to use for various purposes. The WIOA program at the local level requires funds to be used for establishing a One-Stop delivery system, providing career and training services, building relationships with employers, and developing industry partnerships. Participants have consumer choice in service delivery, with adult and dislocated worker programs offering career services and training at two levels: basic and individualized. The WIOA program offers individualized services such as skills assessment and case management, allowing eligible participants to pursue training at an Eligible Training Provider of their choice. The state's Eligible Training Provider List (ETPL) provides options for customers accessing WIOA services, including institutions of higher education and other training providers. Allowable training activities supported by WIOA Title I funds include non-degree and degree programs. Training activities supported by WIOA Title I funds include non-degree and degree instructional programs, work-based learning such as OJT and customized training, for occupations in demand locally or with high growth potential. Programs must lead to an industry-recognized certificate. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) supports training programs leading to industry-recognized certificates, licenses, degrees, or employment. Local areas can allocate funds for incumbent worker training. WIOA provides universal access to career services for adults aged 18 and older, regardless of qualifying characteristics. Under WIOA, career services are available to all adults, with individualized services provided as needed to help individuals secure and maintain employment. Training eligibility requires a need for skills to achieve economic self-sufficiency, the ability to succeed in training, and a choice of training linked to local job opportunities. Under WIOA, adults can access career services tailored to their needs to secure and retain employment. Training eligibility is based on the need for skills for economic self-sufficiency, the capacity to succeed in training, and selecting training connected to local job prospects. One-Stop operators assess individuals for access to training services if they are unable to receive other grant assistance. Priority for career and training services is given to recipients of public assistance, low-income individuals, and those with basic skills deficiencies. Local Workforce Development Boards, in consultation with the state governor, determine fund allocation among these groups. Training can be provided through Individual Training Accounts (ITAs) or contracts for services. Supportive services like child care and transportation can also be funded under WIOA. Individuals eligible for training services under WIOA can choose from the ETPL with the help of a One-Stop operator. An Individual Training Account (ITA) is established for payment to the training provider, not the individual. Local Workforce Development Boards have the authority to set limits on training type, duration, and ITA amount based on individual circumstances. ITA funds can be used to support training. WIOA participants with ITAs can use funds for non-degree programs, degree programs, and related instruction. Local WDBs can also provide supportive services like transportation, child care, and housing for training participation. Training can be done through ITA or a contract for services with work-based learning. The WDB can enter into a contract with an employer or RA sponsor for occupational training for a WIOA participant in exchange for reimbursement. The contract can be used for OJT, RA, customized training, incumbent worker training, or transitional employment, based on various criteria determined by the local WDB. The local Workforce Development Board (WDB) can enter contracts with employers or RA sponsors for occupational training of WIOA participants, reimbursing up to 50% of wages in some cases. State and local WDBs may also contract with RA sponsors to reimburse up to 75% of apprentice wages. Reimbursement for wages is contract-based, not through Individual Training Accounts (ITAs). States develop the Eligible Training Provider List (ETPL), while WDBs and One-Stop operators manage training programs and payments to providers. Quality assurance of training providers is established through initial and continued eligibility processes by the governor and state Workforce Development Boards (WDBs). Training providers must apply for initial eligibility to receive funding in local workforce investment areas. RA programs are automatically eligible for funding, while non-RA providers must apply for eligibility through a procedure established by the governor and local WDB. To maintain eligibility, training providers must follow procedures set by the governor and local Workforce Development Boards (WDBs) and submit required information. WIOA allows WDBs discretion in specific factors, such as determining the length of On-the-Job Training (OJT) contracts based on various criteria. Employer eligibility for WIOA incumbent programs is also determined by the local WDB. WIOA requires local Workforce Development Boards to consider individual characteristics and training relevance for employer eligibility for funding. Providers must report program participation and outcomes every two years to the governor. RA programs are exempt from submitting ETP performance reports. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) requires reporting on various outcomes for participants, including employment rates, earnings, credential attainment, cost of attendance, and program completion rates. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) mandates reporting on outcomes for program participants, including employment rates, earnings, credential attainment, and program completion rates. States must publish annual ETP performance reports with specific information on training services provided and participant outcomes. The WIOA Title I program requires ETP performance reports to include data on participants exiting training services, average cost per participant, number of participants with barriers to employment, disaggregated by program of study, subpopulation, race, ethnicity, sex, and age. The first ETP report is pending, but some participation data is available, showing 955,094 adult participants and 469,572 dislocated workers in work-based learning in 2017. In 2017, there were 955,094 adult participants and 469,572 dislocated worker participants in the WIOA Title I program. The majority of participants were over 30 years old and unemployed or had received a layoff notice. A notable percentage had a degree. In program year 2018, fewer than 20% of participants engaged in work-based learning, while over 66% pursued skills training or upgrading. The WIOA Title I program supports adult entry or reentry into the workforce primarily by providing career services and short-term training. The most popular occupations pursued by trainees are in healthcare, transportation, material moving, computer, mathematical, office support, and management. Over 66% of participants engage in skills training or upgrading through non-degree instructional and degree programs. Increasing focus on non-degree training, additional funding for wage reimbursement and ITAs, relaxing the 20% limit on incumbent training, and eliminating restrictions on grant assistance could enhance support for non-degree education and training programs. Title IV of the Higher Education Act authorizes financial assistance programs for students at certain institutions. Grants and loans are available to qualified students and borrowers. Federal Pell Grants and federal student loans are the primary types of aid provided. The Pell Grant and Direct Loan programs, authorized under Title IV of the Higher Education Act, provide portable aid to eligible individuals for postsecondary education. These programs are not dependent on congressional appropriations and offer loans to all qualified students. The Direct Loan program is a mandatory entitlement program for budgetary purposes, ensuring access to borrowing for eligible individuals. The Pell Grant program is a quasi-entitlement that provides aid to eligible students for postsecondary education. Pell Grants and Direct Loans can be used for Title IV-eligible programs offered by participating institutions. Eligible individuals have access to borrowing in accordance with program rules. Title IV-participating IHEs, including public, private nonprofit, and proprietary institutions, must meet quality assurance criteria. Non-degree programs must lead to a recognized credential for Title IV aid eligibility, excluding noncredit programs. Non-credit programs or programs without defined credit or clock hours are generally not eligible for aid. Work-based learning programs must have the OJT portion supervised by an IHE, with less than 50% offered by an external entity. Non-degree programs have specific durational requirements for instructional time and credit/clock hours. Pell Grants are available for non-degree programs at public, private nonprofit, and proprietary vocational institutions. Non-degree programs at public, private nonprofit, and proprietary vocational institutions have specific durational requirements for instructional time and credit/clock hours. Programs must be at least 10 weeks long with 300-599 clock hours for the Direct Loan program. Students must be enrolled at least half-time in an eligible program to borrow through the Direct Loan program. Non-degree programs at public and private nonprofit institutions must be at least one academic year in length to be eligible for Pell Grant and Direct Loan programs. Students must be enrolled in a Title IV-eligible program to receive federal financial aid. To be eligible for Pell Grants or Direct Loan program loans, students must be U.S. citizens, nationals, legal permanent residents, or specified eligible noncitizens with a high school diploma or equivalent. Pell Grant recipients must be enrolled in an undergraduate program, not have completed a bachelor's degree, and demonstrate financial need. To be eligible for Pell Grants or Direct Loan program loans, students must be U.S. citizens, nationals, legal permanent residents, or specified eligible noncitizens with a high school diploma or equivalent. Pell Grant recipients must be enrolled in an undergraduate program, not have completed a bachelor's degree, and demonstrate financial need. Recipients are subject to a lifetime cap of 12 full-time semesters for Pell Grant aid. Direct Loan program loans have specific criteria including enrollment on at least a half-time basis and additional eligibility requirements for different loan types. The primary loans include Direct Subsidized Loans for undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. Direct Subsidized Loans for undergraduate students with financial need, Direct Unsubsidized Loans for all students, and PLUS Loans for parents and graduate students. New borrowers after July 1, 2013, limited to 150% of program length. Title IV aid amount based on statutory rules, cannot exceed cost of attendance. The Pell Grant award amount is determined based on a student's cost of attendance (COA), which includes tuition, fees, books, supplies, room and board, transportation, and dependent care expenses. The grant is awarded without considering other financial assistance. Annual appropriations and the Higher Education Act establish the maximum Pell Grant amount a student can receive in an academic year. The maximum Pell Grant award for AY 2020-2021 is $6,345 for full-time students in a 26-30 week academic year. Award amount may vary based on COA, financial need, enrollment rate, or program duration. Pell Grants for non-degree programs are taxable, while those for degree programs are taxable if used for non-tuition purposes. Direct Loan program rules differ by loan type, and various factors can impact aid eligibility. The Direct Loan program has specific rules regarding the amount of aid awarded, taking into account other types of financial assistance received. Award limits are based on dependency status and class level, with maximum amounts set accordingly. Direct Unsubsidized Loans for first-year undergraduate students are capped at $5,500 for dependent students and $9,500 for independent students. The maximum loan amount is adjusted for students in programs shorter than a full academic year. The Office of Federal Student Aid administers Title IV aid programs, with various entities handling administrative tasks. High-level functions in program administration are carried out by FSA. IHEs are responsible for day-to-day functions related to awarding and disbursing Title IV aid to students. This includes verifying eligibility, calculating aid amounts, disbursing funds, and managing program funds. ED provides funds to IHEs for this purpose and also pays them an administrative cost allowance under the Pell Grant program. The program integrity triad of state authorization, accreditation, and ED certification ensures quality in Title IV-eligible programs. State authorization provides consumer protection, accreditation ensures quality assurance, and ED certification oversees compliance. Non-degree programs must also meet these requirements. Non-degree programs must meet the program integrity triad requirements, including state authorization, accreditation, and ED certification for Title IV eligibility. Gainful employment requirements may also apply. State approval and licensure requirements vary among states for postsecondary education institutions participating in Title IV programs. To participate in Title IV programs, an IHE must be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by ED as reliable. States have varying requirements for approving IHEs and their educational programs, including evaluating program curricula, objectives, enrollment projections, student outcomes, and program need justification. Some states also require programmatic accreditation or approval by another state agency. Accreditation by a recognized agency is necessary for IHEs to participate in Title IV programs. Regional or national accreditors evaluate if the IHE meets criteria set by the accrediting agency. Criteria include faculty, curricula, and facilities evaluation. Accrediting agencies regularly evaluate an IHE's faculty, curricula, facilities, student support services, and student achievement in relation to the institution's mission. Programmatic accreditation is not required for Title IV purposes but may be sought for employer and licensure requirements. To gain programmatic accreditation, an educational program offered by an IHE is evaluated on established standards for the particular field of study. When seeking Title IV participation, an IHE must apply for certification from ED, which reviews each program to ensure eligibility requirements are met, including durational requirements and clock-hour programs for Direct Loan eligibility. Programs eligible for the Direct Loan program must have completion and placement rates of at least 70%. IHEs can self-certify new programs as Title IV eligible or submit an application for approval. Non-degree programs must prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation, as per the HEA. The 2014 GE regulations, which defined gainful employment, were rescinded in 2019. The 2014 GE regulations, intended to measure program quality through debt-to-earnings rates, were rescinded in 2019. Programs failing to meet standards risk Title IV ineligibility for three years, but no program has lost eligibility yet. The Higher Education Act (HEA) requires education programs subject to Gainful Employment (GE) rules to meet third-party standards and educational prerequisites for professional licensure. Title IV participating institutions must report enrollment information but measures of performance are not defined. No program has lost Title IV eligibility under the requirements yet. The Higher Education Act (HEA) mandates Title IV participating institutions to report enrollment data and other relevant information. In AY2017-2018, 4,618 out of 6,418 IHEs offered non-degree for-credit programs, with private for-profit IHEs accounting for half of these programs. In AY2015-2016, 765,000 Pell Grant recipients pursued non-degree credit programs, receiving $2.7 billion in Pell Grant awards. 10% of undergraduates with Direct Loans were in certificate programs, but support for non-degree programs is limited. Support for work-based learning in non-degree programs at Title IV-participating IHEs is limited to programs leading to a certificate or degree. Some students, such as those without a high school diploma or enrolled less than half-time, may not be eligible for Pell Grants or Direct Loans. Non-degree program quality varies and is primarily assessed. Non-degree program quality is primarily assessed through the program integrity triad, with state authorizers and accreditors having flexibility in determining criteria. Variation among state authorization requirements complicates assessing institutional experiences with state authorization. State history, resources, and priorities influence the extent to which a state chooses to take a more stringent approach. State history, resources, and priorities may influence the state's level of involvement in evaluating non-degree programs. Potential weaknesses in state authorization requirements include concerns about oversight by state boards, input requirements hindering innovative education models, and lengthy approval processes. The state's involvement in evaluating non-degree programs may be influenced by its history, resources, and priorities. Weaknesses in state authorization requirements include oversight concerns, input requirements hindering innovation, conflicts in state laws for institutions offering programs in multiple states, and few states basing authorization renewal decisions on student outcomes. Institutional accreditors tailor peer reviews based on school type and mission, as identified in a 2014 GAO report on accreditation system strengths and weaknesses. Accreditors customize peer reviews based on school type and mission, with programmatic accreditation aligned to specific fields. Weaknesses identified by GAO include conflicts of interest, limited resources, difficulty assessing innovative education methods, and challenges in measuring academic quality. Education tax benefits, administered by the IRS, help offset higher education costs for eligible taxpayers. Education tax benefits provide advantages to upper middle income taxpayers and are claimed when filing federal income tax returns. Taxpayers receive the benefit after paying for education expenses, sometimes months later. Some benefits are only available to individuals in degree programs, while others have broad eligibility rules. Education tax benefits reduce federal revenues and are not subject to annual appropriations. Eligibility rules for these benefits are broad enough to include individuals in non-degree programs. Taxpayers can receive these benefits when filing their federal income tax return, potentially leading to overconsumption of education or subsidizing education that would have occurred anyway. The Lifetime Learning Credit and Employer Provided Educational Assistance are tax incentives available to taxpayers pursuing education. The Lifetime Learning Credit offers a nonrefundable tax credit for qualifying expenses, while Employer Provided Educational Assistance excludes educational costs from taxable income. Additionally, 529 accounts help families save for future educational expenses. 529 accounts and the Lifetime Learning Credit can be used for eligible education expenses at Title IV-eligible IHEs for non-degree programs. Employer provided educational assistance may cover a broader range of non-degree programs. Qualified education expenses for the credit include tuition, books, supplies, and equipment required for enrollment, excluding living expenses. The Lifetime Learning Credit can be used for tuition, fees, books, supplies, and equipment for post-secondary degree programs or courses to improve job skills. Employer provided educational assistance can also cover expenses related to instruction or training for skill development. According to IRS Publication 970, employer-provided educational assistance can cover expenses for courses to improve skills, up to $5,250, without being included in the employee's wage income. Tax-free withdrawals from 529 accounts are allowed for qualified expenses at Title IV-eligible institutions. Taxpayers can claim tax credits for qualified education expenses paid for themselves, spouses, or dependent children if they file a federal income tax return or are claimed as dependents. Certain eligibility criteria apply, such as not filing as married filing separately, being a nonresident alien, or having an income over $68,000. Participants can use the Lifetime Learning Credit (LLC) for qualified educational expenses if their employer offers an educational assistance program. Beneficiaries of a 529 account are designated at its establishment and funds can be transferred to another 529 account for certain relatives. The LLC, calculated as 20% of the first $10,000 of qualified expenses, is claimed when filing federal income tax returns. Qualified educational expenses from a 529 account or employer are tax-free. The Lifetime Learning Credit (LLC) is calculated as 20% of the first $10,000 of qualified education expenses, with a maximum credit of $2,000 per taxpayer. The credit phases out for taxpayers with income between $58,000 and $68,000 ($116,000 and $136,000 for married joint filers) in 2019. The LLC is nonrefundable, meaning it cannot exceed the taxpayer's federal income tax liability. Low-income taxpayers may receive little to no benefit from this credit. Employers can provide up to $5,250 in educational assistance to employees. Taxpayers can withdraw funds from their 529 accounts tax-free to pay for qualifying education expenses, employers can provide up to $5,250 in tax-free tuition assistance per year, and the LLC offers a maximum credit of $2,000 per taxpayer for qualified education expenses. Taxpayers can apply for the LLC by filing their federal income tax return and Form 8863 to claim education tax credits. They do not need to specify the course or program of study they are enrolled in. Employers must have a written educational assistance program to qualify for tax benefits. They can request IRS determination on program qualification. Discrimination in favor of certain employees is not allowed. Employees eligible for educational assistance programs must be given reasonable notice of its terms and availability. States typically sponsor 529 plans, allowing individuals to establish accounts for beneficiaries. Withdrawals from a 529 plan result in a Form 1099-Q showing total amount withdrawn and investment breakdown. Taxpayers must be aware that withdrawals from a 529 plan for non-eligible expenses may be subject to taxation without documentation required on how the funds were spent. The IRS does not have specific rules on the quality of education programs for tax benefits, and audits are rare, with only 0.5% of taxpayers audited in 2018. The IRS does not collect or publish performance measures for non-degree programs. In 2015, 2.5 million taxpayers claimed $2.1 billion of the LLC tax credit, with an average credit of $830 per taxpayer. Half of the LLC dollars were claimed by taxpayers with AGI between $50,000 and $200,000. Taxpayers with AGI below $15,000 or over $200,000 generally did not claim the LLC due to its nonrefundability and phase-out. No studies have evaluated the impact of the LLC on enrollment in non-degree programs. The impact of the LLC on enrollment in non-degree programs or its effectiveness in helping candidates improve job skills has not been evaluated. Data on employer provided educational assistance and 529 plans are unavailable. Survey data shows few families have 529 accounts, with those who do having higher assets and income. The impact of 529 plans on enrollment in non-degree programs or their effectiveness in improving job skills has not been evaluated. Research on education tax benefits has shown limited effect on increasing enrollment, highlighting limitations such as delayed assistance for upfront education costs. The education tax benefits discussed in this report may be confusing for taxpayers to determine eligibility and which benefits provide the largest tax savings. These benefits only help taxpayers with income tax liabilities, excluding many low-income taxpayers. Veterans education programs (GI Bills) were originally intended to aid former servicemembers in transitioning to civilian life. The benefits of veterans education programs have evolved over the years to include compensation for compulsory service, encourage voluntary service, avoid veteran unemployment, provide equitable benefits, and promote military retention. The VET TEC program incentivizes training providers for program completion and employment, offering financial assistance to eligible students based on their service in the uniformed services. The GI Bills and VET TEC are programs administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs to support students in approved education and training programs. The Post-9/11 GI Bill has been the primary program, representing over 80% of total participation and spending since FY2013. The Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits support education through degree pursuit, training, and non-degree instructional programs at various establishments. Eligible programs include credit and noncredit courses, OJT, apprenticeships, and courses leading to specific objectives. VET TEC benefits offer non-degree high-technology programs of education at contracted training providers, focusing on computer programming, software, media application, data processing, and information science. Training providers must meet criteria such as not offering degrees and adhering to annual VA caps on tuition and fees. The VET TEC program offers non-degree high-technology education programs at training providers that meet specific criteria, including not offering degrees and adhering to VA caps on tuition and fees. Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits are available to eligible servicemembers, veterans, and their families, with eligibility based on active duty service requirements. Transfer of benefits to family members is possible, and spouses and children of servicemembers who die in the line of duty are also eligible. VET TEC is available to GI Bill-eligible veterans enrolled in a VET TEC-eligible program. Participants may receive living stipends and program cost payments. Counseling is also offered to help individuals with their career paths and VA benefits utilization. The Post-9/11 GI Bill offers educational assistance payments over 36 months, with options for benefit transfers. Different payment amounts and eligibility criteria depend on factors like benefit level, type of program, enrollment rate, charges, and tuition location. The Post-9/11 GI Bill provides educational assistance payments based on qualifying active duty service or eligibility characteristics. Payments cover tuition, fees, housing allowance, books and supplies stipend, tutorial assistance, and test fees reimbursement. In AY2019-2020, veterans enrolled in educational programs may receive tuition and fees up to $24,476.79, housing allowance between $800 and $4,300 monthly, and $1,000 for books and supplies. Veterans in OJT or apprenticeship receive decreasing housing allowance and may not receive tuition benefit if none is charged. Payments are provided to veterans under VET TEC for training. Under VET TEC, veterans receive payments while enrolled full-time in training programs. The VA reimburses training providers for tuition and fees, paying 25% upon enrollment, 25% upon completion, and 50% upon employment in a suitable field. Participants apply to the VA for eligibility and cannot be charged directly for tuition and fees. Eligible individuals can enroll in approved programs under the Post-9/11 GI Bill or VET TEC. Educational institutions certify enrollment to the VA, which verifies eligibility and distributes payments. Program quality is overseen by state approving agencies and the VA. The VA and state approving agencies oversee program quality for VET TEC programs, with a focus on participant employment outcomes. They share responsibility for ongoing oversight and ensure proper administration of GI Bill benefits through contracts or agreements. Quality standards are established for educational programs, institutions, and training establishments. Quality standards for educational programs are overseen by the VA and state approving agencies, focusing on participant employment outcomes. Four main standards include program objective, independent study restrictions, the 85-15 rule, and contractual arrangement restrictions. The program objective must not be avocational, recreational, or personal development. Independent study programs must be accredited and lead to a degree or certificate meeting specified criteria. The 85-15 rule limits the percentage of students enrolled in a program. Under the 85-15 rule, no more than 85% of students in an educational program can have tuition covered by institutional aid or GI Bill. Programs offered through contractual agreements must have approved courses for GI Bill purposes. Non-degree programs must meet specific standards for facilities, instructors, and curricula. Programs preparing individuals for state licensure have additional requirements. Programs preparing individuals for state licensure or certification must meet recognized standards. Non-degree programs approved by government agencies include FAA flight training, DOL Registered Apprenticeships, and state-approved apprenticeships. Additional standards for faculty and instructional requirements apply. The VA determines eligibility for VET TEC based on standards such as faculty qualifications and curriculum alignment. The payment structure of the program ensures quality and value by reimbursing providers when veterans complete the program and secure meaningful employment within 180 days. The VET TEC program requires training providers to be licensed and approved, meet the 85-15 rule, and offer non self-paced programs. The VA must report annually on the outcomes of Post-9/11 GI Bill participants to assess program effectiveness. Performance measures include program admittance rate and job placement. The VET TEC program performance measures include program admittance rate, job placement and retention rates, percentage of program completers employed in field of study, median annual salary, and transfer rates. GI Bill participants can pursue training in non-degree programs, with 9% pursuing educational certificates in 2013. In 2013, 9% of GI Bill participants pursued educational certificates, while 81% pursued degrees. In FY2018, 0.4% of Post-9/11 GI Bill participants were in OJT or apprenticeship programs. Over 18,000 school locations did not award degrees, with 37% being private for-profit, 37% public, and 27% private nonprofit schools. The most popular certificates completed were in welding. The popular certificates completed by Post-9/11 GI Bill participants in AY2018-2019 were in welding, information technology, HVAC, healthcare, and gunsmithing. Program eligibility is limited to military personnel and their families. Concerns have been raised about the oversight process for program quality. The oversight process for the Post-9/11 GI Bill program may limit thorough oversight, as highlighted in a 2018 VA OIG report. The program provides benefits for eligible low-income households through SNAP, administered by the Department of Agriculture. States receive federal funding for SNAP Employment & Training programs in addition to food benefits. The government provides SNAP Employment & Training funding to states to offer employment and education services for SNAP participants, with the goal of increasing their ability to obtain regular employment. This program was established by Congress in 1987 to meet SNAP's work-related requirements for nondisabled adults ages 18 to 59. SNAP's work-related requirements apply to nondisabled adults aged 18 to 59. State agencies administering SNAP must have a SNAP E&T program, which can be mandatory or voluntary. Most states operate voluntary E&T programs, offering job search programs, training, and workfare. SNAP E&T programs include job search programs, training, workfare, work experience, education, self-employment training, and WIOA services. Funding includes $124 million without a state match and federal matching for administrative expenses and dependent care. Total funding varies based on states' use of matching funds. Since October 2015, USDA-FNS and Seattle Jobs Initiative have been operating SNAP to Skills, a project providing technical assistance and resources to enhance SNAP E&T programs in states. The project aims to address the need for education beyond high school and integrates with the WIOA Title I program. The SNAP E&T program is delivered through the statewide workforce development system, with services available at WIOA One-Stop centers. SNAP staff are experienced in addressing challenges like low basic skills, housing instability, and mental health issues. States offer varying services, and SNAP E&T programs can provide education activities to improve employability. The SNAP E&T program offers educational programs to enhance job search abilities and employability. Activities may include high school programs, literacy education, and English as a second language instruction. These educational components must directly improve participants' employability and have a clear link to job readiness for approval. The goal is to help SNAP participants quickly transition into employment. SNAP E&T program provides education and training opportunities for participants to enhance job search abilities and employability. Activities offered include vocational training, basic education, work experience, apprenticeships, subsidized employment, and unpaid internships. States may target services to specific populations within SNAP. Participants must meet income eligibility and other nonfinancial rules to participate in SNAP. SNAP households must meet income and nonfinancial rules to qualify. Gross monthly income must be at or below 130% of the federal poverty level, and net monthly income must be at or below 100%. Work requirements are in place for non-disabled adults. The SNAP work registrant population must register for work, accept a job if offered, and maintain at least 30 hours of work per week. States can design their SNAP E&T programs to focus on a subset of this population and may make E&T mandatory. The process of assigning individuals to E&T programs varies, with USDA guidance requiring assessment to determine the most effective components for each participant. The 2018 farm bill requires states to include case management services in their assessment tools for SNAP. E&T funds cannot be used for TANF recipients, and some individuals enrolled half-time or more in an IHE may be ineligible for SNAP. The SNAP E&T program provides educational programs and funds associated costs, such as dependent care and transportation. Funding is administered by state agencies and contracted programs, often through partnerships. USDA-FNS promotes third-party partnerships as a model for SNAP E&T development. Third-party partnerships are promoted as a model for developing SNAP E&T programs. States collaborate with entities like community colleges, which contribute financially or in-kind. Federal funds are drawn down for reimbursement, with funding varying from 100% to a 50% match. Pell Grant-eligible students must use the Pell Grant as the primary payer for college expenses, with E&T benefits covering the remaining costs. The SNAP E&T program is designed by states to cover college expenses not paid by the Pell Grant, with associated expenses needing to be reasonable and necessary. Workforce partnerships, including private employers and training providers, offer training and work experience, with components like OJT and apprenticeships included. The program must adhere to federal rules but allows for state customization. Each state designs its own SNAP E&T program within federal guidelines and must obtain USDA-FNS approval. State programs vary in capacity and services offered. Changes from the 2018 farm bill require consultation with state workforce development boards or private employers. Participants learn about programs through the SNAP state agency or partner referrals. The 2014 farm bill required USDA to establish a performance indicators reporting process for SNAP E&T programs. USDA has not yet published a compilation of the reports. The national reporting measures include unsubsidized employment and median quarterly wages after completion of participation. The majority of SNAP E&T participants received services other than education, with 38 out of 53 state agencies offering an education component in their programs. In FY2016, almost 70,000 SNAP participants were served in the education components of their programs. In FY2016, SNAP E&T participation data showed varying participant numbers by state, with some serving fewer than 100 while others served nearly 100,000. Less than 10% of participants engage in education components, and information on program quality and employment outcomes is lacking. Future guidance may come from an evaluation on 2014 farm bill pilot projects. The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families block grant aims to provide assistance to needy families with children, promote work and marriage, reduce out-of-wedlock pregnancies, and support two-parent families. Wages earned through SNAP E&T may increase household income, potentially reducing eligibility for SNAP and SNAP E&T. Subsequent employment outcomes for SNAP E&T participants are not available. States have flexibility in using TANF block grants to achieve its purpose, administered by HHS. TANF is a broad-purpose block grant providing assistance to needy families, primarily single mothers, in the form of cash or vouchers. Funds can also support various benefits and services. TANF funds can be used for basic needs, subsidized employment, and career pathways. Some states have used TANF funds to support career pathways, providing education programs and support services for advancement in chosen career paths. This includes programs with coordinators paid with TANF funds, working at community colleges to recruit students and provide support services. The TANF program supports career pathways by providing education programs and support services for low-income families with children. States have flexibility in determining eligible vocational educational training programs. Financial eligibility rules are set by the state of residence. Financial eligibility rules for TANF vary by state, with over one-third of recipients having less than a high school education. TANF funds state assistance programs for needy families with children, as determined by state legislatures. TANF funds state assistance programs for needy families with children, as determined by state legislatures. States set eligibility rules, benefit amounts, and required activities for adult recipients. Benefits may be reduced or ended if recipients refuse to participate in required activities like training and education. TANF also provides funding for various support services other than cash assistance. TANF funds support services such as advising, career planning, and employment services at the state and local level. States determine which participants receive these services, and some may refer recipients to WIOA One Stop Centers for education or employment. Training and education programs' quality is not federally regulated, but states may establish their own standards. The TANF program requires states to meet a minimum work participation rate, with rules limiting training and education activities. \"Vocational educational training\" is limited to 12 months in a lifetime, and obtaining a GED may not count towards the standard unless in a related work activity for a minimum number of hours per week. States can establish their own standards for the quality of training and education programs. The TANF program allows states to meet work participation rates by reducing cash assistance caseloads. Limited data exists on TANF participation in training and education. Child care and educational barriers hinder TANF recipients from enrolling in non-degree programs. TANF recipients are mostly single mothers with young children. States can use TANF funds for child care assistance. The cash assistance caseload is educationally disadvantaged. Lifetime limits on vocational training may restrict program choices. The TANF program has a 12-month limit on vocational training, potentially restricting program choices. Income eligibility for assistance may be exceeded in apprenticeship programs. The quality of training and education programs is uncertain."
