    "content": "Economics is the study of efficient resource use and trade for mutual enrichment. Countries can benefit from trade by producing efficiently and trading for goods produced less efficiently, leading to higher consumption levels. Importing goods can boost consumer welfare, and the United States imports for various reasons. The United States imports goods for various reasons, including accessing a greater variety of products at lower costs. Many imports contain U.S.-made components or raw materials. Trade improves consumer purchasing power, especially for lower-income households. Trade allows producers to access lower-cost inputs and overseas markets, leading to increased global competitiveness, economies of scale, and innovation. Economist David Ricardo's concept of comparative advantage supports this idea. Economist David Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage explains how countries benefit from specialization and trade, even if one country is more efficient in producing all goods. Ricardo argued that absolute advantage is less relevant than comparative advantage in determining trade relationships due to immobile resources between countries. The theory of comparative advantage, proposed by economist David Ricardo, emphasizes the importance of opportunity cost in determining specialization and trade. Countries can benefit from trading goods they produce relatively well (comparative advantage) for goods they produce less efficiently (comparative disadvantage). Subsequent economic theories have further developed and refined this concept. The theory of comparative advantage, proposed by economist David Ricardo, emphasizes opportunity cost in specialization and trade. Economists study how comparative advantage explains trade patterns in the 21st century with global value chains, services, digital trade, and technology flows. Differences in comparative advantage between countries stem from factors like labor, capital, human capital, and technology. The theory of comparative advantage, proposed by economist David Ricardo, explains how countries have a comparative advantage in activities that use their abundant factors of production. For example, the United States has a relative abundance of high-skilled labor, leading to a comparative advantage in producing goods like aircraft. Technology also plays a role in determining comparative advantage among countries. The ICT revolution and digital trade have reduced barriers to technology and knowledge-flows across countries, potentially influencing comparative advantage. Governments can shape comparative advantage through policies that indirectly nurture it or directly support specific industries, known as industrial policy. Indirect policies include combating corruption, enforcing property rights, liberalizing trade, and improving infrastructure. Industrial policy involves implementing measures to liberalize trade and foreign investment barriers, improve infrastructure, and support mass education. Direct influence can include policies like subsidies or tariffs to protect strategic industries. There is debate on the effectiveness of such targeted policies, with concerns about potential distortions in trade and investment flows and reduced economic efficiency. Intra-industry trade between advanced economies suggests trade based on economies of scale or increasing returns to scale, rather than just comparative advantage. Trade between countries is driven by economies of scale, leading to specialization in producing certain goods. This specialization impacts employment, wages, income distribution, and overall standard of living positively. Trade overall has a net positive effect on a country's economic well-being, leading to benefits such as more efficient resource use, greater competition, economies of scale, and consumption gains. Increases in trade can boost GDP, efficiency, and consumer welfare. Liberalizing trade globally has reduced extreme poverty by half in the past 25 years, but benefits are not evenly distributed within an economy, with some sectors facing disruption and costs like job losses. Trade can disrupt certain sectors, leading to job losses and stagnant wages in specific regions and import-sensitive industries. While the overall economic impact of trade on jobs and wages is debated, economists suggest that economy-wide gains from trade usually outweigh the costs. The challenge lies in implementing policies that help those affected by trade while still reaping the benefits. Market forces, including trade, are economically less costly than protective policies that insulate workers and industries from trade and competition. Adjustment assistance for displaced workers is crucial for maintaining political support for free trade. Existing policies in the United States to help communities affected by trade are deemed inadequate. Trade creates and destroys jobs, known as \"job churn,\" similar to technological change. Trade can impact workers in different occupations. Trade can have different effects on workers in different occupations, known as \"occupational exposure\" to trade. Job shifts occur within and between industries due to trade liberalization, leading to a change in employment composition without necessarily causing a net loss of jobs. Job loss attributed to trade is minimal. Estimates suggest that job loss due to trade is minimal, accounting for a small share of jobs lost economy-wide each year. Between 2001 and 2016, more than 150,000 U.S. net jobs were lost annually due to expanded trade in manufactured goods, representing 1% of workers laid off in a typical year. While some jobs may be displaced, workers are likely to be reemployed elsewhere. However, the short-run costs to workers switching occupations or industries due to trade liberalization may be substantial, including reduced wages. Increased import competition from China has particularly negatively affected U.S. workers. Studies suggest that increased import competition from China negatively affected U.S. local labor markets and manufacturing jobs. Most economists argue that equating net imports with unemployment is questionable. Historically, U.S. global trade has expanded during economic growth, with the trade deficit and unemployment rate moving in tandem. GDP growth reduces unemployment while increasing demand for imports and attracting capital inflows. International trade can impact wages of U.S. workers and income inequality. Studies show no consensus on the effect of trade agreements on wages, with technological change having a larger impact. Trade tends to increase returns for capital and high-skilled workers. Trade tends to increase returns for capital and high-skilled workers in the United States, while decreasing returns for low-skilled labor. A large increase in imports, especially from countries like China with abundant low-skilled labor, could negatively impact wages of low-skilled U.S. workers in import-sensitive industries. U.S. low-skilled workers face competition from lower-cost producers in developing countries, as some U.S. multinational corporations shift production to take advantage of global value chains. The growth of global value chains has led some U.S. multinational corporations to shift production overseas, while others keep high-end services in the United States. U.S. workers in export-oriented industries earn more than those in non-exporting industries, with an average earnings premium of 16% in export-intensive manufacturing and 15.5% in services. Economic globalization refers to the increasing integration of national economies worldwide. Globalization involves the integration of national economies through trade, financial flows, technology transfer, and labor migration. Experts note periods of both globalization and deglobalization. The most recent period of economic globalization began after World War II, with global trade as a percentage of global GDP increasing from 25% to 57% between 1960 and 2017. Global trade as a percentage of global GDP increased from 25% to 57% between 1960 and 2017. Foreign direct investment (FDI) also grew significantly during this period, from 6% of global GDP in 1980 to 39% in 2017. The integration of the world economy has been aided by advancements in transport and communication, reducing barriers to international exchange. Domestic and multilateral policies have further lowered barriers such as tariffs and quotas since World War II. Globalization has reduced barriers to international exchange since World War II, including tariffs, quotas, subsidies, immigration regulations, and capital controls. Economists debate whether economic integration has been inclusive and contributed to inequality within countries. Global value chains (GVCs) organized by multinational corporations (MNCs) involve assembling parts from multiple countries to create products for consumers. Global value chains (GVCs) involve assembling parts and components from multiple countries to create products, with more than half of global manufacturing imports being intermediate goods within supply chains. Over 75% of global services imports are intermediate services. The foreign value-added share in U.S. exports increased in most industries from 1995 to 2011, indicating the importance of GVCs in driving globalization. Global value chains (GVCs) have been a key driver of globalization, facilitating lower trade barriers and technological advances. They have blurred the distinction between domestic and foreign activities, making it challenging to determine who benefits from global trade. Global value chains (GVCs) have blurred the distinction between domestic and foreign activities, making it difficult to determine who benefits from global trade. Trade in intermediates has made imports essential for exports, leading to interconnected policies affecting both imports and exports. Analysts predict shifts in GVCs will shape future globalization and policy challenges, with foreign direct investment (FDI) playing a significant role in driving trade. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) supports global value chains by allowing residents of one country to obtain lasting interests in businesses in other countries. This has led to increased trade within multinational corporations, where components are sent between locations to create final products. FDI has facilitated the growth of inter- and intra-firm trade, involving parent companies, foreign affiliates, and affiliates of foreign firms. In 2016, 11% of sales from U.S. foreign affiliates went to U.S. parent companies, while 59% went to the host country's market and 30% to other foreign countries. U.S. firms invest abroad to sell goods and services to foreign markets and to understand local preferences. Greater global integration through trade and investment flows can disrupt markets, leading to concerns about offshoring and outsourcing. Foreign firms may invest in the United States to access the consumer market and high-skilled labor. Some U.S. multinational corporations focus on establishing operations abroad for various reasons. Some U.S. multinational corporations outsource production to countries with lower labor costs, focusing on high-end activities like research and development. Globalization and trade liberalization may not impact overall U.S. employment rate, but could lead to greater income and employment volatility. Shifting manufacturing assembly abroad may reduce U.S. manufacturing jobs but increase service-related jobs. The impact of globalization on wealth distribution includes dampening wages for lower-skilled U.S. workers due to foreign competition and higher returns to capital. Studies show that at least 10% of the decline in labor share in advanced economies is attributed to increasing globalization, delocalization of production, and import competition from low labor cost countries. Globalization has marginally contributed to rising U.S. wage inequality by 10% to 20%. Most-favored-nation treatment (MFN) in the World Trade Organization requires equal trade benefits to all member countries. Most-favored-nation treatment in the World Trade Organization requires equal trade benefits to all member countries, with exceptions for trade agreements and special treatment for developing nations. National treatment ensures nondiscrimination between domestic and foreign products. Most-favored nation (MFN) trade status ensures equal treatment of imported products, services, and intellectual property rights. Countries with permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) receive nondiscriminatory treatment, while those without face higher duty rates. Cuba and North Korea do not have PNTR with the United States. Countries with NTR status receive lower duty rates compared to imports from countries without that status. The Trade Act of 1974 prohibits granting PNTR status to countries not receiving such treatment at the time of the law's enactment. The Jackson-Vanik amendment further denies PNTR status to countries restricting freedom of emigration. As a WTO member, the US must extend MFN treatment to all WTO members immediately. PNTR had to be granted to countries like China, Vietnam, and Russia upon their accession to the WTO. The Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) determines tariffs on imported goods using a structure of tariff classification developed by the World Customs Organization. It groups 1,200 product headings into 96 chapters, with each heading further divided into subheadings at the four-digit and six-digit levels. The Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) categorizes goods into 1,200 product headings across 96 chapters. Each heading is further divided into subheadings at the four-digit and six-digit levels, with detailed descriptions. The HTSUS uses HS codes up to the 6-digit level, with the U.S. further subdividing into 8-digit and 10-digit tariff lines unique to the country. The U.S. International Trade Commission maintains and updates the HTS. The U.S. International Trade Commission publishes and updates the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). U.S. Customs and Border Protection enforces the tariff code. Rules of origin (ROO) determine product nationality for imports, impacting duty rates and trade program eligibility. Determining origin can be complex in the global economy. In the global economy, rules of origin (ROO) determine product nationality for imports, impacting duty rates and trade program eligibility. The United States negotiates different ROO within its FTAs to ensure only eligible trading partners receive tariff benefits. The \"yarn-forward\" rule in apparel requires yarn and fabric to come from FTA partners, limiting the impact of liberalized trade on import-sensitive industries. Some argue this rule is strict compared to rules negotiated by other countries. The \"yarn-forward\" rule in apparel is strict compared to rules negotiated by other countries, but it is crucial for the survival of the U.S. industry. Global trade is vital for the global economy, with trade as a share of global GDP rising from 25% in 1960 to about 57% in 2017. Trade openness and reforms have led to higher growth in productivity, real incomes, and reduced poverty worldwide. Annual real global trade growth has historically outpaced GDP growth, but this trend has slowed in recent years due to the global economy recovering from the 2008 financial crisis. Trade growth slowed in 2016, attributed to weak import demand, exchange rate fluctuations, and falling commodity prices. Factors like investment slowdown and China's shift to a consumption-driven economy also played a role. However, trade growth rebounded in 2017, driven by increased investment and consumption expenditure, reaching the strongest rate since 2011. The IMF and WTO projected a rebound in trade growth for 2018 and 2019, but global trade growth is now expected to slow due to rising trade tensions between major economies like the United States and China. Restrictive trade policy measures imposed by the United States and its trading partners are affecting trade flows and prices in targeted sectors, leading to concerns over disruptions to supply chains and investment plans. In 2017, the top-five largest trading economies were the United States, China, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom. The EU would be the largest trading economy if its 28 members are treated as a single bloc. China was the largest exporter, while the United States was the largest importer. The US was the largest importer and second-largest exporter in goods trade, and the largest in services trade. The United States is a major global trader, with a share of global goods exports falling from 15% in 1960 to 9% in 2017. In services trade, the US is the largest importer and exporter, with a 14% share of global services exports. In 2017, US exports and imports of goods and services combined were equivalent to 27% of GDP. Despite being a major global trader, the size of trade relative to the US economy is smaller compared to other major trading economies. Various organizations have developed indexes to assess the \"openness\" or \"competitiveness\" of the US economy. The United States ranked first in the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index. In 2017, U.S. exports totaled $2.4 trillion and imports totaled $2.9 trillion, with exports growing over 40% and imports over 20% in the past decade. Trade relative to GDP has increased significantly since 1960, with exports as a percent of GDP rising from 5% to 12% and imports from 4% to 15% in 2017. China was the top U.S. trading partner in 2017, with $712 billion in total goods traded. In 2017, China was the top U.S. trading partner with $712 billion in total goods and services trade, followed by Canada, Mexico, Japan, and Germany. The EU is the largest export destination and source of imports for the United States. About 65% of U.S. global trade is with countries without a free trade agreement. Multinational corporations (MNCs) produce worldwide using inputs from many countries, leading to complex global value chains. Traditional trade statistics do not fully capture the source of resources used in production or who benefits from trade. For example, products like iPhones by U.S. firm Apple are developed in the U.S. but assembled elsewhere. Apple's products, like iPhones, are developed in the United States but assembled in China using components from various countries. The full value of imports from China is attributed to China, even though the value added there is minimal. Most of Apple's high-wage functions and employment, such as design, software development, and marketing, occur in the United States. This results in U.S. imports from China actually comprising imports from multiple countries, with China receiving credit for the full value of the final product. The \"trade deficit\" between the U.S. and China is inflated due to the way imports are attributed. The TiVA initiative aims to identify the origin of value added in goods and services. If measured this way, the U.S. trade deficit with China would have been reduced by one-third in 2011. The trade balance is the difference between a country's exports and imports of goods and services, leading to a deficit when imports exceed exports. The United States has consistently run trade deficits post-WWII, with a global trade deficit of $552.3 billion in 2017 driven by goods trade. In 2017, the United States had a trade deficit of $552.3 billion, driven by goods trade. The U.S. trade deficit in goods was $807.5 billion, while the services trade surplus was $255.2 billion. The current account deficit since the mid-1970s was $449.1 billion. The United States has had an annual current account deficit since the mid-1970s, with a $449.1 billion deficit in 2017. The shrinking deficit was attributed to the economic slowdown post the 2008 global financial crisis, reduced demand for imports, and lower commodity prices. The trade deficit reflects that the U.S. consumes more than it produces and imports more than it exports, largely due to macroeconomic policies. The U.S. trade deficit is largely caused by a low rate of domestic savings compared to investment needs, leading to borrowing from countries like China. This borrowing boosts economic growth, consumption, and demand for imports, resulting in a trade deficit. The U.S. trade deficit is influenced by various factors, including differences in economic growth between countries and the role of the dollar as a global reserve currency. Foreign investors seek dollar-denominated assets as safe-haven investments, helping to sustain the trade deficit by financing the lack of savings in the U.S. economy through buying U.S. Treasury securities. The U.S. trade deficit is sustained by foreign investors buying U.S. Treasury securities to finance the lack of savings in the economy. The U.S. current account deficit has declined from a historic high in 2006 to 2.3% of GDP in 2017, in line with trends since the mid-1980s. Selected economies' current account balances as a percentage of GDP are compared in Table 2. The United States, along with other countries, has current account deficits due to insufficient savings to meet investment needs. In 2017, the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States had the largest deficits, while the Netherlands, Germany, and South Korea had surpluses. Some policymakers believe U.S. trade deficits with countries like China are a result of unfair trade practices. Trade policies like trade barriers, subsidies, and discriminatory regulations can impact bilateral trade but have less effect on the global U.S. trade deficit, which is mainly due to low savings. High tariffs are not necessarily linked to smaller trade deficits. Reduction of protectionist measures in certain countries could increase U.S. exports, but without changes in consumption and savings behavior, the trade deficit would likely remain unchanged. The overall U.S. trade deficit is influenced by various factors beyond trade barriers, such as economic development, raw materials abundance, and technological change. Bilateral trade balances offer a snapshot of trade relationships but can be complex due to these factors. The U.S. trade deficit is influenced by factors beyond trade barriers like economic development and technological change. Bilateral trade deficits with certain partners reflect complex supply chain relationships, causing adjustments in the economy, particularly in exchange rates. Net imports lead to a surplus of U.S. dollars flowing abroad, affecting the value of the dollar relative to other currencies. The excess supply of U.S. dollars abroad affects its value relative to other currencies, making imports more expensive for Americans and exports cheaper for foreign buyers. The dollar's special status in global financial markets as a reserve currency and safe haven for investments, especially for countries like China with high savings rates, contributes to its appreciation when foreigners exchange their currency for U.S. dollars. Some analysts argue that foreign governments' intervention in currency markets, such as China, to keep their currency undervalued has hindered global trade balance realignment. Trade deficits indicate a savings/investment shortfall, leading to the United States borrowing from abroad and accumulating debt. Borrowing to finance imports in the United States raises concerns about debt accumulation from sustained trade deficits. The key factor is whether the borrowed funds are used for productive investments that can lead to higher economic growth in the long run, or for current consumption. If the borrowed funds are used for technology, equipment, or other productivity-enhancing products, it can result in a deficit that can be paid off through increased economic growth. However, borrowing for consumer purchases like clothes and electronics can lead to repayment challenges. Borrowing to finance consumer purchases can push repayment to future generations without investments to raise the ability to finance those repayments. A rising U.S. trade deficit could lead to a sudden fall in the value of the dollar, risking financial turmoil. Addressing underlying macroeconomic imbalances is crucial to prevent negative impacts on the economy, including reducing economic growth. Addressing macroeconomic imbalances is crucial to prevent negative impacts on the economy, including reducing economic growth. Ways to reduce the current account deficit include boosting domestic savings, realigning exchange rates, and ensuring other countries do not artificially devalue their currencies. Trade policies are not seen as the most effective tool for balancing trade. In 2017, the United States exported $1.3 trillion in manufactured goods. In 2017, the United States exported $1.3 trillion in manufactured goods and imported $2.0 trillion, resulting in a merchandise trade deficit of $698 billion. U.S. manufactures accounted for 56% of total exports and 70% of total imports. The top exports and imports included transportation equipment, computer and electronic products, chemicals, and machinery. The growth of global value chains has transformed U.S. manufacturing, leading to the outsourcing of labor-intensive activities while design, product development, and distribution drive the process. Factory closings and layoffs, along with merchandise made in other countries, have contributed to the perception of a shrinking U.S. manufacturing sector. The manufacturing sector in the United States has seen a decline in employment but an increase in output due to increased productivity. Despite its decreased importance relative to the economy, manufacturing remains a significant component. From 1980 to 2017, U.S. manufacturing real output increased by over 80%, and since 2009, it has increased by about 20%. The value-added of manufacturing as a share of GDP decreased from 21% in 1980 to 11% in 2017, while the value-added of services increased from 55% to 70% of GDP. U.S. employment in manufacturing fell from 19.4 million in 1979 to 12.4 million in 2017, but has been rising since 2010. Manufacturing employment accounted for 8.5% of total nonfarm employment in 2017, down from 20.7% in 1980. In recent years, business services employment within manufacturing has increased. The decline in manufacturing employment is not unique to the United States and has occurred in most advanced economies. Changes in the sector may be due to technology, consumer preferences, or broader macroeconomic factors. The role of trade, particularly increased imports from China, has been debated as a factor in the decline of U.S. manufacturing employment. The decline in U.S. manufacturing employment has been attributed to various factors such as technology, consumer preferences, and macroeconomic changes. Some argue that job losses in manufacturing were offset by job gains in services from increased U.S. exports. Others believe that trade played a smaller role compared to automation. The U.S. manufacturing sector underwent significant restructuring even before China joined the WTO. Manufacturing activity measurement is challenging, and existing data may not fully capture changes in employment and value creation. Manufacturing remains a significant part of the U.S. economy. The U.S. manufacturing sector is a significant component of the economy, accounting for a large portion of R&D and exports. In 2017, the U.S. had a trade surplus of $17 billion in agricultural goods. Agriculture's share of U.S. exports has slightly decreased over the past decade. The U.S. agricultural sector has seen an average growth of 8% over the past decade, with exports accounting for about 20% of total farm production value. Foreign markets play a significant role in absorbing U.S. output, especially for wheat, cotton, and certain food products like coffee and spices. Services, including audiovisual and construction, are also expanding economic activities. Services, such as audiovisual, construction, computer, energy, express delivery, e-commerce, financial, retail, transportation, tourism, and telecommunications, play a crucial role in the economy by facilitating the movement of goods and providing credits for manufacturing. Foreign markets are essential for absorbing U.S. agricultural output, particularly for wheat, cotton, coffee, and spices. Trade in services, including R&D, design, engineering, and business services, faces barriers that are often different from those for goods. These barriers, such as discriminatory regulations favoring domestic providers, are mainly \"behind the border\" restrictions within the importing country. Services transactions often require direct consumer-provider contact, leading to unique trade challenges for companies. In 2017, the United States had a trade surplus of $255 billion in services, with exports totaling $798 billion and imports at $542 billion. Services trade accounted for 34% of total U.S. exports and 19% of total U.S. imports, playing a significant role in the economy. The United States has a trade surplus in services, with exports exceeding imports. Services trade plays a significant role in the U.S. economy, contributing to GDP and employment. Trade deficits in goods are partially offset by surpluses in services. Trade data may underestimate services trade due to the lack of value-added measurement. Services inputs include transportation, R&D, design, engineering, and business services within the value chain. Digital trade encompasses a wide range of services beyond just physical goods, including R&D, design, engineering, and business services. These services play a crucial role in trade and can enhance productivity and competitiveness. Examples of digital trade include online shopping, information transmission for business operations, online health and educational services, and communication channels like email. Digital trade services include online health or educational services, communication channels like email, and financial services for e-commerce. Information and communication technologies (ICT) services are growing faster than trade in ICT goods. Digital trade barriers can be tariff or nontariff, with nontariff barriers often restricting the flow of commercial data through localization requirements. Restrictions on cross-border data flows, known as data localization barriers, can limit the types of services firms can offer and hinder communication with subsidiaries or headquarters abroad. This can also impede the entry of cloud-computing providers into a market. The United States has historically focused on supporting economic growth and jobs through trade policies, liberalizing markets, enforcing trade commitments, and advancing strategic goals. The key objective of U.S. trade policy is to advance strategic goals by supporting economic development, strengthening alliances, and extending influence abroad. The current Administration aims to support national security, negotiate new trade deals, enforce trade laws, protect rights under agreements, and reform the multilateral trading system. The U.S. trade policy aims to advance strategic goals by supporting economic development, strengthening alliances, and extending influence abroad. Key trade functions include formulating policy, negotiating agreements, enforcing laws, and administering programs. Congress plays a major role in trade policy through legislative and oversight authority, working with the executive branch. Interagency coordination is crucial in implementing trade policy. The USTR is the President's main trade policy advisor and negotiator, overseeing interagency coordination. Other agencies like the Commerce Department and Department of Agriculture have specific roles in trade. Congress holds primary authority over trade policy according to the U.S. Constitution. Congress has primary authority over trade policy according to the U.S. Constitution, granting powers to regulate commerce and make necessary laws. U.S. trade policy is based on statutory authorities passed by Congress, including laws governing trade programs and trade policy in general. Congress has delegated certain powers to the President to negotiate reciprocal trade agreements and take executive action, including setting trade negotiating objectives, requiring consultation from the executive branch, and conducting oversight hearings on trade programs and agreements. The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 granted the President authority to enter into reciprocal agreements to reduce tariffs within preapproved levels and implement new tariffs by proclamation. This authority was periodically renewed by Congress until the 1960s. The Trade Act of 1974 expanded this authority to include opening markets and negotiating international trade norms for nontariff barriers. The House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee have primary responsibility for trade matters, with subcommittees dedicated to trade issues. Other committees may also have a role in trade agreements and policies. For example, the House Foreign Affairs and Senate Banking Committees have jurisdiction over export controls. Congressional committees also examine trade relationships as part of their oversight of foreign relations. Congressional Advisory Groups on Negotiations (CAGs) consult and provide advice to USTR before and during trade agreement negotiations. Separate CAGs are established for both houses: a House Advisory Group on Negotiations (HAG), chaired by the chair of the Ways and Means Committee, and a Senate Advisory Group on Negotiations (SAG), chaired by the chair of the Finance Committee. CAGs can receive briefings and access trade negotiating documents. Individual Members affect trade policy as voting representatives who determine statutes governing trade matters and as sitting members on relevant committees. Individual Members of Congress can influence trade policy through voting on statutes and serving on relevant committees. They can also provide input through testimony, letters to USTR, and informal influence over other Members. Trade promotion authority (TPA) expedites the approval and implementation of trade agreements requiring changes in U.S. law. Trade promotion authority (TPA) expedites the approval and implementation of trade agreements through expedited consideration with no amendments, provided certain requirements are met. This includes negotiations reflecting specified objectives, notifications to Congress, and consultations with stakeholders. TPA defines how Congress exercises its authority over trade policy. Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) gives Congress control over trade policy while enhancing the President's negotiating power. TPA was first enacted in 1974 and has been renewed four times, with the latest renewal in 2015 (P.L. 114-26). The President is responsible for executing trade policy under the Constitution. The President has the responsibility for conducting the nation's foreign relations, negotiating treaties, and directing overall trade policy in the executive branch. The executive branch negotiates, implements, and monitors U.S. trade agreements, enforces customs, collects duties, and administers export and import policies. The President also adjusts tariff rates through delegated authority and is the chief adviser on trade policy. The USTR, a Cabinet-level appointment, is responsible for developing, coordinating, and implementing trade policy, negotiating trade agreements, and enforcing U.S. trade laws. Congress created the USTR in 1962 to provide better balance between domestic and international interests in trade formulation. The USTR, a Cabinet-level appointment, is responsible for developing, coordinating, and implementing trade policy, negotiating trade agreements, and enforcing U.S. trade laws. Congress created the USTR in 1962 to provide better balance between domestic and international interests in trade formulation, previously managed by the State Department. Various departments and agencies within the executive branch handle trade functions delegated by Congress and the President, coordinating U.S. positions through an interagency process with input from advisory groups. Key agencies involved in trade policymaking and enforcement include Commerce, Agriculture, State, Treasury, Homeland Security, and Labor. The USTR is responsible for trade policy decisions and negotiations, involving other Cabinet-level departments in a multidepartment interagency process. Congress established the Trade Policy Committee, chaired by USTR, with sub-Cabinet groups like the Trade Policy Review Group and the Trade Policy Staff Committee. The Trade Policy Review Group (TPRG) and the Trade Policy Staff Committee (TPSC) are key components of the executive branch's trade policy decision-making process. The President plays a crucial role in influencing trade legislation and making specific decisions on U.S. trade policies when necessary. This includes requesting Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) and addressing critical trade issues. The President plays a crucial role in influencing trade legislation and making specific decisions on U.S. trade policies, such as requesting TPA, initiating trade remedy cases, and imposing import restrictions. The private sector and stakeholders contribute to U.S. trade policy through a three-tiered committee system established by Congress in the Trade Act of 1974. The U.S. trade policy is influenced by a three-tier committee system consisting of 28 committees with citizen advisors. The system, administered by USTR's Office of Intergovernmental Affairs & Public Engagement, includes the President's Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations, general policy advisory committees, and technical advisory committees in industry and agriculture. These committees ensure that public and private sector views are considered in trade policies and programs. The advisory system involves private sector, NGOs, and labor groups shaping U.S. trade policy by providing input on negotiating objectives and potential impacts of trade agreements. Stakeholders may testify before congressional committees and government bodies to offer assessments. The private sector, NGOs, and labor groups play a significant role in shaping U.S. trade policy by providing input on trade initiatives. Trade is crucial to the U.S. economy, with various goods and services being tradeable. Technological advancements have made services tradeable across borders, impacting various interests in the United States. Congressional decisions on trade agreements and antidumping cases can affect employment, economic growth, product choices, and prices for consumers. Groups seek greater market access in other countries, with trade agreements focusing on nontariff issues like intellectual property rights and labor. The focus of trade agreements has shifted to nontariff issues like intellectual property rights and labor protections, leading to increased stakeholder interest. Various groups, including businesses, farmers, workers, and public interest groups, strive to ensure their views are represented in trade policy decisions. Legal challenges in federal court can be brought by importers, exporters, manufacturers, and other parties affected by governmental actions related to trade, such as customs classification, antidumping proceedings, and national safeguards. The federal government can initiate legal proceedings against individuals and firms to enforce customs laws or statutory restrictions on imports and exports, including AD and CVD proceedings. Some trade statutes may preclude judicial review, such as actions involving WTO and free trade agreements. Most federal cases involving trade laws are heard in the U.S. Court of International Trade. The U.S. Court of International Trade (USCIT) is a federal court in New York that hears cases involving trade laws. Court decisions can impact U.S. trade policy by examining agency actions, executive branch deference, and trade statute constitutionality. The U.S. Court of International Trade (USCIT) in New York City has exclusive jurisdiction over trade-related matters, including customs decisions, trade remedy determinations, import embargoes, and customs duties. It consists of nine judges appointed by the President with Senate approval, and decisions can be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals. The U.S. Court of International Trade (USCIT) has exclusive jurisdiction over trade-related matters and decisions can be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals. Statutory provisions related to the USCIT can be found in specific sections of the U.S. Code. The United States negotiates trade agreements for economic, commercial, foreign policy, and national security reasons, aiming to reduce barriers, increase market access for U.S. exporters, and gain competitive advantages for U.S. firms. The United States negotiates trade agreements to reduce barriers, increase market access for U.S. exporters, and gain competitive advantages over foreign competitors. These agreements aim to increase access to lower-cost imports, encourage trading partners to liberalize their trade and investment regimes, and strengthen alliances and influence in geographic regions. The U.S. participates in multilateral agreements negotiated in the World Trade Organization and free trade agreements. Free trade agreements (FTAs) are negotiated outside the World Trade Organization (WTO) and can involve two countries (bilateral FTAs) or three or more countries (regional FTAs). Plurilateral agreements involve more than two countries and focus on specific sectors. The United States currently has 14 FTAs in force. The United States has 14 FTAs in force, covering 20 countries. Globally, there are nearly 300 trade agreements in force as of late 2018. U.S. FTAs mainly involve small, developing countries, with only 35% of total U.S. trade with FTA partners. Over 99% of U.S. trade is with WTO member countries, with 65% of U.S. trade with WTO members without an FTA. The Trump Administration has brought a shift in approach to trade negotiations. The Trump Administration shifted trade negotiations by withdrawing from the TPP and focusing on bilateral deals. They renegotiated NAFTA into the USMCA in 2018. The Trump Administration shifted trade negotiations by withdrawing from the TPP and focusing on bilateral deals. They renegotiated NAFTA into the USMCA in 2018. The United States recently negotiated amendments to the U.S.-South Korea FTA (KORUS) and notified Congress of intent to negotiate new trade agreements with Japan, the European Union, and United Kingdom under TPA procedures. Negotiations for comprehensive FTAs by the United States often go beyond WTO rules, covering tariff reductions, services trade, foreign investment, intellectual property rights, government procurement, labor standards, and the environment. The U.S. has been seeking to establish new trading rules in recent trade agreements. The United States has more than 50 Trade and Investment Framework Agreements (TIFAs) with developing countries to consult on mutual economic interests, promote trade and investment. The USTR leads TIFA talks, and joint ministerial-level councils and issue-oriented working groups can be established with TIFA partners. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was established in 1947 post-WWII to create an international economic framework. It governed international trade for 47 years until the World Trade Organization (WTO) was formed in 1995. GATT rules continue to be applied with some modifications. The GATT was established in 1947 post-WWII to govern international trade, with core principles including lowering tariffs and applying them in a nondiscriminatory manner. The WTO, formed in 1995, administers trade rules and agreements to eliminate barriers. The WTO, established in 1995, oversees trade rules and agreements to eliminate barriers and promote nondiscriminatory trade. The United States played a significant role in its formation and the negotiation of new rules through the Uruguay Round. The WTO oversees trade rules and agreements under the GATT, GATS, TRIPS, and others. It also conducts negotiations like the Doha Development Agenda, which has been stalled due to differences among members. The WTO's negotiating effectiveness has been questioned since the Doha Round's collapse. Members are divided on the need for reforms to maintain its role in global trade. The Trump Administration is withholding approval for appointments to the WTO Appellate Body amid concerns over \"judicial overreach\" and certain procedures, which could lead to the dispute settlement system ceasing to function by late 2019 if new appointments are not approved. Members can initiate dispute settlement proceedings under the WTO to challenge trade practices that violate WTO agreements. The WTO dispute settlement process involves consultations between members, followed by a dispute panel adjudication and possible appeal to the WTO Appellate Body. If a member is found in violation, they must remove the measure or face retaliatory action. Over 575 complaints have been filed since 1995. Since 1995, 575 dispute settlement complaints have been filed in the WTO. The United States is a frequent user of the system, being involved in the most cases. Some pending disputes involve challenges to recent tariff measures by the Trump Administration. WTO decisions do not directly impact U.S. law, requiring legislative action for implementation. The United States may not implement WTO decisions without U.S. legislative action. USTR decides on compliance actions if administrative actions are challenged. Changes may be made to regulations or practices if there is statutory authority. The U.S. may compensate complainant countries instead of changing rules. Generally, the U.S. aims to comply with WTO decisions to encourage compliance from other members. The United States seeks to comply with WTO decisions and U.S. FTAs establish procedures to resolve disputes. Disputes can be resolved through consultations or by requesting a panel to adjudicate. Non-compliance can result in suspension of trade benefits. Countries can choose the forum to bring a dispute, and state-state dispute settlement has not been common. The United States resolves disputes with FTA partners through consultations or WTO rules, with state-state dispute settlement rarely used. NAFTA has a unique binational panel system for dispute resolution, while most U.S. FTAs include investor-state dispute settlement for investment-related provisions. The proposed USMCA maintains a unique binational panel system for reviewing trade remedy laws. Trade preference programs offer duty-free access to the U.S. market for exports from eligible developing countries. Congress has created six programs since 1974, including GSP, CBERA, CBTPA, AGOA, and HOPE. The Hemispheric Opportunity Through Partnership Encouragement Act (HOPE) and country-specific trade preferences for Nepal were passed by Congress in 2016. The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) is the largest U.S. trade preference program, covering 120 countries and territories, providing duty-free treatment to thousands of products. In 2017, $21 billion imports entered the U.S. under the GSP program. Countries must meet specific criteria set by Congress to be eligible, including protections for intellectual property and worker rights. The USTR is currently conducting eligibility reviews for several countries. Trade capacity building (TCB) involves U.S. assistance to support developing countries' integration in international trade. In FY2016, the U.S. invested $1.2 billion in 651 TCB activities across 134 countries. TCB helps countries negotiate trade agreements and improve their capacity for increased trade. Trade capacity building (TCB) involves U.S. assistance to support developing countries' integration in international trade. Examples include implementing customs reforms, improving labor and environment protections, and meeting export standards. Various agencies are responsible for TCB activities, with USAID receiving the most funding. The Constitution empowers Congress to set tariffs, which has been partially delegated to the President. Tariffs were historically used for revenue collection, but now developed countries like the United States rely on other methods. U.S. Customs and Border Protection collects tariffs at ports, amounting to $32 billion in 2016, just 1% of federal revenue. The U.S. used tariffs to promote global trade liberalization over the past 80 years. The United States has promoted global trade liberalization by reducing tariffs through bilateral and multilateral agreements since 1934. This effort continued after World War II through support for a rules-based trading system under the GATT and WTO, leading to a global average tariff rate of less than 7% by 2012. As of 2016, the mean U.S. tariff rate across all products was 3.3%. The United States has a low average tariff rate of 3.3% on all products, with 70% entering duty-free. The Trump Administration has increased tariffs on certain goods from key trading partners, using trade remedies like antidumping and countervailing duty laws. Trade remedy laws such as antidumping and countervailing duty laws are administered by the Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration and the U.S. International Trade Commission to address unfair trade practices. Other trade remedy laws include Section 201 and Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. Trade remedy laws, including antidumping and countervailing duty laws, are enforced by the Department of Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission to combat unfair trade practices. These laws must comply with U.S. WTO obligations, such as the Antidumping Agreement and Agreement on Subsidies. Supporters argue that trade remedies are necessary to protect U.S. industries and workers, while others fear they may lead to disguised protectionism and inefficiencies in the global trading system. Antidumping actions can create inefficiencies in the global trading system by raising prices on imported goods. Dumping occurs when exporters sell goods at lower prices in one market than in their home market. U.S. law allows for the imposition of antidumping duties when foreign goods are sold at \"less than fair value\" in the United States. Antidumping duties are imposed when foreign goods are sold at \"less than fair value\" in the United States. AD orders are subject to annual review and sunset review every five years. The United States had 354 AD orders in place as of mid-December 2018, with over one-third against China. Countervailing duty (CVD) is another frequently used U.S. trade remedy law to offset competitive advantages from subsidies received by foreign manufacturers or exporters. Countervailing duties offset advantages foreign exporters receive from subsidies. These duties are imposed on imports of subsidized goods into the United States. The U.S. had 113 CVD orders in place as of mid-December 2018, with nearly half against China. Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 allows the President to temporarily restrict imports causing harm to domestic industries. The Trade Act of 1974 allows the President to impose safeguard actions to provide temporary relief to domestic industries facing serious injury from imports. The ITC conducts investigations based on petitions filed by trade associations, companies, or unions, and recommends temporary relief to the President for final action. Unlike AD and CVD cases, safeguard investigations do not require allegations of unfair trade practices. In 2017, two safeguard investigations were initiated under the Trump Administration. The President imposed safeguard measures on imports of solar cells and large residential washing machines. The ITC conducted 73 investigations from 1975 to 2001, with 19 cases resulting in safeguard measures imposed by the President. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 allows the President to impose import restrictions if they threaten national security. The Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security consults with the Secretary of Defense and other agencies to investigate the impact of imports on national security. The President can impose tariffs or quotas on imports that threaten national security under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. Recent investigations led to tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Current investigations are ongoing for uranium, autos, and auto parts under Section 232. Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 allows the US to enforce trade agreements and address unfair barriers to exports. It applies to foreign actions that violate trade agreements or restrict US commerce. Cases can be initiated by petition or by USTR, with a focus on seeking negotiated settlements with trading partners. The USTR must seek negotiated settlements with trading partners to address trade barriers or practices. If resolution is not reached, tariffs may be imposed. The \"Special 301\" provision requires USTR to report annually to Congress on countries denying adequate protection for U.S. IPR. The USTR maintains a three-tier list of countries with inadequate IPR regimes, with a \"Priority Foreign Country\" designation being the most serious. Since 1974, USTR has initiated 125 Section 301 cases, with almost half occurring in the 1980s. In 2017, USTR launched an investigation into China's IPR technology policies, finding certain practices to be unreasonable or discriminatory in March 2018. The Trump Administration increased tariffs on $250 billion worth of U.S. imports from China, with threats of additional tariff increases. China responded by increasing tariffs on $110 billion worth of U.S. products. Both sides pursued dispute cases at the WTO. In November 2018, USTR reported that China had not changed its unfair practices. President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to start negotiations at the 2018 G-20 Leaders' Summit. President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to start negotiations on \"structural changes\" regarding IP, technology, agriculture, and services within 90 days. China agreed to make significant purchases of U.S. agricultural, energy, and industrial products, while the U.S. agreed to suspend planned tariff increases from 10% to 25% under Section 301 for the same period. Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 prohibits unfair competition in importing goods to the U.S. Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 prohibits unfair competition in importing goods to the U.S., including infringement of U.S. patents, copyrights, trademarks, and semiconductor products. The ITC is responsible for investigating violations, and no proof of injury is required for enforcement. The ITC is responsible for Section 337 investigations, which prohibit unfair competition in importing goods to the U.S. Trade Adjustment Assistance programs provide federal assistance to workers and firms affected by trade, with TAA for Workers being the largest program. Trade Adjustment Assistance for Workers (TAAW) provides $790 million in FY2019 to workers affected by foreign competition, offering career services, training, and income support. Individual workers receive benefits through state workforce and unemployment insurance systems. Smaller TAA programs also assist affected firms and farmers. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) provides support to workers and firms affected by foreign competition, aiming to facilitate adjustment and return workers to work quickly. TAA is justified for economic efficiency and equity reasons, compensating those impacted by trade liberalization. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) aims to help those affected by trade liberalization by providing support to workers and firms. Critics argue that TAA is costly and inefficient, reducing incentives for relocation and adjustment. Despite disagreements, Congress has maintained the program to generate support for international trade. Several federal agencies, including the Export-Import Bank, Department of Agriculture, and Overseas Private Investment Corporation, administer finance programs to assist U.S. firms in exporting and investing in developing countries. The BUILD Act of 2018 establishes a new agency to succeed OPIC, with varying mandates focusing on U.S. commercial interests and foreign policy objectives. The U.S. government agencies, such as the Ex-Im Bank and Department of Commerce's ITA, support U.S. firms in exporting by providing financing and export promotion services, particularly for small and medium-sized companies. The Ex-Im Bank offers direct loans, loan guarantees, and export credit insurance to help finance U.S. exports to developing countries. The Ex-Im Bank, backed by the U.S. government, provides export credit insurance to finance U.S. exports to developing economies. Despite reauthorization, the bank is not fully operational due to unfilled board positions, limiting approval of medium- and long-term export financing above $10 million. Presidential appointments to the board require Senate approval. The United States restricts exports for national security, foreign policy, and economic reasons through various acts like the AECA, ECA, and IEEPA. Export controls aim to balance national security goals with export competitiveness, especially for defense items and dual-use goods. Presidential appointments to the Ex-Im Bank board require Senate approval, impacting the bank's ability to provide export credit insurance for U.S. exports to developing economies. The United States restricts exports of defense items, dual-use goods, certain nuclear materials, and items related to nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. Export controls are also used to restrict trade with sanctioned countries. Various departments administer export control programs and licenses are required for certain exports. The ECA (P.L. 115-232, Subtitle B, Part I) provides legislative authority for the President to implement dual-use export. The Export Control Act of 2018 grants the President authority to implement dual-use export controls, replacing the expired Export Administration Act of 1979. It allows the Department of Commerce to regulate the export of \"emerging and foundational technologies\" crucial to national security. Dual-use goods have both civilian and military applications, such as nuclear materials and electronics. The Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) licenses exports of dual-use goods like nuclear materials, microorganisms, electronics, computers, lasers, and sensors. Licenses are based on technical characteristics, destination, end use, and end user activities. Foreign direct investment (FDI) involves acquiring real assets abroad, while foreign portfolio investment (FPI) involves purchasing foreign assets. Foreign portfolio investment involves purchasing foreign equities or bonds, loans to foreign residents, or opening foreign bank accounts. FDI involves a long-term commitment and stimulates direct employment for the host country. Portfolio investments are highly liquid and can be withdrawn easily. Official capital flows are generated by governments for various purposes. Global trade in goods and services grew significantly from 1990 to 2017. The global exports increased significantly from $4 trillion to $23 trillion, while gross capital flows grew from $1 trillion to $4 trillion annually, peaking at over $12 trillion in 2007. Additionally, there was a surge in foreign exchange and derivatives markets during this period. The total daily trading of foreign currencies exceeded $5.1 trillion in 2016, impacting the international exchange value of the dollar and prices of goods and services. Multinational corporations invest abroad to increase profits, leveraging their special knowledge or managerial abilities for a competitive advantage. Multinational corporations (MNCs) invest abroad to leverage their product knowledge or special managerial abilities for a competitive advantage. FDI is driven by factors such as competitive advantages, low-cost resources, and improved efficiency or market share. MNCs support global value chains by sourcing production globally and operating close to their customers. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) allows multinational corporations (MNCs) to operate close to customers in foreign markets, accessing resources like a skilled workforce for R&D. FDI transactions, including mergers and acquisitions, enhance global competitiveness. The total stock of global outward FDI in 2017 was $31 trillion, with the United States leading followed by Hong Kong, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Japan. The United States leads in global outward FDI, with Hong Kong, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Japan following. Developing Asia receives the largest share of global FDI inflows, with the United States being the largest source and recipient of FDI. U.S. FDI abroad has significantly increased from $238 billion in 1985 to $6.0 trillion in 2017. The stock of U.S. FDI abroad has risen significantly from $238 billion in 1985 to $6.0 trillion in 2017. The largest destinations for U.S. FDI outflows include the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Ireland, Canada, Singapore, Australia, Germany, and Japan. Europe accounts for nearly 60% of U.S. direct investment abroad, while 68% of FDI in the United States comes from Europe. FDI in the United States is mainly from Europe, with outward investment focused on high-technology, finance, and services. Inward FDI is primarily in the manufacturing sector, particularly chemicals and transport industries. Economists support international capital flows like FDI as they benefit both home and host economies by enhancing firms' competitive advantages and skills in foreign markets. Direct investment brings various benefits such as a strengthened competitive position, higher employee skills, and increased firm incomes in foreign markets. Host countries also benefit from inward FDI by adding to the capital stock and economy's skill set, bringing technological advances, boosting capital formation, and contributing to a more competitive business environment and productivity growth. Additionally, FDI promotes international trade and global economic integration. Foreign firms investing in the United States contribute significantly to the economy, employing millions of workers and adding value to GDP. However, concerns exist about U.S. firms investing abroad and potentially shifting manufacturing and jobs overseas. U.S. FDI in operations abroad may displace domestic production and exports, impacting employment and wages. Data on firms shifting plants or jobs overseas is mostly anecdotal. Outward FDI is mainly in developed countries with similar markets, where production is consumed locally. Economists debate the impact of U.S. direct investment abroad on job numbers and wages. There is no conclusive evidence that U.S. direct investment abroad leads to fewer jobs or lower incomes overall for Americans. Instead, the loss of U.S. manufacturing jobs in recent decades is attributed to improvements in productivity and other domestic economic forces. However, jobs in specific companies and sectors can be negatively impacted when production is moved overseas. International investment agreements establish binding rules on investment protections, while there are no comprehensive multilateral rules on this issue. IIAs serve as the primary vehicle for promoting investment rules globally, with over 2,600 agreements in force. They aim to reduce FDI restrictions, ensure nondiscriminatory treatment of investors, and safeguard a government's right to regulate in the public interest. U.S. IIAs involve reciprocal commitments to offer protections to foreign investors in exchange for similar protections for U.S. investors in partner countries. U.S. investors expect the same protections in partner countries through bilateral investment treaties (BITs) and investment chapters in free trade agreements (FTAs). USTR and the State Department negotiate U.S. IIAs, with 40 BITs in force, including one with Rwanda. BIT negotiations with China and India have stalled. The U.S. also has 14 FTAs covering 20 countries. The United States has 14 FTAs in force covering 20 countries, most with chapters on investment and ISDS provisions for settling disputes. ISDS allows investors to bring claims against host country governments before an international arbitration panel. Successful claims can result in monetary penalties, but countries cannot be forced to change their laws. The number of ISDS cases has increased with global FDI growth. U.S. investors make up a significant portion of investment claims worldwide. Despite being included in most U.S. BITs and FTAs, ISDS has sparked debate in recent U.S. trade negotiations. The Trump Administration made major changes to ISDS under NAFTA renegotiation, proposing to eliminate ISDS between the United States and Canada in the USMCA. ISDS was also a point of contention in T-TIP talks during the Obama Administration, with the EU pushing for an investment court system. The EU has been advocating for an investment court system in trade agreements to replace ISDS. CFIUS, established in 1975, oversees foreign investments that could impact U.S. national security. The Exon-Florio provision, established in 1988, allows for the review of foreign investments that could impact U.S. national security. CFIUS, chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury, conducts risk-based analysis on mergers and acquisitions by foreign investors. The President can block transactions, which has been done five times since 1988. The Exon-Florio provision, established in 1988, allows for the review of foreign investments that could impact U.S. national security. CFIUS, chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury, conducts risk-based analysis on mergers and acquisitions by foreign investors. The authority has been invoked five times since 1988, leading to cancellations or divestments by foreign investors. Recent examples include President Trump blocking acquisitions of Lattice Semiconductor Corp. and Qualcomm. The Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 expands the scope of transactions subject to review under CFIUS. The CFIUS has an expanded role in reviewing investments in critical technology or infrastructure, which some argue goes against the U.S.'s open investment climate. The U.S. promotes both inward and outward foreign direct investment. The OPIC provides services to facilitate U.S. private investments abroad. The BUILD Act of 2018 further supports investments in developing countries and emerging markets. The BUILD Act of 2018 establishes the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) to expand and consolidate development finance functions. SelectUSA coordinates federal efforts to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) in the United States by providing information to businesses and advocating for investments in the U.S."
