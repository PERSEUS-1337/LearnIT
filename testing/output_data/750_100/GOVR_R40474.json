    "content": "This report examines recent gun regulations in the District of Columbia and proposed congressional amendments. Key laws include federal provisions like the National Firearms Act and Gun Control Act, the D.C. Firearms Control Regulation Act, the Second Amendment Enforcement Act (H.R. 645), and the District's Firearms Control Amendment Act and Inoperable Pistol Amendment Act. The report analyzes recent gun regulations in the District of Columbia, including federal laws like the National Firearms Act and Gun Control Act, as well as the District's Firearms Control Amendment Act and Inoperable Pistol Amendment Act. It also discusses congressional proposals such as Title II of S. 160 from the 111th Congress and H.R. 645 from the 112th Congress, highlighting any differences between the two bills. The report examines recent gun regulations in DC, including federal laws and local acts. It discusses congressional proposals post the Heller decision, which affirmed the individual's right to possess firearms for self-defense. The Heller decision affirmed the right to possess firearms for self-defense within the home and declared unconstitutional three provisions of the District's Firearms Control Regulation Act. These provisions included a ban on handgun registration, restrictions on carrying a pistol without a license within the home, and requirements for firearms to be kept unloaded and disassembled. After the Supreme Court's Heller decision, the DC Council enacted emergency legislation to comply with the ruling by temporarily amending the city's gun laws. This attempt was met with criticism, as some felt it was not done in a fair manner. After the Heller decision, DC Council enacted emergency legislation to amend gun laws, criticized for not complying with the ruling. H.R. 6691, Second Amendment Enforcement Act, introduced in Congress to loosen DC's existing gun laws. H.R. 6691 content adopted into H.R. 6842, passed in the House by 266-152 vote. In the 111th Congress, Senator John Ensign introduced an amendment to the District of Columbia Voting Rights Act of 2009, which was approved by the Senate but later stalled. The House passed H.R. 6842 in September 2008, while the DC Council continued to enact emergency legislation. In September 2008, the DC Council passed emergency legislation until permanent legislation could take effect. The Firearms Control Amendment Act of 2008 and the Inoperable Pistol Amendment Act of 2008 were later passed and became effective in 2009, amending firearms provisions in the DC Code. The District of Columbia implemented new firearms regulations in 2009, which were challenged and upheld in court in 2010. Congressional legislation, such as H.R. 645, aims to amend these regulations while considering the impact of the Firearms Control Amendment Act and Inoperable Pistol Amendment Act. The passage discusses the amendments proposed in H.R. 645, which would impact firearms provisions in the DC Code by limiting the District's ability to regulate firearm possession and repealing the registration scheme. Federal firearms laws set minimum standards in the US, with states and territories able to supplement these laws. The District of Columbia seeks to enhance its firearms laws in compliance with federal statutes, without conflicting with the Supreme Court's ruling in District of Columbia v. Heller. The Home Rule Act grants the District the authority to enact its own laws, including regulations on firearms. The Home Rule Act grants the DC Council the authority to regulate firearms, allowing them to amend laws passed by Congress. Congress retains the ability to legislate for the District and impose limits on the DC government's authority. The DC Council has the authority to enact legislation for the District, including amending or repealing laws passed by Congress. Congress can still impose limits on the DC government's authority. Section 3 of H.R. 645 and Title II-S. 160 place limits on the District of Columbia's authority regarding firearms possession, ensuring that individuals not prohibited by Federal law can acquire, possess, transport, and use firearms for lawful purposes without undue restrictions from the DC government. The District of Columbia is restricted from enacting laws that discourage private ownership or use of firearms for lawful purposes under H.R. 645. The Council is not authorized to create laws related to firearms regulation. The District of Columbia is prohibited from enacting laws that discourage private ownership or use of firearms for lawful purposes under H.R. 645. The Council is not authorized to create laws related to firearms regulation, including any constructive prohibition or undue burden on acquiring firearms. This restriction also prevents the District from barring firearms possession by individuals not prohibited under federal law and from prohibiting possession of firearms not already regulated at the federal level. The District of Columbia is limited in creating stricter firearms laws beyond federal regulations under H.R. 645. It is unclear what would violate the prohibition against discouraging private firearm ownership. The proposed language does not revoke the District's authority to enforce sanctions for criminal firearm misuse. The District of Columbia's authority to regulate carrying firearms is limited under H.R. 645, allowing for regulation of concealed or open carry but not outright prohibition. The District of Columbia's authority to regulate carrying firearms under H.R. 645 is limited, allowing for regulation of concealed or open carry but not outright prohibition. The argument revolves around whether the District can ban open or concealed carry despite the congressional provision. Prior to Heller, the DC Code defined a \"machine gun\" as any firearm capable of shooting more than 12 shots without manual reloading, including semiautomatic weapons like pistols, rifles, or shotguns. This broad definition restricted the registration of pistols mainly to revolvers. In contrast, under the NFA, a \"machine gun\" is defined as a weapon that can shoot automatically more than one shot without manual reloading. The DC Code previously defined a \"machine gun\" as a firearm capable of shooting more than 12 shots without manual reloading, including semiautomatic weapons. The definition was amended to align with the federal definition, allowing semiautomatic firearms to be registered. If H.R. 645 is enacted, the definition of \"machine gun\" would revert to its pre-Heller state, aligning with the federal definition. The DC Code allows for firearm registration but previously prohibited certain types of firearms like sawed-off shotguns and machine guns. The DC Code previously prohibited certain firearms like sawed-off shotguns and machine guns, but now allows registration of pistols for self-defense. The definition of \"machine gun\" aligns with the federal definition, allowing registration of semiautomatic handguns if requirements are met. An exemption exists for temporary possession of a registered firearm in another's home. The FCAA amends provisions for firearm registration, prohibiting certain individuals from registering if convicted of specific offenses within five years. Temporary possession of a registered firearm in another's home is allowed for self-defense. Applicants with a history of violent behavior, civil protection orders, or foreign protection orders within five years are prohibited from registering a firearm. The FCAA also mandates firearms training, a competency test, and approval from the Chief of Police for registration. The Chief of Police must approve the registration of a pistol and conduct a ballistics identification procedure. Only one pistol per registrant can be registered every 30 days, except for new residents with pistols owned lawfully elsewhere for six months. The registration system also serves as a licensing and permit system for firearm owners. H.R. 645 maintains the ban on sawed-off shotguns, short barreled rifles, and machine guns. H.R. 645 would repeal registration requirements for firearms in DC, including the need for a registration certificate or licensing of gun owners. The Chief of Police would no longer need to conduct ballistics testing or limit pistol registrations to one per month. H.R. 645 would amend DC Code to allow unlimited handgun purchases per month and transfer of ammunition to any person, including DC residents. H.R. 645 would eliminate restrictions on pistol bullets and allow unlimited handgun purchases per month, including for DC residents. It would also remove the requirement for licensed dealers to track ammunition inventory. Additionally, the bill would permit interstate purchase of firearms, with differences in approach compared to Title II- S. 160. H.R. 645 proposes allowing federal licensees in Maryland and Virginia to sell handguns to residents of the District of Columbia, bypassing federal law restrictions. The GCA allows licensed dealers to sell handguns to District residents if legal conditions are met. Federal law does not specify how firearms should be stored, unlike the District's now-unconstitutional trigger lock requirement. The FCAA requires firearms in lawful possession to be unloaded, disassembled, or secured by a trigger lock. It prohibits storing loaded firearms where minors can access them without permission. The FCAA requires firearms to be securely stored to prevent minors from accessing them without permission. Violating these storage responsibilities can result in criminal penalties. Title II- S. 160 aims to repeal this section of the FCAA. Section 7 of H.R. 645 introduces penalties for allowing minors access to loaded firearms, resulting in injury. Violators would be guilty of unlawful storage if they knowingly leave a loaded firearm where a minor can access it without permission, leading to harm. Penalties include a fine up to $1,000 and/or imprisonment for up to one year. Penalties for allowing minors access to loaded firearms include a fine up to $1,000 and/or imprisonment for up to one year, with exceptions such as securely locked containers or trigger locks, storing on the person's body, unlawful entry, or minor acting unlawfully. The minor's access to the firearm was due to unlawful entry, self-defense, hunting or target shooting under adult supervision, or possession by a law enforcement officer. Prosecution may not occur if the victim is the child of the violator, unless gross negligence is involved. DC law currently includes penalties for general violations of the registration scheme. The violation of the registration scheme in DC, such as unregistered possession of a firearm, carries penalties of fines or imprisonment. H.R. 645 aims to remove these penalties, including criminal consequences for the intentional sale or transfer of firearms. The District of Columbia amended its firearms laws, including definitions like \"machine gun\" and \"firearm.\" H.R. 645 aims to harmonize definitions between Titles 7 and 22 of the DC Code, including terms like \"firearm,\" \"machine gun,\" and \"sawed off shotgun.\" The IPAA amended DC law to allow the District of Columbia and private property owners to prohibit or restrict possession of firearms on their premises, with exceptions for law enforcement personnel. Section 10 of H.R. 645 also addresses property owners' rights to restrict firearms on their property. The provision in Section 10 of H.R. 645 allows private property owners in DC to prohibit or restrict possession of firearms on their premises, with exceptions for law enforcement personnel. This extends to landlords of businesses or residential premises, unlike existing DC law. Additionally, the District would have the authority to restrict or prohibit firearms on public property, including buildings or structures under its control. The proposed language in H.R. 645 allows private property owners in DC to prohibit or restrict possession of firearms in buildings or structures under their control with security measures, excluding lessees. This is narrower in scope compared to current law giving the District authority over property under its control. The proposed language in H.R. 645 allows private property owners in DC to prohibit or restrict possession of firearms in buildings or structures under their control with security measures, excluding lessees. It is unclear if the District could regulate firearms on real property under its control other than buildings and structures. The extent of the District's authority to regulate firearm possession in buildings under its control is ambiguous. The IPAA in H.R. 645 would repeal the Chief's authority to issue licenses for concealed firearms in DC, potentially allowing private property owners to regulate firearm possession in buildings with security measures. The ambiguity lies in whether this regulation extends to areas within buildings or structures under DC's control. H.R. 645 would repeal the Chief's authority to issue licenses for concealed firearms in DC, allowing private property owners to regulate firearm possession. States can also impose their own laws on carrying firearms. H.R. 645 would modify the provision allowing individuals to carry firearms in specific circumstances without a license, as the Chief's authority to issue licenses for concealed firearms in DC would be repealed. H.R. 645 would allow individuals to carry firearms without a license in specific circumstances, including in their dwelling house, place of business, or while engaged in lawful recreational activities. If H.R. 645 is enacted, firearm owners could obtain a concealed carry license and carry their firearms outside specific circumstances. The bill would also allow for the lawful transportation of firearms for any lawful purpose. The IPAA made a technical change to the District Code by including toy and antique pistols as types of firearms that are prohibited from being used to commit a violent or dangerous crime, and violators are subject to certain criminal penalties. H.R. 645 would provide jurisdiction to the Office of Administrative Hearings to hear cases related to firearms dealer licenses, removing the need for jurisdiction over firearm registration certificates due to the repeal of the registration scheme. Amendments to the DC Code were discussed in relation to the enactment of the FCAA and IPAA. The congressional proposal in H.R. 645 would repeal the FCAA and IPAA, leading to the restoration of previous laws. This would impact the DC Code's provisions on dealer licenses and firearm transfers, requiring compliance with new regulations. To obtain a dealer's license or engage in firearm transactions, individuals must meet new requirements under the FCAA. H.R. 645 would repeal the District's registration scheme, allowing eligible individuals to apply for a dealer's license and purchase firearms or ammunition from licensed dealers. Federal prohibitions on firearm possession are also discussed. Additionally, duties such as reporting loss or theft are highlighted in the discussion on ammunition sales and registration. In the discussion on \"Ammunition Sales and Registration,\" duties like reporting loss, theft, or destruction of firearms or ammunition in a dealer's inventory would be repealed. The federal GCA prohibits certain individuals from possessing firearms, including those convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment exceeding one year, fugitives, users of controlled substances, and those adjudicated as mentally defective. The Federal Gun Control Act prohibits certain individuals from possessing firearms, including those convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment exceeding one year, fugitives, users of controlled substances, and those adjudicated as mentally defective. It is also unlawful to sell or transfer a firearm to individuals who fall within specific categories such as being dishonorably discharged from the Armed Forces or convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. Under the Federal Gun Control Act, certain individuals are prohibited from possessing firearms. To transfer firearms, non-licensed individuals must meet federal requirements and additional eligibility criteria under the FCAA. Private sales between non-licensed individuals must go through a licensed dealer, as mandated by D.C. law and H.R. 645. Under H.R. 645, licensed dealers must still conduct transfers, but without the registration requirement of DC law. Only federal disqualifications apply. The bill also impacts the assault weapons ban under the FCAA, redefining \"assault weapon\" and specifying prohibited firearms. The definition of \"assault weapon\" includes specific rifles, shotguns, and pistols, as well as semiautomatic firearms with military-type characteristics. It also covers shotguns with revolving cylinders, except for those designed for .22 caliber rimfire ammunition. The Chief can designate any firearm as an assault weapon if it poses a similar threat to listed weapons. Antique firearms are not included in the definition. The Firearms Control Amendment Act (FCAA) introduces a new definition of \"assault weapon\" that includes specific firearms with military characteristics. This definition applies to the Assault Weapon Manufacturing Strict Liability Act of 1990, holding manufacturers, importers, or dealers strictly liable for any harm caused by these weapons in the District of Columbia. These changes would be repealed by H.R. 645. The Firearms Control Amendment Act (FCAA) in DC prohibits possession, sale, or transfer of large capacity ammunition feeding devices, defined as devices holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition. This restriction remains in place despite the allowance for registration and possession of semiautomatic firearms in DC. The FCAA in DC prohibits possession of large capacity ammunition feeding devices, despite allowing possession of semiautomatic firearms. H.R. 645 aims to repeal this provision. Under the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, licensed dealers must run background checks before transferring firearms. Under federal law, licensed dealers must run background checks before transferring firearms. Non-licensed persons are not required to perform a background check. The DC Code imposes a waiting period of 48 hours for pistol or handgun transfers, but under the IPAA, the waiting period for firearm transfers is now 10 days. The waiting period for firearm transfers under the IPAA is now 10 days, applying to all firearms, not just pistols. If the IPAA is repealed, the waiting period for handguns would revert back to 48 hours. The FCAA added provisions regarding microstamping to H.R. 645, requiring semiautomatic pistols manufactured after January 1, 2011 to be microstamp-ready. New sections 503 and 504 were created to outline these requirements. The FCAA added provisions requiring semiautomatic pistols to be microstamp-ready after January 1, 2011. New Section 504 prohibits the manufacture, sale, or possession of pistols not on the California Roster after January 1, 2009, unless lawfully owned and registered before that date. The FCAA prohibits the possession of pistols not on the California Roster after January 1, 2009, unless lawfully owned and registered before that date. Residents can only sell or transfer such pistols through a licensed firearms dealer. The Chief must review the roster annually for updates, and can revise the list of unsafe handguns. The IPAA makes it illegal to discharge a firearm without a special permit. The District prohibits the discharge of firearms without a special permit, allows for restrictions on possession of firearms on its property, and permits private property owners to do the same. These provisions would be repealed if H.R. 645 became law."
