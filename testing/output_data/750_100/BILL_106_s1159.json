    "content": "Title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section called \"Physical Education for Progress Act.\" This part aims to provide grants and contracts to local educational agencies to enhance physical education programs for all K-12 students. Physical education is crucial for children's development, improving their health, self-esteem, relationships, behavior, and independence. Children who participate in high quality daily physical education programs tend to be healthier and more physically fit. The percentage of overweight young people has more than doubled in the 30 years before 1999, with low activity levels contributing to obesity. Obesity-related diseases cost the US economy over $100 billion annually, and inactivity and poor diet lead to at least 300,000 deaths each year in the US. Children are not as active as they should be, with fewer than 1 in 4 getting 20 minutes of vigorous activity daily. The Surgeon General and CDC recommend daily physical education for all students from kindergarten to grade 12. Resolution 97, 100th Congress, passed in 1987, urged State and local governments to provide high-quality daily physical education programs for all K-12 students, but little progress has been made in achieving this goal. Every student should have the opportunity to participate in quality physical education to develop health-related fitness, physical competence, and cognitive understanding about physical activity. To promote healthy lifestyles, all students should have the opportunity to participate in quality physical education programs to develop fitness, physical competence, and understanding of physical activity. \"Program authorized under SEC. 10999D.\" The Secretary can award grants to local educational agencies for physical education programs for K-12 students, including equipment, curriculum development, and teacher training. \"SEC. 10999E. APPLICATIONS; PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS.\" Each local educational agency must submit an application to the Secretary outlining a plan to enhance physical education programs in schools to meet specific requirements. These requirements include providing elementary, middle, and high school students with a minimum of 150 minutes of physical education curriculum. The plan outlines requirements for physical education programs in schools, including 150 minutes per week of instructional physical education, fitness education, motor skill instruction, and cognitive concepts for lifelong well-being. The plan outlines requirements for physical education programs in schools, including 150 minutes per week of instructional physical education, fitness education, motor skill instruction, and cognitive concepts for lifelong well-being. Teachers of physical education must have baccalaureate degrees qualifying them as specialists in the field. The program aims to promote skills, physical fitness, social development, multicultural perspectives, appropriate physical activity levels, and healthy eating habits. Teachers of physical education must have baccalaureate degrees to qualify as specialists. They should also receive professional development to stay updated on research and trends. Extracurricular activities like team sports and ROTC are not part of the assisted physical education curriculum. The Secretary must ensure equitable distribution of grants and contracts between urban and rural local educational agencies, as well as between those serving large and small student populations. Private school and home-schooled students are also addressed in the legislation. Private school and home-schooled students can participate in activities funded under this part, based on the number of students in the school district. A report is required for continued funding. To continue receiving grant or contract funding after the first year, the administrator of the local educational agency must submit an annual report detailing activities and progress towards program requirements. Additionally, a report to Congress is required. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress by June 1, 2003, detailing programs assisted under this part, their success in improving physical fitness, and recommendations for program continuation and improvement. Additionally, not more than 7 percent of grant funds can be used for administrative costs, and there are guidelines for the federal share and ensuring funds supplement, not supplant. The Federal share under this part may not exceed 90 percent of the total project cost for the first year and 75 percent for subsequent years. Funds must supplement, not supplant other available Federal, State, and local funds for physical education activities. Authorization of appropriations is also addressed. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2000 to 2004 totaling $30,000,000 for 2000, $70,000,000 for 2001, and $100,000,000 for each year from 2002 to 2004 to support physical education activities."
