    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Environmental Justice Enforcement Act of 2006\". The Act, known as the \"Environmental Justice Enforcement Act of 2006,\" is necessary due to a Supreme Court decision in Alexander v. Sandoval that weakens statutory protections against discrimination established by Congress over almost four decades. The decision undermines these protections by denying victims of discrimination the right to seek redress in Federal court. The Sandoval decision undermines protections against discrimination established by Congress in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by denying victims the right to bring action in Federal court. It also challenges settled expectations created by the Act to prevent discrimination in programs receiving Federal funding. The regulatory process ensures broad protections for beneficiaries of the law, with regulations under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 forbidding discriminatory criteria or methods of administration. Retaliation against individuals involved in discrimination charges is also prohibited. These regulations were drafted by the executive branch. The regulations under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, drafted by executive branch officials, have never been invalidated. In 1966, Congress rejected a proposal to invalidate these regulations, implying they accurately reflect congressional intent. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 aimed to benefit those facing discrimination and relied on private attorneys for enforcement. Congress recognized the need for additional enforcement beyond actions by the Attorney General. The Supreme Court emphasized the rights of individuals experiencing discrimination under Title VI. Private right of action in Federal courts for discrimination under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is necessary for effective protection of the law, despite not being explicitly stated in the statute. Congress and the Courts have recognized an implied right of action under Title VI. In 1972, Congress established a right to attorney's fees in private actions brought under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Supreme Court had no basis in law or legislative history in Sandoval for denying a right of action under regulations promulgated pursuant to Title VI while permitting it under the statute. Regulations under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 were congressionally mandated and directed by Congress to enforce antidiscrimination provisions. The regulations must be approved by the President and prohibit discriminatory practices, consistent with Supreme Court decisions acknowledging disparate treatment. The Supreme Court has recognized in various decisions that a disparate impact standard can uncover discrimination disguised as compliance with the law. Evidence of a disproportionate burden is often the starting point in analyzing unlawful discrimination, and an invidious purpose can be inferred from the totality of relevant facts. The interpretation of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits practices with disparate impact, critical for uncovering stereotypes underlying intentional discrimination. The disparate impact standard is crucial in enforcing title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as reinstated by Congress in the Civil Rights Act of 1991. Congress also reinstated a private right of action under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The disparate impact standard under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is essential for preventing unfair discrimination findings. Failure to reinstate a private right of action could leave equality of opportunity solely to Federal agencies, potentially hindering necessary actions due to administrative burdens. Action by Congress is needed to specify a private right of action to ensure remedy for individuals denied equal access to various programs and services due to discriminatory practices. The Supreme Court's decision in Sandoval has led to the dismissal of many claims challenging actions under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 added a provision for a private right of action to title VI, allowing individuals to challenge discriminatory actions. Sovereign immunity will be waived to enforce this right. SEC. 3. PROHIBITED DISCRIMINATION. Section 601 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is amended to include provisions regarding discrimination based on disparate impact. An aggrieved person must demonstrate that a covered entity has a policy or practice causing a disparate impact on race, color, or national origin. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 is amended to address discrimination based on disparate impact. An aggrieved person must show that a covered entity's policy or practice causes a disparate impact on race, color, or national origin, and the entity fails to prove it is necessary for nondiscriminatory goals or refuses to adopt a less discriminatory alternative. The aggrieved person must demonstrate that each challenged policy or practice causes a disparate impact, unless the decision-making process cannot be separated for analysis. If a covered entity proves that a specific policy does not cause disparate impact, they are not liable. The covered entity is not required to prove that a policy or practice causing disparate impact is necessary for its program. Demonstrating necessity cannot be used as a defense against intentional discrimination claims. Discrimination or retaliation is prohibited for opposing any discriminatory policy or practice. The curr_chunk states that discrimination or retaliation is prohibited if a person makes a charge or participates in an investigation under this title. SEC. 4. RIGHTS OF ACTION. Section 602 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is amended to allow any person aggrieved by a covered entity's failure to comply with the title to bring a civil action in Federal or State court. SEC. 5. RIGHT OF RECOVERY. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is amended to provide the right of recovery for individuals affected by discrimination or retaliation. SEC. 602A. ACTIONS BROUGHT BY AGGRIEVED PERSONS. In actions brought under this title against a covered entity for intentional discrimination, aggrieved persons may seek equitable and legal relief, including compensatory and punitive damages, attorney's fees, and costs. Punitive damages are not available against government entities. Claims based on the disparate impact standard of proof are also addressed. In actions based on disparate impact discrimination, aggrieved individuals can seek equitable relief, attorney's fees, and costs from covered entities found guilty of unlawful discrimination. The Act and its amendments are retroactive to April 24, 2001, and effective as of that date. It applies to all actions or proceedings pending on or after April 24, 2001, except for actions against a State under the disparate impact standard, which have the effective date of the Act's enactment."
