    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Safe Communities Act of 2017\" and includes findings. The Congress acknowledges the lack of financial resources for incorporating disaster threats in land use and public facility planning, leading to costly relief programs and disruptive security measures. Despite land use planning being under State and local jurisdiction, there is a need for better integration of disaster preparedness. The Federal Government and State governments should support incorporating disaster mitigation and emergency preparedness into land use planning to reduce post-disaster recovery costs and prioritize prevention strategies. Disaster planning should encompass various mitigation strategies from urban planning, architecture, and design fields to reduce risks posed by natural disasters and terrorist acts. The Federal Government and States should create a supportive environment for comprehensive planning. Many States are updating land use statutes to support comprehensive planning for safe communities, incorporating long-term hazard mitigation and emergency preparedness. Efforts to coordinate State and regional investments with local plans require additional State level planning. Comprehensive urban planning considers the relationship between land use, transportation systems, and water. Safe housing is crucial for community development and should be integrated into comprehensive planning efforts. Modern planning techniques should ensure a variety of safe housing options for all community members. Land use patterns often impact the placement of people in communities. Prevailing land use patterns in rural communities and small towns on the metropolitan fringe pose risks due to haphazard development. Federal and State governments should support Tribal governments and Native Hawaiian organizations in implementing land use planning for safer housing and community development. The curr_chunk focuses on improving housing safety and socioeconomic conditions for Indian Tribes and Native Hawaiians. The curr_chunk focuses on Safe Communities Planning Grants. The Secretary of Homeland Security will establish a grant program to assist States and local governments in developing or updating land use planning statutes and comprehensive planning documents to mitigate natural and human-caused hazards, including acts of terror. The grant program aims to assist States and local governments in developing or updating land use planning statutes and comprehensive planning documents to mitigate natural and human-caused hazards, including acts of terror. Eligibility for the grant requires submission by a State or local planning director. The State or local planning director must submit an application to the Secretary demonstrating consistency with guidelines on citizen engagement and multi-jurisdictional cooperation in land use planning legislation or regulation. To effectively assess risks from natural hazards and terrorist acts, planning legislation and regulations are created through multi-agency cooperation between Federal, State, and local government agencies. Land use plans include implementation elements with timetables for action. Comprehensive planning involves defining roles and responsibilities, aligning with budget objectives, and guiding decisions on future infrastructure development. The text chunk discusses the importance of incorporating risk assessment and mitigation into State or locally adopted land use plans, urban design guidelines, building codes, and transportation plans. It also emphasizes the need for updating comprehensive plans over time and ensuring that they reflect appropriate standards. Grant funds received by a State or local government under subsection (a) shall be used for developing comprehensive land use plans, integrating natural hazard mitigation and security plan elements, assessing critical public infrastructure, and mapping infrastructure for land use and community development policies. The grant funds are used for developing land use plans, integrating hazard mitigation, mapping infrastructure, developing GIS, scenario planning technology, updating regulations, implementing CPTED initiatives, and assessing risk and vulnerability related to land use. The grant funds are used for developing land use plans, integrating hazard mitigation, mapping infrastructure, developing GIS, scenario planning technology, updating regulations, implementing CPTED initiatives, and assessing risk and vulnerability related to land use. This includes incorporating mitigation and security elements in transportation plans, facilities, and operations, regional security plans with regional transportation or land use plans, encouraging interagency cooperation, and identifying natural hazard areas for comprehensive plans and building codes updates. The grant amount shall not exceed $1,125,000. The grant amount under subsection (a) is capped at $1,125,000, with a maximum Federal share of 90% for project funding. The Secretary has the discretion to increase the Federal share for Tribal governments or Native Hawaiian organizations lacking sufficient project funds. Coordination efforts by the Secretary aim to promote collaboration on Federal land use initiatives. The Secretary encourages coordination between Federal land management agencies and State or local planning directors for land use planning. The Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security conducts audits on grants to ensure funds are used as specified. The results of audits on grants are considered for future grant awards. Definitions for \"land use planning legislation\" are provided. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of a comprehensive plan as a planning document for regulating land use and urban development. It also defines the term \"State\" as any of the 50 States or the District of Columbia. The curr_chunk defines entities eligible to develop comprehensive plans as States, Tribal governments, and Native Hawaiian organizations. It also defines a State planning director as an official responsible for drafting State guide. The responsibility of the local planning director is to draft and update local comprehensive plans that regulate land use within the jurisdiction of the local government. The term \"Tribal government\" refers to the Tribal government of an Indian Tribe. The term \"Tribal government\" refers to the Tribal government of an Indian Tribe, as defined in the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. SEC. 4. SAFE COMMUNITIES PLANNING RESEARCH. The Secretary of Homeland Security will conduct research on best practices in land use and community planning to reduce threats from natural hazards and terrorism. This includes integrating federal facility security with local plans and examining the impacts of security strategies on the community environment. The Secretary of Homeland Security will report to Congress on best practices in community security and safety planning, evaluating land use codes, development ordinances, software tools, and risk-assessment strategies. The Secretary of Homeland Security will evaluate software tools, codes, ordinances, and design standards to promote safe planning in residential development. Best practices for incorporating safety into infrastructure planning will also be assessed. The Secretary of Homeland Security will evaluate software tools, codes, ordinances, and design standards to promote safe planning in residential development, taking into consideration regional, State, and local differences, and evaluating practices in terms of risk-reduction and cost. Authorization of Appropriations: $57,250,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2019 through 2023. $56,250,000 for grants under section 3 and $300,000 for section 4."
