    "content": "The unemployment rate is defined as the percentage of persons in the civilian labor force age 16 and older who are unemployed. The labor force includes employed and unemployed individuals in the civilian noninstitutional population age 16 and older. Unemployment refers to people actively searching for work in the four weeks before the Current Population Survey. Mathematically, the unemployment rate is expressed as a percentage. The unemployment rate is determined by the number of unemployed workers and the size of the labor force, which can fluctuate during a recession. The labor force may decrease if discouraged workers stop looking for jobs, but it may increase if people believe the economy is improving and start searching for work again. The unemployment rate is a lagging economic indicator that may rise even after a recession ends. Firms are hesitant to hire until they are confident in sustained economic growth. The demand for goods and services may lead to increased production by restoring hours and having employees work overtime instead of hiring new workers. Job growth may not immediately follow an economic turnaround. Labor market analysts rely on the Current Employment Statistics program for job data from nonfarm employers, which is considered more accurate than household surveys. The U.S. economy has experienced 10 recessions since World War II, with varying severity in GDP decline and duration. The Business Cycle Dating Committee uses changes in GDP and employment trends to determine recession periods. Unemployment rates continued to rise during and after each recession. The unemployment rate increased during and after each of the 10 recessions in the U.S. since World War II. The rate peaked at the bottom of the business cycle in three instances, while in the remaining seven recessions, it continued to rise after the recession had ended. The unemployment rate increased during and after each of the 10 recessions in the U.S. since World War II. In three instances, the rate peaked at the bottom of the business cycle, while in the remaining seven recessions, it continued to rise after the recession had ended. Job growth failed to ensue until after the end of all 10 recessions, with only one exception in the very short January-July 1980 recession. During 10 recessions in the U.S. since World War II, job growth typically did not begin immediately after the recession ended. In seven cases, sustained job growth occurred within three to five months of the start of the recovery. However, after the 1990-1991 and 2001 recessions, job growth was significantly delayed, leading to what was termed as \"jobless recoveries.\" The 2001 recession led to jobless recoveries, with employment failing to improve consistently for over a year. While private sector employment started to rise in January 2010, fiscal issues in local governments slowed overall job growth."
