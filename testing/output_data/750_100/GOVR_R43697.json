    "content": "Ebola virus disease (Ebola, or EVD) is a severe, often fatal disease first detected in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1976. It is spread to humans through contact with infected bodily fluids and is not transmitted through the air. In March 2014, an outbreak was reported in Guinea, West Africa, which has become the largest and most persistent ever documented. The Ebola outbreak in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia is the largest and most persistent ever documented. As of late October, nearly 10,000 people have contracted EVD, with almost 5,000 deaths. WHO estimates actual cases may be two to four times higher than reported due to inadequate disease surveillance capacities in the region. Mali reported its first EVD case on October 23. Mali reported its first EVD case on October 23, and there are concerns about undetected cases in Cote d'Ivoire. WHO is sending a team to Mali to assist with clinical management, contact tracing, and social mobilization. Efforts are being made to develop drugs for EVD treatment, with plans to test Ebola vaccines on health workers and volunteers in January. Supportive care is currently used to treat EVD symptoms. The Ebola virus is treated with supportive care to reduce fatality rates. Disease spread can be limited through surveillance and containment measures outlined by WHO manuals. Previous outbreaks have been successfully contained using these methods. The current outbreak in West Africa is not new, but health systems in affected countries struggle to implement necessary containment measures. The current Ebola outbreak in West Africa is distinct from previous outbreaks due to its emergence in new countries and simultaneous multi-country transmission. Efforts to contain the disease have been challenging, with infected individuals importing the virus into other countries. Contact tracing and containment measures have successfully halted the spread in Senegal and Nigeria. The Ebola outbreak in West Africa has spread to new countries, with successful containment efforts in Senegal and Nigeria. In Nigeria, an imported case led to an outbreak infecting 20 people and killing eight, while in Senegal, a single imported case was contained. The WHO is investigating a new case in Mali. In October, health workers in the US and Spain contracted EVD while caring for patients, but no secondary cases have been reported. No other reports of EVD spreading in evacuated patients' countries have emerged. The current Ebola outbreak is spreading rapidly in urban areas in affected countries, where responders are struggling to isolate cases due to lack of resources. In Liberia, cases are doubling every 15-20 days, and in Sierra Leone, cases are doubling every 30-40 days. Weak healthcare systems are contributing to the unabated spread of the virus. A separate Ebola outbreak in the DRC began in late July or early August, with 66 cases and 49 deaths reported as of October 20. This is the seventh outbreak of EVD in the DRC since 1976, with eight deaths among health workers. Congressional actions to address the outbreak are accelerating. Congressional actions to address the Ebola outbreak in the DRC have been accelerating since 1976. In July and September 2014, U.S. Representative Karen Bass and Senator Christopher Coons introduced legislation recognizing the severe impacts and threats of the outbreak. Congress enacted legislation providing $88 million for the Ebola response, with $30 million for CDC activities in West Africa and $58 million for research on treatments and vaccines. Additionally, Congress allowed the Department of Defense to reprogram around $750 million for FY2014. The Department of Defense reprogrammed $750 million of FY2014 funds for Ebola treatment units in Liberia and to support U.S. efforts in the region. The health systems in affected countries were weak before the outbreak and have been overwhelmed. WHO identifies six components of a health system. The affected countries' health systems face severe deficiencies in key areas such as human resources, governance, financing, commodities, service delivery, and information. Constraints in these components enable the virus to spread, leading to perceptions of government ineptitude and mistrust among civilians. Attacks on health workers and facilities have been reported. Reports of attacks on health workers and facilities persist in countries affected by the Ebola outbreak. Some governments have used armed forces to enforce disease control measures and quarantine neighborhoods, leading to public resentment and criticism over concerns about human rights, food scarcity, and unrest. Liberia and Sierra Leone have stopped quarantining some neighborhoods following protests and expert criticisms, although some quarantine zones remain. Sierra Leonean officials deemed the \"Stay Home House to House\" campaign a success, with 92 bodies recovered and 56 Ebola cases detected. Low health spending in affected countries has led to poor conditions in health facilities, causing delays in compensation for workers and contributing to absenteeism. Some health workers left their posts due to safety concerns and frustration. Several local staff at Ebola treatment units in Liberia have not been paid for three months, leading to safety concerns and frustration. Donors, including the United States, are offering financial aid to support payment of health workers' salaries. The outbreak-affected countries lack sufficient financial resources and need support. Donors have pledged assistance, but gaps remain in funding. The United Nations estimates that Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone will need a total of $887 million to address the health and secondary effects of the Ebola outbreak. Severe shortages of health workers and clinics in Liberia are leaving many infected individuals without medical care. Similar challenges exist in Sierra Leone and Guinea, leading to the spread of the virus as people care for the ill on their own. Observers are concerned about the impact of clinic closures on broader health issues, including maternal and child health. Before the Ebola outbreak, maternal and child mortality rates in the affected countries were among the highest in the world. In 2012, over 46,000 women died from pregnancy-related complications in the four countries, with nearly 1 million children affected. In 2012, nearly 1 million children died in the affected countries before reaching their fifth birthday, accounting for roughly 30% of all under-five deaths in sub-Saharan Africa. Pregnant women are avoiding health facilities due to fear of contracting EVD, leading to clinic closures and constraints in medical attention during labor and delivery. More people are now dying in Liberia from treatable ailments. According to the United Nations, more people are dying in Liberia from treatable ailments and common medical conditions than from Ebola. High maternal and child mortality rates in the affected countries are linked to the lack of health workers. Sierra Leone had only two doctors per 100,000 people between 2006 and 2013. Before the Ebola outbreak, Liberia had fewer than 200 doctors, but after the outbreak, only about 50 doctors remained to provide clinical care. EVD deaths among health workers have further reduced staffing. The Ebola outbreak has led to a significant decrease in healthcare workers in Sierra Leone and Liberia, with over 40% of Ebola-related health worker deaths occurring in Liberia. WHO estimates that a facility treating 70 Ebola patients requires at least 250 healthcare workers. The affected countries would need over 13,000 health workers to provide care and stop the spread of Ebola. The affected countries require more than 13,000 health workers for healthcare, contact tracing, and safe burials. Approximately 5% of the personnel will be from foreign countries, with the rest being national staff. Due to a lack of health workers, countries are sending medics to the region. The Ebola outbreak has worsened healthcare access, with many facilities closed in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Urban areas have the majority of health facilities, while Ebola treatment centers are in high prevalence areas. Limited access to healthcare in urban areas and Ebola treatment centers concentrated in high prevalence areas leave a large portion of the population without necessary medical services. This results in people traveling long distances for healthcare, leading to delayed treatment and reduced survival rates for Ebola patients. The affected countries lack essential health services like Ebola treatment centers, laboratories, contact tracing, and safe burial services, hindering efforts to control the outbreak. The affected countries face severe deficiencies in essential health services like Ebola treatment centers, laboratories, contact tracing, and safe burial services. Patients turned away from treatment facilities often return to their communities, potentially infecting more people. Liberia has the most severe treatment shortage, with only 23% of the needed beds for EVD patients. Treatment capacity is expected to improve with U.S. support. Treatment capacity in Liberia is expected to improve with U.S. support for the construction of 27 ETUs, including 12 by the Department of Defense. Health experts are investigating a decrease in Ebola care seekers, leading to vacant beds. Safe disposal of dead bodies is increasing, with 90% removed within 24 hours. Efforts are being made to adapt traditional funeral practices to prevent EVD transmission. Concerns remain about the poor quality of health care delivery. The poor quality of health care delivery in Liberia is a concern, with inconsistent adherence to infection control protocols contributing to Ebola cases among health workers. CDC investigations identified multiple opportunities for transmission of the virus to healthcare workers, including inadequate use of protective equipment and hand washing. CDC Director Tom Frieden highlighted challenges in sanitation and healthcare infrastructure in the affected region. Limited availability of gloves, hand washing facilities, and running water in health centers hinders efforts to control the spread of Ebola. Poor conditions of health facilities discourage attendance, while power outages and water supply interruptions are common. Ambulance services are scarce, with one district in Sierra Leone having only four ambulances for a population of 465,000 people, leading to overcrowding and delays in transporting ill individuals, regardless of their Ebola infection status. Limited availability of protective gear in health facilities increases the risk of Ebola spread among healthcare workers and the general population. WHO noted the shortage of appropriate equipment, primarily provided to workers in Ebola treatment centers, leaving others at risk of contracting and spreading the disease. Shortages of PPE, antibiotics, and safe blood in ETUs pose challenges in treating Ebola. Price hikes for disinfectants and medicine due to health system deficiencies. Transportation difficulties for aid workers and supplies in affected countries persist despite efforts to improve alternative routes. Limited air service remains a problem. Awareness about preventing EVD infection has improved, but poverty, infrastructural deficiencies, and health system constraints hinder many from avoiding infection. Consumption of wild animals, including fruit bats, is common in areas with high food insecurity. Health officials are expanding efforts to inform the public about the risks associated with eating wild animals. Efforts to contain the Ebola outbreak are hindered by weak laboratory and surveillance systems, leading to uncertainty about the number of cases and hindering containment efforts. Limited laboratory capacity has resulted in extensive diagnosis backlogs, endangering health workers and hindering containment efforts. The financial requirements for containing the Ebola outbreak are rising as the number of cases increases. WHO estimated it would cost $4.8 million in March, but revised its response plan in August to approximately $490 million. Efforts to contain the outbreak are hindered by weak laboratory and surveillance systems. The Ebola response plan was revised in August, estimating a cost of $490 million to contain the outbreak. The outbreak had spread to Sierra Leone and Nigeria, causing 3,685 cases and 1,841 deaths. The United Nations established UNMEER to coordinate the international response, urging member states to support affected countries. The $988 million U.N. integrated Ebola response plan aims to address health and social impacts of the outbreak. Donors have contributed $493 million and pledged an additional $279 million towards the plan. Resources are also being provided for addressing the Ebola outbreak outside of the UN response. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) estimates that $894 million has been committed for addressing the outbreak, with an additional $938 million pledged for immediate and long-term preparedness needs. WHO and UNOCHA may revise their funding requests as the outbreak spreads. Roughly half of the U.N. request is for direct health impacts, with the World Health Organization leading efforts to contain the outbreak by January 2014. WHO's Ebola Response Roadmap outlines measures for the international community to take. The WHO's Ebola Response Roadmap requested $490 million for building referring and isolation centers, increasing diagnostic capacity, and attracting health workers. Pledges for sending health workers have increased, but human resource constraints hinder containment efforts. Countries like Cuba and the U.S. have pledged medical support to the region. Cuba, U.S., Britain, China, African Union, and East African Community have pledged to send health workers to combat Ebola in Liberia. The Liberian Government, WHO, CDC, and partners are implementing the Community Care Campaign to target vulnerable households initially and expand coverage. The Community Care Campaign aims to establish community care centers (CCCs) managed by NGOs, CHWs, and family members of EVD patients to complement Ebola Treatment Units. CCCs are being set up in Sierra Leone, with similarities and differences outlined in Table 4. The United States is a major funder of the international Ebola response. The United States is the leading funder of the international Ebola response, with financial support continuing to rise. As of October 22, U.S. humanitarian funding for EVD responses totaled $344.6 million. The Department of Defense is planning to spend over $1 billion on containing the outbreak in West Africa. President Obama established an Ebola Czar to coordinate U.S. domestic and global responses, with four key goals in the U.S. Global Ebola strategy. The U.S. is the top funder of the international Ebola response, with financial support increasing. The U.S. has nearly 900 personnel in the region, with over 700 military personnel deployed. Efforts focus on controlling the outbreak, mitigating impacts, establishing leadership, and advancing global health security. Activities build on prior capacity-building efforts for disease outbreaks. Since 2005, USAID has invested roughly $1 billion in pandemic preparedness efforts, including responding to disease outbreaks like Ebola. Other U.S. agencies such as CDC, Departments of Agriculture, Defense, and State also contribute to these efforts. In FY2014, USAID spent $72.5 million on detecting, preparing for, and responding to potential pandemics originating in animals. In FY2014, USAID spent $72.5 million on pandemic preparedness efforts through the Emerging and Pandemic Threats program, operating in 18 countries in Africa and Asia. The program focuses on viral detection and risk determination in wildlife, livestock, and human populations to identify potential public health threats. USAID focuses on pandemic preparedness efforts through the Emerging and Pandemic Threats program, including viral detection in wildlife, livestock, and human populations to identify public health threats. A \"one health\" approach is emphasized, along with outbreak response capacity and risk reduction. A Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) has been deployed to West Africa to coordinate the U.S. Government's response to the Ebola outbreak. Between March and October 2014, USAID committed over $300 million to combat Ebola in West Africa, providing resources such as treatment beds, protective equipment, and hygiene kits. They also supported the IFRC in raising public awareness and training volunteers to detect Ebola symptoms. USAID and CDC are actively involved in disease prevention efforts, including training volunteers to detect Ebola symptoms and supporting safe burial activities. USAID has reprogrammed funds to support these initiatives, while CDC funds its global pandemic preparedness efforts through various accounts. The Centers leverage resources from these accounts to respond to global disease outbreaks, including Ebola. CDC has requested additional support in FY2015 ($45 million) to fund activities for the Global Health Security Agenda, accelerating efforts to detect, prevent, and respond to global infectious disease threats like Ebola. CDC supports pandemic influenza preparedness in over 50 countries through various partnerships and expert deployments. In March 2014, CDC teams traveled to Guinea to assist with disease outbreak response. CDC teams traveled to Guinea and Liberia to help Health Ministries control the Ebola outbreak, conduct contact tracing, and improve data management. CDC resumed technical assistance efforts as new cases flared up. They are also training airport personnel and displaying Ebola-specific travel messages at airports in affected countries. CDC is not providing direct care to Ebola patients. As of October 22, 2014, CDC has committed over $16.7 million for its Ebola responses. DOD announced a $22 million funding for a 25-bed field hospital in Liberia to treat EVD cases among healthcare workers. HHS U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps will deploy 65 officers to manage and staff the hospital in Liberia. Military personnel will set up and supply the facility, but not provide direct care. President Barack Obama announced the launch of \"Operation United Assistance\" in Monrovia, Liberia, involving 4,000 U.S. military forces overseen by the DOD U.S. Africa Command. The operation will support relief efforts, train health workers, and establish 12 treatment centers with 100-bed capacity each. The first 22-bed ETC is expected to be completed by the end of October. Efforts are underway to combat the Ebola outbreak in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. A 22-bed ETC is set to be completed by the end of October, with three more to follow in November. Over 700 U.S. military personnel, including personnel from the U.S. Naval Medical Research Center, are in the region operating mobile medical labs for EVD testing. Congress has approved DOD funding exceeding $1 billion for Operation United Assistance and related activities, including supplying protective equipment, laboratory inputs, and technical advisors. The Ebola outbreak in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia has overwhelmed their governments, leading to a spread of the virus and weakening health systems. Congress has enacted legislation to expand U.S. and international responses and provide funds for containment efforts. The Administration may request additional funds as the outbreak continues to spread. The Ebola outbreak in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia has overwhelmed their governments, leading to a spread of the virus and weakening health systems. WHO estimated that 13,000 health workers are needed to contain the outbreak, with human resource constraints most acute in Liberia. The United States has partnered with Liberia, WHO, and other groups to develop a Community Care Campaign to address the shortage of health workers. Doctors Without Borders has expressed concerns about the effectiveness of the campaign. MSF has raised concerns about the Community Care Campaign, warning of the risk of turning CCCs into \"contamination centers\" without proper infection control, supplies, trained staff, supervision, diagnostic capabilities, and burial methods. WHO also acknowledges the potential for virus transmission within CCCs due to implementation deficiencies. Key challenges include inconsistent adherence to infection control protocols leading to EVD cases among health workers. The inability to ensure infection prevention and control protocols among health workers raises concerns about adherence to protocols by non-governmental organizations, community health workers, and family members providing Ebola care in CCCs. WHO recommends only one family member provide care for each patient in CCCs to prevent the spread of EVD. The WHO recommends only one family member provide care for each patient in CCCs to prevent the spread of EVD. Compliance with this guideline may be challenging due to common collective familial care practices in Liberia and other factors such as loss of income and emotional stress. In order to prevent the spread of EVD within CCCs, caretakers must follow strict protocol in using PPE and managing waste. The affected countries face deficiencies in waste management and sanitation facilities, making it challenging to ensure adherence to IPC protocol among lay caretakers without medical training. The Community Care Campaign emphasizes the importance of monitoring and supervision for low-level health workers in CCCs to ensure compliance with IPC protocols and proper use of PPE. Supply chain management issues may impact the availability of necessary resources. Due to poor supply chain management practices, health clinics in affected countries lack essential medical supplies like gloves, masks, and gowns, leading to a risk of EVD infection among health workers. The lack of protective equipment in ETUs and clinics can result in unsafe practices, such as reusing PPE. WHO and partners face challenges in ensuring a continuous supply of commodities to CCCs. The U.S. is implementing the Community Care Campaign by issuing grants to NGOs to manage Community Care Centers in Liberia. USAID oversees the implementation to ensure program targets are met, but questions remain about U.S. oversight. Ministries of Health advise starting with pilot programs before scaling up. Observers have criticized WHO leadership over the global Ebola response, citing budget cuts that have reduced effectiveness and capacity to contain outbreaks. The 2014-2015 WHO program budget called for a 51% reduction in outbreak and crisis response activities, leading to concerns about critical staff reductions. Some critics argue that WHO's response to the Ebola outbreak has been hindered by budget cuts, staff reductions, bureaucratic issues, and weak health systems in affected countries. There are debates on whether WHO should focus on advisory roles or maintain operational capacity. Some analysts suggest establishing a WHO-administered \"Health Systems Fund\" to build long-term health system capacity and address crises like the Ebola outbreak. The weak health systems in West Africa have contributed to the rapid spread of Ebola. Donors have struggled to address health emergencies in countries with dysfunctional health systems. In the early 2000s, donors shifted to disease-based funding through non-governmental groups, sparking debate on how it affects public health systems. The introduction of PEPFAR intensified this discussion on the impact of disease-specific programs on health system capacity. In an effort to combat HIV/AIDS deaths, U.S. agencies funded non-governmental organizations and local partners to establish care facilities. This initiative saved millions of lives and prevented HIV infections, but reliance on U.S. funding puts millions at risk if discontinued. The second phase of PEPFAR focused on supporting health systems to enhance country capacity for HIV/AIDS programs. In its third phase, debate on using PEPFAR funds for health system building has resumed. A 2013 GAO report noted 21% of funds were spent on capacity building projects. PEPFAR Country Coordinator aims to allocate 50% of resources to care and treatment activities. Budgetary reforms may jeopardize health system strengthening efforts. The U.S. Congress is facing a dilemma with the current Ebola outbreak, as affected countries require focused support to contain it. However, without support for developing strong health systems, they may not be prepared for future disease outbreaks. Ken Isaacs from Samaritan's Purse highlighted this issue during a congressional hearing in August 2014. The USAID has established an Ebola Health Systems Strengthening working group to support healthcare delivery and bolster health systems post-outbreak. However, funding for health systems strengthening is lacking, with most aid directed towards specific diseases. The majority of health aid is directed towards specific diseases, leaving minimal resources for broader health system strengthening activities. The ongoing Ebola outbreak is being responded to by various U.S. agencies, with each agency having a specific role in the response efforts. The budgetary structure of various U.S. agencies allows them to respond to unanticipated events like the Ebola outbreak. The Department of State coordinates diplomatic efforts through existing channels without needing additional funding. The CDC can use disaster assistance accounts for outbreak responses, and the DOD budget supports domestic and international health activities. The DOD budget supports domestic and international health activities, including responses to outbreaks like Ebola. USAID receives specific direction from Congress on fund usage, limiting its ability to address unanticipated events without reprogramming funds. The current appropriation structure for addressing outbreaks like Ebola is seen as a tool for overseeing health programs by supporters, while opponents argue that congressional directives limit agility in the field. Disease outbreaks are unpredictable, but with proper surveillance and response mechanisms, their impact can be minimized. USAID pandemic preparedness efforts are focused on East and Central Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and West Africa where Ebola has emerged. The FY2015 budget request is $50 million, 30% less than FY2014. Even if Congress funds at the FY2014 level, it may not be enough to meet current demands. Experts predict that the Ebola outbreak can be contained by the end of January, but the high death tolls are causing disruptions in social structures and may have long-term effects. MSF reports that some villages in Sierra Leone have lost most adult community members, leaving vulnerable populations without resources. Concerns also arise about the growing number of orphaned children, who are at risk of marginalization due to fear of Ebola. The Ebola outbreak in West and Central Africa has left a large number of orphaned children, with over 4 million losing parents to AIDS. This vulnerable group faces marginalization due to fear of the virus. The outbreak is straining government resources and hindering efforts to address other health issues, potentially leading to higher child and maternal mortality rates. The Ebola outbreak in West and Central Africa has led to orphaned children, with over 4 million losing parents to AIDS. This vulnerable group faces marginalization due to fear of the virus. The outbreak has strained government resources, hindering efforts to address other health issues, potentially increasing child and maternal mortality rates. The full health effects of the Ebola outbreak may not be known until it is contained, sparking debates on global health assistance funds allocation. Congress may face arguments from advocates for various health and development issues worsened by Ebola, including poverty, food scarcity, and water-borne infections. Since 1976, Ebola outbreaks have occurred in sub-Saharan Africa with no specific cure, treatment, or vaccine available. Experimental treatments and vaccines are being tested in clinical trials to improve survival rates. The use of untested drugs raises ethical concerns, especially regarding equity in access to healthcare. The debate over equity in access to experimental Ebola drugs raises ethical concerns, particularly regarding administering untested drugs to African patients. The World Health Organization (WHO) held a special meeting in August to address this issue. The World Health Organization (WHO) deemed it ethical to offer unproven interventions for Ebola treatment or prevention under specific conditions. WHO planned to test two Ebola vaccines on 20,000 health workers in January and provide experimental treatment in Liberia by early November. A meeting was held with government representatives, development partners, and vaccine manufacturers at the end of October. A meeting was held with government representatives, development partners, civil society, regulatory agencies, vaccine manufacturers, and funding agencies to fast track testing and deployment of Ebola vaccines. WHO warned bordering countries of Ebola risk, with Mali reporting its first case. The WHO is assisting neighboring countries in building EVD surveillance and response plans. A study by Oxford University raised concerns about potential future Ebola outbreaks in Central and West Africa due to the presence of fruit bats in forested areas. Changes in human mobility could impact the spread of Ebola cases. Urban areas and countries with limited pandemic preparedness capacity are at risk for future outbreaks. The U.S. response to the Ebola outbreak and support for pandemic preparedness efforts are questioned. Reprogramming of USAID funds for Ebola may impact global health programs. Ongoing outbreak responses aim to improve affected countries' capacity to respond to future outbreaks."
