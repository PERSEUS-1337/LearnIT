    "content": "The role of natural gas in the U.S. economy has been a major part of the energy policy debate in Congress. Both the House and the Senate have held hearings and introduced bills related to natural gas. This report highlights global natural gas markets, supply and demand, and major U.S. developments. Natural gas is considered a potential bridge fuel to a lower-carbon economy due to its cleaner burning properties compared to coal and oil. Natural gas emits fewer pollutants than coal and oil when used in power plants. Fugitive emissions can occur during industry operations. The United States leads in shale gas extraction, prompting other countries to follow suit, although progress is slow outside of North America. The United States leads in shale gas extraction, prompting other countries to develop shale gas. Progress is slow outside of North America, but if the U.S. and other countries can bring large new volumes of natural gas to market at a competitive price, natural gas could play a larger role in the world's economy. Factors such as price, technical capability, environmental concerns, and political considerations will determine the market's growth. The development of U.S. unconventional natural gas resources is being closely monitored by countries worldwide. Natural gas consumption is increasing globally, with the United States leading in consumption. U.S. unconventional natural gas reserves, particularly shale gas, have seen rapid growth in recent years. The growth of U.S. unconventional natural gas reserves, especially shale gas, has led to a shift from being a net importer to a potential net exporter. Global natural gas trade is expanding, with the U.S. as the largest consumer. In 2015, the world consumed 122,442 bcf of natural gas, making up 23.8% of total global energy consumption. In 2015, the United States was the world's largest consumer of natural gas, accounting for 22.8% of global consumption. Russia was the second-largest consumer, using 13,820 bcf. Natural gas consumption in Russia declined by 8% between 2011 and 2015 due to a weak economic environment. Global consumption of natural gas grew at 1.7%, with the United States contributing the largest growth in absolute terms. China and Iran saw increased natural gas consumption, with China being the largest global energy consumer due to its growing economy. China's use of natural gas has risen in the past decade but still only accounts for about 5% of its energy consumption. Iran, holding the world's second-largest natural gas reserves, also experienced growth in consumption. Iran holds the world's second-largest natural gas reserves, but its energy sector has stagnated due to sanctions and lack of investment. Domestic energy demand has increased by 50% since 2004, with natural gas making up 60% of total energy consumption in 2014. The lifting of sanctions in 2016 has raised discussions on Iran's natural gas production capacity and its role in the global energy market. The United States is the largest consumer of natural gas, accounting for 23% of global consumption in 2015. Natural gas is mainly used for electric power generation (35%), industrial use (27%), residential use (17%), and commercial use (12%). The increase in natural gas usage for power generation is due to low prices and policies promoting cleaner fuels. The United States is the largest consumer of natural gas, mainly used for power generation and industrial purposes. Demand for natural gas has doubled since 2000 and is expected to grow by 40% by 2040. The industrial sector in the U.S. has increased its consumption of natural gas by 10% between 2010 and 2015. Global proved natural gas reserves amount to 6,599 trillion cubic feet. Global natural gas reserves totaled 6,599 trillion cubic feet in 2015, with a 53-year supply at current production levels. Reserves have grown by 19% since 2005, mainly controlled by government-owned companies. Russia's Gazprom is majority state-owned. In 2015, U.S. natural gas reserves were 368,700 bcf, with shale gas driving the increase. Global natural gas production grew by 2.2%, below the 10-year average. U.S. natural gas production accounted for 22% of total global production in 2015. Between 2005 and 2015, U.S. natural gas production increased by 50%, reaching 27,086 bcf in 2015. The growth is mainly attributed to the development of unconventional resources like the Marcellus and Utica shale formations, accounting for 85% of the increase since 2012. Despite low prices, U.S. natural gas production continues to rise, with a 65% increase between 2005 and 2015. Shale gas production in the U.S. is projected to increase by 73% to 19.6 tcf by 2040, leading to a 45% overall increase in total U.S. natural gas production. LNG trade increased by 1.8% in 2015, with LNG accounting for 33% of the global gas trade. In 2015, LNG trade increased by 1.8%, accounting for 33% of the global gas trade. Australia and the United States launched their first LNG shipments in 2016. The United States initially planned to increase LNG imports but shifted focus to domestic production due to rising prices. This led to modifications and expansions of existing LNG terminals. The U.S. natural gas market is undergoing a transition with the expansion of LNG terminals to increase export capacity. Technologies like hydraulic fracturing have boosted domestic gas supply, making unconventional resources economically competitive. Production has shifted to regions with shale, coal seams, and tight rock formations. Production has shifted to regions like the Marcellus and Utica Basins in the East and Northeast, impacting natural gas transportation. Increased production from shale plays like Marcellus has reduced prices and imports, with future growth expected. Increased production from shale plays like Marcellus, Eagle Ford, Anadarko, Utica, and Haynesville Basins has led the United States to shift from a net importer to a projected net exporter of natural gas by 2017. The first LNG shipments from the lower-48 occurred in February 2016 from the Sabine Pass LNG Terminal in Louisiana. The Panama Canal reopened in June 2016, reducing transit time from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to Asian markets. The Panama Canal reopened in June 2016, reducing transit time from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to Asian markets for potential U.S. LNG shipments. This development has strategic implications for the United States in the global natural gas market, raising questions about the impact on domestic gas prices and the economy. The use and disposition of water in hydraulic fracturing is a major concern for companies and regulators due to potential impacts on drinking water quality and quantity. The EPA initiated a study in 2010 to assess these impacts, but a final report has not been released yet. Deep-well injection is also a source of concern. The concern over deep-well injection and human-caused earthquakes arises from the wastewater disposal in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. Methane emissions from the natural gas sector are also worrisome due to their impact on human health and the environment. The EPA established national air standards in 2012 to reduce methane and VOC emissions in the natural gas sector. In 2016, the NSPS was updated to include additional equipment in the gas production chain, covering well sites, processing plants, and compressor stations. However, federal standards do not address all sources of methane emissions. The production of natural gas in the United States is expanding, raising concerns about methane as an air pollutant. Global and regional markets for natural gas are becoming more integrated, with about 30% of natural gas traded internationally. Natural gas is transported by pipeline or as LNG, with LNG trade increasing by 1.8% in 2015. Global LNG trade increased by 1.8% in 2015, accounting for 33% of the global gas trade. The majority of natural gas is sold under long-term contracts indexed to oil prices, except in the U.S. where prices are market-based. U.S. LNG exports have influenced other countries to reconsider their pricing strategies. Long-term contracts, typically 20 years, are common for international gas trade due to expensive transportation costs. The spot market for natural gas is growing, with Russia and Qatar being major exporters. Europe is the largest importing region of natural gas. Europe is the largest importing region of natural gas, receiving most of its imports by pipeline from Russia, Norway, and Algeria. Recent developments have pushed the European Union to consider more secure sources of natural gas. Asia relies mostly on LNG, but China has become more reliant on imported gas via pipeline from Kazakhstan, Myanmar, and Turkmenistan. China is Turkmenistan's primary importer of natural gas. The United States and Canada have an integrated pipeline system, with Canada and Mexico being the only recipients of U.S. natural gas. Exports of U.S. natural gas by pipeline to Mexico are expected to increase to 1.5 tcf by 2040, while exports to Canada are projected to rise slightly to 0.75 tcf. U.S. LNG prices are market-based, creating an economic incentive for exports. The first cargo of U.S. LNG was shipped to Brazil from the Sabine Pass Liquefaction export terminal in Louisiana. The U.S. natural gas market is a center of debate for policymakers, focusing on its global impact, geopolitics, and domestic prices. There are multiple LNG export terminal projects in operation and under construction in the lower-48 states, including Sabine Pass Liquefaction, Dominion-Cove Point LNG, Cameron LNG, Freeport LNG Expansion, and Cheniere Marketing-Corpus Christi LNG. The Kenai LNG terminal in Alaska continues to supply LNG to Japan. In February 2016, the United States began shipping LNG to Barbados from Miami in cryogenic containers. These containers can be transported over land and loaded onto ships. The natural gas from these shipments has been sold at a higher price than the Sabine Pass exports, ranging from $10 to almost $16 per MBtus. In 2014, a small amount of LNG was shipped to Honolulu, HI using this method for the first time. Alaska has great potential to become a major source of natural gas according to the US Geological Survey. Alaska has potential to become a major source of natural gas with estimated resources exceeding 200,000 bcf. Officials have pushed for a pipeline to sell natural gas internationally as LNG, but it is considered commercially challenging as of 2016. The TPP, a trade agreement involving the United States and several countries, could impact U.S. natural gas trade by expediting permits for exports to FTA partners. The TTIP, a proposed trade agreement between the U.S. and the EU, aims to promote trade and economic growth through addressing market access, regulation, and cooperation. The TPP and TTIP trade agreements aim to promote trade and economic growth by addressing market access, regulation, and cooperation. The United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris resulted in the Paris Agreement, which governs measures for emissions mitigation, adaptation, and finance. The United States signed the agreement in April 2016. U.S. infrastructure may struggle to keep up with demands. Investment in natural gas interstate pipelines may range from $2.6 billion to $3.5 billion annually between 2015 and 2030, posing challenges due to other infrastructure demands. Factors affecting domestic and international markets include oil prices, new infrastructure, technological development, interdependence between gas and electric sectors, and climate and environmental policy. The Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF) plays a role in the gas industry. The Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF), known as gas OPEC, is a cartel organization based in Qatar with 11 natural gas producing countries. Formed in 2001, it holds 62% of global natural gas reserves. Despite the U.S.'s significant natural gas resources, the GECF is unlikely to impact U.S. consumption in the near future. Canada, the largest source of imported natural gas to the U.S., is not a member. Canada, the largest source of imported natural gas to the United States, is not a member of the Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF). Europe, heavily reliant on gas imports from GECF members like Russia and Algeria, is vulnerable to cartel control. However, the current market structure with long-term contracts and specific pipelines limits supply and price manipulation. Global natural gas production in 2015 grew by 2.2%, below the 10-year average of 2.4%. The United States surpassed Russia as the world's top producer. The United States surpassed Russia as the world's largest natural gas producer in 2009, leading to an evaluation of potential natural gas resources in other countries. However, most countries lack the necessary data, technology, and equipment for shale gas production. Commercial production outside of the US and Canada is unlikely before the end of the decade. The price of natural gas in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom is determined by market hubs like the Henry Hub in Erath, LA. Different consumer categories pay varying prices, with residential consumers paying the highest. The EIA projects the Henry Hub natural gas spot price to reach $7.85 per MBtu by 2040 due to increased domestic demand. The EIA projects the price of natural gas to rise to $7.85 per MBtu due to increased demand, requiring more well completions for higher production levels. Natural gas prices are commonly linked to crude oil prices in long-term contracts outside the US, Canada, and the UK. The disparity between contract and spot prices for natural gas has pressured producers to reconsider pricing strategies. Some have started incorporating spot prices into their formulas, reflecting regional differences in the industry. Asia, in particular, is willing to pay high prices for natural gas supplies. Asia, in particular, is willing to pay high prices for natural gas supplies. Two key contract concepts are take-or-pay clauses and destination clauses. Take-or-pay clauses require buyers to pay regardless of gas receipt, while destination clauses allow redirection of cargo. The natural gas industry is facing the question of whether it should become the world's primary energy source. The International Energy Agency predicts a 60% increase in demand for natural gas by 2040, with most of the new demand coming from non-OECD countries like China and the Middle East. This shift is driven by a global push to decarbonize the energy system. China and the Middle East are projected to be major contributors to global gas production. China's shift towards a services-focused economy may reduce its future energy consumption by 85%. India is expected to increase its contribution to global energy demand. India is projected to contribute significantly to global energy demand, with natural gas making up a small portion of its energy mix. Meeting India's energy needs could require a substantial financial investment of nearly $2.8 trillion. The U.S. electric power industry is driving growth in natural gas demand due to factors like low prices and competitive financing. Government policies on carbon dioxide emissions will play a crucial role in shaping the energy landscape. Government policies, especially regarding carbon dioxide emissions, will impact the growth of natural gas usage. Globally, natural gas is expected to make up 28% of total electricity generation by 2040, with non-OECD countries accounting for 61% of this. Production needs to increase to meet demand and stabilize prices. Unconventional gas resources like coal bed methane, shale gas, and tight gas are driving global supply growth, with slower development outside of North America. China has policies that support gas development. China's unconventional resource development is hindered by limited water availability, geology, and population density in resource-rich areas. Government policies support gas development, but production growth may be slower and uneven."
