    "content": "The \"Cut, Cap, and Balance Act of 2015\" is also known as the \"Cut\" Act. It modifies the Congressional Budget Act by adding spending limits. The \"Cut, Cap, and Balance Act of 2015\" sets spending limits for fiscal year 2016 to prevent exceeding specified budget authority and outlays. Adjustments can be made after bills related to the global war on terrorism are reported or amendments are offered. The \"Cut, Cap, and Balance Act of 2015\" allows the chair of the House or Senate Committee on the Budget to adjust spending limits for congressional enforcement based on new budget authority in a measure and its outlays. The \"Cut, Cap, and Balance Act of 2015\" allows the House or Senate Committee on Appropriations to adjust suballocations for fiscal year 2016, specifically for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism. Adjustments provided in subsection (c) apply to fiscal year 2016 appropriations designated for this purpose. Adjustments for fiscal year 2016 appropriations under the \"Cut, Cap, and Balance Act of 2015\" shall not exceed $58 billion in budget authority and outlays. SEC. 317. CERTAIN SPENDING LIMITS. The House of Representatives and Senate cannot consider any bill that would exceed specified spending limits, except for certain exempt functions like Social Security, Medicare, Veterans Benefits, Net Interest, and Military personnel accounts. SEC. 102. STATUTORY ENFORCEMENT OF SPENDING CAPS THROUGH SEQUESTRATION. Title III of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 is amended to include enforcement of discretionary and direct spending caps. The sequesters will be implemented for discretionary and direct spending limits separately, in accordance with the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. The Balanced Budget and Control Act of 1985 exempts certain payments from sequestration, including military personnel accounts, TRICARE for Life, Medicare, military retirement, Social Security, veterans, net interest, and discretionary appropriations. The Presidential Order can be modified after the Director of the Office of Management and Budget issues a sequestration report. The Office of Management and Budget issues a sequestration report under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. Provisions apply to the consideration of a bill to override the order if it achieves the same level of reductions in budget authority and outlays. A point of order is established in the House of Representatives or Senate against considering a bill that does not meet these criteria. The Senate cannot consider a bill that alters a sequestration order unless it achieves the same budget reductions as the order. TITLE II--CAP\n\nSEC. 201. LIMIT ON TOTAL SPENDING. Section 250(c) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is amended to redefine the term 'GDP' as the gross domestic product consistent with Department of Commerce definitions for any fiscal year. Additionally, Title III of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 is amended to include a new section after section 318, related to caps on spending. \"SEC. 319. ENFORCING GDP OUTLAY LIMITS.\" The term 'GDP outlay limit' refers to an amount calculated by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget based on projected GDP for each fiscal year, with specific percentages set for fiscal years 2016 to 2022. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget sets GDP outlay limits for each fiscal year, with 18 percent allocated for fiscal years 2022 to 2025. Total federal outlays include all on-budget and off-budget expenditures. Sequestration to enforce this section follows guidelines from the Balanced Budget Act. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 outlines implementation procedures, with exemptions for certain programs like military personnel, TRICARE, Medicare, military retirement, Social Security, veterans, and net interest payments. SEC. 202. ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES UNDER THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET ACT OF 1974. This section amends Title III of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 by adding enforcement procedures. SEC. 320. ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES. The House and Senate cannot consider any legislation that would exceed the current GDP outlay limits. TITLE III--BALANCE\n\nSEC. 301. REQUIREMENT THAT A BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT BE SUBMITTED TO STATES. The Secretary of the Treasury cannot use additional borrowing authority until the Archivist of the United States sends a balanced budget amendment to the States. This amendment must limit total outlays to not exceed total receipts, set a spending cap as a percentage of GDP, and mandate that tax increases require a 2/3 vote in Congress for approval. It is not allowed in the House or Senate to consider any bill or joint resolution that does not comply with these requirements. The House or Senate cannot pass any bill allowing the Secretary of the Treasury to borrow more money until the Archivist of the United States sends a balanced budget amendment to the States."
