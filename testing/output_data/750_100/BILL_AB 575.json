    "title": "AB 575",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The state board is required to adopt basic instructional materials for kindergarten and grades 1 to 8, with a minimum of five materials for each subject area. The state board is required to adopt basic instructional materials for various subjects including language arts, mathematics, science, social science, and bilingual or bicultural subjects. The adoption of materials for each subject area is regulated to prevent consecutive adoptions in the same grade level. The state board is required to adopt basic instructional materials for various subjects including science, social science, and bilingual or bicultural subjects, as well as any other subject deemed necessary. Procedures for submission of materials must be followed. The state board adopts instructional materials for different subjects every eight years, with restrictions on resubmission of rejected materials without substantive changes. If a publisher or manufacturer submits revisions to adopted instructional material after the specified timeframe, the department will charge a fee not exceeding the reasonable costs for reviewing the material. Instructional materials must be adopted or rejected within six months of submission, with a possible extension of up to three months if needed due to volume, complexity, or other circumstances. The review process for instructional materials involves committees with volunteer experts and teachers from various grade levels and subjects. Rules for adoption must be transparent and consistent for all formats of materials. When reviewing basic instructional materials, the state board must ensure they align with the curriculum framework and meet specified standards. Compliance with state guidelines for social content is also required. Instructional materials must be factually accurate, aligned with state content standards, and free from unnecessary commercial branding. Commercial branding can only be included if deemed appropriate by the state board based on specific findings. The use of commercial brand names, products, or logos in instructional materials must be necessary for educational purposes or incidental to illustrations. To meet criteria set by the state board for educational materials adoption, as required by California Constitution and Statutes of 1989, approved at least 12 months before adoption. The state board may provide written explanations for rejecting instructional materials based on established criteria. They can adopt fewer than five materials if less are submitted. If fewer than five basic instructional materials meet the criteria or fail to meet the state board's curriculum framework, the state board will conduct a review. The state board has the authority to adopt materials that are not basic instructional materials. The state board shall prescribe procedures for an open and flexible materials submission system to ensure diverse educational needs are met in public schools. This includes providing instructional materials that represent cultural pluralism and a broad spectrum of knowledge and technology-based materials. The state board adopts instructional materials and provides a listing with unit costs for publishers and school interests. The materials remain on the list until a new curriculum framework is adopted. The state board adopts instructional materials and provides a listing with unit costs for publishers and school interests. Lists of adopted instructional materials by subject and grade level are available on the department's website, including information from review committees' reports. This includes publisher details and logos for basic information, copyright protection, and content sources. The state board may adopt regulations for exceptions to this section, as determined by the state board. The Superintendent will develop guidelines for implementation. Section 60227 is added to the Education Code for followup adoptions within an eight-year cycle. Before conducting a followup adoption in a subject area, the department must post a notice on their website and notify publishers. Publishers participating will be assessed a fee based on the number of programs and grade levels submitted for review. The department will charge a fee for follow-up adoptions to cover costs, keeping it reasonable by avoiding duplication of work from the primary adoption process. The department requires publishers or manufacturers to declare intent to submit specific programs for follow-up adoption, specifying grade levels, and pay a fee even if they withdraw a program later. Publishers or manufacturers must declare intent to submit programs for adoption, specify grade levels, and pay a fee before their submission can be reviewed. The Legislature intends for the fee for participation in follow-up adoptions to not be prohibitive for small publishers or manufacturers. The state board may reduce the fee upon request from a small publisher or manufacturer meeting specific criteria. The revenue from fees for follow-up adoptions will be budgeted for reimbursements and can cover adoption and instructional material review costs. If there is little interest from publishers, the follow-up adoption may not be conducted. General fund revenue cannot be used for follow-up adoption costs. This section will be in effect until January 1, 2024, and will be repealed on that date unless a later statute extends it before then."
