    "title": "AB 2362",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Existing law in California requires landlords to provide written notification to tenants before applying pesticides in certain ways to dwelling units or common areas. The notification must include details such as the pest to be targeted, the pesticide to be used, the frequency of its use, and a health and safety statement. The bill aims to ensure that owners and tenants in common interest developments are notified in writing before pesticides are applied, whether by the homeowner association or its agents, to protect those who could be impacted by the pesticide. Section 4777 of the Civil Code defines terms related to pesticide application in common interest developments, including \"adjacent separate interest,\" \"authorized agent,\" \"broadcast application,\" and \"electronic delivery.\" A licensed pest control operator is someone authorized by the state to apply pesticides. A pest is a living organism that causes damage to property or economic loss, or transmits diseases. A pesticide is any substance intended to control, destroy, repel, or mitigate pests or organisms, excluding certain antimicrobial pesticides. An association or its agent must provide written notice to the owner and tenant of a separate interest before applying pesticides without a licensed pest control operator. The notice should include the pests to be controlled and the name of the pesticide product to be used. State law requires providing information on the name and brand of the pesticide product to be used. CAUTION \u2013 PESTICIDES ARE TOXIC CHEMICALS. Certain pesticides can be used without a license if used properly. Risks depend on exposure, so minimize exposure. If experiencing symptoms similar to flu within 24 hours of pesticide application, contact a healthcare provider or Poison Control. For Health Questions, contact the County Health Department. For Regulatory Information, call the Department of Pesticide Regulation at 916-324-4100. The association must provide notice of pesticide application at least 48 hours in advance to owners and tenants of the affected separate interests, as well as adjacent separate interests. The notification should include the approximate date, time, and frequency of the application, with a disclaimer that these details are subject to change. Prior to pesticide application in a common area, the association must post a notice 48 hours in advance if possible. If not feasible, individual notice must be given to the owner and adjacent separate interest. If the pest poses an immediate threat to health and safety, the association must post written notice within one hour after pesticide application. Notice to tenants can be provided through first-class mail, personal delivery to tenants 18 years or older, or electronic delivery if an email address is provided. Upon receipt of written notification, the owner or tenant may agree to allow immediate pesticide application by the association or authorized agent. Prior oral agreement can be made for immediate application if requested before the 48-hour notice period. The association or authorized agent must leave a written notice at the separate interest or entrance no later than the time of pesticide application for an oral agreement. The association must provide written notice at the separate interest or entrance at the time of pesticide application for an oral agreement. If required, notification should also be given to owners or tenants of separate or adjacent interests promptly, but no later than the start of pesticide application. Additionally, a copy of the written notice should be attached to the board meeting minutes following the pesticide application."
