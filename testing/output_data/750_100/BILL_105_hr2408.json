    "content": "The \"After School Education and Safety Act of 1997\" aims to improve academic and social outcomes for students by offering productive activities during after school hours. The findings in the \"After School Education and Safety Act of 1997\" highlight the increased social risks faced by today's youth, with students spending more unsupervised time alone. Law enforcement data shows that youth aged 12-17 are most vulnerable to violence between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m., and academic failure consequences are more severe than ever. The goals of the Act include increasing academic success, improving students' skills, promoting safe environments, preparing for workforce participation, and providing alternatives to negative activities. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. The term \"school\" refers to public kindergarten, elementary, or secondary schools. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Education. SEC. 6. PROGRAM AUTHORIZED. The Secretary can award grants to schools for carrying out activities in section 7(a). SEC. 7. AUTHORIZED ACTIVITIES; REQUIREMENTS.
