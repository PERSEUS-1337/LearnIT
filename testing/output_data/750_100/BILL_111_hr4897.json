Congress acknowledges the importance of a strong automotive industry for the economic health of the United States, with automotive sales historically contributing significantly to retail spending and providing financial security for many Americans. The annual rate of automotive sales fluctuated between 17,500,000 units and 14,200,000 units from June 2006 to May 2008, well above the general rate of 13,000,000 units. The seasonally adjusted annual rate of automotive sales has been below 10,000,000 units since June 2008, with only three months exceeding this number. The threshold of 13,000,000 units has not been matched or exceeded. The automotive new vehicle dealers industry makes substantial contributions to the national economy. In 2008, new automobile dealers in the United States had an average sales revenue of $28.8 million per dealership, totaling $576 billion nationwide. There were 1,057,500 employees in new-vehicle dealerships, earning an average of $48,963 per year, contributing over $52 billion to the national payroll. The new-vehicle dealer industry contributes significantly to the national economy by generating billions in sales revenue per dealership and millions in tax revenue. A well-capitalized dealer network is crucial for the success of automobile manufacturers, especially during economic challenges. Consumer confidence and incentives play a key role in driving new vehicle sales. The capital needed to finance a new vehicle purchase will positively impact the new-vehicle dealer industry, strengthening the automotive manufacturing sector and the national economy. Nonmortgage interest payments, like automobile loan debt, were deductible for Federal income tax until 1986. The deduction for interest on indebtedness incurred to acquire a passenger car or light truck was available until 1986 for Federal income tax purposes. The deduction for interest on qualified vehicle acquisition is amended to include a new subparagraph for vehicles acquired when the national unemployment rate is at least 7 percent. The amendment to the deduction for interest on qualified vehicle acquisition includes a definition of \"qualified vehicle interest\" for a 36-month period. The deduction for interest on a qualified vehicle is limited to $5,000 and can only be taken for the 36-month period after the debt is incurred. The term 'qualified vehicle' refers to a motor vehicle that is acquired for personal use by the taxpayer and not for resale, with no payment made under a specific act. The term 'qualified vehicle' under the Save Act of 2009 refers to a motor vehicle with a gross vehicle weight rating of 6,000 pounds or less, treated as a motor vehicle for Clean Air Act purposes, and classified as a passenger automobile or light truck. The term 'motor vehicle' refers to a vehicle with at least 4 wheels designed for use on public streets, roads, and highways, excluding vehicles operated on rails. Other terms like 'automobile', 'passenger automobile', 'light truck', and 'manufacturer' are defined by regulations set by the Environmental Administrator. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency administers title II of the Clean Air Act. The average national unemployment rate is calculated based on monthly rates reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. A deduction is allowed in computing adjusted gross income. The deduction allowed for qualified vehicle interest by section 163(h)(5) is included in the computation of adjusted gross income, effective for vehicles acquired on or after January 1, 2008."
