The \"Economic Sanctions Reform Act of 1999\" defines \"new unilateral economic sanctions law\" as any law enacted after this Act that authorizes unilateral economic sanctions by the United States. The \"Economic Sanctions Reform Act of 1999\" defines a new unilateral economic sanctions law as any legislation introduced after this Act that would authorize the United States to implement unilateral economic sanctions under specific circumstances. A unilateral economic sanction is any action taken by the United States to promote foreign policy or national security interests. The \"Economic Sanctions Reform Act of 1999\" defines a new unilateral economic sanctions law as any legislation that promotes foreign policy or national security interests by restricting economic activities and government programs, without including obligations under international agreements. SEC. 4. GUIDELINES FOR NEW UNILATERAL ECONOMIC SANCTIONS LEGISLATION. Any new unilateral economic sanctions legislation should include a statement of the foreign policy or national security objective, provide authority for the President to refrain from imposing sanctions if in the national interest, and ensure contract sanctity unless determined otherwise by the President. The legislation should allow the President to consider the impact of sanctions on innocent parties and target them narrowly. It should not restrict humanitarian aid, human rights assistance, or agricultural exports. The legislation should not restrict humanitarian aid, human rights assistance, or agricultural exports unless the President deems it necessary for national interest. The President must review and report on sanctions annually. The President must annually review and report on sanctions, evaluating their effectiveness, objectives, and multilateral support. The President must annually review and report on sanctions, assessing their effectiveness, objectives, multilateral support, costs, gains to the United States, and any decisions to exercise additional authorities. SEC. 5. GUIDELINES FOR CONGRESSIONAL CONSIDERATION OF NEW UNILATERAL ECONOMIC SANCTIONS LEGISLATION. In considering new unilateral economic sanctions legislation, Congress should ensure complete information on projected costs and gains to US national interests, take into account international legal obligations, and provide the President an opportunity to submit a report assessing such costs and gains. When considering new unilateral economic sanctions legislation, Congress should consider the consistency with existing sanctions, administrative costs, likelihood of achieving objectives, and national interests. The importance of achieving the stated objective of each sanction in relation to United States national interests should be considered, along with the likely impact of the sanctions on humanitarian conditions, activities of NGOs, relations with US allies, and other national security or foreign policy interests. The proposed legislation requires consideration of diplomatic efforts, likelihood of multilateral adoption, and alternative measures to achieve objectives. The proposed legislation may lead to retaliation against US interests and harm US business, agriculture, and consumers, as well as the country's international reputation as a reliable supplier of products and services. SEC. 6. CONGRESSIONAL RULES OF PROCEDURE. The House of Representatives and Senate must include specific matters in any new unilateral economic sanctions legislation for it to be considered. Such legislation is deemed a Federal private sector mandate and requires a report by the Congressional Budget Office. The Congressional Budget Office report on proposed sanctions legislation must assess the short-term and long-term costs to the US economy, including impacts on trade, employment, growth, international reputation, and competitiveness of US industries. The section is enacted by Congress as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the House of Representatives and the Senate, superseding other rules only to the extent that they are inconsistent therewith. The House can change its rules regarding procedures in the same way as any other rule of the House. The President should adopt guidelines for imposing sanctions and establish procedures for public outreach regarding United States policy on sanctions. SEC. 8. RULES REGARDING SANCTIONS IMPOSED BY THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OR BY STATUTORY ENACTMENTS. The President has the authority to suspend, terminate, or refrain from imposing sanctions if the benefits to national interests do not outweigh the costs. Additionally, the President can also reimpose sanctions if necessary. The President can suspend or refrain from imposing sanctions if national interests are not compromised, but can reimpose them later with congressional notification. The President can suspend or terminate sanctions, with the action taking effect immediately after a report to Congress unless a joint resolution disapproving the determination is enacted within 30 days. Congress can enact a joint resolution disapproving the determination within 30 days to prevent the President from suspending or terminating sanctions. Congressional procedures for joint resolutions are outlined in subsection (d). The joint resolution reported by the committee is highly privileged in the House of Representatives. The provisions of this section supersede any other provision of law."
