It also reviews principles of Senate parliamentary procedure and covers authoritative parliamentary reference sources such as the Senate's official parliamentary reference sources. Text boxes provide information on how to access these sources online. This report focuses on providing access points to relevant parliamentary reference sources for Senators and congressional staff, with an emphasis on online access. It includes two appendixes with information on CRS products and primary websites for accessing resources. Basic familiarity with Senate procedures is assumed. The Senate applies regulations from various parliamentary authorities based on key principles, including deriving procedures from multiple sources, having the power to make its own rules, requiring Senators to enforce rules, and conducting business by unanimous consent. The Senate follows key principles in its parliamentary procedures, including deriving rules from various sources, conducting business by unanimous consent, and adhering to informal practices. The Senate's parliamentary procedures involve party conferences, procedural agreements by unanimous consent, and informal practices. Rule XIX states the presiding officer must recognize the Senator who first addresses them, with precedence given to leaders and managers. This principle can impact Senate floor proceedings. The Senate's parliamentary procedures involve party conferences, procedural agreements by unanimous consent, and informal practices. Rule XIX states the presiding officer must recognize the Senator who first addresses them, with precedence given to leaders and managers. This precedential principle allows the majority leader to offer debate-ending motions or propose amendments on the Senate floor, emphasizing the importance of understanding Senate practices beyond just the standing rules. The Senate has the authority, under Article I of the Constitution, to determine its rules of procedure through rulemaking power exercised by majority vote. The Senate's rulemaking power allows it to adopt amendments or create new standing rules by majority vote. Standing orders and rulemaking provisions of law have the same effect as standing rules. The Senate can also waive its rules by unanimous consent. The Senate can waive its rules by unanimous consent or by a two-thirds vote to suspend its rules, although this is rare. Unlike the House, the Senate cannot supersede its rules by majority vote but can set aside a rule by majority vote in certain situations. The Senate's presiding officer can establish a precedent by setting aside a rule for immediate situations, which can govern subsequent rulings. A violation of Senate rules can occur unless a Senator makes a point of order at the right moment. The presiding officer in the Senate can make rulings on points of order without debate, with the option to submit unclear questions to the Senate for decision. Senators can appeal these rulings, with the Senate deciding by majority vote to uphold or overturn. This vote sets a precedent for future rulings unless overturned. The presiding officer in the Senate can make rulings on points of order without debate, with the option to submit unclear questions to the Senate for decision. Senators can appeal these rulings, with the Senate deciding by majority vote to uphold or overturn. Some rulemaking statutes require a supermajority vote to overturn the presiding officer's ruling on a point of order. Parliamentary actions based on informal practices or party conference rules are not enforceable on the Senate floor. These informal practices and party conference rules do not have the authority of Senate rules and procedures. The Senate's standing rules emphasize individual Senators' rights, such as the right to debate at length and offer amendments. To expedite legislation, the Senate often operates outside its rules by unanimous consent. Senate business is often conducted under unanimous consent agreements, which can be used to bring up measures, establish how they will be considered, and control the amendment process. These agreements are carefully crafted by leaders and take effect unless objected to by a Senator. Senate business is often conducted under unanimous consent agreements, which have the same authority as the Senate's standing rules and can only be altered by unanimous consent. These agreements change Senate rules and precedents and are enforceable on the Senate floor. The Senate's published precedents detail how its rules are interpreted and applied, complementing and supplementing the rules themselves. Precedents in the Senate are crucial for understanding the rules and proceedings. Senators use precedents to support arguments, defend against points of order, or appeal rulings. The presiding officer also relies on precedents to make rulings. Precedents in the Senate influence the application of current rules by relating past decisions to the specific case at hand. They are established through Senate votes on questions of order or when the presiding officer decides a question of order. The Senate typically follows these precedents unless a decision is reversed or modified. Precedents can also be created when the presiding officer responds to a parliamentary inquiry. Precedents in the Senate are established through Senate votes or decisions by the presiding officer. Precedents based on Senate votes carry more weight than those based on the presiding officer's rulings. Responses to parliamentary inquiries have the least weight as they are not subject to appeal by the full Senate. Recent precedents hold more weight than older ones. Recent precedents generally have greater weight than earlier ones, reflecting an established pattern of rulings. Precedents must be evaluated in the historical context of the Senate's rules and practices. Senators can consult the Senate Parliamentarian's Office for precedents. Some Senate procedural actions are based on unofficial practices that have evolved over time and become accepted custom. These practices do not have the same standing as the chamber's rules. Unofficial practices in the Senate, not compiled in any official source, are often followed, such as respecting \"holds\" by individual Senators and giving the majority leader the authority to make motions. The Senate Manual contains official parliamentary authorities. The Senate Manual, issued by the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, includes various parliamentary authorities such as Standing Rules of the Senate, Rules for Regulation of the Senate Wing, and Laws Relating to the U.S. Senate.

The Senate establishes procedural regulations for its committees through simple resolutions or provisions in statutory measures, requiring agreement between both houses for effectiveness. The rulemaking procedures in Congress require agreement between both houses and presentation to the President or through concurrent resolutions. These procedures are established through each chamber's constitutional rulemaking authority and have the same standing as Senate and House rules. Statutes or concurrent resolutions with \"rulemaking provisions\" often include a section asserting the rulemaking authority of each chamber. The rulemaking procedures in Congress are subject to change through simple resolutions. In the Senate, rulemaking provisions come from Legislative Reorganization Acts, expedited procedures for specific measures, and statutes related to the budget process. Congressional budget resolutions may also contain provisions regulating action in the budget process. The budget process in Congress is guided by legislative procedures outlined in rulemaking statutes like the Legislative Reorganization Acts of 1946 and 1970. These statutes have influenced the Senate's standing rules and are included in the Senate Manual. Rulemaking statutes specify legislative procedures to be followed. Rulemaking statutes, such as the Congressional Review Act, establish expedited procedures for Congress to approve or disapprove actions proposed by the executive branch or independent agencies. These special procedures are outlined in the Senate Manual under \"General and Expedited Procedures.\" Some expedited procedures for considering budgetary legislation are outlined in the Senate Manual, including statutes like the Congressional Budget Act, the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act, the Budget Enforcement Act, and the Budget Control Act. These statutes define specific procedures for the Senate to follow when considering budget resolutions.
