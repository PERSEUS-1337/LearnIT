    "content": "Severe wildfires have been burning more structures and area due to high accumulations of biomass. Congress is being urged to provide more funding and authority for activities like prescribed burning and thinning to reduce biomass fuels and wildfire severity. Federal agencies already have broad, indirect authorities to address biomass fuel reduction for wildfire protection. The federal agencies lack sufficient reporting on funding and results for biomass fuel reduction activities, hindering Congress's ability to assess progress in reducing wildfire risks. Improved reporting on funding and results for biomass fuel reduction activities is necessary to enhance Congress's understanding of appropriations and aid in decision-making for funding allocations among activities and agencies. All biomass can potentially fuel wildfires, making wildfires inevitable in temperate ecosystems due to dry conditions and natural ignitions. Wildfires are inevitable in ecosystems due to dry conditions and natural ignitions. They can range from low-intensity surface fires to high-intensity crown fires, depending on fuel characteristics and weather conditions. Fire protection efforts focus on altering fuel to control wildfires. The moisture content of biomass fuels is a key factor in controlling flammability, as it requires heat to evaporate before burning. Other important characteristics affecting wildfire behavior include fuel size, distribution, and quantity. Fire protection efforts aim to modify fuel properties to minimize damages caused by crown fires. The moisture content of green foliage and dead biomass affects flammability. Fuel with up to 20%-30% moisture can be ignited, while 100% moisture content biomass can burn in high winds. Wildfire fuels are categorized by the time it takes for moisture content to decrease. Fine fuels like needles, leaves, and grass have a 1-hour time lag. Fine fuels, also known as flash fuels, dry out quickly and are important for spreading fires due to their ability to ignite and burn rapidly. They include needles, leaves, and grass. Other fuel size classes include 10-hour, 100-hour, and 1,000-hour time lag fuels, with varying diameters. The 1-hour time lag fuels contribute little to fire intensity and damage due to their low mass. Fine fuels, such as needles, leaves, and grass, ignite and burn quickly, contributing to the spread of fires. In contrast, larger fuels like 1,000-hour time lag fuels burn intensely and cause significant damage but do not contribute much to the rate of spread. Fuel distribution plays a crucial role in fire behavior. Compact fuel beds are more resistant to burning due to reduced ventilation, slowing moisture loss, and restricting air flow to the fire. Less compact fuel beds allow for more air flow, drying out the fuels and feeding the fire. Fuel distribution is essential for fire behavior. Fires need continuous fuels to spread, and firelines are used to break this continuity. Factors like fuel size, moisture content, slope, and wind speed determine the width of the break needed. Steep slopes and high winds can reduce fuel moisture and raise temperatures, making it easier for the fire to ignite. High winds can carry firebrands, spreading the fire across wide firebreaks. \"Fuel ladders\" are continuous fuels that help spread fires into the canopy, turning a surface fire into a crown fire by providing continuous fuels between the ground and the canopy. Wind is necessary to initiate and sustain a crown fire. Fuel loads for crown fires can vary widely and include dead biomass, undergrowth, and undesirable trees. Strong convection in a crown fire can increase winds, intensifying its spread. The density and mass of live crown biomass play a significant role in sustaining crown fires, despite not being commercially valuable. Not all fuel is consumed in a wildfire, with fine and small fuels being mostly consumed. In wildfires, the consumption of fuel varies based on size, with smaller fuels being mostly consumed. High-intensity fires can consume foliage and understory vegetation but leave large tree stems largely intact. The characteristics of fuel and resulting fires are influenced by different ecosystems' adaptations to low-intensity surface fires, high-intensity crown fires, or a mixed regime. Many ecosystems in the United States are adapted to relatively frequent wildfires, with large amounts of fine fuels like grasses and needles. Natural forested frequent-fire ecosystems are dominated by fire-resistant trees, creating open, park-like spaces. Ponderosa pine and southern yellow pine ecosystems are classic examples. Surface-fire ecosystems in the U.S. account for about 34% of wildlands and historically consisted of grasses, needles, and small shrubs. Heavy grazing and logging in the late 1800s reduced grass cover, leading to an increase in fuel loads of branches and small to mid-size trees. This ecosystem type, including ponderosa pine and southern yellow pine, has relatively few small to mid-sized trees to provide fuel ladders, resulting in infrequent crown fires. Logging and fire suppression have led to an increase in fuel loads in surface-fire ecosystems, creating fuel ladders and increasing the risk of catastrophic crown fires. Activities to reduce fuel loads and remove fuel ladders are necessary to prevent substantial alterations to these ecosystems. Activities that reduce fuel loads and remove fuel ladders have been shown to decrease wildfire severity in surface-fire ecosystems. Ecosystems adapted to high-intensity crown fires have dense, uniform fuels and frequent fires, with plants that resprout after fires, such as chaparral. Crown-fire ecosystems, found in southern California and the Southwest, are dominated by large shrubs and small trees. These ecosystems have infrequent crown fires, with most trees killed but new stands established after fires. Lodgepole pine is a classic example, with serotinous cones that release seeds after being heated by fire. These ecosystems make up 42% of wildlands in the US and contain large volumes of uniform biomass fuels. No evidence suggests human activities impact these ecosystems. The ecosystems in southern California and the Southwest are dominated by large shrubs and small trees, with infrequent crown fires. Human activities have not impacted fuel loads or fire nature in these ecosystems. Fuel treatment has been found ineffective in preventing catastrophic crown fires, particularly in southern California chaparral. Catastrophic crown fires do not completely destroy all vegetation in their paths and are typically patchy, leaving some areas lightly burned or unburned. For example, the Yellowstone fires in 1988 showed that only about half of the reported burned acres were severely burned. Some ecosystems consistently burn with crown fires of limited scale, mixed with low-intensity surface fires. Whitebark pine is a slow-growing species found in high elevation sites, moderating micro-climates to allow other species to grow. Mixed-intensity fires in these ecosystems kill competing species like firs and spruces. The sporadic mixed-intensity fires in ecosystems with whitebark pine kill competing species like firs and spruces, allowing some pines to survive and produce seeds. Clark's nutcrackers spread the seeds, favoring regeneration in burned areas. Other species in these ecosystems can transition to mixed-fire types under certain conditions. Lodgepole pine can be a mixed fire type on dry sites in the Sierras, but the consequences of fuel reduction activities in mixed-fire-regime ecosystems are uncertain. It is unclear if fuel levels are unnatural and if wildfire severity would be significantly altered by fuel reduction activities in these ecosystems. Reducing fuel loads to suppress wildfires and prevent crown fires may be effective in some ecosystems, but not all. It may not provide significant benefits for protecting structures and communities. Evidence from the Hayman Fire in 2002 questions the effectiveness of reducing fuel loads in all ecosystems. The Hayman Fire in 2002 showed the potential futility of reducing fuel loads in the wildland-urban interface. 83% of homes within the fire perimeter survived relatively unscathed, despite high-severity burns. Reducing fuel loads and eliminating fuel ladders may be necessary for the safe use of low-intensity wildfires and prescribed fires in surface-fire ecosystems. Prescribed burning and thinning are common methods proposed for reducing fuel loads and modifying fuel characteristics. Thinning and prescribed fires can alter microclimate, increasing surface fire intensity and the risk of crown fires. Prescribed burning is the deliberate use of fire in specific areas within prescribed fuel and weather conditions. Fire is a self-sustaining chemical reaction that can escape control if conditions change. Prescribed burning is used for fuel reduction by eliminating fine and small fuels through burning, converting biomass to smoke and ashes. Prescribed burning is effective for reducing fine fuels and converting biomass to smoke and ashes, but it has limitations in addressing large diameter fuels and controlling tree density. It can also be risky, leading to escaped fires and potential wildfires with significant consequences. Prescribed burning can be costly due to excessive personnel and equipment, posing health hazards from smoke. Federal land management agencies allow the use of naturally-occurring fires for fire management objectives. Wildland fire use, also known as \"let-burn\" or prescribed natural fire, allows wildfires to burn with monitoring instead of aggressive suppression efforts. The effects and risks are similar to prescribed burning, with the main difference being the source of ignition. Thinning involves cutting and removing trees in a stand, which can be done commercially. Thinning involves cutting and removing trees in a stand, either for commercial use or to improve the health of the remaining trees. Different approaches to thinning include low thinning, crown thinning, and selection thinning. Thinning involves removing less desirable trees for future stand health. It is controlled and can target specific trees, halt operations, and reduce crown density. Thinning is more precise in creating stand structure compared to prescribed burning. Thinning, especially targeting smaller trees and shrubs, can effectively reduce vertical fuel continuity and crown fire risk. However, it leaves slash on the ground, increasing short-term fuel load, which must be treated for fuel reduction. Thinning can reduce crown fire risk by targeting smaller trees and shrubs, but it leaves slash on the ground, increasing short-term fuel load that needs to be treated for fuel reduction. Thinning is also used to concentrate biomass growth on fewer stems to produce larger, more valuable trees, but in crown-fire ecosystems, it provides little effective wildfire protection. Thinning in crown-fire ecosystems offers limited wildfire protection, while in surface-fire and mixed-fire regimes, it can reduce the risk of catastrophic crown fires when combined with slash treatment. The effectiveness of combining thinning with prescribed burning is uncertain, with variable results observed in empirical evidence. The effectiveness of combined operations to reduce fuel loads, such as thinning and logging, is limited and costly. Logging, especially salvage logging of dead trees, is sometimes suggested but leaves substantial slash and does little for fuel ladders. Commercial logging can reduce crown density but is not effective in reducing fuel loads. The proposal that commercial logging can reduce canopy fires is untested in scientific literature. Commercial logging focuses on large trees and does not address crown base height, which contributes to the \"ladder effect\" in wildfires. Salvage of standing dead trees may reduce fuels, but standing dead trees with shed needles may contribute less to crown fires than live trees. Pruning trees can also alter fuels for wildfire protection. Pruning trees removes lower branches to reduce fuel ladders and crown density for wildfire protection. Five federal agencies, including the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management, are responsible for protecting federal lands from wildfires. None of these agencies are explicitly authorized to reduce fire intensity. Since 1897, federal agencies like the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management have been authorized to reduce fuels for wildfire protection within their mandate to preserve and protect lands. The agencies are implicitly authorized to carry out this task to prevent destruction by fire and depredations on public forests and reservations. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) have broad authority to manage public lands for conservation, protection of wildlife habitats, and outdoor recreation. The BIA has explicit direction for Indian forest land management activities, including forest development, protection against wildfire, and biomass fuel reduction. The Forest Service has specific funding programs for biomass fuel reduction activities, primarily through the Hazardous Fuels sub-account within the Wildland Fire Management line item. This funding can be used for prescribed burning and other fuel reduction activities like thinning. Hazardous Fuels funding increased significantly from FY2001 to FY2009, with a peak in FY2009 due to economic stimulus legislation. The funding has since decreased, with a portion allocated to thinning for fuel reduction and other purposes within the Vegetation program. Ecosystems and specific activities funded by Hazardous Fuels are not reported. The Vegetation and Watershed Management account of the National Forest System funds various activities such as reforestation, rangeland improvements, watershed protection, noxious weed control, and air quality management. Approximately 20% of appropriations in FY2008 were used for thinning and related activities, but the specific portion for wildfire protection is unknown. The FS has a Brush Disposal account funded by timber purchasers for slash treatments in national forests, including mechanical, manual, and prescribed burning methods. Funds are also used for slash treatment after thinning operations, but the specific portion for wildfire protection is unknown. The FS has three mandatory spending accounts: the BD account, the Knutson-Vandenberg Fund, and the Vegetation and Watershed Management Appropriations. These accounts collect deposits from timber purchasers for various forest improvement activities, including slash treatment, reforestation, thinning, and watershed protection. The specific allocation of funds for wildfire protection and thinning activities is unknown. The FS has three mandatory spending accounts for forest improvement activities, including thinning for fuel reduction. Deposits are made when timber sale contracts generate net receipts. The agency does not report how much thinning is funded for wildfire protection. The Hazardous Fuels sub-account in the Wildland Fire Management line item provides funding for prescribed burning and other fuel reduction activities. Funding for Wildland Fire Management shifted to a department-wide program in FY2008. DOI fuel reduction funding in the Hazardous Fuels sub-account increased in FY2001 and has remained stable since. The Hazardous Fuels sub-account funding increased in FY2001 and has been stable since. Other fuel reduction activities are funded through general land and resource management accounts for DOI agencies, including BLM and NPS. These funds can be used for activities that reduce biomass fuels. The NPS, FWS, and BIA have accounts that fund activities to reduce wildfire threats by protecting and restoring natural resources. These funds can be used for fuel reduction activities on Indian lands and wildlife habitats. The BLM has a mandatory spending account, the Forest Ecosystem Health and Recovery Fund, which can be used for activities to reduce biomass fuels and improve wildfire protection, including reducing wildfire risk in damaged forests. The portion of funds used for fuel reduction activities is unknown. Federal authorities for assisting fuel reduction on nonfederal lands are limited. The FS offers two wildfire protection assistance programs that include fuel reduction, while other agencies lack similar programs for state or local governments or private landowners. One FS program, State Fire Assistance, provides funding for fire prevention, control, and prescribed burning. Funding allocation is discretionary. The FS offers two wildfire protection assistance programs: State Fire Assistance and Volunteer Fire Assistance. State Fire Assistance provides funding for fire prevention, control, and prescribed burning based on a non-statutory formula. Volunteer Fire Assistance offers technical and financial aid to rural volunteer fire departments for fire protection. Eligibility is limited to organizations serving communities of up to 10,000 people with firefighting personnel that are 80% or more volunteer. The FS offers State Fire Assistance and Volunteer Fire Assistance programs. State Fire Assistance provides funding for fire prevention, control, and prescribed burning. Volunteer Fire Assistance offers aid to rural volunteer fire departments. Funding allocation is at the agency's discretion, with no funds appropriated for the program yet. The program aims to expand outreach, education, and establish defensible space around private homes. The FS offers various technical and financial assistance programs for forest stewardship, forest health protection, and emergency restoration. These programs could potentially be used to assist in reducing fuels on nonfederal lands for wildfire protection through biomass fuel reduction. No funds have been appropriated for this specific program yet."
