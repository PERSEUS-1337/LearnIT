    "content": "The \"Make College Affordable Act of 2003\" is the short title of the Act. It includes an expansion of the deduction for higher education expenses. The \"Make College Affordable Act of 2003\" expands the deduction for higher education expenses, amending the limitations on the deduction amount under section 222 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Make College Affordable Act of 2003\" increases the deduction for higher education expenses. The deduction amount for taxable year 2003 is $8,000 and for 2004 onwards is $12,000, with limitations based on modified adjusted gross income. The deduction amount for higher education expenses is increased under the \"Make College Affordable Act of 2003\". The reduction in the deduction is based on the taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income for the taxable year. The term 'modified adjusted gross income' is defined for tax purposes as the taxpayer's adjusted gross income for the taxable year, excluding specific sections and after applying certain adjustments. Adjusted gross income is determined without the deduction allowed under this section. Dollar amounts in subparagraph (B)(i)(II) are increased for taxable years after 2003 based on the cost-of-living adjustment. The text discusses adjustments to dollar amounts for taxable years based on the cost-of-living adjustment. It also mentions rounding to the nearest multiple of $50 if the adjusted amount is not a multiple of $50. The text amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow deductions for qualified tuition and related expenses of eligible students. It also defines an eligible student as per section 25A(b)(3). The amendments made by this section make the deduction for qualified tuition and related expenses permanent, and the effective date applies to payments made after December 31, 2002. The new section 25C allows for a credit on interest paid on higher education loans under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The new section 25C of the Internal Revenue Code allows individuals to claim a tax credit for interest paid on qualified education loans, with a maximum credit of $1,500, subject to limitations based on modified adjusted gross income. The tax credit under section 25C of the Internal Revenue Code is reduced if the taxpayer's income exceeds $50,000 ($100,000 for joint returns), based on a ratio of the excess income to $20,000 ($40,000 for joint returns). The term \"modified adjusted gross income\" excludes certain income sources. The tax credit under section 25C of the Internal Revenue Code is reduced for incomes exceeding $50,000 ($100,000 for joint returns), with adjustments for inflation starting in 2003. The tax credit under section 25C of the Internal Revenue Code is reduced for incomes exceeding $50,000 ($100,000 for joint returns) by substituting '2002' for '1992'. Rounding rules apply, and no credit is allowed if a deduction under section 151 is claimed by another taxpayer for the same individual. The credit is limited to interest paid on qualified expenses.
