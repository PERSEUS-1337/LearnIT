    "content": "During the Vietnam War, Operation Ranch Hand sprayed millions of gallons of herbicides, including Agent Orange, over southern Vietnam. The herbicides contained TCDD, a toxic and carcinogenic compound. Dioxin \"hot spots\" have been identified in areas like Bien Hoa, Danang, and Phu Cat. The airbases at Bien Hoa, Danang, and Phu Cat are contaminated with TCDD above acceptable levels. The A Luoi Valley, a key segment of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, was heavily sprayed during the Vietnam War. The former U.S. military base in the A Luoi Valley is another identified \"hot spot\" for dioxin contamination. U.S. response to environmental damage and health issues caused by Agent Orange in Vietnam has helped improve bilateral relations. President Obama met with President Tran Dai Quang in May 2016 to discuss bilateral relations. The United States will continue to address the legacy of war by removing landmines, bombs, and dioxin. Cooperation between the two nations led to the successful conclusion of the first phase of dioxin remediation at Danang International Airport. The cleanup at Bien Hoa Air Base will also be supported by the United States. The United States is committed to partnering with Vietnam to address dioxin contamination at Bien Hoa Air Base. The Trump Administration continues to provide assistance to Vietnam for the Agent Orange/dioxin issue, as stated in a joint statement by President Trump and Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc in May 2017. The United States is collaborating with Vietnam on dioxin remediation at Da Nang and Bien Hoa Airports, with a focus on removing unexploded ordnances. A ceremony was held in November 2017 to celebrate the completion of environmental remediation at Da Nang Airport, and a Memorandum of Intent was signed in January 2018 for dioxin decontamination at Bien Hoa. Congress has allocated $254.8 million for these efforts since 2007. The legislation has appropriated separate amounts for environmental remediation and health and disability programs in areas of Vietnam affected by Agent Orange/dioxin. Congress allocated $254.8 million for dioxin remediation efforts since 2007, with more funds typically allocated for environmental remediation. The actual amount available for assistance may be less than specified due to Foreign Assistance Act provisions. In FY2019, the 115th Congress authorized the transfer of up to $15,000,000 from the Department of Defense for the Bien Hoa dioxin cleanup in Vietnam under Section 1052 of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act. The funds are to be used by USAID and allocated under the State Department's Economic Support Fund account. The Economic Support Fund account (ESF) and Development Assistance account (DA) funds have been allocated for two fiscal years. The State Department has delegated administration to USAID. Most environmental remediation efforts focused on Danang airport cleanup, while health and disability funds were used for programs in Vietnam. Danang airport cleanup is completed. The cleanup of Danang airport in Vietnam has been completed, with joint dioxin removal operations planned at Bien Hoa airbase. Discussions are ongoing between U.S. and Vietnamese officials regarding health issues related to dioxin exposure. Programs funded by allocated funds are managed by the State Department, USAID, and Vietnamese government agencies. The Office of the National Steering Committee on Overcoming Consequences of Agent Orange/Dioxin was established in 1999. The Office of the National Steering Committee on Overcoming Consequences of Agent Orange/Dioxin in Vietnam (Office 33) coordinates the government's policy on Agent Orange and dioxin. It includes representatives from various ministries and agencies. Congressional interest has focused on two main issues. Congressional interest has primarily focused on allocating funds for environmental remediation of dioxin \"hot spots\" in Vietnam and health programs in areas affected by Agent Orange. Oversight is also directed towards ensuring effective use of funds by the State Department and USAID, particularly for health and disability activities. The appropriation of funds to address the Agent Orange/dioxin issue in Vietnam began in May. The 110th Congress allocated $3 million for dioxin remediation in Vietnam and health programs near contaminated sites. The State Department designated USAID to manage the funds, setting a precedent for future appropriations. The 111th Congress also addressed the Agent Orange/dioxin issue in separate legislation. The 111th Congress allocated a total of $18 million for dioxin cleanup in Vietnam and related health services. This included $3 million in March 2009, $3 million in December 2009, and $12 million in July 2010 for remediation of dioxin contamination at the Danang Airport. The 111th Congress allocated $18 million for dioxin cleanup in Vietnam, with $1.9 million from the State Department and USAID for environmental remediation at Danang Airport in FY2010. The Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2010 (P.L. 111-212) supported remediation efforts for dioxin contamination, posing risks to human health. The 113th Congress continued to appropriate funds for Agent Orange/dioxin environmental remediation in Vietnam and related health services. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 renewed the appropriation levels for FY2013, subject to sequestration requirements. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 (P.L. 113-76) allocated funds for environmental remediation and health programs in areas affected by Agent Orange. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-235) specified funds for dioxin contaminated sites in Vietnam and assistance for the Government of Vietnam. Funds allocated under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 and the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 for environmental remediation and health programs in Vietnam, including assistance for areas contaminated with Agent Orange or dioxin. Specifically, $7.5 million for health/disability programs and $15.0 million for environmental remediation of dioxin in Vietnam. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 and the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 allocated funds for environmental remediation and health programs in Vietnam, including assistance for areas contaminated with Agent Orange or dioxin. Specifically, $7.5 million was designated for health/disability programs and $15.0 million for environmental remediation of dioxin in Vietnam. Additionally, S.Rept. 114-79 accompanying P.L. 114-113 provided not less than $25 million for environmental remediation and $7 million for health/disability programs in areas sprayed with Agent Orange or contaminated with dioxin to address the needs of individuals with severe mobility impairment and cognitive disabilities. The Committee intends for health/disability funds to be implemented by Vietnamese organizations to minimize administrative costs and maximize impact. Funding for FY2017, including $20,000,000 for dioxin remediation, was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31). The Support Fund of $20,000,000 is allocated for remediation of dioxin contaminated sites in Vietnam and may also assist the Government of Vietnam, including the military. Additionally, $10,000,000 is designated for health and disability programs in areas affected by Agent Orange and dioxin contamination to aid individuals with mobility or cognitive disabilities. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 allocated $20 million for remediation of dioxin contaminated sites in Vietnam and assistance to the Government of Vietnam, including the military. It also designated $10 million for health and disability programs in areas affected by Agent Orange and dioxin contamination to aid individuals with disabilities. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 allocated not less than $20 million for remediation of dioxin contaminated sites in Vietnam and assistance to the Government of Vietnam, including the military. It also designated not less than $12.5 million for health and disability programs in affected areas to aid individuals with disabilities. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 allocated funds for health and disability programs in areas contaminated with dioxin, with USAID designated as the responsible agency for the funds. USAID has obligated 81% of the appropriated $127 million for environmental activities from FY2011-FY2017. USAID has obligated a significant portion of funds allocated for environmental remediation and health- and disability-related services from various fiscal years. Congressional attention has been drawn to how USAID has obligated appropriations for health and disability activities. The appropriations for health and disability activities have caught congressional attention due to concerns about the pace of utilization and the types of programs being funded. Congress has designated funds for Agent Orange/dioxin-related activities near contaminated areas since FY2007. The Senate report and H.Rept. 112-331 allocated funds for environmental remediation and health activities in Vietnam near contaminated sites. Concerns have been raised about the utilization of these funds and the types of programs being funded. Funds for health and disability services in Vietnam were allocated to programs in Danang from FY2007 to FY2009. However, from FY2010 to FY2013, funds were mainly given to Development Alternatives, Inc. for a disability support program. This program aimed to improve the lives of persons with disabilities without specific reference to Agent Orange/dioxin \"hot spots.\" The program ended in January 2016 after consultations with relevant authorities. Since FY2014, USAID has shifted to smaller direct program funding for health and disability services in Vietnam, increasing outreach to Vietnamese NGOs. Congressional appropriations have supported activities related to Agent Orange/dioxin, including an environmental remediation project at Danang Airport since 2008. Since 2008, the environmental remediation project at Danang Airport has faced delays, increased material for decontamination, and rising costs. USAID aimed to finish by October 2013, but a 2014 audit set the completion date to March 31, 2017. Decontamination finished in August 2017, with the amount of material rising from 61,700 to 90,000 cubic meters, plus 60,000 m3 of \"lower risk material.\" The environmental remediation project at Danang Airport faced delays and increased costs. The project involved decontaminating 90,000 m3 of material, including 60,000 m3 of \"lower risk material.\" Soil samples at Danang airbase showed high levels of TCDD toxic equivalents, exceeding international standards. Work on the project began in December 2009 with a memorandum of understanding signed between the State Department and Vietnam's Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment. The State Department and Vietnam's Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) for implementing environmental health and remediation programs in Danang. USAID and Office 33 were designated as implementing agencies, with $6.0 million in funds appropriated for activities including a grant to CDM International, Inc. for dioxin containment at Danang airport. USAID completed an Environmental Assessment (EA) recommending thermal desorption for decontamination. The Environmental Assessment (EA) recommended thermal desorption to decontaminate 61,700 m3 of material at Danang airport, costing $33.7 million over two years. USAID and Vietnam's Ministry of National Defence signed a Memorandum of Intent to start the project in 2011 and complete it by 2013. The Prime Minister and MND approved the remediation project using in-pile thermal desorption (IPTD) in February 2011. In February 2011, the environmental remediation project at Danang airport was approved by MND. USAID awarded contracts to CDM Smith and Tetra Tech, Inc. in July 2012. The project officially began on August 20, 2012, after a ceremony at the airport on August 9, 2012. An internal USAID audit in November 2014 revealed that six contracts were awarded for the environmental assessment and remediation project at Danang airport. The thermal desorption of contaminated soil was conducted in two phases due to the large amount of material involved. The treatment of 45,000 m3 of soil at Danang airport began in April 2014 and was completed in August 2017. Phase 1 cooling down started in April 2015 after removing over 95% of dioxin. Phase 2 excavation began in January 2015, with soil treatment starting in November 2016 and completion in August 2017. Weather delays during Vietnam's rainy season affected progress on soil excavation. During Vietnam's rainy season, progress on soil excavation and thermal treatment construction was hindered. More soil and sediment than estimated needed decontamination after small lakes were drained. The secondary treatment facility was closed in July 2014 for a filtering system change. Raising the Phase 1 soil temperature to 335\u00b0C took longer than expected. An internal audit by USAID's Office of Inspector General in November 2014 identified potential risks that could delay the project and increase costs. The audit identified risks that could delay the project and increase costs, including issues with weather and soil cooling. It recommended implementing a formal risk management plan and providing more accurate performance data and training to Vietnamese officials. USAID agreed with the recommendations. The completion of the Danang Airport environmental remediation project took longer and cost more than initially projected by USAID due to underestimating contamination, with 162,500 cubic meters of soil found to be contaminated instead of 72,900 cubic meters. The dioxin has percolated deeper than expected, with USAID providing over $60 million in assistance to disabled Vietnamese regardless of the cause of disability, including health services near Agent Orange areas. Between FY2007 and FY2010, the State Department and USAID utilized funds for health services near Agent Orange sites to improve the quality of life for persons with disabilities in Danang. A 2010 USAID assessment noted accomplishments but highlighted the short timeframe. In 2012, a nationwide Persons with Disability Support Program was approved for three years. The nationwide Persons with Disability Support Program (PDSP) is a joint initiative with Development Alternatives, Inc. (DAI) and Vietnam Assistance for the Handicapped (VNAH), focusing primarily on Danang and other high-need areas with dioxin hot spots. The program aims to build on previous USAID assistance to people with disabilities in communities. The RFA calls for a needs assessment in Bien Hoa and Phu Cat, with initial funding set at $9 million. PDSP, in cooperation with DAI, awards grants for disability assistance in health services, rehabilitation, vocational training, and community awareness. USAID supports VNAH in addressing disability policy and legal framework needs in Vietnam. PDSP operates in Binh Dinh, Danang, and Dong Nai provinces, focusing on dioxin \"hot spots.\" The PDSP program has been extended to provinces like Quang Nam, Tay Ninh, and Thua Thien-Hue, which were heavily sprayed with Agent Orange during the Vietnam War. Nearly US$900,000 in grants have been awarded to local partners and organizations. USAID adopted a new approach to assisting persons with disabilities in Vietnam in June 2014. USAID aims to provide assistance to persons with disabilities in Vietnam by addressing key challenges through direct assistance to improve health, independence, and participation in economic and social life. This includes financing therapies and training for practitioners to support changes in disability policies. USAID is providing training to Vietnamese practitioners and technicians in provinces with high disability prevalence and poverty rates. The Aspen Institute has identified Binh Dinh, Binh Phuoc, Dong Nai, Quang Nam, Tay Ninh, Thai Binh, and Thua Thien-Hue as heavily sprayed areas. USAID will directly administer the new approach in consultation with Vietnamese agencies. Joint efforts are being made to clean up the dioxin \"hot spot\" at the Bien Hoa airbase after the completion of the environmental cleanup at Danang airport. The Bien Hoa airbase, heavily sprayed with Agent Orange during the war, is now undergoing a cleanup of dioxin contamination. Soil samples showed high levels of dioxin, prompting mitigation measures by the Vietnamese government. A passive landfill contains 43,000 m3 of contaminated soil excavated from herbicide storage. A study by Hatfield Consultants found multiple dioxin \"hot spots\" at Bien Hoa airbase, with contaminated soil spreading into nearby water bodies. The UNDP, Office 33, and MONRE have been working on a master plan for dioxin remediation for five years. In 2014, a joint investigation found dioxin contamination at Bien Hoa airbase, estimating 250,000 m3 of soil needing decontamination at a cost of $250 million. USAID contracted CDM International Inc. in 2013 to assess dioxin remediation options, partnering with Hatfield Consulting. The final report in 2016 identified 408,500 to 495,300 m3 of contaminated soils and sediments on or near the airbase. The report identified 408,500 to 495,300 m3 of contaminated soils and sediments near the airbase. Five treatment methods were considered, with costs ranging from $137 million to $794 million. USAID has allocated over $3.7 million for environmental remediation assessment. Over $3.7 million has been allocated for assessing environmental remediation at Bien Hoa Airbase. In September 2017, Vietnam's Ministry of National Defence announced infrastructure construction for dioxin decontamination at the airport, with a budget of $11.8 million. USAID and Vietnam's Ministry of National Defence signed a memorandum of intent on January 23, 2018, to begin the decontamination process. U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam Daniel J. Kritenbrink expressed eagerness to collaborate on the project. The United States and Vietnam signed a $183 million aid agreement for the decontamination of Bien Hoa airport, with a projected 10-year timeline and estimated cost of $390 million. Approximately 500,000 cubic meters of soil are to be remediated. The Ministry of National Defence signed a deal with Shimizu Corporation to build a decontamination factory at Bien Hoa airport. The factory will use a new technique to decontaminate soil, costing half as much as previous methods. U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis visited the airport in October 2018. During his visit to the former Agent Orange storage site in Vietnam, Secretary Mattis reaffirmed America's commitment to remediate past environmental damage. Congressional interest in Agent Orange/dioxin in Vietnam focuses on providing assistance for environmental and health effects, as well as oversight of its utilization. The State Department and USAID have requested funding for decontamination of dioxin \"hot spots\" in Vietnam, with Congress generally appropriating funds for health and disability services in areas affected by Agent Orange and dioxin contamination. The Trump Administration has shown support for environmental remediation projects in Vietnam. The State Department and USAID have utilized funds for disability programs in areas affected by Agent Orange and dioxin contamination. President Obama's budget requests did not specifically include funding for health and disability assistance in these areas. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 continues to designate funds for health and disability services. The Victims of Agent Orange Relief Act of 2019 designates funds for health and disability programs in areas contaminated with Agent Orange/dioxin to assist individuals with severe mobility or cognitive disabilities. The Victims of Agent Orange Relief Act of 2019 aims to provide assistance to individuals affected by exposure to Agent Orange, including medical services, vocational training, and equipment. Covered individuals are defined as Vietnamese residents impacted by Agent Orange between 1961 and 1975, or their descendants. The Victims of Agent Orange Relief Act of 2019 aims to provide assistance to individuals affected by exposure to Agent Orange, including medical services, vocational training, and equipment. Covered individuals are defined as Vietnamese residents impacted by Agent Orange between 1961 and 1975, or their descendants. The Act also includes provisions for repairing substandard homes, supporting research on health issues related to Agent Orange exposure, providing assistance to healthcare institutions in Vietnam, and remediating affected geographic areas. The Victims of Agent Orange Relief Act of 2019 aims to provide assistance to individuals affected by exposure to Agent Orange in Vietnam. The Act includes provisions for medical services, vocational training, repairing substandard homes, supporting research on health issues related to Agent Orange exposure, and remediating affected geographic areas. The Act prioritizes heavily sprayed areas and military bases where Agent Orange was handled. Congress oversees the implementation of the Victims of Agent Orange Relief Act of 2019, focusing on funding for environmental remediation and health services in Vietnam. Congressional oversight includes monitoring the rising costs of cleanup at Danang airport and potential implications for funding at Bien Hoa. USAID's provision of health services is under congressional oversight due to slow fund obligation and changes in administration. The cost of environmental remediation at Danang airport increased from $33.7 million to $116 million, leading to concerns about potential cost overruns at Bien Hoa airport. Approximately 500,000 m3 of contaminated soil at Bien Hoa is four to five times more than at Danang. USAID faced rising costs and delays in the Danang airport cleanup, but managed to keep the project going. However, there have been challenges in effectively utilizing funds for health services in areas contaminated with Agent Orange/dioxin. Only 63.5% of funds allocated from FY2011 to FY2017 have been used, with a shifting approach in fund administration raising concerns about effectiveness. Some question the effectiveness of health services funds allocated by USAID and Congress for Vietnam, citing dissatisfaction with fund management. Legislation includes appropriations for environmental remediation and health services in Vietnam, with specific amounts often detailed in accompanying reports. The table below provides relevant text in public law and associated language in accompanying reports or explanatory statements."
