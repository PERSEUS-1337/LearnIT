    "content": "The report summarizes the USDA's efforts to establish a national animal traceability system for rapid disease outbreak response. Despite economic benefits, federal proposals face controversy within the U.S. cattle industry. It provides background on animal ID and traceability, reviews arguments for and against a national system, and describes current U.S. ID and traceability development. The curr_chunk discusses the claims and counter-claims surrounding a national animal ID system, highlighting unresolved issues in program development. It also includes a brief chronology of the U.S. National Animal Identification System and international organizations involved in animal health standards. Tom Vilsack announced USDA's new approach to animal disease traceability, replacing the abandoned National Animal Identification System. The new framework allows states and tribal nations to choose their own level of animal ID and traceability, tailored to their producer needs. USDA will require all animals moving interstate to have a form of ID. USDA's new framework for animal disease traceability requires all animals moving interstate to have a form of ID traceable back to their originating state. A Traceability Regulation Working Group was established to collaborate with state, tribal, and APHIS officials in building on the framework. The Traceability Regulation Working Group, consisting of state, tribal, and APHIS officials, is responsible for synthesizing feedback and making recommendations for a proposed rule on animal disease traceability. APHIS conducted a forum in March 2010 for animal health officials to discuss the new framework, followed by five public meetings in May, June, and July to gather feedback. In August 2010, USDA released two publications outlining the Animal Disease Traceability Framework. The USDA's traceability framework is still developing, with states and tribal nations responsible for managing a traceability program. States may choose to have no mandatory animal ID or traceability capability, or rely on existing systems to combat diseases like brucellosis and tuberculosis. The USDA's traceability framework allows states and tribal nations to implement within-state programs to combat contagious animal diseases. Federal rules will apply to livestock moving in interstate commerce, requiring official identification and an Interstate Certificate of Veterinary Inspection (ICVI). Data collection and storage will be done by state authorities, not the federal government. The Traceability Regulation Working Group, along with state and tribal animal health officials, will define performance standards for animal disease traceability. Performance standards will outline desired outcomes, leaving the method of achieving them to states and tribal nations. The method for achieving animal disease traceability outcomes will be determined by states and tribal nations through detailed cooperative agreements with APHIS. Federal funding, if available, will be provided through annual agreements, with potential funding from the Senate Committee on Appropriations after needs are identified under USDA's new initiative. Implementation of animal disease traceability for interstate movements will be regulated by USDA through federal rulemaking. A proposed rule is expected in April 2011, with a final rule likely 12 to 15 months later. This is crucial for preventing major outbreaks of diseases like avian influenza, foot and mouth disease, and mad cow disease. The economic impact of animal disease outbreaks like foot and mouth disease (FMD) and mad cow disease is significant, leading to the slaughter of millions of animals and billions of dollars in damages. The United States has been fortunate in avoiding catastrophic outbreaks similar to those in Taiwan in 1997 and the United Kingdom in 2001. The economic consequences of major animal disease outbreaks in the 1990s and early 2000s led to the development and implementation of animal identification and traceability systems in many countries. If a foot and mouth disease outbreak were to occur in the United States, it could cost the cattle industry $30 billion to $100 billion alone, as stated by House Agriculture Committee Chairman Collin Peterson in 2009. The implementation of animal identification and traceability systems varies across countries, with some focusing on animal health (such as the United States) and others on food safety and animal health (like the EU, Japan, and South Korea). Japan and South Korea are considering requiring traceability on imported meat products, which would impact market access for animal products. The United States is a major producer and exporter of livestock and animal products, leading in beef and poultry production and ranking third in pork production. It is the top exporter of pork, second in poultry, and third in beef exports, while also being the leading importer of beef. The United States is a major producer and exporter of livestock and animal products, leading in beef and poultry production. U.S. exports of animal products account for substantial portions of total domestic production. Animal identification (ID) involves keeping records on individual farm animals for tracking purposes. Animal identification (ID) systems are crucial for traceability, allowing for quick response to disease outbreaks or tainted food. A national database combined with traceability is considered the ideal system to protect human and animal health and minimize commercial damage. Various countries have versions of animal ID systems with differences based on the amount and type of information collected. Animal ID systems exist in various countries with differences in the information collected. Minimum data includes birthplace, owner details, movement history, and slaughter information. More advanced systems track sex, breed, parentage, feed, pharmaceuticals, and product movement. Tracking animals is essential for disease control and food safety. In the United States, animal ID focuses on health, tracing movements from birth to processing. Other countries like the EU, Japan, and South Korea have more comprehensive systems for both health and food safety. In response to international demands for better information on U.S. animal products, a national animal ID and traceability system has evolved in the United States. This system extends beyond processing plants, using animal-specific bar codes to trace products to retail consumers. Critics and proponents have emerged as traceability systems have developed. Proponents argue that a national animal ID and traceability system would enhance animal health surveillance and disease eradication by facilitating early detection of disease outbreaks and identifying the source of the disease. A national animal ID and traceability program can reduce disease testing costs and minimize economic impact of outbreaks by controlling and eradicating diseases at regional and national levels through zoning or compartmentalization. Regionalization helps contain outbreaks to specific zones, limiting spread and reducing the number of affected animals. Compartmentalization reduces economic damage by controlling disease outbreaks and reopening export markets. Farmers can exploit production characteristics for price premiums in domestic markets. Universal bar codes on processed food, including meats, are used by processors and retailers to manage inventories and add value. ID and traceability help verify production methods for organic, humane treatment, or environmental standards. Government programs like USDA's AMS process verification program assure customers of consistent quality from livestock and meat producers. The USDA's AMS process verification program offers meat producers the opportunity to confirm their manufacturing processes through independent audits, allowing for marketing claims like breeds and feeding practices. Other traceability programs include the national organic certification and mandatory country-of-origin labeling. This program serves as a valuable management tool for producers. An animal ID and traceability program would provide valuable post-mortem information on cattle, track performance history of racing or show animals, increase supply chain transparency, reduce liability claims, and help maintain records on animal movements and health. A traceability program helps producers maintain records on animal movements, health, and marketing activities. It addresses food safety and national security concerns by collaborating with federal and state agencies to protect the food supply from threats like tuberculosis and foodborne illnesses. Local health officials can trace illnesses back to processors and slaughter facilities, but determining specific animals, herds, or flocks is more challenging. Some believe that a more rigorous traceback and animal ID system would facilitate food recalls, contain the spread of foodborne illnesses, and help authorities stem future incidents. Others, particularly in the food industry, disagree, arguing that such a system would not be based on sound science, and would be technically unworkable and costly. Enhancing foreign marketing opportunities for animal products is also a key benefit of traceability systems in the global marketplace. The USDA's AMS developed an export verification program for U.S. plants to meet beef import specifications of countries like Japan after BSE appeared in North America in 2003. This program helps reassure buyers about the health of U.S. animals and certifies production processes for niche markets. The USDA's AMS established standards for U.S. beef suppliers to ship to foreign markets like Japan and Korea. The EV program is voluntary but necessary for access to these markets. Establishing traceability enhances U.S. export competitiveness. The lack of a national animal identification system hindered the U.S. from receiving the best BSE status from the World. Receiving \"negligible risk\" status for BSE from OIE would boost U.S. competitiveness internationally and support domestic price structures. An animal ID system could aid in rescuing animals during natural disasters. Opponents argue against implementing an animal ID and traceability system. Opponents argue that an animal ID and traceability system invades privacy and increases costs and technical complexity. Critics fear government intrusion into personal information and potential disclosure of proprietary data, along with higher producer-level implementation costs without market guarantees. The concern over increased producer-level costs of implementing an animal ID system without market benefits is supported by a USDA-funded analysis. Over 90% of the annual cost would fall on the cattle sector, and the technology requirements could complicate operations. Additionally, the system rewards vertical integration over family farms in the cattle industry. The implementation of a national ID program in the cattle industry is expected to disproportionately burden cattle producers with individual animal tagging costs, disadvantaging family farms with a lack of market power. This added cost factor could erode profit margins for small operators who cannot spread the costs over large operations. Disadvantages family farms due to lack of market power in price structure. Large retailers and meat packers may shift compliance costs to farms, making it harder for smaller, independent farms to survive. Some religious groups object to individual animal marking. Producer push-back due to concerns about increased transparency at the farm level. Some producers are concerned about increased transparency at the farm level leading to higher tax liabilities. A national animal ID and traceability program has evolved from state and national disease eradication efforts overseen by USDA's APHIS. The USDA's APHIS oversees programs for animal disease eradication and control, including animal identification requirements. Brucellosis ID tags were used successfully in eradicating brucellosis from U.S. commercial herds. Official identification requirements have long been in place for certain classes of livestock before interstate commerce. After the successful eradication of brucellosis from U.S. commercial herds using ID tags, official identification requirements have been in place for certain classes of livestock before entering interstate commerce. Various disease programs and state laws mandate animal identification for species like swine, sheep, cattle, and horses. However, these programs are not nationally standardized and differ in their approach to animal identification, record keeping, and data management. Limitations in U.S. animal ID were highlighted after the discovery of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in a Canadian-born dairy cow in December 2003. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) program was established in response to the discovery of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in a Canadian-born dairy cow in the United States in December 2003. Trading partners were hesitant to reopen borders due to difficulties in tracing the whereabouts of other cattle that had entered the country with the infected cow. The NAIS program, administered by USDA's APHIS, aimed to improve animal identification and tracking through a state-federal-industry partnership. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) was a voluntary program that aimed to improve animal identification and tracking. However, due to criticism from the U.S. cattle sector, the USDA replaced NAIS with a more flexible, state-based program that mandates traceability only for livestock moving in interstate commerce. The NAIS system aimed to cover all major commercial livestock and poultry species in the US, excluding household pets. It was replaced with a state-based program for livestock traceability in interstate commerce. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) aimed to identify animals entering commerce or commingling with others at different premises. It was voluntary and focused on popularizing the program, providing information, and addressing implementation issues by species/sectors. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) focused on prioritizing implementation by species/sectors, harmonizing animal ID programs, standardizing data elements, integrating technology, partnering with states/industry, and advancing ID technologies. USDA published reports for participant guidance, technical standards, and implementation strategies. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) focused on prioritizing implementation by species/sectors, harmonizing animal ID programs, standardizing data elements, integrating technology, partnering with states/industry, and advancing ID technologies. Reports provided detailed information about the status of NAIS, how to participate in the program, necessary technical details, and future program implementation directions. A Business Plan to Advance Animal Disease Traceability recommended strategies to enhance animal disease traceability. The NAIS User Guide offered guidance to producers and owners of animals. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) User Guide, published in November 2006, provided guidance to producers and owners of animals on how to participate in NAIS and the benefits. The Program Standards and Technical Reference document established data standards for NAIS, including formats for premises identification numbers, animal identification numbers, and group/lot identification numbers. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) aimed to protect U.S. agriculture from animal disease outbreaks. It was not a food safety program but could have positive public safety effects. USDA set specific goals to increase disease control. USDA set specific goals for NAIS to increase disease control, limit disease spread, minimize economic impact, protect animal producers' livelihoods, and maintain market access. The long-term goal was to identify and trace animals within 48 hours of a disease problem, requiring rapid access to reliable data on animal ID and movement history. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) was designed to quickly trace animals in a disease outbreak to their original premises and identify other exposed animals. NAIS consisted of three components: premises registration, animal identification, and animal tracking. The first phase of NAIS involved registering the geographic location where livestock or poultry were raised, housed, or boarded. States and tribes had to collect and maintain specific information for premises registration, including a premises identification number (PIN), entity name, contact person, address or coordinates, phone numbers, operation type, activation and retirement dates, and alternative phone numbers. The PIN is a unique seven-digit number permanently assigned. The PIN, a unique seven-digit number permanently assigned to a location, would not change following a change of ownership. A producer or owner could have multiple PINs based on the nature and type of operations. Premises registration was free and did not require participation in the following steps. USDA maintained the premises information in a National Premises Information Repository, ensuring privacy and confidentiality. The USDA implemented premises information to protect private and business data, notify producers of disease outbreaks, and aid in locating at-risk animals during emergencies. By 2009, only 37% of U.S. animal and poultry operations were registered under the NAIS. The USDA implemented premises information to protect private and business data, notify producers of disease outbreaks, and aid in locating at-risk animals during emergencies. By 2009, only 37% of U.S. animal and poultry operations were registered under the NAIS. USDA stated that higher levels of participation were needed to successfully implement NAIS, with the second phase involving assigning unique numbers to individual animals or specific groups. An animal identification number (AIN) is a unique 15-digit number, with the first three digits as the country code and the following 12 digits as the animal's unique identifying number. Animal ID under NAIS was achieved through obtaining USDA-recognized numbering tags or devices from authorized manufacturers. AIN devices include visual ear-tags, RFID tags, and injectable transponders for electronic reading. USDA did not designate. The USDA did not specify specific identification technologies beyond the minimum requirements for official identification. RFID devices and injectable transponders are increasingly used for faster access to ID information, eliminating the need to approach or restrain animals. Some animals were not required to be identified under NAIS. USDA encouraged all animal owners to register their premises, regardless of the number of animals present, due to the potential spread of diseases like avian influenza, foot-and-mouth disease, and vesicular stomatitis. Some animals, such as those that never leave their birth premises or are moved directly to custom slaughter for personal consumption, did not need to be identified under NAIS. The USDA recommended registering all animal premises to prevent disease spread. Animals should have an ID attached before moving to another location. Producers could choose when to attach the ID, either shortly after birth or later. If unable to tag at current premises, animals could be tagged at an auction market before being commingled with others. Animals should be tagged before being commingled with others, with tagging services available in some areas. Producers bringing animals into their operation should maintain the official identification already on the animal. Group/lot identification numbers can be used for animals moving through the production chain as a group, common in the poultry and pork industries. The Group/Lot Identification Number (GIN) is a 15-character number used in the poultry and pork industries, but can also be used for other species moving through the production chain. It consists of a seven-character PIN, a six-digit date, and a two-digit number to reflect the count of groups assembled at the same premises on the same day. The GIN is self-generated by the producer and remains with the animal for its lifetime. The uniform numbering system links livestock or poultry to their birthplace. The identification protocol is tailored to different species groups and their movement. The third phase of NAIS involves timely access to animal movement records for disease outbreak response. Producers choose NAIS-compliant animal tracking databases for this purpose. Under NAIS, states and private industry maintain a system for reporting animal movements. The minimum tracing information required includes national premises identification number, animal ID number, date of event, and event type. Additional animal-specific data is standardized but not necessary for participation. The voluntary animal tracing component of NAIS is a public/private partnership where industry and states operate and maintain Animal Tracking Databases (ATDs) containing animal location and movement records. The federal government does not maintain the ATDs; states and private entities do. The federal government does not maintain the Animal Tracking Databases (ATDs) for the National Animal Identification System (NAIS); states and private entities do. USDA operates the Animal Trace Processing System (ATPS) to enable animal health officials to request information from the ATDs during disease outbreaks. The ATDs provide timely and accurate reports on animal movements during health events. The USDA defines optimal retrieval of traceback data within a 48-hour window for disease containment. The system is used in situations like a positive test for a foreign animal disease or a need to trace the origin of infection for certain diseases. About 40% of potential premises in the US were included in the system as of September 2008. As of September 2008, 40% of potential premises in the United States had been registered in the system for disease containment. Poultry and sheep registration was at 95%, swine at 80%, goat at 60%, horse at 50%, and cattle at 18%. 531,284 animal premises (excluding horses) had been registered in one of the databases, representing 36.9% of livestock and poultry farms in the US. To effectively respond to an animal disease outbreak, USDA's NAIS program aims for a 70% participation rate in identifying and tracing 70% of animals in a specific species back to their premises of origin. This \"critical mass\" level of participation is necessary for achieving a 48-hour traceback goal. Dr. Clifford suggested a 90% participation rate is needed for effective traceability in the animal ID program. Some supporters criticize USDA for slow progress and lack of clear direction. GAO report identified problems hindering implementation, such as prioritization among species and integration with existing requirements. The USDA's National Animal Identification System (NAIS) faced criticism for not integrating with existing animal ID requirements, lacking key data requirements, and low participation rates. The USDA's slow progress was attributed to unresolved issues and differences among producers. USDA officials expressed concern over low participation rates hindering NAIS's effectiveness in achieving a 48-hour traceback window. The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) and other groups called for Congress to address low participation rates in the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) by making the program mandatory for all U.S. breeding cattle. USDA mandates animal ID for U.S. breeding cattle. Industry groups and lawmakers support mandatory national system to prevent losses from diseases. Opposition exists to mandatory NAIS. Groups opposed to a mandatory NAIS, such as the Rancher's-Cattlemen Action Legal Fund (R-CALF) and the National Cattlemen's Beef Association (NCBA), fear high costs and industry concentration. They question USDA's ability to keep information confidential. Members of Congress from cattle-heavy districts share these concerns. In August 2006, then-Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns announced that USDA would continue to implement NAIS as a voluntary program, despite concerns from the cattle industry. Proponents argue that Secretary Vilsack should have the authority to make participation in NAIS mandatory. The USDA reversed the decision to make participation in NAIS voluntary and announced it would be mandatory for the U.S. livestock industry. The costs of an animal ID system include tags, data systems, and increased traceability costs. Cost estimates for a national system vary widely, with questions about who should bear the expenses - the industry, government, or both. USDA's proposals suggest sharing expenses, with government funding database costs. The USDA's proposals suggest sharing expenses for a mandatory animal ID system, with government funding database costs. Larger retailers and meat packers may shift compliance costs to farms, making it harder for smaller operations to survive. Smaller plants with slower fabrication speeds may be better equipped to implement traceability. On April 29, 2009, APHIS released a study on the economic benefits and costs of adopting USDA's NAIS. The research was conducted by economists at Kansas State University in collaboration with researchers from other universities. Key study assumptions included the implementation of NAIS across multiple species and at varying participation rates. Smaller plants with slower fabrication speeds may find niche market opportunities. The KSU Benefit-Cost Study (2009) estimated annual costs for implementing NAIS in the livestock industry at approximately $228 million for full pre-harvest traceability with 100% participation. Costs increase to $304.2 million when including horses. Lower participation levels result in lower cost estimates. The cost estimates for implementing NAIS in the livestock industry vary based on levels of participation and traceability features. Over 90% of the costs would be associated with the cattle sector, amounting to $5.97 per animal marketed. Identification tags and tagging cattle make up 75% of the annual adoption costs, ranging from $3.30 to $5.22 per animal. The average cost per animal for livestock sectors varies, with the cattle industry at $5.97 per animal. Other sectors have lower costs: $0.059 per swine, $1.39 per sheep, $0.0007 per broiler, $0.002 per turkey, and $0.0195 per layer. A study showed that the economic benefits of NAIS with full participation outweigh the costs, including savings in disease control programs and quicker market recovery after outbreaks. The study found that implementing NAIS could lead to expanded market access, avoidance of significant losses, and increased consumer demand. Cost-effectiveness of NAIS increases with higher participation levels, but may not be economically viable at lower levels. Some producers are concerned about liability for contamination issues. Producers are concerned about liability for contamination issues and public scrutiny of their records under the federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). They believe documentation of management practices can protect against liability and prove the origin and raising of animals. Some worry about animal rights extremists misusing information obtained through FOIA. The 110th Congress removed a provision in the omnibus 2008 farm bill that would have required USDA regulations to protect trade secrets and confidential business information in an animal ID system. South Korea plans to implement traceability measures. South Korea plans to impose traceability requirements on imported beef by December 2010, following the EU's standards. Japan currently does not require traceability for imported beef but has age limitations. The Democratic Party of Japan aims to pass laws to subject imported beef to traceability requirements. The DPJ in Japan aims to form a coalition to pass legislation but may not prioritize traceability requirements for imported beef. India is the only major beef exporter without a traceability system, exporting low-valued canned/cooked beef. According to CattleFax analyst Brett Stuart, beef traceability may become necessary for global market access due to WTO regulations on non-tariff trade barriers. Traceability measures for imports must be scientifically justified and equivalent. Since early 2004, USDA has invested nearly $142 million in the development of the National Animal Identification System (NAIS), with funds allocated for research, database systems, and premises registration. Despite the significant investment, only about 40% of livestock producers participated in NAIS by 2009, leading to criticism from the U.S. cattle sector. In response to low participation rates and concerns from producers, efforts were made to assess and address issues with NAIS. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack conducted public listening sessions from April 15 to June 30, 2009, to gather feedback on the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) from livestock producers and stakeholders. The information collected from these sessions and written comments helped Vilsack make decisions on the future of animal ID and traceability in the U.S. Secretary Vilsack announced the abandonment of NAIS in favor of a state-based system in 2010 due to growing frustration with the slow pace of implementation despite significant funding. Congress directed APHIS to make progress in implementing the program and meeting specific objectives. In 2009, the Administration proposed increasing funding for the NAIS to $14.6 million in FY2010, but the House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee voted to eliminate funding for USDA's NAIS from the FY2010 appropriations bill. Subcommittee chairwoman Rosa DeLauro and Collin Peterson expressed frustration with the slow national sign-up for NAIS. The full committee's report (H.Rept. 111-181) criticized the slow progress of the NAIS despite receiving $142 million in funding since FY2004. It stated that USDA needs to provide details on how it will implement an effective ID system before further investments are made in NAIS. The Senate version of H.R. 2997 initially included the proposed $14.6 million funding, but an amendment to eliminate Senate funding for NAIS failed to pass in July. The Senate version of H.R. 2997, as amended, passed with reduced FY2010 funding of $7.3 million. House and Senate differences in funding were resolved, setting the final FY2010 funding level for NAIS at $5.3 million. The Agriculture appropriations bill was signed into law as P.L. 111-80 by President Obama on October 21, 2009. The USDA has claimed authority to implement an animal ID program under the Animal Health Protection Act. In the 110th Congress, bills were proposed to clarify USDA's authority and establish a national ID system. In the 111th Congress, H.R. 3485 and S. 1292 aimed to implement a comprehensive farm-to-consumer animal ID and meat traceability program for USDA-regulated meat and poultry, as well as other FDA-regulated foods. These bills required FSIS to establish a system to trace each animal and meat/poultry product from slaughter through distribution to the consumer. The bills in the 111th Congress aimed to implement a farm-to-consumer animal ID and meat traceability program for USDA-regulated meat and poultry, as well as other FDA-regulated foods. This would involve tracing each animal and meat/poultry product from slaughter through distribution to the consumer. Traceability provisions have been included in food safety legislation approved by the House and Senate, but they apply to FDA-regulated foods, not FSIS-regulated meat and poultry products. The Subcommittee on Livestock, Dairy, and Poultry held public hearings to review animal identification systems, including the National Animal Identification System. Previous Congresses have also discussed animal ID issues related to health, disease, bio-security, and agro-terrorism. Animal ID has been used in the United States since the 1800s. In the 1800s, hot iron brands were used in the U.S. West for animal ID to prevent theft. In the 1940s, USDA started a program to identify cattle vaccinated for brucellosis with tags and ear tattoos. The system was successful but phased out as brucellosis neared eradication. Animal industries realized early detection of sick animals was crucial during disease outbreaks in the 1950s-1980s. In the 1980s, USDA began planning a national animal identification system after realizing the importance of early detection during disease outbreaks. Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or \"mad cow disease\" was first identified in the UK's cattle herds in 1986-1988, leading to the slaughter of 3.7 million cattle. In 1997, an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Taiwan resulted in $6.9 billion in losses. In 1997, an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Taiwan cost $6.9 billion in losses and led to the slaughter of 3.8 million pigs, impacting the pork export market. Similarly, a major outbreak of Classical Swine Fever in the Netherlands resulted in the destruction of 12 million hogs and $2.3 billion in economic losses. In 2001, an outbreak of FMD in cattle in the UK led to the slaughter of over 10 million sheep and cattle, costing $7.9 billion in losses. In 2003, Animal Agriculture and other organizations collaborated to draft an early version of the U.S. Animal Identification Plan. A group of state, federal, and industry representatives formed the National Identification Development Team, which created the initial draft of the U.S. Animal Identification Plan (USAIP). The plan called for recording the movement of individual animals in a central database, with APHIS responsible for designing an ID numbering system and allocating numbers to premises and animals. The USAIP called for all states to have an animal premises ID system by July 2004, with farm animals identified by July 2006. The first case of mad cow disease in the US led to accelerated implementation of a national animal ID system by USDA. Secretary Ann Veneman transferred $18.8 million from CCC funds to APHIS for the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) in April 2004. The program's framework was announced, periodically revised, and a Draft Strategic Plan was issued in May 2005 for a mandatory program by January 2009. USDA announced Draft Program Standards in August 2005 and unveiled Implementation Strategies in April 2006. In April 2006, USDA introduced a new plan called \"Implementation Strategies\" for the National Animal Identification System (NAIS), setting a timeline for full implementation by 2009. The program was initially designed to transition from voluntary to mandatory, but in August 2006, it was announced that NAIS would remain entirely voluntary at the federal level. In November 2006, USDA distributed a draft \"user guide\" outlining the three-step approach to implementing the National Animal Identification System (NAIS). The guide emphasized that the program would remain voluntary and protect individuals' private information. In December 2007, USDA's APHIS released the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) User Guide and Additional Information Resource. In April 2008, a Business Plan was released in draft form to advance animal disease traceability, with a focus on achieving 48-hour traceback of affected animals in case of an outbreak. The plan prioritized species, placing primary commercial food animals in \"Tier 1\" along with horses requiring a health certificate. The USDA's APHIS released the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) User Guide and Business Plan in 2007 and 2008, prioritizing commercial food animals in \"Tier 1\" for traceability. A proposed rule for an Official Animal Identification Numbering System was published in January 2009, aiming to bring 70% of the cattle breeding herd into NAIS by the end of 2009. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack held public listening sessions from April to June 2009 with various stakeholders. In April 2009, public listening sessions were held to gather feedback on the National Animal Identification System (NAIS). In 2010, Secretary Vilsack announced a new approach for animal disease traceability, allowing states to choose their own system. The USDA is proposing a new approach for animal identification and traceability, giving states the freedom to choose their own system. However, all animals moving in interstate commerce must have a form of ID for traceability. Public meetings were held from March to August 2010 to gather feedback on the Animal Disease Traceability framework. The USDA is proposing a new approach for animal identification and traceability, allowing states to choose their own system. Animals in interstate commerce must have ID for traceability. The United States participates in international organizations like CODEX, OIE, and WTO for animal health and trade. The United States participates in international organizations like CODEX, OIE, and WTO for animal health and trade. U.S. livestock and animal products are subject to export certification standards imposed by importing countries. The WTO sets international trade rules for harmonizing commerce and dispute settlement, while CODEX and OIE recommend standards for food safety and animal health. The WTO's Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures restricts traceability measures on imports to scientifically justified requirements equivalent to domestic standards. The Codex Alimentarius Commission, created in 1963 by the FAO and the World, develops international standards for food safety. The FAO and WHO collaborate to develop food standards and guidelines under the Joint FAO/WHO Food Standards Program to protect consumer health and ensure fair trade practices. The OIE, founded in 1924, is responsible for coordinating international efforts related to animal health. The OIE, an intergovernmental organization, is a leading standard-setting body for animal identification and traceability. It assists member countries in implementing systems to enhance disease prevention, food safety, and export certification. The OIE, as a standard-setting body, adopted standards on animal identification and traceability in 2007. These standards include general principles and guidance on system design and implementation. The Director General called for global implementation of these systems from farm to fork under OIE standards. Robust animal identification and tracing systems following OIE standards allow compartmentalization and regionalization during disease outbreaks, enabling trade continuity for animal products. The OIE's Terrestrial Code includes sections on zoning and compartmentalization. Export certification is managed by USDA's FSIS for compliance with importing countries' requirements. Certification for beef imports involves compliance with importing country's standards, including animal production methods and plant inspections. The OIE contributes to international certification standards through programs promoting transparency and reliance on scientific information. Chapter 5 of the OIE's Terrestrial Code outlines general obligations and procedures for certification. Foreign Animal ID and Traceability Programs have been adopted by many international trading partners and competitors, such as Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, the European Union, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, and Uruguay. Canada has its own national individual identification, tracking, and trace-back system managed by the Canadian Cattle Identification Agency (CCIA). The Canadian Cattle Identification Agency (CCIA) oversees the animal identification and trace-back system for the Canadian cattle and bison industry. It is governed by a board of directors representing various sectors of the Canadian livestock industry, with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) as a non-voting member. Initially a voluntary program in 2001, cattle identification became mandatory on July 1, 2002, using CCIA-approved ear tags. Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) collaborates with CCIA to meet funding requirements for development initiatives. Since 2003, the Canadian cattle industry has transitioned to RFID tags for all cattle leaving their farm of origin. These tags consist of a transponder with an encoded chip and antenna, providing benefits such as exceptional tag retention, increased data integrity, and the ability to read at a distance without line of sight. CCIA executive director estimated a nationwide compliance rate of 99-100% for Canadian cattle ID by March 2009. The compliance rate for Canadian cattle ID is between 99-100%. Personal information associated with ear tag numbers is securely maintained in the national database. The Canadian Livestock Traceability System (CLTS) houses national ID and traceback systems for various industry and species groups. Mandatory sheep and hog identification programs were established in 2004 and 2008, respectively. Australia has the National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) for traceability. The National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) in Australia is a permanent system for electronic identification and traceability of livestock from birth to slaughter. It was established in the early 1960s to eradicate bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis. Mandatory cattle identification started in 1967, while tracing systems for sheep and goats began in 2009. Similar systems are being developed for pigs and alpacas. In 1967, a mandatory cattle identification system using Property Identification Codes (PICs) was established to trace cattle back to their last property of residence. In the mid-1990s, the system transitioned to electronic RFID technology for whole-of-life individual cattle identification to ensure biosecurity, food safety, and market access. In 1998, individual identification became compulsory for producers supplying the EU market with meat from Hormone Growth Promotant-free cattle. The NLIS was introduced in 1999, and by 2004, all animals identified using NLIS were traced to their property of origin within 24 hours. NLIS expanded in 2005 to mandatory animal identification for all cattle leaving their property of birth. Individual animal ID information in Australia is linked to live animals, carcasses, hides, and byproducts through a unique ID number attached to a bar code at slaughter. However, unless specific agreements are made, animals are grouped into lots by harvest date and time, and individual carcass data is not available. Australia's NLIS is a joint commitment between the Australian Government and state levels. The Australian Government and state governments work in partnership with industry to implement the animal identification program. State governments have legal jurisdiction over livestock movement and health, while the Federal government provides funding and policy coordination. Joint management committees in each state develop legislation and education programs for producers. State governments maintain a registry of PICs for tracking animals. The state governments in Australia work with industry to implement the animal identification program, including establishing a registry of PICs and monitoring compliance. Meat and Livestock Australia administers the database for NLIS, protecting data from Australian Freedom of Information laws. The European Union also has regulations on animal identification. The European Union (EU) has mandatory programs for animal identification as part of its food safety initiatives. The objectives include localizing and tracing animals for veterinary purposes to control infectious diseases. Species-specific ID systems have evolved in response to disease outbreaks like classical swine fever and foot-and-mouth disease. The EU incorporates traceability in its animal ID systems. In response to the BSE crisis, the EU implemented a mandatory system for permanent identification of individual bovine animals, requiring double ear tags for identification and maintaining a register at each location. Cattle passports and a national electronic database were also established for tracking movements. The EU implemented a mandatory bovine ID and traceability system after the BSE crisis. Regulations require tracking animals from birth to harvest and labeling meat products with reference numbers linking them to the animal of origin, member state of harvest, and facility approval numbers. Mandatory food traceability has been in place since 2005 in the EU. Since 2000, all equidae in the EU must have a passport for movement. Porcine animals have had mandatory identification since 2008, while ovine and caprine animals have had an ID system since 2005. Japan also has a bovine ID system since 2004, tracking animals from birth to consumer purchase. Imported beef does not have the same traceability requirements as domestic beef. In Japan, domestically produced beef is subject to traceability requirements due to food safety crises in the early 2000s, including BSE discovery and labeling scandals. Imported beef currently lacks the same traceability regulations. In response to food safety crises, Japan implemented traceability laws for domestically produced beef, requiring traceability from farms to slaughterhouses by December 1, 2003. Subsequently, the Beef Traceability Law extended traceability to processors, distributors, and retailers by December 1, 2004. This led to retailers and restaurants displaying animal identification numbers for consumers to access information about the beef they purchase. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries (MAFF) in Japan introduced the Japan Agricultural Standard (JAS) program for certifying the traceability of imported beef. Exporters need to provide detailed information including date of birth, sex, breed, owner's name and address, fattening location, slaughter date, feeds, and pharmaceuticals used. South Korea has a mandatory Beef Traceability System (BTS) for domestically produced beef, requiring individual identification. The South Korean government implemented a mandatory Beef Traceability System (BTS) for domestically produced beef in 2009. The BTS tracks individual animals from birth to consumer, providing detailed information such as sex, breed, quality grade, location of birth, owner's information, feed and medications administered, slaughter date and location, inspection date, and processing location. The South Korean government plans to impose traceability requirements on imported beef by December 2010. New Zealand established the NAIT system to improve animal traceability, starting as a project in early 2009. New Zealand's NAIT system, established in early 2009, is still in development and focuses on traceability for cattle and deer populations. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) emphasizes that other species should only be added once the system is fully operational. New Zealand's animal ID systems for cattle and deer include the voluntary MINDA system and the mandatory NTBIP. MINDA is for herd management with high dairy herd participation, while NTBIP focuses on animal traceability before movement. A new mandatory animal identification system for cattle and possibly deer is proposed to be in place by June 2011 in Brazil, known as the Brazilian Bovine and Buffalo Identification and Certification System (SISBOV). Initially intended as a mandatory program for producers, SISBOV now includes the entire beef chain. SISBOV, a voluntary program in Brazil, focuses on providing origination information for animals destined for foreign markets, particularly the EU. The program was initially intended for producers but now includes the entire beef chain. The EU has raised concerns about Brazil's animal identification and traceability system, leading to a near-total ban on beef imports from Brazil in 2008. Despite efforts to improve, a 2009 report suggests the situation in Brazil was deteriorating. The EU/FVO raised concerns about Brazil's animal identification system in 2009 due to lack of robust information and fear of foot-and-mouth disease entering the EU. Argentina established a limited mandatory system of animal identification and traceability in 2003, directed at animal products destined for the EU. Argentina implemented a mandatory animal identification system in 2003 for cattle destined for export markets, with official ID tagging required for calves born after September 2007. The system aims to track cattle from birth to slaughter, but the entire beef herd is not expected to be tagged until 2017. Export limitations, particularly due to foot and mouth disease outbreaks, have restricted Argentina's beef exports to the United States to thermo-processed beef. Argentina implemented a mandatory animal identification system in 2003 for cattle destined for export markets. Export limitations due to foot and mouth disease outbreaks have restricted Argentina's beef exports to the United States. Uruguay is dependent on external markets for selling a large portion of its annual beef production, with 68% sold in foreign markets during 2004-2008. Uruguay has a strong incentive to provide animal identification and traceability information as demanded by foreign buyers. Uruguay implemented a comprehensive national program in late 2006. Uruguay's Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture, and Fisheries (MAGyP) introduced the National Livestock Information System (SNIG) in 2006, requiring all cattle to be tagged before six months of age or transport. Two tags, one visible and one electronic, are needed for each animal, along with accompanying paperwork. The government aims to have all herds registered and cattle tagged by 2010, extending traceability beyond slaughter. The government of Uruguay introduced the National Livestock Information System (SNIG) in 2006, requiring cattle to be tagged before six months of age. SNIG extends traceability to all cuts of beef back to specific animals at their farm of origin. The system includes premises and animal identification, movements, and termination data, with termination records recorded by MAGyP. Further traceability to consumers is under consideration. The Uruguayan government plans to shift the cost of ID tags for cattle to producers in the future. Some countries like Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, and Russia do not have animal ID programs due to large agrarian populations and lack of national distribution chains for animal products. In poorer countries, consumers cannot afford to be selective with animal products, leading to a lack of willingness to pay extra for identified and traceable food."
