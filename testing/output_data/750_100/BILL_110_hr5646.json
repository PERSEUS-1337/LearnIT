    "content": "The Act titled \"Protecting the Second Amendment and Hunting Rights on Federal Lands Act of 2008\" allows for possessing or carrying firearms and ammunition in units of the National Park System and the National Wildlife Refuge System. Congress finds that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to bear arms and that firearms are used for self-defense over 2,000,000 times a year in the US. States expanding firearm rights for self-defense have seen a decrease in gun-related crime. Federal regulations currently prohibit firearm possession in National Parks and Wildlife units. The regulations in National Parks and Wildlife Refuges often restrict individuals' Second Amendment rights, conflicting with Federal and State laws on firearm possession and transportation in these areas. Federal law should clarify that the second amendment rights of an individual in units of the National Park System or the National Wildlife Refuge System will not be infringed. No Federal regulation shall restrict any individual's right to keep and bear firearms and ammunition in these areas. Federal law should clarify that second amendment rights in National Park System or National Wildlife Refuge System will not be restricted. No Federal regulation can limit individuals from possessing firearms or ammunition in these areas. Federal law should clarify that second amendment rights in National Park System or National Wildlife Refuge System will not be restricted, allowing individuals to possess firearms and ammunition in these areas. The purpose of this section is to require that hunting activities be included in all Federal land management plans unless clearly incompatible with the land's purposes. The head of the agency overseeing the land must ensure that hunting is allowed unless it conflicts with the land's management goals. The head of the agency overseeing Federal land must include reasons for not allowing hunting in the management plan, ensuring hunting activities are aligned with the land's purposes. Fee charged for hunting activities on Federal land should not exceed a certain limit. Fees charged for hunting activities on Federal land must be limited to cover management costs and retained by the agency overseeing the land. Any excess fees will be considered a restriction on hunting. The Act defines hunting to include hunting, trapping, netting, and fishing on Federal land. A management plan must be in place for the management or use of Federal land. This section applies to all management plans developed, approved, or amended after the enactment of this section."
