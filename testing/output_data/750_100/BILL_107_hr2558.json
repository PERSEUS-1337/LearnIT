    "content": "The Act titled \"Teacher Voluntary Early Retirement Incentive Act of 2001\" allows for voluntary early retirement incentive plans for governmental and higher education employees. Amendment to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 allows for voluntary retirement incentive plans for employees of educational agencies and institutions of higher education. Supplemental benefits for employees based on age at retirement must not be reduced or eliminated unless permitted by other provisions. These benefits should be in addition to any retirement or severance benefits offered to all employees within the past year. The Teacher Voluntary Early Retirement Incentive Act of 2001 allows eligible employees a 180-day window to elect retirement without being required to retire sooner than 180 days after election. The amendment ensures that employees who are not eligible for maximum supplemental benefits due to their age at retirement were given a fair chance to receive those benefits earlier in their employment. This amendment applies to voluntary employee early retirement plans in local educational agencies, with exceptions outlined in the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967. Employees in educational agencies or higher education institutions found in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 after January 1, 1996. SEC. 3.

The amendments made by subsections (a) and (b) apply to determining if a voluntary early retirement incentive plan or an employee benefit plan providing medical benefits for retired participants was in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967. No inference may be drawn regarding whether a voluntary early retirement incentive plan maintained by a local educational agency constitutes a defined benefit plan for any purpose."
