Private prisoner transport companies may be used by governmental entities for moving violent prisoners due to fiscal or logistical concerns. If a government entity chooses to use a private prisoner transport company, the company should be regulated to enhance public safety. Private prisoner transport companies may be utilized by governmental entities for transporting violent prisoners. Regulation of these companies is necessary to ensure public safety. In this Act, the term \"crime of violence\" is defined as in section 924(c)(3) of title 18, United States Code. A \"private prisoner transport company\" is any entity, other than the government, that transports individuals in custody for compensation. A \"violent prisoner\" is an individual in the custody of a State or an inferior political subdivision. An individual in custody of a State or inferior political subdivision previously convicted of or currently charged with a crime of violence or similar statute. SEC. 4. FEDERAL REGULATION OF PRISONER TRANSPORT COMPANIES. The Attorney General, in consultation with relevant organizations, will establish regulations for transporting violent prisoners across state lines, including background checks and drug testing for employees. Employees must undergo a minimum of 100 hours of training before transporting prisoners, covering restraints, searches, use of force, CPR, map reading, and defensive driving. Preemployment drug testing will be conducted according to State laws. Minimum standards for employee uniforms, identification, and restrictions on the number of hours employees can be on duty are outlined. Additionally, there are minimum standards for the number of personnel required to supervise violent prisoners, with a ratio of 1 agent for every 6 violent prisoners. Minimum standards for employee uniforms and identification include wearing a uniform with a badge identifying the employee as a transportation officer. Standards also require violent prisoners to wear brightly colored clothing for identification and specify the use of restraints like leg shackles and double-locked handcuffs. Private prisoner transport companies must notify local law enforcement when transporting violent prisoners. Private prisoner transport companies must notify local law enforcement officials 24 hours in advance of any scheduled stops.

Minimum safety standards for violent prisoners must be followed according to Federal and State law. Federal regulations for private prisoner transport companies must not be stricter than those for the United States Marshals Service, Federal Bureau of Prisons, and Immigration and Naturalization Service when transporting violent prisoners. SEC. 5. ENFORCEMENT. Violators of the regulations established by this Act may face a civil penalty up to $10,000 per violation, along with prosecution costs. They must also reimburse any entity that incurred expenses in apprehending a violent prisoner who escaped due to a violation of the regulations.
