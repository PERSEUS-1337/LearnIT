    "content": "The federal government has a strong interest in regulating hazardous chemicals security to prevent terrorist attacks since September 11, 2001. Congressional attention has focused on ensuring the availability of these chemicals for commercial use while reducing the risk of exploitation by terrorists. In the 109th Congress, legislation was introduced to enhance penalties for criminal activities around ports and marine vessels, as well as to improve general port security. Congress is also considering federal policies for the marine transportation of hazardous chemical cargo in response to the evolving security environment. The report provides an overview of hazardous chemicals marine transportation in the United States, focusing on risks in the homeland security context. It includes federal statistics on hazardous chemical marine shipments, detailing shipment volumes and port locations. The report discusses U.S. maritime security regulations and policy issues related to shipments of acutely hazardous chemicals that could pose a catastrophic hazard. It does not cover other maritime security hazards like petroleum products or biological agents. The report focuses on threats to the general public from chemical releases during marine transport, particularly hazardous chemical cargo that are potential terrorist targets due to their toxicity and combustibility. Legal limitations prevent detailed statistics on specific hazardous chemicals or ports of interest from being provided. Hazardous chemical marine vessels are a serious threat to human life and infrastructure if intentionally released near populated areas. Protecting these shipments is crucial for U.S. homeland security, as they are potential terrorist targets. Major accidents involving hazardous chemical marine vessels are rare but have resulted in some of the deadliest industrial incidents in history. While no terrorist attacks using these vessels have occurred in the U.S., intelligence suggests that foreign terrorists may have the interest and capability to carry out such attacks. In 1917, the explosion of the Mont-Blanc in Halifax killed over 1,900 people. The 1947 Texas City explosion killed nearly 600. Improved safety practices have prevented similar disasters, but incidents involving chemical marine shipments have still occurred. Incidents involving chemical marine shipments have forced evacuations of coastal populations, including fires aboard vessels carrying toxic chemicals in Somalia, Spain, and Scotland. While no serious casualties occurred, emergency responders were highly concerned for public safety. Terrorists have not used marine cargo vessels for chemical attacks on the general public. During the 1990s, international combatants and domestic terrorists attempted to release chemicals from land-based facilities in foreign war zones like Croatia. Attacks targeted plants producing various hazardous chemicals near population centers. In the United States, criminals also tried to release chemicals in the late 1990s. During the late 1990s, criminals attempted to release chemicals from facilities in California and Texas. Terrorists targeted marine vessels, including an Al-Qaeda plot in June 2002 and an attack on the oil tanker Limburg in October 2002. Foreign governments have expressed concerns about terrorist groups commandeering hazardous chemical vessels. The Department of Homeland Security is concerned about terrorist groups hijacking chemical tanker ships and crashing them into ports. The President's National Strategy highlights the challenge of protecting high consequence cargo in the port system. The Department of Homeland Security is concerned about terrorist threats to high consequence cargo, including liquefied natural gas (LNG) tankers. The risks associated with LNG shipments are real and can never be entirely eliminated, according to DHS and Sandia National Laboratories reports. LNG tankers are vulnerable to various terrorist attacks such as ramming, explosives, hijacking, and missile attacks. Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD-7) focuses on terrorist attacks with catastrophic health effects or mass casualties comparable to those from a weapon of mass destruction. Hazardous chemical cargo on commercial marine vessels could pose a catastrophic hazard to the public if accidentally released or combusted, leading to poisoning, asphyxiation, chemical burns, or thermal burns. Numerous federal standards identify potentially hazardous chemicals, with relevant standards promulgated by the Department of Transportation (DOT), the Coast Guard, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The Hazardous Materials Transportation Act of 1975 empowers the Secretary of Transportation to designate hazardous materials that may pose risks to health, safety, and property. The DOT classifies hazardous materials in 49 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 172.101, including toxic, radioactive, corrosive, explosive, and flammable materials. Materials are grouped by type of hazard, with a ranking of relative hazard provided in 49 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 173.2a. The DOT requires shippers of certain hazardous materials to comply with safety regulations. The DOT requires shippers of certain highly hazardous cargo to develop security plans, including radioactive material, explosives, poisonous inhalation materials, bulk hazardous liquids or gases, bulk hazardous solids, packaged hazardous material, CDC regulated agents, and placarded hazardous materials. The Coast Guard enforces federal hazardous material laws for marine vessels, identifying hazardous cargo as per DOT regulations. Certain dangerous cargoes are defined under the Port and Waterways Safety Act of 1972. The Coast Guard enforces federal hazardous material laws for marine vessels, identifying hazardous cargo as per DOT regulations. Certain dangerous cargoes, including liquefied gas and bulk liquid cargoes, are prescribed special requirements by the Coast Guard in 46 C.F.R. for vessels carrying hazardous materials. This includes bulk solid hazardous materials, bulk liquid hazardous materials in barges, bulk liquid, liquified gas, or compressed gas hazardous materials carried by ship, and regulations for incompatible chemicals on parcel tankers or container ships. The Coast Guard enforces hazardous material laws for marine vessels, identifying various hazardous materials. Regulations also cover waterfront facilities handling hazardous cargoes. The EPA regulates stationary facilities under the Clean Air Act. Congress amended the CAA to require facilities with specified quantities of hazardous substances to comply. Section 112 mandates facilities with certain threshold quantities of hazardous substances to submit risk management plans (RMPs) detailing potential threats from large releases. RMPs must include off-site consequence analysis for worst-case scenarios, prevention measures, and mitigation plans. Hazardous substances include 14 listed chemicals and over 100 designated by the EPA based on risk criteria. The EPA established a list of hazardous substances based on criteria like potential health effects, accidental release likelihood, and human exposure. The list included acutely toxic substances, flammable gases, and volatile flammable liquids. High explosive substances were removed in 1998, and flammable substances used as fuel were excluded in 2000. The current EPA/RMP list can be found in Appendix 2. The EPA list of hazardous substances, found in Appendix 2, identifies chemicals with the greatest potential consequences to the general public. These chemicals are considered among the most hazardous on land and may pose similar hazards if released. This report uses EPA/RMP chemicals as the basis for marine cargo hazard analysis, with most hazardous substances also found on DOT and Coast Guard lists. Notable exceptions include radioactive materials and explosives. Army Corps of Engineers marine commerce statistics for 2003 are discussed. The Corps of Engineers marine commerce statistics for 2003 show that explosives and radioactive materials would make up less than 0.3% of U.S. hazardous marine cargo if added to the EPA/RMP list. Excluding these two classes is unlikely to impact the policy conclusions in this report. EPA/RMP chemicals are broadly classified as acutely toxic or flammable, with variations in toxicity and flammability among specific chemicals like Ammonia. Ammonia is a potentially explosive, acutely toxic liquefied gas used in various industries. It can quickly reach harmful concentrations in the air, causing skin and respiratory irritation, eye corrosion, and fatal lung fluid buildup. Methane, on the other hand, is not inherently toxic but can cause asphyxiation at high vapor concentrations. Cryogenic methane (liquefied natural gas, or LNG) is not toxic but can freeze body parts upon contact. Methane is highly flammable and explosive when mixed with air in confined spaces. Methyloxirane is a toxic liquid used in manufacturing various industrial products, causing irritation to eyes, skin, and respiratory tract. It is also a fire hazard and reacts explosively with chlorine and ammonia. Vapors are highly flammable and react explosively with certain chemicals. An uncontrolled release of chemicals on the EPA/RMP list can have varying effects on the exposed population. The EPA considers all RMP chemicals above threshold quantities to be hazardous to the public, warranting special regulatory treatment. Certain shipments of hazardous chemicals may warrant special regulatory treatment. The EPA/RMP list of hazardous chemicals was developed for land facilities, but the health hazards may differ if released over water. Some chemicals dissolve or sink in water, potentially reducing the hazard in a marine incident. The EPA/RMP list of hazardous chemicals was developed for land facilities, but the health hazards may differ if released over water. Some chemicals dissolve or sink in water, potentially reducing the hazard in a marine incident. Further research is needed to understand the relative marine hazards of specific chemicals. The Army Corps of Engineers maintains statistics of marine commerce in U.S. waters for analysis. According to the Army Corps of Engineers (ACE) statistics, over 48 million tons of EPA/RMP chemicals were transported through U.S. waters in 2003, accounting for 2% of total U.S. waterborne cargo tonnage. In 2003, EPA/RMP hazardous cargo accounted for 2% of total U.S. waterborne tonnage. Hazardous materials on the EPA/RMP list are included due to their chemical properties making them hazardous to human health. The overall volume of hazardous materials must be large enough to pose a potentially catastrophic threat to the general public in the event of a maritime release. In 2003, over 100,000 marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous cargo passed through U.S. waterways, posing a potential terrorist risk due to the large volume of shipments. Figure 1 shows the total number of shipments and average cargo tons per shipment as estimated by the ACE. Cargo vessels may load or unload partial cargoes at multiple locations. In 2003, over 100,000 marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous cargo passed through U.S. waterways. Cargo vessels may load or unload partial cargoes at multiple locations. The EPA regulations specify minimum threshold quantities for risk planning between 500 and 20,000 pounds for the EPA/RMP chemicals. The average shipment volume for hazardous chemicals is shown in Figure 1 on a logarithmic scale. The dashed line represents the 20,000 pound upper threshold for off-site consequence plans. Based on ACE data, the average waterborne shipment volume of hazardous chemicals exceeds the EPA/RMP 20,000 pound threshold, requiring off-site risk management plans. Different categories of chemicals were shipped hundreds to thousands of times in 2003, with no clear distinction between \"low frequency\" and \"high frequency\" hazardous cargoes. Various marine vessels transport hazardous cargo in bulk. Cargo vessels transporting hazardous materials have distinct construction and operating characteristics based on the type and quantity of cargo they carry. These characteristics are crucial for security considerations, affecting the vulnerability of vessels to accidents or attacks. In 2003, over 67% of EPA/RMP hazardous marine cargo was transported in tankers or self-propelled liquid chemical barges, with an additional 29% in non-self-propelled liquid chemical barges. Liquefied gas tankers are oceangoing ships designed to carry various types of liquefied gas cargo such as butane, propane, LNG, butadiene, and ammonia. These vessels are crucial for transporting EPA/RMP hazardous marine cargo. Liquefied gas tankers carry chemicals like ethylene, vinyl chloride, methyl chloride, ammonia, and propylene oxide. The vessels have onboard tanks that are pressurized, refrigerated, and insulated to meet cargo needs. International shipping codes set strict standards for construction and operation, with robust, double-hulled tanks that can withstand high pressures or low temperatures. LNG tankers have cargo tanks above a double bottom and inboard of the outer hull, providing greater structural integrity. They carry only LNG, unlike other liquefied gas tankers that may carry a combination of different cargoes, creating unique multi-chemical hazards. LNG tankers have capacities ranging from 25,000 m3 to 147,000 m3, with plans for new construction of 200,000 m3 capacity ships. These vessels are among the largest cargo ships globally. Chemical parcel tankers are versatile vessels designed to carry a wide range of liquid and chemical cargoes, including hazardous chemicals. They can have 10 to 60 separate cargo tanks and a total cargo capacity ranging from 3,000 to 50,000 tons. Chemical parcel tankers are constructed with features like stainless steel or specialized coatings in their cargo tanks to ensure compatibility with various chemicals. They have double bottoms or hulls to prevent contact between incompatible cargoes and can carry multiple hazardous chemicals simultaneously. Liquid chemical barges are shallow draft vessels designed for transporting chemicals. Liquid chemical barges are shallow draft vessels designed to carry bulk liquid chemicals, primarily in coastal regions and through inland waterways. These barges may contain multiple separate cargo tanks lined with stainless steel or other special coatings, ranging in size from 700 tons to 3,500 tons of total cargo capacity. Larger barges transporting hazardous chemicals are typically double-hulled and self-propelled, while smaller ones may be unpowered and rely on tugboats for movement. Unpowered chemical barges on inland waterways are approximately 52 to 54 feet wide and up to 300 feet long. Inland barges on waterways are typically 52 to 54 feet wide and up to 300 feet long. They travel in groups, with some tows consisting of more than 20 barges. These barges can be refrigerated and have insulated cargo tanks capable of carrying 1,250 to 1,500 tons of chemical products. Pressurized cargo tanks are also available for liquid cargoes. Large quantities of hazardous chemicals may be transported on container ships in various forms such as tankcontainers, drums, and portable tanks. Roll-on/roll-off vessels can also carry these chemicals in tanker trucks or tractor-trailers with internally packaged cargo. The Jolly Rubino was reported to be carrying 3 containers of vinyl. The Jolly Rubino was reported to be carrying hazardous chemicals, including vinyl acetate and other toxic chemicals, when it caught fire off South Africa in 2002. Hazardous chemicals must be shipped in designated cargo areas on various types of vessels, including container ships, general cargo ships, container barges, ferries, and other vessels. The public hazards associated with these chemicals are proportional to the volume present on marine vessels. Comparing the volumes of hazardous chemicals on marine vessels to other modes of transportation is informative. Marine vessels, rail tank cars, and highway tanker trucks are all bulk transportation modes for EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals. A shipment of hazardous cargo may be moved sequentially by all three modes. Rail tank cars can carry 50 to 90 tons, while containerized tank cars on flatbed railcars may carry up to 70 tons per tank. Rail shipments may carry multiple tank cars and hazardous cargoes simultaneously. Highway tanker trucks also transport EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals. Table 2 summarizes the typical range of cargo tank capacity for marine, rail, and highway tankers transporting EPA/RMP chemicals. Multiple tanks are usually found on liquefied gas tankers, chemical parcel tankers, and liquid cargo barges. Marine cargo tank capacity generally exceeds the capacity of a single rail or highway tanker truck. Marine cargo tank capacity generally exceeds the capacity of a single rail or highway tanker truck by one or more orders of magnitude, making many marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous material larger than individual land shipments. Comparing actual volumes shipped across these modes is challenging due to partial cargoes and multiple barges or rail tank cars involved. The EPA maintains a database of on-site chemical storage volumes. The EPA database tracks on-site chemical storage volumes for facilities required to file risk management plans under the Clean Air Act. These filings help estimate the maximum and average quantity of EPA/RMP chemicals held across facilities. Comparisons were made between marine shipping volumes and land shipments. The EPA database tracks on-site chemical storage volumes for facilities required to file risk management plans under the Clean Air Act. Comparisons were made between marine shipping volumes and land shipments for nine EPA/RMP chemicals, representing high, medium, and low volume shipments of toxic and flammable chemicals. The results are summarized in Table 3. The table shows that marine shipments of EPA/RMP chemicals are generally larger than volumes stored at chemical plants, except for chemical #3. Marine shipments either start or end at U.S. ports, with some ports serving as temporary storage hubs. Port facilities in the U.S. serve as transportation hubs for hazardous cargo, either for temporary storage or direct use in industrial processes. Some facilities also produce hazardous cargo. Total marine shipments of EPA/RMP chemicals vary significantly from port to port, with differences in both volume and specific types of chemicals. Security hazards may be related to the volume and specific type of EPA/RMP chemicals being transported. In the United States, there are over 360 commercial ports with around 3,200 cargo and passenger handling facilities. In 2003, EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals were shipped through 113 ports, with the top 30 handling 95% of the hazardous cargo tonnage. These 30 ports are crucial for policy discussions regarding hazardous marine shipments. In 2003, EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals were shipped through 113 ports in the United States, with the top 30 handling 95% of the hazardous cargo tonnage. Additional hazardous cargoes may also be shipped in large volumes through certain ports, regardless of their ranking. An attack on any hazardous cargo vessel, regardless of the port it is in, could have serious consequences. The top 30 hazardous chemical ports in the United States are located in 15 states, with over half in the Gulf of Mexico. These ports handle a significant amount of hazardous cargo tonnage, with varying mixes of principal EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals. Great Lakes ports are not included in the top 30 list. The top 30 hazardous chemical ports in the United States handle LPG and ammonia as the most frequently shipped hazardous cargoes. LPG is a flammable gas shipped under pressure, while ammonia is a toxic gas. The list of ports is based on EPA/RMP hazardous cargo volumes and is one of many factors affecting terrorism risk in U.S. ports. The terrorism risk in U.S. ports is influenced by various factors including hazardous cargo shipments, passenger traffic, proximity to populations, and threat intelligence. The Department of Homeland Security considers these factors in its Port Security Grant Program. The Department of Homeland Security evaluated 129 U.S. ports in FY2005 using a risk-based formula, identifying 66 ports eligible for grants. The Coast Guard is responsible for promoting maritime security, tracking and inspecting ships, and overseeing security in ports. The Coast Guard has a history of special concern for ships and barges carrying hazardous cargo, with safety regulations in place to mitigate damage from accidents or terrorist attacks. Compliance with these regulations could help minimize cargo releases and deter attacks. Since 9/11, the Coast Guard has expanded its maritime security regulations to distinguish between safety measures and security measures. Area maritime security committees assess port vulnerabilities and create plans to address them. The Coast Guard has assessed port vulnerabilities and created plans to address them, focusing on marine targets' susceptibility to terrorist attacks. These plans involve deploying federal, state, and local resources to prevent attacks on vessels and facilities under Coast Guard jurisdiction, as well as other vital port infrastructure. The assessments have been used to enhance security measures and develop new maritime security standards. The Coast Guard plays a key role in developing maritime security standards under the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 and the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code. The ISPS Code requires ships and port facilities worldwide to have approved security plans. The ISPS Code requires ships and port facilities to have approved security plans indicating operational and physical security measures under three threat levels. Every ship and port must designate a security officer, deploy security equipment, monitor access, and ensure security communications. The Coast Guard reviewed and approved security plans for over 9,000 vessels by July 1, 2004. The Coast Guard reviewed and approved security plans for over 9,000 vessels under the provisions of the MTSA and ISPS Code. They also completed on-site inspections of these vessels to ensure implementation. Additionally, the Coast Guard conducted security assessments of the nation's 55 strategic ports and took specific measures to prevent terrorist attacks on hazardous chemicals vessels. They evaluated the vulnerability of marine tankers to various types of attacks. The Coast Guard evaluates the vulnerability of marine tankers to different types of attacks and conducts special assessments on inland barges carrying dangerous cargoes. They require vessels carrying hazardous chemicals to report information four days before arrival or departure to determine security risks and take necessary actions for secure operations. The Coast Guard may board vessels to ensure secure transit in U.S. waters, with armed sea-marshals on board. Ships carrying hazardous cargo may be escorted by Coast Guard patrol boats in a moving security zone while transiting a harbor. Vessels carrying hazardous cargo may also be required to have roving patrols on deck and at the terminal while moored. Non-commercial traffic may be restricted in high threat levels or sensitive harbor areas. The Coast Guard enforces security measures in U.S. waters, including escorting ships carrying hazardous cargo in moving security zones. Non-commercial traffic may be banned in high threat levels or sensitive harbor areas. Vessels calling at U.S. ports must have AIS transponders for tracking. The Coast Guard enforces security measures in U.S. waters, including escorting ships carrying hazardous cargo in moving security zones. Vessels calling at U.S. ports must have AIS transponders for tracking. The Coast Guard has installed AIS receivers at port areas and plans to install them at all U.S. ports. They are developing joint harbor operations centers (JHOCs) to track and monitor vessel traffic using various equipment and personnel. The Coast Guard is working with other federal security agencies and local law enforcement to coordinate responses to threats. They have a program called \"Waterways Watch\" to involve the public in identifying and reporting suspicious activity. They are also collaborating with the Transportation Security Administration to enhance security for merchant mariners and landside workers. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) maintains hazardous material emergency response capabilities, including the CAMEO program, for first responders and emergency planners. The program includes a database with response recommendations for over 6,000 chemicals. NOAA's CAMEO program includes a database with response recommendations for over 6,000 chemicals and models predicting chemical gas movement. NOAA has linked its air dispersion models to support emergency planners and first responders. NOAA partnered with the Coast Guard and Office of Naval Intelligence in conducting risk assessments on hazardous chemicals stored or shipped through U.S. ports. NOAA and DHS are coordinating federal chemicals emergency response efforts. The DHS, along with industry groups and the Coast Guard's Chemical Transportation Advisory Committee, coordinate federal chemicals emergency response and promote security of hazardous marine cargo. CTAC formed a Subcommittee on Hazardous Cargo Transportation Security to assess vulnerability and promote industry security awareness. AWO created a model vessel security plan to prevent terrorist attacks on the inland waterway system. The Chemical Distribution Institute (CDI) inspects and issues audit reports on chemical and LPG tankers, tank storage terminals, and container ships carrying hazardous cargo. The American Chemistry Council has also issued transportation security guidelines for the chemical industry, reflecting the priority of securing hazardous chemicals against terrorist attacks in U.S. homeland security policy. Maritime security of chemical cargo on U.S. waterways and ports is a priority, with policy issues such as risk uncertainty, resource availability, and security effectiveness needing Congressional attention. Terrorism risk related to hazardous marine cargo involves uncertainties in threat, vulnerability, and consequence factors. Uncertainties exist regarding the threat of terrorists targeting hazardous marine cargo in U.S. waters since 9/11. Some experts believe public concern is overstated and should not hinder maritime trade, while others argue that terrorists have the desire and capability to attack such shipping. The basis of these conclusions is questioned due to the uncertainty of threat intelligence. The uncertainty of threat intelligence and the shifting goals of potential attackers make estimating the probability of a terrorist attack difficult. Vulnerability and consequence analysis of marine chemical hazards also face uncertainties. The Coast Guard has approved security assessments for vessels under the MTSA and ISPS codes, while NOAA partners with them for hazardous chemical risk assessments at U.S. ports. Some analysts suggest that the vulnerabilities and consequences of a terrorist attack on hazardous marine cargo vessels are not well understood. Public controversy over terrorist risks to LNG shipping stems from conflicting studies by government and private sector groups. The security sensitivity of these assessments complicates evaluation efforts due to limited public information on vessel vulnerabilities to terrorism. The vulnerabilities of marine vessels to terrorist attacks with weapons or explosives are a concern, as shown by past incidents like the Cole and Limburg attacks. While there is research on accidental release of hazardous chemicals, intentional release has received less attention. Vessel vulnerability assessments and security plans are important for maritime security, but may be limited for hazardous chemicals carriers if operators do not fully understand vulnerability and consequences, especially for attacks affecting the general public. Federal officials face challenges in determining the risk of terror attacks on hazardous marine cargoes, which could impact the general public. Reducing risk uncertainty would help prioritize maritime security activities. The Coast Guard could enhance port security by receiving timely intelligence from federal agencies. Security experts can analyze vessel vulnerabilities and consequences of chemical attacks using standard models and methodologies. The use of standard models and methodologies, such as those maintained by NOAA and EPA, is important for analyzing hazardous marine cargo security. A federal role may be necessary to ensure consistency across chemicals, vessel types, and locations. Concerns include the costs associated with security and potential diversion of resources from other activities. Coast Guard officials note that maritime security expenditures are not all incremental. Coast Guard officials acknowledge that resources dedicated to securing marine shipments of hazardous cargo could be used for other missions like boating safety, search and rescue, and drug interdiction. A Government Accountability Office study found that security activities increased significantly after 9/11. President Bush requested $8.1 billion for the Coast Guard in FY2006, with $2.2 billion allocated for security. In FY2006, the President requested $8.1 billion for the Coast Guard, with $2.2 billion allocated for port, waterway, and coastal security. An additional $11 million was sought for general maritime security funding, including resources for new response boats and crew. The budget also includes $5.7 million for implementation purposes. The budget includes funding for vessel monitoring systems and increased surveillance by aircraft to enhance maritime security. State and local agencies are seeking additional funding to cover the costs of securing hazardous marine cargo, particularly LNG tankers, which could cost up to $80,000 per shipment. This could strain resources for state and local police and emergency services. Federal officials are aware of these concerns. Federal officials recommend new LNG terminal operators pay for additional maritime security and safety. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 requires cost-sharing for LNG tanker security, but ambiguity in accounting and uncertain federal funding sources raise concerns. Some LNG companies resist paying more for public security, arguing that their taxes should cover the costs. Some LNG companies resist paying more for public security, arguing that their taxes should cover the costs. Others are willing to pay for \"excess\" security only if it exceeds the level of security service ordinarily commensurate with corporate tax payments. The costs to public agencies to secure hazardous marine cargo from terrorist attack appear significant and may warrant new security technology and threat assessments to lower costs in the future. The effectiveness of security measures to protect hazardous marine cargo from terrorist attacks is questioned, with concerns about the Coast Guard's deployment of resources and evaluation of security activities. The need for a review of cost-sharing mechanisms and new security technology to lower costs in the future is highlighted. While there is increased awareness of maritime security needs and improved ability to identify threats, assessing progress in securing the nation remains challenging. Seaport security actions lack defined performance measures, raising concerns about the Coast Guard's effectiveness in addressing terrorism risks related to hazardous cargo. The Coast Guard's maritime security plan identifies high-risk cargos and conducts operations to address those risks. However, there are concerns about whether the level of security for hazardous chemical vessels reflects their relative risk, given the uncertainties associated with terrorism risks and competing demands for resources. Port captains have discretion in deploying security resources, leading to questions about the adequacy of security measures. In the deployment of security resources within ports, there are concerns about varying levels of protection for chemical shipments posing terrorism hazards. Congress may assess the effectiveness of the Coast Guard's hazardous marine cargo activities in the context of maritime security responsibilities. Emergency response to marine chemical attacks is also a significant concern among security analysts. Emergency response to marine chemical attacks is a concern among security analysts, with potential high casualties and overwhelming emergency agencies and medical facilities. Emergency response to marine chemical attacks poses challenges for emergency teams and medical treatment due to the hazardous cargo terrorism risk. Salvage of damaged vessels may also be difficult, requiring specialized expertise and resources. It is advisable for authorities near affected waterways to develop specific measures to handle chemical cargo releases, with potential support from federal or private sectors for communities lacking sufficient capabilities. The DOT and DHS offer funding for emergency response plans for marine chemicals. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 provides a legislative model for coastal LNG terminals and tankers. Marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals are comparable in volume to those stored at large chemical plants. Marine vessels carrying EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals pass near populated areas and major U.S. ports, making them potential terrorist targets. Government and industry have taken steps to enhance maritime security for these shipments under the MTSA. The MTSA grants the Coast Guard authority over hazardous marine shipping security. Congress may question terrorism risk uncertainty and evaluate federal and private sector efforts. Concerns may arise about resource sufficiency for securing hazardous chemical cargo and the effectiveness of current security measures. Bulk quantities of hazardous chemicals are found in marine vessels, rail and highway tankers, and chemical facilities on land, raising concerns about the effectiveness of current security measures against terrorist attacks. Congress may also evaluate the emergency response capabilities of coastal communities exposed to chemical shipping hazards. The transportation of hazardous chemicals through marine vessels, rail and highway tankers, and chemical facilities on land poses a security challenge due to different regulations and authorities. Limited information on vulnerability and consequences, especially in marine transportation, hinders the comparison of terrorism risks across sectors for the same chemical hazard. This lack of comprehensive perspective complicates the identification of hazardous chemical risks for security analysts. Security analysts may struggle to identify which chemical assets to protect and how to allocate limited resources effectively. Diverting marine resources to enhance security could reduce terror risk but increase overall risk if safety programs are compromised. Congress may face challenges in aligning security priorities and activities to achieve common goals. Source: 49 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 173.2a. Army Corps of Engineers (ACE) collects marine commerce statistics. The Army Corps of Engineers (ACE) collects detailed marine commerce statistics through its Waterborne Commerce Statistics Center (WCSC) to plan and manage capital projects. Separate domestic and foreign commerce databases record vessel trips, tonnages, and commodities for U.S. ports and waterways. Vessel types include dry cargo ships, tankers, barges, fishing vessels, and towboats. The ACE collects marine commerce statistics for various vessel types including dry cargo ships, tankers, barges, fishing vessels, and towboats. Vessel operators must report domestic waterborne commercial movements to the ACE. The ACE databases may be used for chemical-specific analysis with limitations and caveats. The ACE provided estimates of EPA/RMP cargo statistics based on available data, with caveats on accuracy. Cargo is classified using internal WCSC and UN codes, which may not always correspond uniquely to hazardous chemicals in the EPA/RMP list. The CRS corrected inconsistencies in hazardous chemical classification by comparing WCSC and UN codes, and consulting with experts. For example, LNG and LPG were separated from the same code (34000) using trade data. The report discusses how shipment estimates for EPA/RMP chemicals may include other chemicals not on the list. Cargo vessels may load or unload partial cargoes at multiple locations during a single shipment. The ACE data report the movement of cargo but cannot provide the total tonnage carried aboard a vessel. Data quality is a challenge due to the large size of the ACE waterborne commerce databases. The ACE waterborne commerce databases contain millions of records with potential errors in data classification, entry, and processing. CRS identified inconsistencies in ACE estimates, which were corrected. However, there may be additional data quality-related errors that have gone unnoticed. The databases contain detailed commercial information about private companies. The waterborne commerce databases contain commercial information about private companies. Summary estimates of chemicals shipping data are included, but specific details about vessels or operating companies are not disclosed. ACE data on individual shipments, vessels, or operators is considered privileged information and not for public release. CRS products are not intended for general public distribution."
