The \"MANIFEST for Human Spaceflight Act of 2016\" reaffirms Congress's goal for NASA to expand human presence beyond low-Earth orbit with international partners, as outlined in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010. The National Academy of Sciences reviewed human spaceflight goals and published findings in a 2014 report titled \"Pathways to Exploration: Rationales and Approaches for a U.S. Program of Human Space Exploration.\" The Committee on Human Spaceflight included leaders from various communities and concluded on practical and aspirational aspects. Spaceflight concluded that various rationales make a strong case for human space exploration, including economic benefits, national security, prestige, inspiring citizens, scientific discovery, human survival, and shared destiny. The Committee on Human Spaceflight affirmed Mars as the long-term goal and recommended NASA define sustainable steps for mission planning. NASA is working towards placing humans on Mars by defining sustainable steps and conducting mission planning and technology development as needed. NASA is focused on human exploration strategy, aiming to place humans on Mars through sustainable steps, mission planning, and technology development. NASA's focus is on human exploration strategy, aiming to achieve human exploration of Mars, including establishing a capability to extend human presence to the surface of Mars. The Administrator of NASA must submit reports outlining a strategy to achieve human exploration of Mars through a series of missions utilizing cis-lunar space and the Space Launch System. The Administrator of NASA must develop a strategy for human exploration of Mars using cis-lunar space, including missions to various destinations like the lunar surface, asteroids, Mars, and moons of Mars for economic, scientific, and technological advancements. The strategy for human exploration of Mars includes collaboration opportunities with international partners, private industry, and other Federal agencies. The International Space Station offers specific opportunities for scientific research and technological developments to support human presence in cis-lunar space and beyond. The strategy for human exploration of Mars includes collaboration opportunities with international partners, private industry, and other Federal agencies. This involves scientific research and technological developments to support human presence in cis-lunar space and beyond, including exploration mission architectures for the Orion crew capsule and the Space Launch System. Factors like cost effectiveness, schedule resiliency, safety, sustainability, and international collaboration opportunities are considered in comparing different approaches. The curr_chunk discusses the potential of architectures and approaches to create new markets, opportunities for private industry, scientific discovery, technological excellence, competitiveness, leadership, and national security considerations. It also emphasizes the importance of flexibility in adapting to evolving needs. The curr_chunk focuses on measures for ensuring crew health and safety during missions, including setting standards for radiation exposure limits, addressing urgent medical conditions, and other safety issues. The curr_chunk outlines crew training needs, capabilities, and mission prioritization for space missions. The curr_chunk provides details on the Authorization Act of 2010, including recommendations incorporation and technical information for stakeholder identification. An independent review by the National Academy of Sciences is also mandated. The National Academy of Sciences will review and comment on each interim report, identifying agreed-upon matters, concerns, and making further recommendations related to the strategy described in the Authorization Act of 2010. The National Academy of Sciences will review and comment on each interim report in a timely manner to comply with requirements and facilitate the incorporation of their comments. The Administrator must submit interim reports to the National Academy of Sciences within 90 days of the Act's enactment and every five years thereafter for independent review. Final reports are due within one year. The Administrator must submit final reports to Congress on the strategy within one year of the Act's enactment and every five years thereafter, incorporating the National Academy of Sciences' response to the most recent interim report."
