    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Engineering Biology Research and Development Act of 2015\". The Congress finds that cellular and molecular processes can be utilized to create new products, improve societal well-being, and strengthen national security. Engineering biology requires a diverse set of skills and long-term research for breakthroughs, necessitating government investment. The Federal Government plays a crucial role in advancing engineering biology by investing in tools and technologies to support development. Without necessary resources and a national strategy, the United States risks falling behind other countries in this emerging field. A National Engineering Biology Initiative is essential to establish new research directions, improve coordination, drive technology transfer, and maximize returns on Federal investment. The curr_chunk is a section header \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" which indicates that definitions will be provided in the following text. In this Act, definitions are provided for terms such as \"Advisory Committee,\" \"biomanufacturing,\" and \"engineering biology\" to clarify their meanings within the context of the legislation. The term \"Interagency Committee\" refers to the committee designated under section 4(e), and the term \"Program\" refers to the National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program established under section 4. The National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program is established under section 4. The President will implement a National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program to advance societal well-being, national security, and economic productivity through research at the intersection of biological, physical, and information sciences, supporting social science research, and expanding the number of researchers, educators, and students with engineering biology training. The National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program aims to advance societal well-being, national security, and economic productivity by supporting research at the intersection of biological, physical, and information sciences. This includes accelerating translation and commercialization of engineering biology research, improving interagency coordination, and providing sustained support through grants and interdisciplinary projects. The National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program supports interdisciplinary research projects, education of students in biological, physical, and information sciences, and activities to track economic benefits. The National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program aims to accelerate the translation and commercialization of new products, processes, and technologies through various activities such as identifying research opportunities, fostering public-private partnerships, providing entrepreneurship education, and supporting proof of concept activities. The National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program supports proof of concept activities and the formation of startup companies. It also focuses on expanding participation by reaching out to undergraduate and minority-serving institutions and promoting research collaborations. Additionally, the program addresses ethical, legal, environmental, and societal issues. The National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program supports activities addressing ethical, legal, environmental, and societal issues related to engineering biology, including integrating research on these topics with research and development in engineering biology. The National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program aims to disseminate research results and integrate public input through mechanisms like citizen panels and consensus conferences. The President will designate an Interagency Committee to oversee the Program. The President will designate an interagency committee on engineering biology, including representatives from various agencies to oversee the planning, management, and coordination of the National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program. The Interagency Committee will oversee the coordination of Federal engineering biology research and development activities, establish goals and priorities for the Program, and develop a strategic plan to guide its activities every 5 years. The Interagency Committee will oversee the coordination of Federal engineering biology research and development activities, establish goals and priorities for the Program, and develop a strategic plan to guide its activities every 5 years. The Program's support includes long-term funding for interdisciplinary engineering biology research, education, public outreach, research on societal issues, and moving results into practical applications. The Program aims to transfer engineering biology research from the laboratory to practical applications for societal benefit and US competitiveness. It includes proposing an interagency budget, utilizing Federal programs like SBIR and STTR, and ensuring funding balance to meet Program goals. The Interagency Committee responsible for the Program will consider recommendations from the Advisory Committee, workshop results, existing reports, and input from various groups. They will also prepare an annual report for submission to specific congressional committees within 90 days of the President's budget request. The Interagency Committee overseeing the Program will submit an annual report to congressional committees within 90 days of the President's budget request. The report will include the Program budget for the fiscal year, spending breakdown for each agency, assessment of federal agencies' plan implementation, and details on Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer awards. SEC. 5. ADVISORY COMMITTEE. The President shall designate an advisory committee on engineering biology research and development with at least 12 members from various sectors to assess the progress, need for revisions, balance of activities and funding, and the impact of Program priorities on maintaining US leadership in engineering biology. The Advisory Committee on engineering biology research and development assesses the Program's leadership, management, coordination, and ethical considerations. Reports are submitted every 3 years to the President and relevant congressional committees. The Advisory Committee evaluates the Program and provides recommendations for improvement. The Federal Advisory Committee Act does not apply to this Committee. SEC. 6. EXTERNAL REVIEW OF ETHICAL, LEGAL, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND SOCIETAL ISSUES. The Director of the National Science Foundation will convene a workshop with the National Academies to review ethical, legal, environmental, and societal issues related to engineering biology research. The workshop aims to assess current research, identify gaps, and provide recommendations within 12 months of the Act's enactment. A report to Congress is due within 2 years. The Director of the National Science Foundation will transmit a summary report to Congress within 2 years of the Act's enactment, containing the findings of a workshop on ethical, legal, environmental, and societal issues related to engineering biology research. SEC. 7. AGENCY ACTIVITIES. The National Science Foundation supports basic research at the intersection of biological, physical, and information sciences, research on environmental and social effects of engineering biology, provides instrumentation support, and awards grants for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. The Department of Commerce, as part of the Program, will establish a bioscience research program to advance standard reference materials and measurements for engineering biology. They will also provide access to user facilities with advanced equipment and resources for researchers. The Department of Energy, under the Program, will conduct research and development in engineering biology disciplines to support new products and systems. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, as part of the Program, will conduct and support research in engineering biology disciplines such as synthetic biology, biofuel development, biobased materials, and environmental remediation. They will also provide access to advanced facilities for research and testing by industry, higher education institutions, nonprofits, and government agencies. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration will conduct and support research in engineering biology fields, including synthetic biology, and award grants for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to perform research in an industry setting. The Environmental Protection Agency will support research on how engineering biology products, processes, and systems will impact the environment as part of the Program."
