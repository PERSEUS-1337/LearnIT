    "content": "The \"Biodiesel Renewable Fuels Act\" is cited as the short title. An amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 introduces a new section for a credit for biodiesel used as fuel. The biodiesel fuels credit under section 38 is determined as the biodiesel mixture credit, which is calculated based on the biodiesel mixture rate and the number of gallons of qualified biodiesel mixture blended by the taxpayer for the taxable year. The biodiesel fuels credit is determined based on the biodiesel mixture rate for different blends, such as B-1, B-2, and B-20, with specific cents per gallon rates. The biodiesel fuels credit is determined based on the biodiesel mixture rate for different blends, such as B-1, B-2, and B-20, with specific percentages of biodiesel in each blend. The term 'applicable amount' for a B-1 blend is calculated as 1.5 cents multiplied by the percentage of biodiesel in the blend divided by 1 percent. A 'qualified biodiesel mixture' is a blend of diesel and biodiesel sold by the taxpayer for use as fuel. The qualified biodiesel mixture must be sold or used as fuel by the taxpayer in their trade or business for it to be considered for tax purposes. The tax credit for biodiesel mixtures is not eligible for casual off-farm production. The credit amount may be reduced to account for any benefit from other tax exemptions. Definitions and special rules apply for this tax credit. The tax credit for biodiesel mixtures is subject to specific definitions and rules, including the definition of biodiesel as monoalkyl esters of long chain fatty acids derived from various vegetable oils for use in diesel engines. Registration requirements must be met for biodiesel to qualify for the credit. The tax credit for biodiesel mixtures is contingent on meeting registration requirements set by the EPA under the Clean Air Act. If biodiesel is used in the production of a qualified biodiesel mixture and then separated, the tax may be imposed. If biodiesel is separated from the mixture or used in a way other than as fuel, a tax is imposed based on the biodiesel mixture rate and the number of gallons. Applicable laws and penalties apply. Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, rules similar to those of section 52 shall apply for pass-thru in the case of estates and trusts. A taxpayer may elect to not have the biodiesel fuels credit apply for any taxable year. An election can be made or revoked within a 3-year period from the last date for filing the return. The manner of making the election is determined by the Secretary's regulations. The biodiesel fuels credit can be excluded for a taxable year upon taxpayer's election. The biodiesel fuels credit is amended and a new provision is added under section 38(b). Section 39(d) is also amended to disallow carryback of the biodiesel fuels credit before January 1, 2003. The biodiesel fuels credit is amended under section 196(c) and a new provision is added under section 40A for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2003. The amendments made by section 40A apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2001. The new subsection (f) under Section 4081 of the manufacturers tax on petroleum products relates to biodiesel mixtures. It allows for a reduced tax rate for qualified biodiesel mixtures. The new subsection (f) under Section 4081 of the manufacturers tax on petroleum products allows for a reduced tax rate for qualified biodiesel mixtures produced from diesel fuel. The new subsection (f) under Section 4081 allows for a reduced tax rate for qualified biodiesel mixtures produced from diesel fuel. Section 4041 is amended to include regulations for biodiesel mixtures. The new subsection (f) under Section 4081 allows for reduced tax rates for qualified biodiesel mixtures. Section 6427 is amended to include regulations for biodiesel mixtures. The amendments allow for reduced tax rates on diesel fuel used in producing qualified biodiesel mixtures. Effective January 1, 2002, the Secretary will pay an amount equal to the applicable biodiesel mixture rate for such fuel. The Highway Trust Fund will be protected from reductions in receipts due to amendments made by the Act, with transfers from the Commodity Credit Corporation based on estimates by the Secretary of the Treasury. Adjustments will be made for any errors in the estimates."
