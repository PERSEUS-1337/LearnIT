    "content": "The Gun Show Loophole Closing Act of 2009 may be cited as the \"Gun Show Background Check\" act. The Congress finds that approximately 5,200 traditional gun shows are held annually in the US, attracting thousands of attendees and firearms sellers. These shows provide a convenient location for criminals to obtain firearms without background checks or records for tracing. The term 'gun show' is defined as an event where 50 or more firearms are offered for sale, exchange, or transfer, with exceptions for sales from personal collections at private residences. The definition of a 'gun show' excludes events where fewer than 100 firearms are offered for sale, exchange, or transfer, organized by hunting-focused non-profit organizations exclusively for their members and their families. The term 'gun show vendor' refers to a person who is not licensed under section 923 and exhibits, sells, or exchanges firearms at a gun show. A new regulation is proposed for firearms transfers at gun shows in Chapter 44 of the title. The proposed regulation in Chapter 44 of the title involves the registration of gun show operators, specifying age requirements and prohibiting certain individuals from operating gun shows if they are prohibited from transporting firearms. The proposed regulation in Chapter 44 of the title requires gun show operators to register with the Attorney General, provide fingerprints and a photograph, and certify compliance with specific requirements. Gun show operators must register with the Attorney General, provide required information, and pay a registration fee. It is unlawful to operate a gun show without meeting these requirements. Gun show operators must notify the Attorney General of the gun show details and verify the identity of vendors before the show begins. Gun show vendors must sign a ledger with identifying information and a notice outlining their obligations under this chapter. Attendees must be informed of the requirements of this chapter by the gun show operator. The Attorney General shall prescribe regulations for recordkeeping at gun shows to demonstrate compliance. Unlicensed persons are prohibited from transferring firearms at a gun show without a background check. The regulations require licensed dealers at gun shows to keep records of firearm transactions, including make, model, and serial number. Prospective transferors and transferees must be notified of the national instant background check. The national instant criminal background check system provides a unique identification number to prospective firearm transferees to ensure compliance with federal and state laws. Licensees must keep records of firearm transfers and provide notification to the parties involved within 10 days. Licensees must submit a report to the Attorney General within 10 days of a firearm transfer, detailing the make, model, and serial number of the firearm. They must also retain a record of the transfer. Licensees must submit a report to the Attorney General within 10 days of a firearm transfer, detailing the make, model, and serial number of the firearm. They must also retain a record of the transfer, including the same information as required for transfers from their inventory, as part of their permanent business records. The Attorney General cannot impose recordkeeping requirements on gun show vendors under this section. Penalties for knowingly violating subsection (a) or (d) of section 932 include fines, imprisonment up to 5 years, or both. Penalties for violating subsections (b) or (c) of section 932 include fines, imprisonment up to 2 years, or both for first-time offenders, and fines, imprisonment up to 5 years, or both for repeat offenders. The Attorney General may impose additional penalties on those knowingly violating any provision of section 932. The Attorney General may suspend or revoke the registration of a person under section 932(a) and impose a civil fine of up to $10,000 for violations. A clerical amendment is made to the table of contents for chapter 44 of the title. The Attorney General has the authority to inspect gun show operators' records and inventory during business hours for compliance with firearm transfer regulations. The Attorney General can inspect gun show operators and licensees for compliance without needing reasonable cause or a warrant. Increased penalties for serious recordkeeping violations by licensees are also proposed. Licensees who knowingly make false statements or violate certain sections shall face fines, imprisonment, or both. Licensees who knowingly make false statements or violate certain sections face increased penalties, including fines and imprisonment for up to 10 years under section 922(t) of the title. The Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives may hire additional personnel for inspecting gun shows. The Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives must report to Congress biennially on firearm sales at gun shows, implementation of background checks, resource needs, and recommendations for preventing sales without checks. The Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives must report to Congress biennially on firearm sales at gun shows, implementation of background checks, resource needs, and recommendations for preventing sales without checks. Effective Date: This section and the amendments made by this section shall take effect 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act."
