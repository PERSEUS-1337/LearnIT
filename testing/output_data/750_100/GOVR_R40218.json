    "content": "Since the mid-1980s, Congress has passed legislation to support older youth in foster care through the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP), providing services like housing. States have developed independent living programs with funding from CFCIP and other sources to help youth attain self-sufficiency. Federal law also directs child welfare agencies to develop policies for older youth transitioning from care. Research has shown that compared to their peers, former foster youth face challenges in transitioning to adulthood, such as lower rates of higher education, poorer health, homelessness, and reliance on public supports. Despite services like written case plans, these youth struggle more in their early adult years. Research, policy makers, and child welfare advocates have brought attention to challenges faced by youth transitioning from care. Congress is focusing on ensuring youth have connections to caring adults and support after turning 18 to ease the transition to adulthood. Federal policy makers recognize that most youth are not ready to live independently at 18 and are interested in providing a safety net for state wards. The 110th Congress held hearings on child welfare reforms. The 110th Congress conducted hearings on child welfare reforms, leading to the passage of the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008. Subsequently, the 113th Congress passed the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) was signed into law by President Obama on September 30, 2014. It aims to protect older youth in care, promote normalcy for children in foster care, and requires child welfare agencies to respond to victims of sex trafficking. Implementation challenges of this law, along with the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008, are key issues affecting older youth transitioning from foster care into adulthood. The implementation challenges of P.L. 110-351 involve states extending foster care to older youth, with concerns about cost hindering some states from providing continued support after age 18. States are required to assist youth in developing a transition plan within 90 days of exiting care to identify available supports and services. States can approach transition planning for older foster youth before the 90-day requirement, involving adults for support. Concerns persist about challenges faced by emancipated youth in establishing connections, securing resources, and staying connected to work and school. Limited information is available on youth transitioning from foster care. Limited information is available on youth transitioning from foster care, but a new national database may provide insight into their outcomes in education, employment, and contact with social services and the criminal justice system. Youth in foster care are also vulnerable to child sex trafficking, and child welfare agencies are required to have policies in place to serve these youth. Congress may need to monitor states' implementation of these requirements and the number of reported victims. The report discusses federal child welfare policies for transitioning youth, including the implementation of P.L. 110-351 and ongoing issues. It is a companion to another report on older foster youth and federal policy. The overall number of children in foster care has been declining in the past decade. The number of children in foster care has been decreasing over the past decade. In FY2002, there were approximately 523,000 children in foster care, compared to 397,122 in FY2012. The percentage of older children in care increased but then slightly declined. Children aged 13-17 made up 29% of the caseload in FY2002, 35% in FY2010, and 34% in FY2012. The number of older youth aging out of foster care also increased over the years. The number of youth aging out of foster care increased over the years, reaching a recent low of 23,396 (10%) in FY2012. Research shows that youth in foster care tend to have more negative outcomes in adulthood compared to their peers. The Midwest Evaluation study is tracking outcomes of former foster youth in Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin. The Midwest Evaluation study tracks outcomes of former foster youth in Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin. Surveyed youth entered care before age 16 and responded to questions in five data collection waves. Results at age 26 showed similarities in outcomes between former foster youth and their peers in the general population. Former foster youth at age 26 had more negative educational and employment outcomes compared to youth in general. They were less likely to have attained a four-year college degree (2.5% versus 23.5%). Barriers to education for youth in the Midwest Evaluation included financial constraints, employment, childcare responsibilities, and transportation issues. Former foster youth were almost as likely to have held a job as youth in general (93.6% versus). Former foster youth at age 26 had lower employment rates and income compared to their peers. The state child welfare agency is responsible for the care and placement of children removed from their homes due to various reasons. They aim to reunite children with their parents or find them a permanent home using federal and state funds. The primary federal funding source for foster care is Title IV-E, which requires states to promote safety, permanency, and well-being for children in foster care through written case plans and regular reviews. The case review for children in foster care must be conducted regularly, at least every 6 months by a judge or panel, and every 12 months by a judge considering the child's permanency plan. Older youth in care, aged 14 and above, must have a written case plan that includes programs and services to help them transition to adulthood successfully. The state child welfare agency must include in a child's case plan a document listing rights related to education, health, visitation, and court participation for children in foster care at age 14 or older. The plan must also address provision of identification documents, safety, and avoidance of exploitation. Children aged 14 and above in foster care must be consulted and acknowledge receipt of the list of rights. Children in foster care aged 14 and older must be consulted in the development and revisions of their case plan and permanency plan. They can choose up to two members for the planning teams, with one being their advisor and advocate for the \"reasonable and prudent parenting standard.\" States are required to assist youth in foster care with these processes. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program helps older youth in foster care transition to independence by addressing housing and other needs. States must find adoptive parents or legal guardians for children who cannot reunite with their parents. Some youth age out of foster care without finding a permanent home. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program prepares older youth in foster care for independence as they reach the state's legal age of majority. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act (P.L. 110-351) made significant changes to federal child welfare statutes, focusing on older youth in foster care and those transitioning out of care. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act focuses on older youth in foster care, allowing states to extend foster care to youth aged 18 and older. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act provides protections for older youth in care and promotes \"normalcy\" among children in foster care. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act focuses on older youth in foster care, allowing states to extend foster care to youth aged 18 and older. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act provides protections for older youth in care, promotes \"normalcy\" among children in foster care, and requires child welfare agencies to respond to sex trafficking of children. Funding for room and board costs for eligible children in out-of-home foster care can be partially reimbursed under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act. Funding for Title IV-E foster care program is provided from the general treasury on an open-ended entitlement basis to support eligible children in out-of-home foster care. Eligibility criteria include being in state care, citizenship, income/assets tests, age, and family structure. The federal government reimburses states for eligible expenditures made on behalf of these children. The state or tribal child welfare agency must provide a \"foster care maintenance payment\" on behalf of every Title IV-E eligible child in foster care, ensuring their care and safety in a licensed setting. A Title IV-E maintenance payment covers the cost of food, clothing, shelter, supervision, school supplies, personal incidentals, insurance, visitation travel, and school travel for eligible children in foster care or child care institutions. Federal reimbursement is only available for licensed placements, except for young people in extended care who may be in independent living. States and tribes receiving federal child welfare funds must promote safety, permanency, and well-being for all youth in care, regardless of eligibility for Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments. Eligibility for these payments extends until age 18 or 19 if still in school, with the option to provide payments until age 21 starting in FY2011. States can seek reimbursement for youth aged 18. States and tribes can seek reimbursement for youth aged 18 or older who are Title IV-E eligible and meet certain criteria, including completing high school, pursuing post-secondary education, participating in employment-related activities, or having a medical condition that prevents participation. Payments can be provided until age 21. The law allows states to seek federal foster care reimbursement for eligible youth living in licensed foster homes or child care institutions. A child care institution is defined as a facility for up to 25 children, excluding detention facilities or training schools. The law does not specify programs to remove employment barriers or define medical conditions that could prevent youth from working or attending school. The law allows states to seek federal foster care reimbursement for eligible youth living in licensed foster homes or child care institutions, excluding detention facilities or training schools. States may also seek reimbursement for youth ages 18 or older in foster care placed in a supervised independent living setting. HHS is directed to establish regulations for qualifying settings, and in July 2010, issued program instructions on certain provisions of the law. HHS encourages states to extend federal foster care assistance to eligible youth until age 21. States and tribes must establish criteria to determine eligibility for federal foster care assistance until age 21, including employment or education conditions and medical incapacity verification. This information is required in their Title IV-E plan for funding approval. States and tribes must establish criteria for federal foster care assistance until age 21, including education or employment conditions. Youth in extended care can pursue activities like finishing high school, enrolling in college or vocational school, and working part-time. States and tribes must verify that the youth continues to meet the conditions of remaining in care. HHS advises states and tribes to establish requirements for extended foster care, such as providing assistance to youth enrolled in post-secondary education. States and tribes should consider offering extended assistance to youth aged 18 and older to ensure ample support. Program instructions address criteria for Title IV-E foster care eligibility for young people reaching the state age of majority. The AFDC Program Criteria apply to young people in foster care who reach the age of majority and seek to continue or reenter care before age 21. Eligibility is based on the youth's income, assets, and living arrangements at the time of removal from their parents' home. States are not required to reassess eligibility for these youth. The AFDC Program Criteria apply to young people in foster care who reach the age of majority and seek to continue or reenter care before age 21. Eligibility is based on the youth's income, assets, and living arrangements at the time of removal from their parents' home. Youth in extended care must have entered care via a court order or voluntary placement agreement, regardless of the parents or guardians in the home they were removed from. Removal criteria for youth who are 18 or older are also specified in the program instructions. The instructions address criteria for youth in foster care seeking to continue or reenter care before age 21, including eligibility based on income, assets, and living arrangements. Youth must enter care via court order or voluntary placement agreement. The provision allows for voluntary placement agreements if in the child's best interest, subject to Title IV-E requirements. Placement and care rules for older youth are also addressed. The instructions address criteria for youth in foster care seeking to continue or reenter care before age 21, including eligibility based on income, assets, and living arrangements. Youth can meet placement and care rules with written authorization before age 18 or through a voluntary placement agreement or court order after turning 18. Placement settings include supervised independent living or licensed foster family homes. HHS does not currently have regulations for independent living settings. The instructions provide guidance on supervised independent living settings for youth in foster care, allowing states and tribes flexibility in developing various options. Eligible settings include host homes, college dormitories, shared housing, and supervised apartments. Child welfare agencies must ensure youth in these settings have opportunities to connect with caring adults. The program instructions for Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments in independent living settings emphasize the importance of applying case planning and review requirements to youth in extended care. The program instructions for Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments in independent living settings emphasize the importance of case planning and review requirements for youth under age 18 and older. The case plan should be developed jointly with the youth, include benchmarks for achieving independence, and involve periodic reviews every six months to ensure the youth's safety in placement. States and tribes are required to make reasonable efforts to finalize a permanency plan every 12 months for older youth, with the goal of emancipation. The guidance emphasizes the importance of case planning and review for youth in independent living settings. The court can determine efforts to finalize a permanency plan without a hearing. States and tribes extending care to ineligible youth are not required to fulfill IV-E requirements. The guidance emphasizes the importance of case planning and review for youth in independent living settings, including data collection and reporting requirements. Nearly half of jurisdictions have extended the maximum age of foster care for IV-E eligible youth, allowing them to receive Medicaid benefits. Title IV-E state plans have been approved by HHS to extend foster care until age 21 in 18 states and the District of Columbia, with two other states under review for plan amendments. Indiana and Nebraska currently extend care until ages 20 and 19, respectively. Nebraska is in the process of extending care to age 21. In 2013, legislation was enacted to extend foster care to age 21, with HHS reviewing the change. Except for Tennessee, Washington, and West Virginia, approved plan amendments allow youth to stay in care under certain conditions or if incapable for medical reasons. Tennessee requires youth to be in school or a program addressing employment barriers, while Washington and West Virginia limit care to eligible youth completing high school or an equivalent program. In considering extending care for youth beyond age 18, states and tribes need to evaluate various factors such as outcomes, costs, court oversight, reentry into care, foster care placements, and independent living settings. The research literature on youth transitioning out of care or remaining in care provides valuable insights. The Midwest Evaluation study found that youth who stayed in care beyond age 18 had more positive outcomes compared to those who emancipated at age 18. The study focused on former foster youth in Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin, providing insights into their experiences. The Midwest Evaluation study found that foster youth in Illinois who remained in care past age 18 had higher earnings and delayed pregnancy. Each additional year in care after age 18 was associated with a $470 increase in average annual earnings, with those staying longer seeing a $924 increase after controlling for certain characteristics. The study found that foster youth in Illinois who stayed in care past age 18 had higher earnings and lower pregnancy rates. Factors like work history, education, mental health, and criminal behavior at age 17 influenced future earnings. Youth in care were less likely to become pregnant between ages 17 and 19, and more likely to receive transitional living services between ages 19 and 21. However, the benefits of remaining in care seemed to diminish after two years. The benefits of remaining in care for foster youth in Illinois appeared to fade two years after aging out. By age 23, they were more likely to have completed one year of college but not more likely to have earned a degree. This could be due to losing access to services and supports that helped them pursue educational goals, leading them to focus on meeting basic needs like housing. Despite receiving support from programs like the Chafee Education and Training Voucher (ETV) program and tuition waivers in some states, foster youth may lack academic and social/emotional support in school. States struggle to provide extended care due to budget constraints, with 17 states citing financial limitations as the main reason for not extending care. The Jim Casey Youth Opportunities Initiative aims to assist youth transitioning from foster care. The Youth Opportunities Initiative suggests that states should convene a planning group of stakeholders, review federal requirements, consider existing supports, reach agreement on key design issues, and project for the transition of youth from foster care to adulthood. The Youth Opportunities Initiative recommends states convene a planning group to transition youth from foster care to adulthood. Advantages of youth remaining in foster care after age 18 include significant benefits demonstrated by studies on extending care or providing transitional living services to offset costs like state prison admissions and welfare payments. Researchers evaluated the cost and benefits of extending foster care beyond age 18, estimating an annual cost of about $20,800 per youth. The benefits of remaining in care were assessed in this context. The analysis found that for every $1 spent on a youth remaining in care, there was an average return of about $2, resulting in approximately $72,000 additionally earned over the youth's lifetime. Cost considerations such as additional time for caseworkers and hiring more personnel were not examined in the analysis. The analysis did not consider potential benefits of extending care, such as higher tax revenues and reduced homelessness. Providing foster care to eligible youth after age 18 is a significant cost consideration for states, with just under half of children meeting criteria for federal payments. Eligibility determination and data collection costs are included as administrative costs. State foster care expenditures may only be partially reimbursed by the federal government for Title IV-E eligible children and youth placed in licensed settings with eligible providers. The reimbursement rate for federal foster care maintenance payments is tied to a state's administrative costs. The reimbursement rate for federal foster care maintenance payments is linked to a state's Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP), ranging from 50% to 73%. Program administration costs are reimbursed at 50%, while training costs are reimbursed at 75%. States may choose to only cover youth who are IV-E eligible due to the high expense. States may choose to only cover youth who are IV-E eligible for federal foster care maintenance payments, with the full costs for non-eligible youth covered by state or local funds. Extending care only to certain eligible youth may raise equity concerns regarding reimbursement levels and services provided. Eligible youth can remain in care after age 18 as specified by federal law. Federal law allows eligible youth to remain in care after age 18 by meeting certain requirements, such as attending school or working. States seeking federal reimbursement for extending foster care may restrict eligibility based on specific activities, potentially raising equity concerns if youth are excluded for pursuing other opportunities outlined in the law. Federal law allows eligible youth to remain in care after age 18 by meeting certain requirements, such as attending school or working. States seeking federal reimbursement for extending foster care may restrict eligibility based on specific activities, potentially raising equity concerns if youth are excluded for pursuing other opportunities outlined in the law. Some states may only provide extended care to youth in post-secondary education, potentially creating disparities among youth in care. Federal child welfare law gives state courts a crucial role in ensuring the safety and appropriateness of a child's situation. State courts play a crucial role in overseeing the safety and appropriateness of a child's placement, regardless of their eligibility for IV-E funding or the circumstances of their entry into care. A case review must be conducted every six months to assess progress towards addressing the reasons for the child's removal, with a review panel or judge overseeing the process. Additionally, within 12 months of removal to foster care, a permanency goal must be established for the child. The permanency plan for children in foster care must be established within 12 months of removal, reviewed every 12 months thereafter, and must consider the child's input in an age-appropriate manner. HHS guidelines ensure these protections for all children under 18, regardless of IV-E eligibility. The case review system protections apply to all children under age 18 regardless of IV-E eligibility and to those children in care age 18 and older who are IV-E eligible. Children ineligible for IV-E may not be subject to the same court oversight. Permanency hearings are not required for youth under a voluntary placement agreement, but a case review must be conducted every six months. In states extending care beyond age 18, different levels of services are provided based on IV-E eligibility. Non-IV-E eligible youth may not have the same oversight and supervision as IV-E eligible youth. This lack of information may hinder policy makers' understanding of their needs. The American Bar Association (ABA) recommends legislation to extend juvenile court involvement beyond age 18 for older youth in care. This ensures accountability for child welfare agencies and others in meeting the needs of young adults in extended care. The ABA recommends extending juvenile court involvement beyond age 18 for older youth in care to ensure accountability for child welfare agencies. Stakeholders urge reconceptualizing support for youth in foster care at age 18 and older. The Jim Casey Foundation emphasizes the challenges faced by foster youth aging out of the system at 18, transitioning from limited autonomy to independence abruptly. Extended care for foster youth aging out of the system should be developmentally appropriate, taking into account their trauma and enabling them to be involved in decisions about their lives. This approach is based on research about adolescent brain development. Research on adolescent brain development suggests that young people have a \"second window\" of growth and need strong social supports during the transition to adulthood. It emphasizes the importance of learning from mistakes, taking on responsibility, and developing healthy relationships. Extended care for young people emphasizes their autonomy in choosing who to connect with, with graduated levels of supervision and support. Case planning may involve assigning roles and responsibilities at an earlier age, providing experiences for increased autonomy, and building social networks. Research also focuses on factors that help young people stay in extended care. In a study by the Chapin Hall Center for Children at the University of Chicago, researchers identified reasons why some youth in Illinois do not remain in care despite state policies. In the Cook County region, over 81% of youth remain in care beyond age 18, compared to 54% in other regions. The Chapin Hall study identified factors influencing youth leaving care before age 21 in Illinois. Factors include active juvenile courts retaining youth, lack of uniform understanding of laws among stakeholders in the child welfare system. Factors influencing youth leaving care before age 21 in Illinois include stakeholders lacking a uniform understanding of laws and DCFS policy, limited appropriate foster care placements leading to youth leaving care after age 18, stable relationships with adults increasing the likelihood of youth staying in care longer, and youth attitudes towards remaining in care beyond the age of majority posing a challenge. In Illinois, factors influencing youth leaving care before age 21 include stakeholders lacking a uniform understanding of laws and DCFS policy, limited appropriate foster care placements leading to youth leaving care after age 18, stable relationships with adults increasing the likelihood of youth staying in care longer, and youth attitudes towards remaining in care beyond the age of majority posing a challenge. States that extend foster care may allow youth age 18 or older to return to care due to challenges faced living independently. HHS permits states to extend foster care assistance to help youth stay in care. States and tribes can extend foster care assistance to allow youth to stay in care continuously or leave and return after turning 18, up to age 19, 20, or 21 depending on the state. A 2014 report by the Government Accountability Office found that 19 states have policies in place for youth to leave and re-enter care, with 12 states allowing youth to stay in care under voluntary placement agreements. In 19 states, youth can remain in foster care under voluntary placement agreements after turning 18. The law allows for youth to live independently in supervised settings if they stay in care after age 18. However, the instructions from HHS in July 2010 do not provide clarity on what independent living settings entail or how they should be supervised. States with foster youth in independent living settings face challenges in establishing protocols for supervising older youth in care. Advocates emphasize the importance of young adults learning adult life skills while still receiving state support. The child welfare agency continues to provide supervision, even though the parent or guardian is not the foster care provider and formal reunification has not occurred. The child welfare agency overseeing foster youth in independent living settings must address various issues such as purchasing units, screening residents, rent responsibilities, visitation frequency, consequences for rule violations, and potential for transitioning to different settings based on progress. In independent living settings for foster youth, the state must consider maintenance payment distribution, consequences for misusing funds, and support for transitioning back to parental homes. States face challenges in finding suitable housing options for these youth. States that extend care to youth age 18 and older have outlined appropriate housing options, such as apartments, homes, and dorms. Minnesota allows youth to live with roommates but not with parents or significant others. Independent living settings do not need to be licensed, and counties have discretion on background checks for roommates. The law allows for youth to be connected to caring adults through adoption or placement with relatives. Monthly federal assistance is generally not available for children who have left foster care for a permanent family after turning 18, but states can provide subsidies for eligible children who leave foster care after their 16th birthday. States and tribes can provide assistance to eligible children who leave foster care after their 16th birthday, as long as they are under 21, enrolled in school, employed, or in a program to promote employment. Assistance can also be extended to older youth with medical conditions preventing participation in these activities. This assistance can continue until the child's 21st birthday if deemed necessary by the state. States and tribes can provide assistance to eligible children who leave foster care after their 16th birthday, as long as they are under 21, enrolled in school, employed, or in a program to promote employment. Assistance can also be extended to older youth with medical conditions preventing participation in these activities, up to the age the state has elected. The instructions advise that \"relative\" for kinship guardianship assistance can include biological, legal familial ties, tribal kin, extended family, friends, or other \"fictive\" kin. States and tribes can establish conditions for guardianship, like requiring a child to be in care for over six months or targeting certain age groups. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) funds services to assist youth. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) provides support services for youth expected to emancipate from foster care at age 18. It aims to help them transition to self-sufficiency, obtain employment, access postsecondary education, and receive personal and emotional support through mentors and other adults. Former foster youth aged 18 to 21 also receive support to achieve self-sufficiency. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program supports former foster youth ages 18 to 21 in achieving self-sufficiency through various services like employment, education, and housing. P.L. 110-351 allows states and tribes to provide independent living services to youth leaving foster care after age 16. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act added a purpose area to the Chafee program. The Chafee program, effective one year after enactment, ensures foster children likely to remain in care until 18 have opportunities for appropriate activities. CFCIP provides capped funding of $140 million, with states receiving amounts based on foster care population share. States must provide a 20% match. States have developed independent living programs with funding from the CFCIP, providing services like housing, education, counseling, and mentoring to youth. To be eligible for CFCIP funds, states must describe their program in their five-year plan, ensuring statewide coverage and serving children of various ages and stages. The Chafee Education and Training Voucher Program (ETV) was authorized to support children who have emancipated from care or were adopted from care at age 16 or older. Congress also permits youth who leave foster care for guardianship at age 16 or older to be eligible for the program. The Chafee Education and Training Voucher Program provides vouchers worth up to $5,000 annually for eligible youth leaving foster care for guardianship at age 16 or older. The program is allocated $60 million in discretionary funds, with approximately $45 million appropriated each year. Vouchers cover the cost of full-time or part-time attendance at an institution of higher education, including tuition, fees, books, supplies, room and board, and related expenses, for students in good academic standing. The Chafee Education and Training Voucher Program provides vouchers up to $5,000 annually for eligible youth leaving foster care for guardianship at age 16 or older. Students must be in good academic standing and making progress towards completing their program. Independent living services are also provided to youth who have left foster care under a permanent arrangement before age 18. States provide independent living services to youth likely to remain in foster care until age 18, with the option to extend services until age 21. States have discretion in defining eligibility criteria for the program, and may need to assess capacity to serve additional youth. New purpose areas will be implemented in FY2016 to address age-appropriate activities for participating youth. The purpose area effective in FY2016 requires youth in foster care to develop a transition plan with assistance from their caseworker. The plan includes options for housing, health insurance, education, mentors, workforce supports, and employment services, to be implemented 90 days before the youth's 18th birthday. The transition plan for youth in foster care, as required in FY2016, includes options for housing, health insurance, education, mentors, workforce supports, and employment services. The plan must also designate an individual to make health care decisions if the youth is unable to do so. The transition plan for youth in foster care includes options for housing, health insurance, education, mentors, workforce supports, and employment services. It must also designate an individual to make health care decisions if the youth is unable to do so. The transition plan is separate from the case plan, which outlines the youth's placement and care while in foster care. The transition plan for youth in foster care includes options for housing, health insurance, education, mentors, workforce supports, and employment services. It must also designate an individual to make health care decisions if the youth is unable to do so. Additionally, for youth ages 16 or older, the case plan must address programs and services for a successful transition to adulthood. The transition plan outlines services and supports for when the youth is no longer in state custody or receiving independent living services. It requires specific options to help youth live independently, including housing options. The transition plan for youth in foster care includes housing options, health insurance, education, mentors, workforce supports, and employment services. It is directed by the youth in consultation with others and can be detailed as desired. The case plan is reviewed by a court annually to review permanency goals, while the transition plan is not. HHS program instructions provide guidance on transition planning for youth in foster care. The transition plan for youth in foster care includes housing options, health insurance, education, mentors, workforce supports, and employment services. Child welfare agencies are encouraged to engage youth in the transition plan process well in advance of the 90-day period before their 18th birthday. Questions arise for youth emancipating at age 17 without a transition plan, potentially leaving them less prepared than their peers in care. Without a transition plan, youth in foster care may be less prepared than their peers who emancipate at 18 or older. States and tribes may not assist in developing transition plans for youth who remain in care past age 18 but leave before reaching age 19, 20, or 21. Social work professionals are working on guidance for implementing transition plans that involve engaging youth and stakeholders in the process. The guidance emphasizes engaging youth and stakeholders in the transition planning process to achieve permanency with caring adults. Plans should consider the strengths of young people, be youth-directed, and involve sharing information to help plan for their future. States have adopted policies to involve youth in planning. In a 2014 report, GAO found that states have adopted policies to engage youth in transition planning from foster care. Nearly all jurisdictions require documented youth input and key document inclusion in the plan. Some jurisdictions have specialists to assist with the transition plan. Several jurisdictions face challenges with transition planning for youth aging out of foster care, including a lack of staff training and time, difficulty in engaging supportive adults, and finding appropriate housing. Hawaii and Nebraska have developed detailed transition planning processes to involve youth and others in the process. Transition planning \"circles\" are held to assist young people in foster care plan for their future as they become adults. These conferences involve the youth and their support system to generate options and resources for decision-making. Foster Club has created a transition planning kit for older youth in Nebraska, outlining roles of the transition plan team and courts in oversight. Transition planning for older foster youth involves a transition proposal checklist, a \"permanency pact\" to identify supportive individuals and resources, and ongoing support as they age out of the system. Despite policy changes, concerns remain about the challenges faced by these youth during their transition to adulthood. Older foster youth and those aging out face challenges transitioning to adulthood, including difficulties in forming permanent connections, securing health insurance and housing, and staying connected to work and school. Limited knowledge exists on their transition from foster care and the effectiveness of services received. A new national database may shed light on outcomes in education, employment, and interactions with social services and the criminal justice system. Congress is focusing on enhancing protections for children in foster care. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183), enacted in September 2014, aims to increase protections for vulnerable children in foster care who may be at risk of sex trafficking. The Midwest Evaluation highlights that youth aging out of foster care struggle to form lasting relationships and often remain estranged from their biological families. The Midwest Evaluation on the Adult Functioning of Former Foster Youth shows that at age 26, these youth were more likely to be married and less likely to live with their parents. They also reported being estranged from their biological family members, including parents and grandparents. The study found that many former foster youth did not have strong relationships with relatives after leaving care. Child welfare practitioners advocate for policies to improve the transition to adulthood by promoting long-term connections with caring adults, which can provide support for successful outcomes. Child welfare practitioners emphasize the importance of permanent adult connections for youth aging out of foster care, which provide a safe, stable, and secure relationship. They suggest reevaluating the case goal of \"another planned permanent living arrangement\" to help youth identify lasting connections. Child welfare practitioners stress the significance of permanent adult connections for youth transitioning out of foster care. They recommend reevaluating the case goal to help youth establish lasting relationships with caring adults, such as teachers or mentors, while cautioning against forming unsustainable connections that could potentially harm the youth. Advocates urge policy makers and practitioners to initiate permanency planning before youth leave care, emphasizing the importance of healthy relationships between foster youth and their family members. This can be achieved through the case planning process and annual permanency hearings where judges determine the child's permanency plan. APPLA, a permanency option for children in foster care, was added to the statute in 1997 as part of reforms to address concerns about long-term foster care instability. It is selected when other permanency goals are not possible or appropriate, with states required to provide a \"compelling reason\" for this decision. Advocates emphasize that APPLA should be a permanent arrangement for a child with a specific adult or couple caring for them, rather than a temporary solution. Concerns have been raised that APPLA is being used as a default permanency goal for some children in foster care, replacing long-term foster care. Advocates caution against using APPLA as a default permanency goal for children in foster care, emphasizing the importance of pursuing family settings over group care whenever possible. In December 2010, the Senate Caucus on Foster Youth issued a white paper highlighting the need for policy and practice changes to improve outcomes for children in foster care. The white paper recommended eliminating APPLA as a case plan goal or restricting it to older teenagers after intensive family finding efforts. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act incorporated some of these recommendations. The law (P.L. 113-183) incorporates recommendations from a white paper, stating that no child under 16 can have a permanency plan of APPLA. Effective one year after enactment, except for children under an Indian tribe's care (effective in three years), additional requirements must be met for children with an APPLA plan during annual permanency hearings and six-month reviews in foster care. The law includes requirements to ensure the state child welfare agency continues to seek a permanent family for children with an APPLA designation. The transition plan requirement aims to help youth establish permanent connections in adulthood by considering local mentoring opportunities. Changes to federal child welfare law could assist youth in achieving permanency by amending written case plan requirements to include steps for ensuring a permanent living arrangement after emancipation. This could involve documentation of efforts to find a permanent placement with a family or other adult connection for older youth leaving foster care. The 2014 report on the Fostering Connections Act found that 36 jurisdictions require intensive efforts to establish adult connections for youth in transition. In Texas, youth receive assistance in identifying supportive adults for their post-care needs. As part of the youth's case plan, they are asked to identify a supportive adult over 18 who will provide consistent help and guidance. Foster Club's Permanency Pact aims to connect youth aging out of care with caring adults to ensure emotional and tangible support. Other efforts focus on adoption for older youth. HHS funded a pilot project in 2005 to support adoption for older youth, known as Adoption Opportunity Grants. The grants aimed to demonstrate effective strategies for open adoption and securing permanent connections for youth through adoption, open adoption, guardianship, and kinship care. This initiative funded 10 projects nationwide to achieve permanency for current and former foster youth. Federal grants could be funded to provide mentoring for current and former foster youth, with legislation introduced in Congress to authorize funding for grants supporting mentoring programs. State and local child welfare agencies are responsible for implementing policies to promote the well-being of foster children. Child victims of sex trafficking may be reported to child welfare agencies through the CPS hotline. Children in foster care, often placed due to abuse or neglect, are at risk of trafficking, especially those who run away. State and local agencies may have limited capacity to respond to the needs of trafficking victims. The response to the needs of sex trafficking victims is limited due to various factors such as inadequate training, insufficient resources, and high caseloads. States may lack mechanisms to identify cases involving children who are sex trafficked by perpetrators who are not their parents or caregivers. The National Academy of Sciences recommends improving collaboration and information sharing across different sectors to address child sex trafficking. In the 113th Congress, hearings were held on child sex trafficking and the challenges for child welfare agencies. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) was passed as a result of these efforts. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) amends the Title IV-E foster care program to require state child welfare agencies to develop procedures to identify and provide services for children at risk of sex trafficking. The procedures must involve collaboration with various agencies and organizations and ensure training for caseworkers. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) mandates state child welfare agencies to develop procedures within one year of enactment and implement them within two years. Within two years, agencies must report child sex trafficking cases to law enforcement immediately or within 24 hours. Within three years, agencies must report annually to HHS the total number of child sex trafficking victims. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) requires state child welfare agencies to report child sex trafficking cases to law enforcement within 24 hours and annually report the total number of victims to HHS. HHS is also mandated to provide a written report to Congress summarizing demographic information and state efforts to provide specialized services for child victims of sex trafficking. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act mandates state child welfare agencies to report child sex trafficking cases to law enforcement within 24 hours and provide annual reports to HHS. HHS must establish the National Advisory Committee on Domestic Sex Trafficking within 180 days, advising on policies and best practices for combating domestic sex trafficking of minors. Congress should monitor state implementation of these requirements. States must implement requirements of the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act within one to four years after enactment. Considerations include guidance from HHS, serving youth not in foster care, reporting victims to the federal government, and best practices for victim services. State child welfare agencies must serve only children and youth already in the system. Pending legislation, such as H.R. 5081, would require state child welfare agencies to have procedures in place to identify and assess reports involving children who are sex trafficking victims. This includes training child protective services workers to identify and assess child victims of sex trafficking. Children in foster care may go missing due to abuse and neglect. Federal guidance is limited on serving missing children, focusing only on those who run away. Some stakeholders advocate for a more comprehensive response to address this issue. The Child Welfare League of America conducted a survey in 2004 on children missing from care, revealing that many states have policies in place to prevent and recover missing children. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act provides guidance to state child welfare agencies on responding to missing children from care. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act focuses on responding to missing children from care by requiring state child welfare agencies to develop protocols for locating missing children, addressing factors contributing to their disappearance, learning about their experiences while absent, and reporting relevant information. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act requires state child welfare agencies to develop protocols for locating missing children, reporting information to HHS, NCMEC, and law enforcement authorities. This must be done within one year of the law's enactment. Child welfare agencies and the federal government are involved in responding to missing children cases. Best practice guidelines recommend procedures like recruiting and training a competent workforce, involving various stakeholders in decision-making, and examining agency structure. Child welfare agencies and the federal government are involved in responding to missing children cases. Best practice guidelines recommend involving stakeholders in decision-making and examining agency structure. States define missing children differently, raising questions about reporting to law enforcement agencies. Structural and operational deficiencies in foster care facilities contributing to running behavior of children in care should be corrected. States may need to restrict reporting missing children from care to law enforcement to ensure effective response. Law enforcement agencies may not have dedicated staff for missing persons cases and may prioritize other public safety threats. Some missing incidents, like frequent runaways, may not receive vigorous responses due to various factors. The challenges of coordinating between child welfare agencies, law enforcement, and courts to prevent children from going missing are highlighted. Federal child welfare policy outlines general requirements for these agencies, but specific measures for children missing from care are lacking. The CWLA Best Practices guidelines and NCMEC guidelines emphasize collaboration between law enforcement and child welfare agencies to define roles and share clear definitions for missing children. Limited information is available on children missing from foster care, with state agencies reporting to HHS on runaway children. Child welfare agencies need to track and locate children who go missing for reasons other than running away, such as abductions or negligence. Stakeholders are concerned that agencies may not fully track abducted or missing children. Child welfare agencies may restrict foster youth from participating in normal activities due to safety policies. Witnesses testified about the limitations foster youth face, such as not being able to have sleepovers, date, use the phone, get a driver's license, work, go on school trips, or participate in sports. Witnesses testified that foster youth may need background screenings for activities, as teenagers exhibit more risk-taking behaviors due to brain development changes during adolescence. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) introduced provisions to promote normalcy for youth in foster care, including a \"reasonable and prudent parenting\" standard. Congress will monitor the law's implementation as these provisions take effect one year after enactment. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act introduced provisions to promote normalcy for youth in foster care, including a \"reasonable and prudent parenting\" standard. HHS must help states identify best practices for assisting foster parents in using the standard, provide training on children's developmental stages, and revise licensing standards for foster care. States are required to revise licensing standards for foster family homes and child care institutions to include provisions for normalcy. Concerns exist about the lack of adequate and affordable housing for youth aging out of foster care, with studies showing varying rates of homelessness among former foster youth. The Midwest Evaluation found that 24% of 23-year-olds reported being homeless at least once since exiting care. Former foster youth face challenges with housing stability, with 24% of 23-year-olds experiencing homelessness after exiting care. Many also couch surf, lacking permanent housing. Individual characteristics and involvement with the child welfare system impact their housing status. Former foster youth may struggle with housing stability due to lack of coordination with support systems and affordability issues in the housing market. While the CFCIP allows states to allocate funds for room and board, it may not be sufficient for many former foster youth. Nonprofit organizations and housing programs may provide assistance in securing housing for these individuals. Housing programs for former foster youth offer various options like single-site, scattered-site, and host homes. These programs focus on independent living support and require participants to be employed or in school. However, none of the programs have been rigorously evaluated for their effectiveness in preventing homelessness or improving housing stability. Some states struggle to find appropriate housing options for current and former foster youth, especially during school breaks when college facilities are closed. Public universities in some states are required to provide housing for these youth. Some states require public universities to provide housing for emancipated foster youth, including during school breaks. The Higher Education Act authorizes services for youth in foster care, such as housing services. The Higher Education Act authorizes Student Support Services to provide temporary housing for disadvantaged college students, including those who were in foster care or homeless before age 13. Additionally, funds from the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education can be used to establish demonstration projects offering comprehensive support services, including housing, for these students. Federal law allows owners of properties financed with Low-Income Housing Tax Credits to designate units occupied by low-income students who were in foster care as low-income units. These students are not typically considered low-income households, but exceptions exist. The law does not specify the duration of time these students must have spent in foster care. The law does not specify the length of time students in foster care must have spent or require emancipation. The U.S. Government Accountability Office defines disconnected youth as ages 14-24 not in school or working, at risk of disconnection. Youth aging out of care have low employment rates and earnings. At age 24, three out of five youth who aged out in California, Minnesota, and North Carolina were working, with lower earnings compared to national averages. Young people in care or who have aged out face challenges in education. Young people in foster care or who have aged out face challenges in education, including multiple school placements, delays in enrollment, loss of academic credit, and lack of consistent education support. Foster care alumni are less likely to attend college, with only about 7% attaining an associate's or bachelor's degree by age 26. Additional supports may be needed for young foster care alumni. Young foster care alumni may require extra support to complete their education, including academic, social/emotional, and logistical assistance such as year-round housing. Federal and state child welfare laws address the educational needs of youth in foster care, ensuring placement proximity to their school and inclusion of specific support measures in their case plans. The law requires state child welfare agencies to include education-related records in a child's case plan and work with education authorities to keep the child in the same school or ensure immediate enrollment in a new school if necessary. States can claim federal funding for transporting children to school. The law allows states to receive federal funding for transporting children to their \"school of origin\" at the same rate as foster care payments. States must ensure that children receiving federal foster care payments are enrolled in school or have completed high school. Educational records must be updated and provided to foster care parents at each placement. Federal agencies are collaborating to address the education needs of current foster youth. A summit in November 2011 brought together state teams to promote educational stability and improve outcomes for children in foster care. Despite this collaboration, federal education law does not fully address these needs. Recent legislation, such as S. 1094, aims to improve education access for children in foster care by amending federal education law to align with child welfare provisions. The bill would require state education agencies to ensure that foster care children remain in their current school. The bill aims to ensure foster care children stay in their current school or enroll in a new one if it's best for them. It also mandates state education agencies to have policies for transferring school credits for children changing schools. Federal education law addresses postsecondary educational needs of foster youth. The federal Trio programs provide services like mentoring and tutoring to youth in foster care and homeless children. These programs aim to support disadvantaged students for higher education and provide necessary services while in college. The federal Trio programs, including Talent Search, Upward Bound, Student Support Services, and Educational Opportunity Centers, aim to support disadvantaged students for higher education. The FY2014 appropriations law directs the Department of Education to modify the FAFSA form to include a box for foster care applicants and provide information on available federal educational resources. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program provides funding for independent living services for youth in care or who have aged out. The effectiveness of independent living services for foster youth is not well understood, with limited rigorous studies showing mixed results. There is a lack of national data on how well former foster youth transition to adulthood, although the National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) aims to provide insight into this issue. The National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) aims to provide insight into the lives of youth when they leave care, but full implementation will take several years. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program is the main source of funding for independent living services for transition-age young people in and recently emancipated from foster care, with an annual appropriation of $140 million distributed to states based on their relative share of children in care. States must provide a 20% match to receive the funds, and nearly all states draw down their maximum amount of CFCIP dollars. Based on a 2008 survey by the University of Chicago's Chapin Hall Center for Children, 31 states spend additional funds for independent living services beyond the 20% match required to receive CFCIP dollars. This indicates that federal funding alone may not be sufficient for states to support their independent living programs effectively. With limited funding available, states could benefit from learning about the most effective services. Research on independent living programs is scarce, but evaluations are required by the law that established the CFCIP. The HHS conducted evaluations of independent living programs funded by the CFCIP to determine their effectiveness in achieving key outcomes for foster youth. The evaluation involved randomly assigning 1,400 eligible foster youth to four programs. The evaluation randomly assigned 1,400 eligible foster youth to four programs in California and Massachusetts. The youth were surveyed at three points: baseline, one year after baseline, and two years after baseline. In-person interviews were conducted with the youth, program administrators, community advocates, and directors of community provider agencies. The evaluation of foster youth programs in California and Massachusetts involved surveys and interviews with various stakeholders. The findings showed no significant impacts in Los Angeles and Kern County programs, but positive outcomes in the Massachusetts life skills program for education. The Massachusetts Adolescent Outreach Program for Youth in Intensive Foster Care, known as Outreach, aims to help youth achieve education, avoid high-risk behaviors, and gain employment through tailored services and a youth development approach. The Outreach program emphasizes a youth development approach, with social workers overseeing a small caseload of approximately 15 youth. Workers aim to develop a close relationship with the youth to act as their advocate, assisting with tasks like obtaining driver's licenses, applying for college, and gaining employment. Caseworkers may also refer youth to service providers as needed, with evaluations focusing on educational, employment, and other outcomes. The evaluation of the Outreach program showed that youth who participated were more likely to enroll and persist in college, remain in foster care, and receive more assistance in various areas such as education, employment, money management, and housing. Remaining in care and college enrollment were found to be closely linked according to the study. The evaluation of the Outreach program showed that youth who participated were more likely to enroll and persist in college, remain in foster care, and receive more assistance in various areas such as education, employment, money management, and housing. The study found a strong link between remaining in care and college enrollment. However, the program did not show better outcomes in employment, economic well-being, housing, delinquency, pregnancy, or preparedness for independent living tasks. This raises questions about the effectiveness of independent living programs and classroom-based instruction in helping youth transition to independent living. The Outreach program aims to assist transitioning youth, but results show no significant improvement compared to other foster youth in various areas. The National Youth in Transition Database tracks outcomes of foster youth to identify effective approaches, although states are still in the early stages of utilizing this data. The National Youth in Transition Database tracks outcomes of foster youth to identify effective approaches, with states reporting information to the database. HHS consults with various stakeholders to develop outcome measures and identify data needed to track youth outcomes. The National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) was established to track outcomes of foster youth and collect data on independent living services. States began collecting data on youth in FY2011, with HHS using NYTD for data collection and reporting activities. States collect and report information twice each fiscal year on eligible youth receiving independent living services, including their foster care status and outcomes at ages 17, 19, and 21. This data is tracked regardless of whether they receive services at those ages. States have the option to track a sample of youth. The rule requires states to collect and report data on youth receiving independent living services at ages 17, 19, and 21. States can track a sample of youth to reduce data collection burden and face financial penalties for not meeting data submission requirements."
