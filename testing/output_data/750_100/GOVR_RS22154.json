    "content": "The Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations, initiated in 1986 under GATT, concluded in 1994 with the signing of the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the WTO. The WTO Agreement, in force since January 1, 1995, requires countries to accept all agreements negotiated during the Round. The Uruguay Round package expands on trade obligations, including rules on dispute settlement administered by the WTO Dispute Settlement Body. The process of dispute settlement in the WTO involves consultations, panels, possible appeals, and adoption of resulting reports by the DSB. If a Member is found to have violated a WTO obligation, it must implement the decision within a reasonable period of time. Failure to comply may result in seeking compensation or imposing retaliatory measures. The Uruguay Round Agreement Act approved and implemented the WTO Agreement and other agreements negotiated in the Uruguay Round. The Uruguay Round Agreement Act (URAA) comprehensively addressed the legal effect of Uruguay Round agreements and WTO decisions in the United States. It prohibits private remedies for alleged violations of WTO agreements and requires the USTR to update Congress on disputes challenging U.S. laws. The URAA establishes requirements for agencies implementing WTO decisions and considers the Uruguay Round agreements non-self-executing, relying on the URAA for legal effect in the U.S. The URAA approves WTO agreements, includes provisions for implementation, new authorities, and repeals. It states that domestic law supersedes inconsistent WTO provisions and requires specific action to implement WTO decisions challenged in the U.S. The URAA approves WTO agreements, includes provisions for implementation, new authorities, and repeals. Congressional or administrative action is required to implement these WTO decisions, ensuring that domestic law supersedes inconsistent WTO provisions. The Statement of Administrative Action (SAA) accompanies the WTO agreements when submitted to Congress by the President. The URAA approves WTO agreements, includes provisions for implementation, new authorities, and repeals. The Statement of Administrative Action (SAA) clarifies that U.S. law will take precedence over any conflicts with the Uruguay Round agreements. Congress can enact statutory changes to address unforeseen conflicts between U.S. law and WTO agreements in subsequent legislation. The URAA legislative history emphasizes that changes in Federal statutes should be specifically enacted, not preempted by international agreements, including WTO dispute settlement results. Congressional approval is required for implementing any dispute settlement findings that a U.S. statute is inconsistent with an agreement. The URAA requires Congress approval for implementing WTO dispute settlement findings on U.S. statutes. State law issues in WTO disputes involve federal-state cooperation and USTR involvement in developing responses. Private remedies are generally precluded under the URAA. The URAA centralizes the response to adverse WTO decisions involving state law in the federal government, precluding private remedies. State laws are not automatically preempted by Uruguay Round agreements unless declared invalid in an action brought by the United States. The URAA centralizes the response to adverse WTO decisions involving state law in the federal government, precluding private remedies. State laws are not automatically preempted by Uruguay Round agreements unless declared invalid in an action brought by the United States. The statute also contains restrictions on any such U.S. legal action, including that the report of the WTO dispute settlement panel or the Appellate Body may not be considered binding on the court or otherwise accorded deference. Any such suit by the United States is expected to be a rarity. Private remedies are prohibited under Section 102(c)(1) of the URAA. The URAA prohibits private remedies under any Uruguay Round Agreements, stating that only the United States can challenge actions inconsistent with such agreements. Congress aims to occupy the field regarding any cause of action or defense related to these agreements. The URAA prohibits private remedies under Uruguay Round Agreements, allowing only the United States to challenge actions inconsistent with the agreements. This provision prevents private parties from bringing actions against States or political subdivisions based on judgments obtained by the United States. The URAA prohibits private parties from taking action against states under Uruguay Round Agreements, stating that only the US government can challenge actions inconsistent with the agreements. This provision aims to ensure that federal and state laws align with US obligations under international agreements like the Uruguay Round. The URAA ensures that federal and state laws align with US obligations under international agreements like the Uruguay Round, allowing agencies to consider consistency with these agreements. The Act sets out procedures for implementing adverse WTO decisions and addresses regulatory modifications and new determinations. Section 123(g) of the URAA requires consultation with Congress, seeking private sector advice, and public comment before amending regulations found inconsistent with WTO agreements. Section 123(g) of the URAA mandates a 60-day consultation period with Congress and allows the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means Committees to vote on proposed changes. This process does not apply to the U.S. International Trade Commission. Section 129 outlines the authorities and procedures for the United States Trade Representative, USITC, and Commerce Department. The US International Trade Commission (USITC) and the Department of Commerce (Commerce Department, or DOC) implement adverse WTO panel and Appellate Body (AB) reports in U.S. safeguards, antidumping, and countervailing duty proceedings. These proceedings are governed by the WTO Agreement on Safeguards, the Agreement on Antidumping, and the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. In safeguards proceedings, the USITC investigates whether increased imports of a product cause serious injury to a domestic industry. The US International Trade Commission (USITC) and the Department of Commerce (Commerce Department, or DOC) implement adverse WTO panel and Appellate Body (AB) reports in U.S. safeguards, antidumping, and countervailing duty proceedings. These proceedings are initiated on the basis of a domestic industry petition, executive or legislative branch request, or its own motion. If injury is found, the President may temporarily restrict imports or take other measures to remedy the harm to U.S. firms. Antidumping and countervailing duty investigations may be initiated by petition or on the motion of the Department of Commerce, and involve determinations by both the Commerce Department and the USITC. The Commerce Department and USITC determine if products are dumped or subsidized, causing injury to domestic industries. Antidumping duties are imposed for dumping, countervailing duties for subsidization. Adverse WTO decisions can impact these determinations. In case of an adverse WTO decision, Section 129 requires the affected agency to determine if it can comply with the decision under existing law. The USTR may request a \"Section 129 Determination\" from the agency to make its action consistent with WTO findings, with consultation with Congress required during the process. The USTR may direct DOC to revoke antidumping or countervailing duty orders if the USITC no longer finds material injury from dumped or subsidized imports. DOC may adjust duties or revoke the order based on new determinations. Section 129 determinations have prospective application, applying to unliquidated goods entering the US for consumption on specified dates. They are triggered when a USITC injury determination no longer supports an antidumping or countervailing duty order, or when a new DOC dumping or subsidy determination is made. These determinations can be reviewed in the U.S. Court. Section 129 determinations implemented can be reviewed in the U.S. Court of International Trade or before binational panels under NAFTA. Private rights of action based on Uruguay Round agreements are precluded, but WTO panel findings have been brought to federal courts in challenges to agency determinations. Federal courts often handle challenges to agency determinations in antidumping and countervailing duty proceedings under Section 516A of the Tariff Act of 1930. The U.S. Court of International Trade has exclusive jurisdiction over these cases, with appeals going to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and potentially the U.S. Supreme Court. The U.S. Court of International Trade has exclusive jurisdiction over challenges to agency determinations in antidumping and countervailing duty proceedings under Section 516A of the Tariff Act of 1930. Federal courts must review agency determinations for compliance with the law, using a two-step analysis outlined by the U.S. Supreme Court in Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council. Congress has clearly spoken to the issue at hand. The court decides whether the agency's construction of the statute is permissible and will defer to an agency's interpretation if reasonable. The court should apply the canon of construction from Murray v. Schooner Charming Betsy to interpret statutes consistently with U.S. international obligations. The Charming Betsy argument applies when a statute is unclear, but if the statute is clear, the statutory language prevails. Courts have not been prevented from considering WTO-based arguments in domestic legal challenges, as these challenges are based on the Tariff Act, not a WTO agreement. Federal courts have deemed WTO decisions as \"persuasive\" but not binding on the United States. Questions on compliance with adverse WTO decisions fall under the executive branch's jurisdiction. In court cases challenging Commerce Department antidumping determinations, the issue of Chevron and Charming Betsy arises when dumping margins are calculated using \"zeroing.\" This practice involves assigning a zero value to sales at or above fair market value, leading to disputes over the reasonableness of agency actions. The U.S. practice of zeroing in antidumping calculations has been challenged in WTO disputes for inflating margins. U.S. courts have upheld Commerce Department's interpretation allowing zeroing, despite adverse WTO rulings. To comply with WTO decisions, Commerce Department has abandoned zeroing using Section 123(g) authority. The Commerce Department has used Section 123(g) authority to abandon zeroing in original antidumping investigations and proposed modifications for subsequent phases. Additionally, in cases where antidumping orders have been challenged in WTO proceedings, Section 129(c) authority has been utilized to issue new antidumping determinations without zeroing. Legislation introduced in recent Congresses reflects concerns about WTO Appellate Body interpretations. Legislation addressing concerns about WTO Appellate Body interpretations, particularly regarding U.S. use of zeroing in antidumping proceedings."
