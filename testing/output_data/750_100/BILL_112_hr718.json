    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Huntington's Disease Parity Act of 2011\". Congress finds that Huntington's Disease is a progressive neurological condition causing physical and mental deterioration in approximately 30,000 individuals in the US, with 200,000 more at genetic risk. There is currently no effective treatment to halt or slow the disease's progression, with clinical indicators including loss of movement control and cognitive impairment. Adult-onset Huntington's Disease typically results in symptoms developing between ages 30 and 50, while late-onset occurs after age 50. Symptoms include loss of cognitive abilities, memory, behavioral changes like irritability and depression. Juvenile Huntington's Disease affects individuals under 19 years old and progresses rapidly. Due to the disabling nature of the disease, individuals with Huntington's Disease rely on Social Security Disability Insurance. Despite medical advancements, the impact on individuals remains significant. The Social Security Administration has not updated its rules for evaluating neurological disabilities since 1985, leading to an outdated and inaccurate designation of Huntington's Disease as \"Huntington's Chorea.\" This fails to recognize the full impact of the disease, affecting eligibility for Social Security Disability Insurance and Medicare. After qualifying for Social Security Disability Insurance, individuals with Huntington's Disease must wait 24 months before receiving Medicare benefits, despite often becoming incapacitated before reaching the age requirement of 65. In 2000, the Centers for Medicaid & Medicare Services waived the waiting period for ALS patients, a condition similar to Huntington's Disease. The outdated Social Security Disability Insurance guidelines for Huntington's Disease need urgent revision due to significant cognitive, behavioral, and physical incapacitation faced by individuals with this condition. There is a need to update the medical and evaluation criteria used by the Social Security Administration to determine disability, as well as remove the 24-month waiting period for Medicare coverage, similar to the exemption for ALS patients. The Social Security Disability Insurance guidelines for Huntington's Disease need updating to reflect the challenges faced by individuals with the condition. This includes revising medical criteria and removing the 24-month Medicare waiting period, similar to the exemption for ALS patients. Revision of medical and evaluation criteria for evaluating disability caused by adult-onset and juvenile Huntington's Disease. The Commissioner of Social Security will update the criteria for evaluating disability caused by Adult-Onset and Juvenile Huntington's Disease in consultation with medical experts. The Commissioner of Social Security will update the criteria for evaluating disability caused by Huntington's Disease, including Juvenile Huntington's Disease, by providing medical and evaluation criteria in relevant sections of the Listing of Impairments. The Commissioner of Social Security will update the criteria for evaluating disability caused by Huntington's Disease, including Juvenile Huntington's Disease, by amending the Listing of Impairments to provide medical and evaluation criteria. The Social Security Act is amended to waive the 24-month waiting period for Medicare coverage for individuals diagnosed with Huntington's Disease. This change applies to benefits under title XVIII of the Social Security Act for services provided after the enactment of this Act."
