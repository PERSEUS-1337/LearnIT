    "content": "Surface transportation authorization acts authorize spending on federal highway and mass transit programs, safety, research, and some rail programs. The most recent authorization, SAFETEA-LU, expired in 2009, leading to operations on extension acts and resolutions due to budget constraints. The highway trust fund has been the primary funding source. The highway trust fund (HTF) has been the main source of funding for surface transportation bills since 1956. However, declining revenues from highway taxes, due to the economy and improved fuel efficiency, have raised concerns about passing a multi-year bill without cutting spending, raising gas taxes, or increasing the deficit. Other debated issues include alternative finance, tolling, public-private partnerships, project delivery acceleration, and performance management in this fiscal context. In the fiscal context, issues of equity in federal spending distribution among states are being debated. The Senate passed MAP-21 on March 14, 2012, reauthorizing surface transportation programs. For more details, refer to CRS Report R41512. The House committees reported favorably on H.R. 7, a five-year bill reauthorizing surface transportation programs with a total authorization of $260 billion. The bill includes provisions to increase oil and gas production to fund highway infrastructure, which has sparked controversy. The House passed the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2012, Part II (H.R. 4348) to extend surface transportation authorizations through FY2012, including provisions for the Keystone XL Pipeline and Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund. The Senate agreed to an amendment that replaced the House-passed language in H.R. 4348 with the language of MAP-21, allowing the measure to go to conference. Negotiations will involve the substance of H.R. 7 and provisions of the extension bill. Surface transportation reauthorization is a complex issue before Congress, involving multiple committees. The highway trust fund is primarily funded by excise taxes on motor fuels. The Highway Trust Fund (HTF) is funded by taxes on motor fuels, with rates set at 18.3 cents per gallon for gasoline and 24.3 cents per gallon for diesel. The HTF has two separate accounts for highway and mass transit, with the highway account receiving 15.44 cents of the gasoline tax and the mass transit account receiving 2.86 cents. Fuel tax revenues do not increase with inflation as they are set in cents per gallon. The last fuel tax rate increase was in 1993, and sluggish economic performance and improved vehicle fuel efficiency have led to lower than expected revenues. The Highway Trust Fund has faced reduced fuel tax revenues, requiring transfers from the general fund. The Congressional Budget Office projects a shortfall of $4.6 billion by the end of FY2013, with a gap of $8-9 billion per year through FY2022. The mass transit account faces a projected shortfall of $1.2 billion by the end of FY2014, increasing to $5 billion by the end of FY2015. Without an increase in fuel taxes, the trust fund system will struggle to support transportation spending. The Federal-Aid Highway Program (Highway Program) may not be able to support current or increased surface transportation spending without new revenue sources. State DOTs primarily manage the program but must adhere to federal planning guidelines. The Federal-Aid Highway Program is managed by state DOTs according to federal planning guidelines. Projects require a state/local matching share, typically 10% for Interstate System projects and 20% for other roads. FHWA notifies states of federal funds availability for four years, with funds distributed through apportionment. The Federal-Aid Highway Program distributes federal funds through apportionment, allocation, and reimbursement. Reimbursement is provided once a project is approved and costs are incurred, to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. Contract authority allows for obligation without appropriation. The Federal-Aid Highway Program distributes federal funds through apportionment, allocation, and reimbursement. Contract authority allows for obligation without appropriation, with liquidating authority needed to pay obligations. Obligation of contract authority legally commits the federal government to reimburse the state for project costs. Limitation on obligations (ObLim) controls annual spending, similar to an appropriation. Formula and discretionary programs receive funds, with formula program funds apportioned to each state. Under SAFETEA, federal-aid highway money is apportioned to state DOTs through large formula-driven programs, which receive 80% of contract authority. These core formula programs, such as the Interstate Maintenance Program (IM), fund most federal-aid highway projects. Discretionary programs, on the other hand, are smaller programs allocated by FHWA or earmarked by Congress. The core formula programs for federal-aid highway projects include Interstate Maintenance Program (IM), National Highway System (NHS), Surface Transportation Program (STP), Highway Bridge Program (HBP), Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ) Program, Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP), and Equity Bonus Program (EB). Each program has its own formula factors to determine state apportionment of funds. The Equity Bonus Program, the largest highway program in dollar terms, guarantees each state a minimum share of funds regardless of funding formulas. State DOTs have increasing flexibility to transfer funds between programs, reducing the importance of funding formulas and program eligibility distinctions. Some argue that the program structure limits their ability to use federal highway funds as they see fit. Highway Program funding can also be used for transit projects. The Equity Bonus Program guarantees each state a minimum share of funds regardless of funding formulas, diluting the policy rationales associated with core program formulas. Smaller discretionary highway programs are also part of the Federal-Aid Highway Program, earmarked by Congress during SAFETEA. The term \"program\" is used broadly in FHWA's Financing Federal-Aid Highways listing. The Federal Transit Administration administers various individual programs with different funding amounts, distribution mechanisms, and spending rules. There are four main federal transit programs in SAFETEA, accounting for 85% of authorized funds. The Urbanized Area Formula Program and the Fixed Guideway Modernization Program are two of the main federal transit programs in SAFETEA, accounting for 57% of authorized transit funding. The Urbanized Area Formula Program provides funding to urbanized areas with populations of 50,000 or more, while the Fixed Guideway Modernization Program funds are mainly used for transit replacement and rehabilitation. 16% of authorized transit funding is allocated for the replacement and rehabilitation of transit rail system assets. The New Starts Program, accounting for 18% of overall funding, is competitive and supports new fixed guideway systems and extensions, including busways, ferries, and vintage trolleys. Additionally, the \"Small Starts\" program in SAFETEA funds projects with a total cost of $250. Congress enacted the \"Small Starts\" program in SAFETEA to fund projects with a total cost of $250 million or less, with a federal share of $75 million or less. Small Starts projects receive $200 million annually from the New Starts authorization starting in FY2007. Bus Program funds, 9% of authorized funding, are used to purchase buses and bus-related equipment, as well as for building construction. Previously earmarked, these funds are now allocated by the FTA. The FTA allocates funds for various transit programs, with smaller programs like the Rural Formula Program, JARC, Elderly and Disabilities grants, and New Freedom Program accounting for 15% of funds. Highway transportation is a leading cause of fatalities and injuries in the US, with states responsible for highway safety. Congress has federal highway safety programs to assist states. The Department of Transportation (DOT) administers federal highway safety programs to assist states in improving highway safety. Three DOT agencies oversee these programs: NHTSA focuses on driver behavior and vehicle safety, FMCSA focuses on commercial driver qualifications and vehicle safety, and FHWA focuses on roadway design safety. NHTSA provides grants to states, regulates motor vehicle safety, and conducts research on traffic safety. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) oversees federal grant funds for traffic safety, requiring states to submit approved highway safety plans to receive funds. Each state's plan must identify primary safety problems, set goals, and establish performance measures. NHTSA also provides training and grants through various programs. FMCSA administers various grant programs to support state efforts in improving traffic safety, including reducing speeding, increasing seat belt usage, and discouraging unsafe driving behaviors. It also promotes commercial motor vehicle safety through regulation, enforcement, training, and technical assistance. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) administers motor carrier safety grant programs to ensure the safety of truck and motor coach operations. The Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) aims to reduce traffic fatalities and injuries by improving roadways. States receive funding based on road lane-miles, vehicle miles traveled, and traffic fatalities, with a minimum allocation of 0.5%. HSIP includes a set-aside for the Railway-Highway Grade Crossing Hazard Elimination Program. SAFETEA extended funding mechanisms to protect highway and mass transit budgets from being reallocated for other purposes. It guaranteed annual funding levels for high-risk rural roads and specified funding levels for FY2005 through FY2009. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 specified SAFETEA ObLim levels to prevent lower funding levels. Budget firewalls set in the Budget Enforcement Act were honored by appropriators until 2002. A change in House rules provided a second level of protection, but it was eliminated in the 112th Congress, removing the guarantees. RABA can adjust funding levels annually. RABA is a mechanism for adjusting highway funding levels based on annual account receipts. Despite revenues consistently falling below guarantee levels, funding cuts have not been implemented due to general fund transfers. Consideration for aligning spending with receipts may still be needed. Some mechanism to align spending with receipts may still be necessary for reauthorization, as the Budget Control Act requires sequestration if a special joint committee fails to agree on spending reductions. However, exemptions under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act likely mean sequestration would not significantly reduce surface transportation spending. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act exemptions indicate that sequestration would not significantly reduce surface transportation spending beyond FY2012. Exempted programs include Federal-Aid Highways, Highway Traffic Safety Grants, NHTSA operations, Motor Carrier Safety programs, Transit Formula and Bus Grants. The $739 million annual contract authority exempt from obligation limitation may be subject to sequester. The Federal Transit Administration's New Starts program, supported by general fund revenues, is also affected. The Transit Administration's New Starts program, funded by general revenues, may be impacted by sequester. SAFETEA expired in 2009, with surface transportation programs operating on extension legislation. The House-passed STEA-II extends the HTF and federal transportation programs until September 30, 2012, with new legislative provisions. The Senate replaced this with MAP-21 on April 24, 2012. The House and Senate sent the two-year surface transportation bill and the House extension legislation, MAP-21 and STEA-II, to conference for negotiation. Chairman John Mica stated that the negotiation would include the substance of H.R. 7. Provisions in conference proposals must align with the differences between the House and Senate versions. The substance of H.R. 7 provisions, not present in either version, is expected to be included. The substance of H.R. 7 provisions, not in the Senate or House versions, is expected to be proposed in conference. Members may raise issues on the allowable scope for conference on H.R. 4348. Conference reports with out-of-scope provisions may face points of order in both chambers. House can waive content restrictions with a majority vote, while Senate requires 60 Senators' support. Title II of the STEA-II bill includes provisions related to the North American Energy Access Act, transferring permitting authority for the Keystone XL pipeline, and requiring a permit to be issued within 30 days of enactment. It also states that the final environmental impact statement from August 26, 2011, satisfies all requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The bill establishes the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund, financed by 80% of Deepwater Horizon-related penalties under the Clean Water Act. The Secretary of the Treasury administers the fund, distributing revenues with 35% going to Gulf Coast states. The House-passed H.R. 4348 establishes the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund, distributing revenues with 35% to Gulf Coast states, 60% to the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council, and 5% for research. Unlike S. 1400, future revenue distribution would require an act of Congress. The provision ensures budgetary resources match Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund receipts and restricts use to harbor maintenance programs. Title V includes the Coal Residuals Reuse and Management Act. Title V of the House-passed H.R. 4348 adds the Coal Residuals Reuse and Management Act to the bill, allowing states to implement coal combustion residuals permit programs. Title VI, from H.R. 7, aims to expedite transportation project delivery. Both House and Senate bills focus on reducing highway programs and expediting project delivery without earmarks. MAP-21 is a two-year reauthorization bill funding the Federal-Aid Highway Program. MAP-21 is a two-year reauthorization bill that funds the Federal-Aid Highway Program with adjustments for inflation. It includes changes to the structure, formulas, and funding distribution. The bill authorizes $39.5 billion for FY2012 and $40.5 billion for FY2013, with $400 million allocated for research and education each fiscal year. Formula factors under individual programs would be eliminated, and states would receive contract authority based on their previous apportionments and allocations. The MAP-21 bill authorizes funding for the Federal-Aid Highway Program based on states' previous apportionments and allocations. It replaces individual program formulas with a calculation based on SAFETEA share, reducing federal and congressional influence on project selection. MAP-21 would significantly change federal planning and project delivery by eliminating most discretionary grant programs and reducing the number of programs by two-thirds. Transferability between core programs would be limited to 20% of each formula program's apportionment. The Transportation Enhancements Program would be merged into the CMAQ program. The bill merges the Transportation Enhancements Program into the CMAQ program and allows states to use funds for non-TE CMAQ uses after building up an unspent balance. The National Freight Program aims to increase funding for freight projects by eliminating competition with non-freight projects. The Senate bill also significantly increases funding for the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act program. The House bill, H.R. 7, is a five-year reauthorization bill with modest increases for federal-aid highways and funding for research and education. It includes provisions to fold existing programs into the National Highway System and Surface Transportation Programs. The bill does not address tolling of federally funded roads and bridges, which are important for revenue streams needed for TIFIA and other projects. The House bill, H.R. 7, proposes reducing the number of distinct programs by two-thirds to around 30. It includes retaining the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality program and the Highway Safety Improvement programs. The Equity Bonus program would guarantee a 94% state rate of return on payments to the Highway Trust Fund. The Mass Transit Account would be renamed the Alternative Transportation Account and would provide $2.267 billion annually for highway programs. Fuel taxes credited to the Mass Transit Account would be redirected to the Highway Account. The House bill, H.R. 7, proposes redirecting fuel taxes from the Mass Transit Account to the Highway Account. Provisions under the streamlining title would change NEPA requirements for federal highway and transit projects, excluding projects costing less than $10 million or with federal funding below 15%. TIFIA funding would increase significantly, and MAP-21 would maintain current funding levels for the Federal Transit Administration. H.R. 7 proposes changes to transit funding, including the creation of the State of Good Repair program and modifications to the New Starts process. Funding for the Bus and Bus Facilities SGR program would come from the New Starts program. H.R. 7 proposes changes to transit funding, including renaming the Mass Transit Account to the Alternative Transportation Account (ATA) and redirecting motor fuel taxes to the Highway Account. The bill would transfer $40 billion from the general fund to fund the ATA and eliminate various grant programs while combining others into a single program. MAP-21 includes provisions for a national rail plan, rolling stock equipment pool, and positive train control. It also amends the RRIF program to accept state or local subsidies as collateral for freight rail loans. The bill includes provisions for Amtrak funding, the RRIF program, and positive train control implementation. It aims to close the gap between projected HTF revenues and total authorizations. The Senate bill extends highway-related taxes and trust fund expenditure authority. The bill includes provisions to raise $13.872 billion over ten-and-a-half fiscal years for the HTF, with transfers from various sources such as the LUST trust fund, Gas Guzzler Tax, revocation of passports of tax delinquents, and allowing the Treasury to levy payments to Medicare providers. The curr_chunk details various sources of revenue generation, including levying payments to Medicare providers, transfer of import tariffs on automotive products, change in tax treatment of securities, IRS levy on federal employee's Thrift Savings Account, extension for transfers of excess pension assets, and application of U.S. tax code to life insurance. Total revenue raised is $4.52 billion from import tariffs, $244 million from tax treatment change, $25 million from IRS levy, and $363 million from pension asset transfers. The curr_chunk summarizes various revenue sources, including pension funding stabilization, transfer from Treasury general fund to HTF, phased retirement, sale of life insurance policies, and extending taxes. Total revenue generated is $9.467 billion from pension funding, $4.970 billion from Treasury transfer, $459 million from phased retirement, $244 million from life insurance sales, and $99 million from tax extensions. The curr_chunk outlines revenue sources including delaying interest expense allocation, special measures against money laundering, and comments on exceeding offset needs for deficit reduction. The Finance Committee reported favorably on provisions that cost money, including reducing spending levels by $761 million over 10 years, changing the Small Issuer Exception rules, and extending special rules for bonds issued before January 1, 2013. Additionally, $215 million would be saved by not treating certain bonds as a tax preference for alternative minimum tax purposes, and $139 million would be saved by extending the parity of monthly exclusion for employer-provided vanpool and transit pass benefits. The Senate bill includes provisions for TRIP bonds through state infrastructure banks and modified versions of the Sustainable Water Infrastructure Act and the Transportation Access for All Americans Act. The Transportation Access for All Americans Act would amend the Internal Revenue Code to extend the depreciation period for long-term highway leases to 45 years, potentially reducing private-sector investor interest in highway privatization. The bill also ensures that the amortization period for the franchise right to collect tolls is not less than the lease term or 15 years, whichever is longer. The Finance Committee is concerned that the current 15-year amortization period for toll collection rights is often shorter than the lease term. The Finance Committee is proposing a \"solvency account\" to manage excess funds appropriated to the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) under MAP-21. These funds would be transferred to the highway and mass transit accounts to ensure their needs are met. The Senate bill proposes using the LUST trust fund to provide new revenue for the highway trust fund, which was established in 1986 to address groundwater contamination from leaking underground storage tanks. The fund receives revenues from a tax on gasoline and diesel fuels to support environmental cleanup programs. The LUST trust fund is used for environmental contamination investigation and cleanup programs, as well as UST leak prevention. States use the fund for overseeing corrective actions by responsible parties and conducting actions when no responsible party is identified. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 expanded the fund's use for federal UST leak prevention and detection programs. The LUST trust fund, used for environmental cleanup and UST leak prevention, has addressed 85% of reported releases, with 88,000 still needing cleanup. The fund had a $3.392 billion balance in FY2012, receiving $117 million in interest and $181 million in tax receipts. Congress typically appropriates $113 million annually from the fund for states' grants. The LUST trust fund, used for environmental cleanup and UST leak prevention, has addressed 85% of reported releases, with 88,000 still needing cleanup. States receive a minimum of 80% of the annual appropriation from the fund, while EPA uses the remainder for its responsibilities, including implementing the program on Indian lands. States' LUST programs have relied on nonfederal fund sources due to low appropriations. Section 40301 of the Senate bill would transfer $3.0 billion from the LUST trust fund to the highway trust fund in FY2012, and Section 40302 would appropriate one-third of future LUST trust fund receipts to the highway trust fund. The LUST trust fund receives funds from a tax on gasoline and diesel fuel, projected to provide $3.685 billion to the highway trust fund over ten years. The expenditure authority for the LUST trust fund is set to expire on March 31, 2012, but the Senate bill aims to extend it through September 30, 2013. The finance provisions of H.R. 7 were included in the American Energy and Infrastructure Jobs Financing Act of 2012. The bill H.R. 7 reauthorizes HTF expenditure authority through FY2016 and extends existing highway taxes, including motor fuel taxes, through FY2018. It includes a provision requiring offsets for transfers from the general fund to the HTF. The finance provisions of H.R. 7 aim to reconfigure the highway trust fund and address revenue gaps. H.R. 7 proposes offsets for highway account revenues and balances, including $40 billion from the general fund for an alternative transportation account. It extends the LUST trust fund and aims to direct federal revenues from energy leasing into the Highway Trust Fund. Title XVII of H.R. 7 would allocate government receipts from energy leasing and drilling activities to the Highway Trust Fund. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act governs offshore energy development, allowing the Department of the Interior to lease federal ocean areas for oil and gas resources. The Department of the Interior has the right to develop oil and gas resources in federal ocean areas, generating $6.5 billion in federal receipts in FY2011. These receipts are allocated to various programs, including the Land and Water Conservation Fund and the National Historic Preservation Fund. Additionally, states receive portions of federal receipts from certain submerged acreage. H.R. 7 renames the mass transit account of the HTF to the alternative transportation account and provides a one-time appropriation of $40 billion. Gulf Coast states receive additional funds from specified leases. Federal Employee Retirement is included to provide offsetting revenues for the $40 billion in general fund revenues allocated to the alternative transportation account. MAP-21 proposes total authorizations of $80.8 billion over two years under the Highway and Research titles of the bill. The bill guarantees a state share based on SAFETEA and a 95 cent return on each dollar paid to the highway account. MAP-21 does not include highway program earmarks or reinstate funding firewalls. Section 4001 includes a provision for Highway Spending Controls. Section 4001 of MAP-21 includes a \"ratchet mechanism\" provision to ensure solvency of the highway account by reducing FY2012 ObLim if balance falls below $2 billion in FY2012 or $1 billion in FY2013. Any withdrawn ObLim would lapse, and a proportionate amount of contract authority would be rescinded. The provision in MAP-21 includes a \"ratchet mechanism\" to maintain solvency of the highway account by reducing FY2012 ObLim if the balance falls below certain thresholds. Any withdrawn ObLim would lapse, and a proportionate amount of contract authority would be rescinded. The calculation is to be made under year-long appropriations bills, not short-term continuing resolutions, to address the pending HTF shortfall and ensure spending stays within HTF means. This may increase pressure to find additional revenue options for the HTF. H.R. 7 proposes a $205 billion federal-aid highway program authorization over five years, with HTF obligation limitations set for each year. Congress has a history of overriding negative RABA calculations by drawing down the HTF balance. H.R. 7 proposes a $205 billion federal-aid highway program authorization over five years, with HTF obligation limitations set for each year. Some highway programs would be funded from a proposed Alternative Transportation Account, providing an additional obligation limitation of $2.7 billion annually for FY2013-FY2016. H.R. 7 includes a modified Equity Bonus Program with a guarantee that each state's total highway grants will equal at least 94% of the motor fuel taxes paid into the HTF. The House bill, H.R. 7, proposes a $205 billion federal-aid highway program authorization over five years, with an obligation limitation of $3.9 billion per year. It includes funding for various highway programs such as the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Program, Ferry Boats and Terminals, Puerto Rico Highways, and Territorial Highway Program. Additionally, the bill allows expanded tolling of the Interstate system and federal participation in projects to increase highway capacity and convert to toll facilities. H.R. 7 proposes a $205 billion federal-aid highway program authorization over five years with expanded tolling of the Interstate system. MAP-21 determines state apportionments for major programs using a single methodology. The amount available for apportionment by each state is based on their share of total nationwide apportionments and allocations received for FY2005-FY2009. Adjustments are made to ensure each state's combined apportionments will not be less than 95% of estimated tax payments made by highway users. It is unlikely adjustments will be needed due to excess federal highway spending over revenues. Additionally, an amount is based on each state's CMAQ percentage of total apportionments for FY2009, plus 10% of the state's. The new CMAQ program allocates a percentage of each state's apportionments for FY2009, along with 10% of the state's Surface Transportation Program funding for FY2009. The metropolitan planning amount is determined based on a state's apportionment ratio under Title 23 Section 134 for FY2009. The remaining initial amount is divided among four core programs, with 58% going to the National Highway program. The remaining core programs receive apportionments as follows: 58% for the National Highway Performance Program (NHPP), 29.3% for the Transportation Mobility Program (TMP), 7% for the Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP), and 5.7% for the National Freight Program (NFP). States with privatized toll roads would have their apportionments adjusted based on privatized lane mileage and vehicle miles traveled on those highways. The apportionments for states with privatized toll roads would be adjusted based on lane mileage and vehicle miles traveled. This adjustment would reduce apportionments for Illinois, Indiana, and Colorado, while increasing apportionments for all other states. Apportionments for states with privatized toll roads would be adjusted based on lane mileage and vehicle miles traveled. Illinois, Indiana, and Colorado would see a decrease in apportionments, while all other states would see an increase. Concerns about equity in federal highway spending were historically addressed through programs like SAFETEA's Equity Bonus Program, but MAP-21 does not have a similar program. Instead, MAP-21 determines the initial amount for each state based on their share of total funding from FY2005-FY2009 to resolve the donor-donee issue upfront. The adjustment mechanism in MAP-21 aims to resolve the \"donor-donee\" issue upfront by ensuring all states receive a 95% rate of return on their payments to the HTF. If Congress does not provide sufficient funding, adjustments may be necessary. Some states may prefer using their state return on payments to determine the \"initial amount\" instead of the state share of total FY2005-FY2009 funding. SAFETEA included 6,372 earmarks valued at $24.3 billion, with 67% being \"below the line\" earmarks that did not bring additional money to states. The remaining 33% were \"above the line\" earmarks that increased funds flowing to states. The extension legislation increased states' shares of highway program funding, benefiting states that previously obtained above-the-line earmarks. MAP-21 eliminated project earmarks but still allocated funding based on states' past earmark success under SAFETEA. MAP-21 reduced the number of funding programs by two-thirds, absorbing their eligibilities into new core programs. The five core programs plus metropolitan transportation planning would be authorized at $39.143 billion, reflecting the unequal distribution of earmarks among Members of Congress and states under SAFETEA. The NHPP program, the largest within the restructured Federal-Aid Highway program, would receive $20.5 billion for FY2012 and $21 billion for FY2013 to improve the National Highway System. It combines three SAFETEA core programs to achieve national performance goals. The NHPP program, funded with $20.5 billion for FY2012 and $21 billion for FY2013, aims to improve infrastructure condition, safety, mobility, and freight movement. It includes projects for highways, bridges, tunnels, ferry facilities, bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure, traffic monitoring, intelligent transportation systems, and environmental restoration within NHS corridors. The NHPP program focuses on infrastructure improvement, safety, mobility, and freight movement. States must develop asset management plans with performance metrics. Funds may be transferred if bridge conditions fall below minimum standards. This program aims to enhance federal-aid highways and bridges. The Transportation Modernization Program (TMP) aims to improve federal-aid highways and bridges by replacing SAFETEA's Surface Transportation Program. It includes funding for transit, carpool programs, congestion pricing, and other transportation enhancement activities. The authorization for TMP is approximately $10.5 billion annually for FY2012 and FY2013. The Transportation Modernization Program (TMP) funds various projects such as recreational trails, ferry facilities, border infrastructure, scenic roads, truck parking, safe routes to school, and natural habitat conservation. It also covers improvements to freight railroads, marine highways, and intermodal facilities under certain conditions. Maintenance and improvement of public roads within 10 miles of international borders are also eligible for TMP funds. The Transportation Modernization Program (TMP) funds various projects including public roads within 10 miles of international borders where federally owned vehicles make up over 50% of traffic. States face penalties if deficient bridge deck area increases. TMP funds are sub-apportioned within states based on population distribution in urbanized areas, areas with populations over 5,000, and other areas. The Appalachian Development Highway System is also included. The Transportation Modernization Program (TMP) would give states more flexibility in determining spending on the Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS). The Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program (CMAQ) would be expanded under MAP-21, absorbing eligibilities of discontinued programs and receiving roughly $3.3 billion annually for FY2012 and FY2013. Eligibility for CMAQ funding would be expanded to include demand-shifting projects like telecommuting and ridesharing. The CMAQ program would be expanded to include demand-shifting projects like telecommuting and ridesharing. HSIP would continue to support safety improvement projects on road infrastructure. The High Risk Rural Roads Program and Rail-Highway Grade Crossing Program would be abolished. The NFP would be a new program. The NFP would be a new program funded at roughly $2 billion annually for FY2012 and FY2013, aimed at improving the condition and performance of a newly designated national freight network. MAP-21 would reduce the maximum percentage of funding that a state can transfer between programs from 50% to 20%, with restrictions on transferring TMP funding suballocated by population. H.R. 7 would consolidate or eliminate many programs, retaining core program structures while expanding the National Highway System Program and Surface Transportation Program. The Interstate Maintenance program would be folded into the NHS, and the Highway Safety Improvement Program would be retained. The 10% STP set-aside would remain. The 10% STP set-aside for Transportation Enhancements is eliminated in H.R. 7, which consolidates or eliminates many programs while retaining core program structures. The Interstate Maintenance program is folded into the National Highway System Program, and an additional $8 billion is provided for the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program. H.R. 7 would allocate $70.4 billion for FY2013-FY2016 to expand funding for the National Highway System program. This would help with maintenance and repair of the Interstate Highway system and bridges on the NHS. Only projects on the NHS would be eligible for funding, and states would need to participate in state asset management. H.R. 7 would authorize $42.4 billion for FY2013-FY2014 for the Surface Transportation Program (STP), broadening its purpose to include construction, inspection, rehabilitation, and replacement of bridges and tunnels. The bill would eliminate the requirement for 10% of STP funds to be set aside for transportation enhancement purposes. H.R. 7 would modify the allocation of STP funds, allowing up to 15% to be used on roads classified as minor collectors in areas with populations under 5,000. It would also reduce the percentage of funds required to be spent on urbanized areas with populations over 200,000 from 62.5% to 50%. States must consult with local or rural planning organizations before obligating funds for projects in population areas of 5,000 to 200,000. H.R. 7 would provide $10.4 billion for FY2013-FY2014 for HSIP, requiring states to have their own highway safety improvement programs and state safety plans to receive funds. Plans must set safety goals, identify projects, and evaluate progress annually. Federal cost share would remain at 90%. H.R. 7 would provide $8 billion over FY2013-FY2014 from the proposed alternative transportation account for CMAQ, amending the program to guarantee each state a minimum 94% return in core program apportionments. The total authorization is $15.6 billion over two years, limiting the amount for the guarantee to $3.9 billion per year. Under SAFETEA, the EB authorization was for \"such sums as necessary,\" with an estimated $40.9 billion needed in contract authority. If the $3.9 billion annual amount is insufficient to bring all states up to 94%, the STP authorization would be decreased. The Senate bill, Section 1107, clarifies eligibility criteria for ER funds for roads and bridges damaged by natural disasters or catastrophic failures. Roads already closed to traffic or scheduled for construction in the approved statewide transportation improvement plan at the time of the disaster would not be eligible for ER funds. The ER funds eligibility criteria for roads and bridges damaged by natural disasters or catastrophic failures are clarified under the Senate bill. The U.S. territories would not receive more than $20 million in a single fiscal year, and the $100 million ceiling on a single natural disaster or catastrophic failure in a single state would be eliminated. Section 1506 allows adjustments to the 180-day emergency period for federal government payment of repair costs. Additionally, 100% federal share may be allowed if repair costs exceed the annual state apportionment. The repair costs can exceed the annual state apportionment under H.R. 7, Section 1111. Reimbursement for debris removal is limited to costs not covered by the Stafford Act. U.S. territories are capped at $20 million per fiscal year for assistance. An emergency declaration is required for assistance, with states needing to provide a list of projects and costs within two days. The Senate bill proposes restructuring the Federal Lands Highways Programs to create the Federal Lands and Tribal Transportation Program, with three main components: Tribal Transportation Program, Federal Lands Transportation Program, and Federal Lands Access Program. MAP-21 suggests funding the Tribal Transportation Program at $450 million annually. The Senate bill proposes restructuring the Federal Lands Highways Programs to create the Federal Lands and Tribal Transportation Program. Funding for the Tribal Transportation Program would be $450 million annually, with a new formula for distributing funds among tribes based on road mileage and tribal population. The Federal Lands Access Program would allocate funding among states based on federal land, recreational visitors, federal roads, and federally owned bridges. H.R. 7 authorizes the Tribal Transportation Program at $465 million annually for FY2013-FY2016, and the Federal Lands Transportation program at $535 million. The Senate bill proposes combining the Puerto Rico and Territorial Highway programs, with funding set at $180 million annually for FY2012 and FY2013. Puerto Rico would receive a 75% set-aside, totaling $135 million annually, with specific program eligibilities outlined. H.R. 7 retains the Puerto Rico Highway Program and authorizes it at $150 million annually from the alternative transportation account for FY2013-FY2016. The Territorial Highway Program is also retained and authorized at $50 million annually for FY2013-FY2016. The Senate bill eliminates the ADHS as a freestanding program and incorporates its eligibilities into the new Transportation Mobility Program. Section 1530 would raise the federal share payable for the cost of constructing highways and access roads on the Appalachian Development Highway System to 95% under certain conditions. H.R. 7 would retain the Appalachian Development Highway System program at $470 million per year for FY2013-FY2016. States can use toll credits for matching share. Funds are apportioned based on cost estimates, with no state receiving less than 1% or more than 25%. The Senate bill provides $1 billion budget authority for FY2013 for a similar program. The discretionary program in H.R. 7 provides $1 billion for FY2013 to fund high-cost surface transportation infrastructure projects. The program aims to enhance national and regional economic benefits, increase global competitiveness, reduce congestion, improve energy security, freight and people movement, and transportation safety. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) is required to report on the selection process within three years of enactment. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) is mandated to report on the selection process for high-cost surface transportation infrastructure projects. H.R. 7 would repeal the SAFETEA PNRS provision, while the Senate bill would establish a general fund program for Ferries and Ferry Terminal Facilities with funding distribution based on passenger and vehicle metrics. The proposed legislation, MAP-21, allocates $67 million annually for ferry systems based on vehicle and route metrics. Ferry boats and facilities are eligible for funding under the National Highway Performance Program. H.R. 7 would modify the existing Ferry Boat and Ferry Terminal Facilities Program. The proposed legislation, H.R. 7, allocates $67 million annually for ferry systems based on vehicle and route metrics. The program would be funded through the Alternative Transportation Account for FY2013-FY2016. Distribution of funds would be based on vehicle and passenger metrics, as well as nautical route miles serviced by ferry systems. H.R. 7 proposes funding ferry systems with $67 million annually based on vehicle and route metrics. Ferry boats and facilities on the National Highway System would be eligible for formula funds. The Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act provides federal credit assistance for large transportation projects. MAP-21 proposes significant changes to the TIFIA program, including authorizing $1 billion annually from the highway trust fund for administrative and subsidy costs. This would allow for loans totaling $9.9 billion per year, with administrative costs capped at 1%. MAP-21 proposes significant changes to the TIFIA program, including increasing the share of project costs TIFIA may provide and allowing credit assistance for a program of projects secured by a common security pledge through a \"master credit agreement.\" This change is sought by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority to accelerate the financing of 12 transit projects. MAP-21 proposes changes to the TIFIA program, including a lower threshold of $25 million for rural infrastructure projects. Rural projects would receive loans at half the Treasury rate compared to urban projects. The TIFIA program under MAP-21 proposes changes for rural projects, offering loans at half the Treasury rate. Evaluation criteria for projects seeking assistance would be abolished, with funds allocated on a first-come, first-served basis. Project sponsors can enter into a master credit agreement or pay their own credit subsidy from federal surface transportation apportionments. H.R. 7 authorizes $1 billion annually for TIFIA from the highway trust fund, with funds available for administrative and subsidy costs. The bill also establishes master credit agreements for credit assistance and eliminates evaluation criteria, providing assistance on a first-come, first-served basis. Administrative costs are capped at $3.250 million. H.R. 7 proposes changes to TIFIA assistance criteria, including thresholds for non-ITS, ITS, and rural projects, as well as a $1 billion threshold for master credit agreements. It also increases federal assistance to 49% and authorizes $750 million annually for state infrastructure banks. Each state can use federal transportation funds to establish a state infrastructure bank. SAFETEA does not have a separate federal freight transportation program, instead, it includes various freight-related programs within the larger surface transportation program. Most freight-related funding is provided to states through regular highway programs like the Surface Transportation Program (STP). SAFETEA allocates minor funding for freight transportation improvements, allowing state DOTs and metropolitan planning organizations to prioritize projects. The federal government is considering creating a new dedicated funding program for freight transport, with the Senate bill (MAP-21) proposing this initiative. The House bill (H.R. 7) does not include a similar program but contains provisions that impact freight transport. Both bills require the U.S. Department of Transportation to develop a national freight plan. The U.S. Department of Transportation is mandated to create a national freight transport plan in collaboration with stakeholders. Both Senate and House bills aim to boost private-sector involvement in financing transportation projects, potentially benefiting freight carriers and shippers. MAP-21 introduces a core program to allocate funds to critical infrastructure segments for freight movement. The U.S. Department of Transportation plans to designate a \"primary freight network\" (PFN) of 27,000 centerline miles of existing roadways based on freight volume. States must prioritize spending on the PFN before other freight-related infrastructure, with the option to add 3,000 more miles based on future importance. States can designate \"critical rural freight corridors\" based on truck traffic density connecting the PFN or Interstate System with busy freight terminals. They can allocate up to 20% of their freight program funds to these roads. The designated critical rural freight corridors, non-PFN Interstate System portions, and the PFN form the \"national freight network (NFM).\" States can use freight program funds on non-Interstate highways or transit systems. States can spend freight program funds on non-Interstate highways or transit system projects to improve freight flows on nearby or parallel interstate highways more cost-effectively. They can also allocate up to 10% of funds for freight rail or maritime projects if approved by the Secretary of Transportation. This creates a specific funding program for freight movement and requires states to develop plans. The creation of a specific funding program for freight movement, along with the requirement for states to develop performance measures, will enhance the consideration of freight needs in project selection. A designated Primary Freight Network (PFN) of approximately 30,000 miles of highway would focus funds on critical segments for freight movement. The Department of Transportation (DOT) estimates that on congested highway segments, trucks have to travel below the speed limit during rush hours, particularly at urban interchanges. This freight program would utilize apportioned funds. The freight program under MAP-21 focuses on critical segments for freight movement, particularly at urban interchanges. States may be hesitant to address costly bottlenecks that primarily benefit trucks. Funding for these projects may be better suited under programs like TIFIA, PNRS, and CMAQ. The Senate bill requires a study on possible changes to truck size and weight limits. The House bill concentrates funding for freight transport by reducing funding for non-shippers' programs. The House bill focuses on funding for freight transport by reducing funding for non-shippers' programs. It seeks to increase reliance on tolling for highway construction, which is opposed by trucking organizations preferring fuel tax increases. The bill also proposed increasing federal truck weight limits from 80,000 to 97,000 pounds with an additional axle, but this was not approved. The Transportation and Infrastructure Committee did not approve the addition of a sixth axle, instead calling for a DOT study. H.R. 7 includes provisions for increasing the permitted lengths of double trailers, truckload carrier trailers, and auto transporters. The bill also proposes a pilot program allowing certain states to increase truck weights on Interstate Highway segments. MAP-21 proposes changes to transportation planning requirements at national, state, and local levels, including the use of performance management throughout the planning process. The bill also mentions a pilot program for increased truck weights on certain Interstate Highway segments, with participants like coal transport in West Virginia and timber trucking in Minnesota. Additionally, there is a weight exemption increase for idle reduction equipment. For freight provisions related to rail and maritime modes, refer to the \"Rail Provisions\" and \"Harbor Maintenance Expenditures\" sections of the report. MAP-21 proposes changes to transportation planning requirements at national, state, and local levels, emphasizing the use of performance management. State and metropolitan planning would include performance measures and targets, with consequences for not meeting targets being mild. The bill also introduces a National Freight Program, requiring the development of a national freight strategic plan. The new National Freight Program under MAP-21 mandates the development of a national freight strategic plan by the Department of Transportation, including establishing performance measures for freight movement on the primary network. States must set performance targets for freight movement to receive funding, and failure to meet targets requires submission of a performance improvement plan to the Secretary of Transportation. The Transportation and Freight Policy Act includes provisions for a national surface transportation and freight policy and strategic plan. Some provisions repeat or conflict with those in other sections. For example, there are goals to reduce traffic fatalities and serious injuries, but also conflicting targets for reducing motor vehicle-related fatalities by 50% by 2030. The Transportation and Freight Policy Act includes conflicting provisions for reducing motor vehicle-related and truck-related fatalities by 50% by 2030. Section 1115 calls for a national strategic freight plan within three years, while Section 33003 calls for a national surface transportation and freight performance plan within two years. States must develop risk-based asset management plans with performance targets and investment strategies under the National Highway Performance Program. States failing to meet targets must submit action plans. The Transportation and Freight Policy Act requires states to develop risk-based asset management plans with performance targets. States failing to meet targets must submit action plans to improve the condition of Interstates and NHS bridges. MAP-21 also mandates states to redirect federal apportionments if minimum standards for pavement and bridge conditions are not met. MAP-21 introduces changes to statewide transportation planning, requiring incorporation of metropolitan and nonmetropolitan transportation plans. States must now develop plans in cooperation with nonmetropolitan areas, with a focus on a performance-based approach. Performance measures and targets need to be coordinated with other planning efforts. MAP-21 proposes creating two tiers of MPOs based on population size, with Tier I for areas with 1 million or more people and Tier II for areas with less than 1 million. These MPOs would have to meet minimum technical requirements related to modeling, data, staffing, and other planning elements. The Secretary would establish these requirements within one year of enactment. MAP-21 establishes two tiers of MPOs based on population size, with Tier I for areas with 1 million or more people and Tier II for areas with less than 1 million. Tier I MPOs will require performance-based planning and targets, while Tier II requirements will be more discretionary. Both tiers can select projects from their TIPs in consultation with states and facility owners. Optional blueprint planning and performance measures are also included in MAP-21. MAP-21 proposes to designate MPOs only in urbanized areas with a population of 200,000 or more, up from the current requirement of 50,000. MPOs in areas below 200,000 could be designated by agreement between the governor and local officials, but must meet minimum technical requirements set by the Secretary. Existing MPOs in areas under 200,000 population will be terminated three years after regulations are promulgated for Tier II MPOs, unless reaffirmed by the MPO, governor, and approved by the Secretary. H.R. 7, like MAP-21, aims to consolidate metropolitan planning under a single MPO in each urban region, but allows for multiple MPOs if deemed appropriate. It includes provisions for national transportation planning, performance measurement, and the development of a national strategic transportation plan by DOT. The national plan under H.R. 7 requires states to submit projects of national and regional significance, with cost estimates, to be updated every two years. It also mandates the development of a national performance management system to track progress towards national performance goals for highway and public transportation systems, including state reporting on performance targets. H.R. 7 mandates states to report annually on progress towards meeting performance targets in transportation planning. It requires identification of projects of national, regional, and statewide significance, including measures to address congestion at airports, freight rail corridors, ports, and inland waterways. Planning must also consider the role of intercity buses in reducing congestion, pollution, and energy consumption, and ways to maintain and improve the intercity bus system. H.R. 7 aims to enhance the intercity bus system by involving regional transportation planning organizations in project selection and increasing the urbanized population threshold for MPO designation. It also requires consideration of intercity buses in metropolitan planning processes. Budgetary pressures have increased concern about using resources for transportation projects effectively. The federal government's role in project delivery and expediting the environmental review process for highway and transit projects are key focus areas in both House and Senate proposals. The process for highway and transit projects involves activities from planning to design, focusing on identifying and addressing project-related impacts on the environment, considering various factors like economic benefits, and ensuring compliance with state, tribal, and federal requirements. Various environmental requirements may apply to transportation projects, such as obtaining permits, mitigating effects on historic sites, and avoiding adverse impacts on parks or wildlife refuges. Documentation, analysis, and review are necessary for all federal-aid highway or transit projects. Under NEPA, federal agencies must assess environmental impacts before approving highway or transit projects. DOT policy requires coordination of all environmental investigations and compliance with applicable requirements in the NEPA document. Compliance process ensures distinction between NEPA requirements and other environmental obligations. The compliance process under NEPA requires distinguishing between NEPA requirements and other environmental obligations. Recent legislative efforts aim to expedite environmental reviews by focusing on NEPA compliance for major transportation projects. The House proposal and MAP-21 focus on expediting highway and transit project delivery by changing environmental compliance requirements. The proposed changes may either accelerate environmental reviews and project delivery or slow them down by removing coordination mechanisms or adding requirements. The environment-related provisions in MAP-21 apply to activities associated with the environmental review phase of transportation project development, where compliance with state, tribal, and federal environmental requirements, including NEPA, is documented before project construction can proceed. Input or cooperation from federal, state, or tribal agencies may be necessary. Before project construction can proceed, FHWA or FTA must ensure the completion of the environmental review process, which includes an environmental impact statement if the project may significantly affect the environment. If the environmental impacts are unclear, an environmental assessment (EA) is prepared. Projects with no significant environmental impacts are categorically excluded from preparing an EIS or EA, known as categorical exclusions (CEs). DOT's NEPA regulations list two groups of actions generally considered CEs. The NEPA regulations categorize actions as CEs that may not require additional DOT approval and those that can be processed as CEs with proper documentation. Around 90% of FHWA-approved highway projects annually are CEs, while 6% require an EA. Projects deemed to have no significant environmental impact under NEPA may still need to comply with other environmental laws. MAP-21 introduces significant changes to the environmental review process, particularly under Section 1313, \"Accelerated.\" Under Section 1313 of MAP-21, new requirements for issue resolution in the environmental review process would ensure timely project deadlines and dispute resolution. Financial transfer provisions would apply to agencies failing to issue or deny approvals. Financial transfer provisions would require an agency to transfer $10,000 or $20,000 weekly if there is a delay in issuing permits or approvals, as mandated by federal law. The transfer would be triggered after 180 days of a complete application or final project decision, pursuant to NEPA, unless the delay is not the agency's fault. Agencies responsible for issuing approvals or permits for DOT projects vary and may include EPA, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, or U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Under-staffing or lack of funds in these agencies can cause delays in issuing necessary approvals or permits for various regulated activities. The need to redirect limited agency funds to expedite transportation project approvals can unintentionally slow down other applications. MAP-21 requires DOT to compare completion times of environmental assessments initiated before and after 2005, as well as before and after the enactment of MAP-21. The DOT is required to compare completion times of environmental assessments initiated before and after MAP-21's enactment. Reporting to Congress is mandated within one year, with no specific funding authorized for assessments. Tracking the time to complete NEPA documents, especially for EIS, is challenging due to limited data availability for projects processed with EAs or CEs. State DOTs generally do not track the NEPA process completion time. The NEPA process completion time is challenging to track, and accurate information may not be readily available. Congress may require states to start tracking this information and report it to the DOT, as an addition to the existing environmental clearance process. MAP-21 provisions related to CEs involve directives to change existing regulatory requirements for such projects. The curr_chunk discusses directives to DOT to change existing regulatory requirements for categorical exclusions (CEs) by adding new projects suggested by state agencies and moving specific projects from requiring documentation and approval to not needing additional DOT approval. The curr_chunk discusses provisions related to DOT agency roles in NEPA compliance for multimodal projects and criteria for designating projects as categorical exclusions within existing highway right-of-way. It also mentions continuing or amending environment-related programs established under SAFETEA, including assistance to affected state and federal agencies. The curr_chunk discusses provisions for a federal agency supporting transportation project planning and delivery. It includes requirements for a memorandum of understanding between the agency and state for project priorities and allowing states to use funds for attorneys' fees. It also mentions making the Surface Transportation Project Delivery Program permanent. The curr_chunk discusses making the Surface Transportation Project Delivery Program permanent, allowing any state to participate in assuming federal responsibilities for environmental reviews required under NEPA. Additional environment-specific provisions under MAP-21's Subtitle C reinforce the importance of certain activities and clarify existing requirements for NEPA compliance. The House bill includes provisions under Title III and Subtitle C that would extensively change NEPA requirements for federal highway and transit projects, excluding projects costing less than $10 million from NEPA compliance. H.R. 7 would modify NEPA requirements for highway and transit projects, exempting those under $10 million or with federal funding below 15%. Changes include altering project alternatives, document formats, analysis, and evaluation levels. It also sets timeframes for permits, a 270-day deadline for environmental reviews, and limits on project impacts. The House proposal in H.R. 4348 includes a 270-day deadline for environmental review processes and amends requirements for parks, wildlife refuges, and historic sites. The Senate has substituted MAP-21 language for H.R. 4348 and called for a conference with the House. The inclusion of H.R. 7 streamlining provisions in H.R. 4348 ensures environmental streamlining. The House-passed H.R. 4348 includes H.R. 7 streamlining provisions to prevent challenges on scope differences. MAP-21 aims to speed project delivery by allowing state DOTs to use CM/GC contracts. These contracts combine traditional design-bid-build and design-build methods. H.R. 7 and MAP-21 aim to streamline project delivery by allowing state DOTs to use CM/GC contracts, combining traditional design-bid-build and design-build methods. The CM/GC contract involves a single contractor responsible for design and construction, accelerating project delivery. MAP-21 increases federal funding share by 5% for highway projects using innovative delivery methods. Examples include prefabricated bridge elements and design-build contracts. The MAP-21 legislation increases federal funding for highway projects using innovative delivery methods, such as design-build contracts. It also includes a pilot program for advance payment of moving costs for those affected by highway projects, with H.R. 7 having a similar provision without state limitations. The MAP-21 legislation includes provisions for innovative delivery methods in highway projects and a pilot program for advance payment of moving costs. State transportation officials have suggested changes to property acquisition and relocation laws under Section 1113 of MAP-21. The CMAQ program aims to reduce transportation-related pollutants to meet air quality standards. The Clean Air Act directs the EPA to set air quality standards for pollutants like ozone, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter. Areas that meet or exceed these standards are in \"attainment,\" while those that do not are in \"nonattainment.\" \"Maintenance\" areas were previously in nonattainment but are now meeting the standards. The CMAQ program provides funds for projects in nonattainment and maintenance areas. Proposed amendments would change how funding levels are established and distributed within states, while program goals and eligibility criteria remain largely unchanged since the early 1990s. The CMAQ program funding levels are apportioned to each state based on population and pollution levels. The apportionment for FYs 2012 and 2013 would be tied to previous funding amounts plus a percentage of STP funds. Funds within each state are distributed based on established limitations and suballocations. The CMAQ program funds are apportioned to each state based on population and pollution levels. States must reserve 10% of previously-apportioned STP funds for specific transportation projects. The remaining CMAQ funds are suballocated within each state for various transportation enhancements. Half of the remaining CMAQ funds are suballocated for projects in nonattainment or maintenance areas, with distribution based on a state-developed formula approved by DOT. The formula considers population, pollution severity, and requires 50% of funds to be obligated for fine particulate areas. Additionally, 30% of funds must be used for low-emissions construction equipment and vehicles. The CMAQ funds allocated to states can be used for eligible projects in nonattainment or maintenance areas. Proposed provisions in MAP-21 may change how the program is implemented, including prioritizing projects that reduce fine particulate pollution in certain areas. Proposed changes in MAP-21 would direct MPOs to prioritize CMAQ funds for projects reducing pollutants like diesel emissions. DOT and EPA would develop a cost-effectiveness table for projects, to be considered by states and MPOs in performance plans. Optional programmatic eligibility would allow MPOs to conduct technical assessments for emissions reductions, demonstrating project eligibility for CMAQ funding. The House bill includes provisions amending project eligibility requirements for CMAQ-funded projects, with incentives for alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles such as tax credits for plug-in vehicles and biofuels from cellulose. The House bill includes incentives for alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles, such as tax credits for plug-in vehicles and biofuels from cellulose. Non-tax incentives include credits under the CAFE program for automakers producing alternative fuel vehicles. Various highway programs also provide non-tax incentives, such as allowing low-emission vehicles to use HOV lanes. H.R. 7 and MAP-21 propose extending states' authority to exempt alternative fuel vehicles from HOV lane restrictions, but with limitations if the lanes become degraded. The bills aim to address degradation issues and support the expansion of electric vehicle infrastructure. H.R. 7 and MAP-21 support the expansion of electric vehicle infrastructure by allowing highway funds to be used for new charging stations and amending the Clean Fuels Grant Program to include grants for clean fuel buses and facilities, including zero emission buses. MAP-21 includes provisions for \"zero emission buses\" that do not emit carbon or particulate matter, unlike H.R. 7. The Senate's public transit provisions in MAP-21 authorize $10.458 billion annually for federal transit programs, with funding from the mass transit account of the highway trust fund and the general fund. H.R. 7 would rename the mass transit account of the highway trust fund as the alternative transportation account and authorize $10.458 billion for FY2012 and $10.498 billion annually for FY2013 through FY2016. It eliminates the use of motor fuel taxes for mass transit and transfers revenue to the highway account. $40 billion from the general fund would be transferred to the alternative transportation account. The Federal Transit Program in MAP-21 includes restructuring with the creation of a State of Good Repair Grant Program to replace the Fixed Guideway Modernization Program. This new program has four components, including the High Intensity Fixed Guideway SGR Formula Program for maintenance, repair, and replacement of fixed guideway public transit systems. Funding for this program would come from the mass transportation account. The State of Good Repair Grant Program in the Federal Transit Program under MAP-21 includes the Fixed Guideway SGR Grant Program for competitive grants to maintain fixed guideway systems. Funding for this program comes from the general fund and a new formula based on vehicle miles and route miles. The High Intensity Motorbus SGR program distributes funds by formula for public transportation on facilities at least seven years old with access for high-occupancy vehicles. Funding for this program comes from the mass transit account. The Bus and Bus Facilities SGR program under the Federal Transit Program would distribute competitive grants for bus upkeep using a formula based on fixed-guideway motor bus vehicle miles and route miles. Funding of $75 million for this program would be allocated from the New Starts program. Additionally, the FPTA would eliminate the heavily earmarked discretionary Bus and Bus-Related Facilities program, with some of its funding potentially being added to other formula programs like the Urbanized Area and Non-Urbanized Area Formula programs. The Formula Grants for Elderly Individuals and Individuals with Disabilities Program and the New Freedom Program would be combined into a single program called Formula Grants for Enhanced Mobility of Seniors and Individuals with Disabilities. The Jobs Access and Reverse Commute program would be integrated into the Urbanized and Non-Urbanized Area Formula programs. The Access to Jobs program would require recipients to allocate at least 3% of their Urbanized Area apportionments to projects benefiting low-income individuals' job travel. The Senate bill includes new programs for low-income job travel, such as the Appalachian Development Public Transportation Assistance Program and the Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program for disaster funding. The House bill (H.R. 7) authorizes funds for a new transit program, doubling the amount set aside for Indian reservations to $30 million annually. It eliminates some programs but largely maintains the current federal transit structure. The House bill (H.R. 7) proposes changes to transit funding, including combining multiple programs into one and distributing funding for the Bus and Bus-Related Facilities Program by formula. Funding would be directed to bus transit providers in urbanized areas without heavy rail, commuter rail, or light rail services. H.R. 7 proposes changes to transit funding, including incentivizing bus service contracting and allowing private operators access to federally funded facilities. The Senate bill would make changes to the New Starts program, allowing funds for investments in existing fixed guideway systems to increase capacity and functionality. The bill, H.R. 7, proposes changes to transit funding by incentivizing bus service contracting and allowing private operators access to federally funded facilities. It also authorizes core capacity improvement projects and simplifies the New Starts process by reducing major stages to project development, engineering, and construction. Eliminating the separate alternatives analysis is also a key feature of the bill. The bill, H.R. 7, proposes changes to transit funding by incentivizing bus service contracting and allowing private operators access to federally funded facilities. It also authorizes core capacity improvement projects and simplifies the New Starts process by reducing major stages to project development, engineering, and construction. The bill would eliminate the separate alternatives analysis required by law in NEPA, streamlining the project development process. The project, as the locally preferred alternative, is adopted into the metropolitan plan and justified on its merits. Successful projects can enter into a full funding grant agreement with the Secretary for federal funding assistance and move into the construction phase. The Senate bill aims to expedite projects with special warrants for those with federal shares of $100 million or less. However, it would eliminate the Small Starts program for projects requesting $75 million or less in federal assistance. Additionally, the bill would create a pilot program. The House bill (H.R. 7) proposes a pilot program for expedited project delivery for certain fixed guideway capital projects and core capacity improvement projects costing $250 million or less. It also maintains the distinction between New Starts and Small Starts projects, allocating $150 million for Small Starts projects. H.R. 7 proposes changes to project evaluation criteria, including eliminating alternatives analysis and adjusting project justification factors. It includes provisions for expediting projects, such as using special warrants for certain projects like urban circulator service. The bill also emphasizes private contributions and intermodal connectivity as evaluation factors. H.R. 7 proposes changes to project evaluation criteria, including emphasizing private contributions and intermodal connectivity. It allows small bus transit systems in urbanized areas of 200,000 or more people to use a percentage of their Urbanized Area apportionments for operating expenses. The House bill (H.R. 7) proposes allowing transit bus systems in urbanized areas with high unemployment rates to use a percentage of their Urbanized Area apportionments for operating expenses for up to three years. H.R. 7 allows transit bus systems in urbanized areas with 200,000 or more people to use federal funding for operating expenses based on the number of buses operated, with varying cost shares. It also increases the share of funds for Americans with Disabilities Act paratransit services. The Senate and House bills propose increasing formula funds for Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) paratransit from 10% to 15%, which can be used for capital and operating expenses. They also include provisions for passenger and freight rail, calling for the development of a national rail plan to guide future investments and regional rail plans to refine the national plan for each region. The bill proposes creating regional rail plans with maps of rail alignments and station stops, as well as state rail plans. It also amends the NEC advisory commission and requires Amtrak to submit a new plan for high-speed service. Additionally, the bill mandates DOT to develop guidance on measuring train delays within one year of enactment. The bill requires DOT to develop guidance on measuring train delays within one year of enactment, conduct a data needs assessment for intercity passenger rail, survey track access arrangements, and promote the development of standardized cars for corridor intercity passenger services. The bill aims to create a corporate entity controlled by Amtrak and states to manage standardized cars for corridor passenger service. It would also amend the capital grant program to include Amtrak as an eligible recipient. The equipment pool seeks to achieve economies of scale but may hinder innovation in car design. Positive train control implementation could impact domestic car design. The Federal Railroad Administration regulations require U.S. passenger cars to limit collision damage, making them heavier than foreign cars. Positive train control implementation may align U.S. requirements with foreign ones, potentially opening a global market for passenger car equipment. H.R. 7 would repeal the congestion grant program. H.R. 7 would repeal the congestion grant program, reduce funding for Amtrak's operating assistance grants, and amend laws related to food and car equipment. Congress did not provide funding for the congestion grant program in FY2011 or FY2012. H.R. 7 would amend laws related to food and beverage service on Amtrak trains, repealing the self-supporting requirement and putting the provision of service out to competitive bidding. Section 36401 of H.R. 7 would amend a federal grant program to include the relocation of roads in addition to rail lines. Section 36408 would expand the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing Program to accept state or local subsidies as collateral. The Senate bill proposes changes to laws governing the Surface Transportation Board (STB), raising the ceiling on maximum total dollar value of freight charges that shippers can bring before the STB. The bill proposes changes to the Surface Transportation Board (STB), including raising the maximum total dollar value of freight charges that shippers can bring before the STB. It also imposes shorter procedural deadlines for rate relief cases and requires the STB to study incorporating railroad asset replacement costs in its annual examination of revenue adequacy. Additionally, the bill mandates the compilation and reporting of railroad service complaints on the STB's website and a review of the agency's staffing needs. The bill includes provisions to facilitate access to the RRIF loan program for class II and III freight railroads. Congress mandated positive train control (PTC) in 2008 following accidents involving toxic chemicals and collisions. PTC relies on radio signaling to prevent human error in train control. Railroads have raised objections to PTC implementation. The Senate bill allows for an extension of the deadline for implementing Positive Train Control (PTC) technology beyond December 31, 2015, if deemed infeasible. It also makes PTC implementation eligible for RRIF funding and requires a joint study on spectrum needs for PTC. The House bill (H.R. 7) would also extend the deadline. The House bill (H.R. 7) would extend the deadline for implementing Positive Train Control (PTC) to 2021 for routes with passenger traffic and eliminate the deadline for routes carrying certain toxic chemicals. It allows railroads to implement equivalent safety measures and adjust installation routes. The Senate bill retains existing NHTSA grant programs and creates an incentive grant program to discourage texting while driving and cell phone use by drivers under 18. The House bill (H.R. 7) proposes making texting while driving and cell phone use by drivers under 18 primary traffic offenses. It also aims to increase civil penalties for vehicle safety violations and require event data recorders in passenger vehicles starting from 2015. Additionally, it consolidates various NHTSA grant programs into one general highway safety grant program. The House bill (H.R. 7) aims to consolidate NHTSA grant programs into one general highway safety grant program at a reduced funding level. It prohibits federal funding for measuring motorcycle helmet usage and creating motorcyclist checkpoints. The Senate bill authorizes higher highway safety grants for FY2012 and FY2013. Both bills establish a clearinghouse for drug and alcohol test results for commercial drivers and strengthen DOT's actions against \"reincarnated carriers.\" The two bills provide similar levels of funding for truck safety grants to states in FY2013. Currently, DOT is prohibited from setting standards for transit agency operations, despite questions about state oversight of transit safety after fatal incidents in 2009 and 2010. The transit safety section in MAP-21 is similar to previous proposals. The Public Transportation Safety Act of 2010 (S. 3638) authorizes DOT to establish safety standards for rail transit systems, create a safety certification program, and ensure state safety oversight agencies are financially independent. H.R. 7 would authorize grants to states for transit safety oversight, without allowing DOT to set safety standards. It would require federal grant funds to be spent on safety and state of good repair projects first, and direct DOT to certify state safety oversight organizations. Financial assistance of $4.6 million annually would be provided. Both MAP-21 and H.R. 7 would authorize funding for transportation research and education, with MAP-21 allocating $400 million annually and H.R. 7 allocating $440 million annually. Both bills include provisions for technology deployment programs and prize competitions to promote transportation innovations. Additionally, both bills direct the Department of Transportation to conduct studies on various aspects of transportation improvement. Both MAP-21 and H.R. 7 authorize grants for transportation research at university centers. They also emphasize the need to fully utilize the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund for infrastructure maintenance. Congress currently only appropriates half of the collected cargo tax for this purpose. House-passed H.R. 4348 includes language that would require the total level of budgetary resources provided for a fiscal year to equal the receipts credited to the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, restricting the use of such amounts to harbor maintenance programs."
