It is illegal to drive with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08% or higher.

It is also unlawful for a person addicted to drugs to drive, except for those in approved narcotic treatment programs. It is illegal to drive a commercial motor vehicle with 0.04% or more alcohol in the blood, with a rebuttable presumption if a chemical test within three hours after driving shows the same alcohol level.

A passenger for hire is defined as someone who pays or is expected to pay for the ride. In a prosecution, it is assumed the person had 0.04% or more alcohol in their blood while driving if proven by a chemical test within three hours after driving.
