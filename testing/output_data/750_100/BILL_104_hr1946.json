    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act of 1995\". Congress recognizes the fundamental right of parents to direct the upbringing of their children, as established in Supreme Court cases. The role of parents in raising their children is highly valued and should be protected by all levels of government. The tradition of western civilization recognizes parents' responsibility to love, nurture, train, and protect their children. Some courts have not treated parental rights as fundamental, leading to improper judicial review. Parents face increasing government intrusions into their decisions and prerogatives. The Act aims to protect parents' right to raise their children and emphasizes that governments should not interfere without compelling reasons. The traditional court process effectively balances the interests of parents, children, and government. The Act emphasizes the fundamental right of parents to raise their children and protect them from abuse and neglect. It also acknowledges that parents have the responsibility to ensure their children are educated for literacy and self-sufficiency. The Act emphasizes parental rights in healthcare decisions for children, with a standard of judicial review and a 4-step evaluation process for cases involving parental rights. The Act establishes a process for parents to demonstrate government interference with their right to direct the upbringing of a child, shifting the burden of proof to the government to show the interference is necessary for a compelling reason. The Act requires government intervention to be essential for a compelling interest and to use the least restrictive means. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
