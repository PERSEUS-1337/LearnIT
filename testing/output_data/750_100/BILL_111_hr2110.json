    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Mobile Workforce State Income Tax Fairness and Simplification Act\" and it limits state withholding and taxation of employee income. The \"Mobile Workforce State Income Tax Fairness and Simplification Act\" limits state income tax to the employee's residence state and the state where they work for more than 30 days in a calendar year. Wages earned are only subject to state income tax withholding and reporting if the employee meets the criteria outlined in the Act. Income tax withholding and reporting under subsection (a)(2) applies to wages earned as of the commencement date of duties in the State during the calendar year. Employers can rely on an employee's time estimate for work in different states unless there is fraud or collusion. The employer and employee colluding to evade tax is prohibited. Employers can rely on employee's location determination for tax purposes unless they maintain a time and attendance system tracking the employee's daily duties. The Act defines how an employee's presence and performance of duties within a state are determined. If an employee performs duties in both a resident and nonresident state on the same day, they are considered to have worked in both states. The term \"employee\" is defined by the state where duties are performed, excluding professional athletes, entertainers, and certain public figures. Transit time does not count towards determining an employee's location for work purposes. The term \"professional athlete\" refers to someone who is paid for participating in professional athletic events, while \"professional entertainer\" refers to someone who is paid for performing in the professional performing arts. The term \"certain public figures\" refers to prominent individuals who are paid for services provided at discrete events, such as speeches or personal appearances, on a per-event basis. The term \"employer\" is defined as per section 3401(d) of the Internal Revenue Code. The term \"time and attendance system\" is defined as a system where employees record their work location for days worked outside their primary state, with data used by employers to allocate wages for tax purposes. The term \"State\" refers to each of the several states in the United States. The term \"wages or other remuneration\" is defined by the State where the employment duties are performed for tax purposes. The Act will be effective on January 1, 2011."
