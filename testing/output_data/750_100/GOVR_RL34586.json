    "content": "This report focuses on USAID's global health programs for child survival and maternal health from FY2001 to FY2008. It discusses how advancements in addressing malaria can improve maternal and child survival. UNICEF's report in 2008 celebrated the decline in annual deaths among children under five. In 2006, an estimated 9.7 million children under age five died, showing a 60% decrease in mortality since 1960. Despite this improvement, around 26,000 children still die daily, with most deaths occurring in developing countries, particularly in Africa. Neonatal infections are responsible for nearly 90% of all child deaths. Nearly 90% of child deaths in Africa are caused by neonatal infections and five infectious diseases. Undernutrition is a major factor in up to half of these deaths. Maternal and child health are crucial indicators of overall health conditions, with Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5 focusing on improvements in child and maternal health. The ability to reach MDGs 4 and 5, which call for a two-thirds reduction in child and maternal mortality, is affected by progress in other MDGs. Countries with undernourished populations and lack of clean water tend to have higher maternal and child mortality rates. UNICEF found that 62 countries were making no progress towards the Millennium Development Goal on child survival, with nearly 75% of these in Africa. UNICEF reports that child survival and maternal health are closely linked, with over 500,000 women dying annually from pregnancy-related causes. Access to adequate diets could prevent these deaths, especially in developing countries where maternal mortality rates are significantly higher. Maternal deaths in developing countries could be prevented with access to adequate diets, safe water, sanitation, literacy, and health services during pregnancy. UNICEF estimates that 20% of maternal deaths are due to undernutrition, while 75% are caused by obstetric complications like hemorrhage, sepsis, and unsafe abortions. Young mothers under 20 are at higher risk due to complications such as toxemia, anemia, and prolonged labor. Pregnancy-related complications, including anemia, premature delivery, prolonged labor, and cervical trauma, pose a significant risk to young mothers under 20. Adolescents aged 15-19 are at a higher risk of maternal mortality and delivering low birth weight babies. The United Nations estimates that 15 million infants are born to adolescents annually, with girls aged 15-19 being twice as likely to die from childbirth compared to women in their twenties. Girls younger than 15 are five times as likely to die. In Mali, the maternal mortality rate for girls aged 15-19 is 178 per 100,000 live births, compared to 32 per 100,000 for women aged 20-34. The maternal mortality rate for girls aged 15-19 is 178 per 100,000 live births in Mali, compared to 32 per 100,000 for women aged 20-34. Hemorrhage is a significant cause of maternal deaths in Africa and Asia, with regions lacking skilled health attendants at birth having higher mortality rates. In sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, maternal mortality rates are high due to lack of skilled birth attendants. UNICEF reports that many countries lack the capacity to reduce maternal mortality, with 80% of priority countries having insufficient health workforce densities. In sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, maternal mortality rates are high due to a lack of skilled birth attendants. South Africa and Swaziland have reached the minimum standard of health workers per 1,000 people, improving health conditions and reaching health-related MDGs. Child and maternal survival rates are higher in areas with ample health workers, clean water, controlled mosquito populations, and access to nutritious food. Sub-Saharan Africa has the greatest proportional shortage of health care workers in the world. Africa faces the greatest shortage of health care workers globally, with 36 out of 57 countries in the region experiencing critical deficits. The World Health Organization estimates that an additional 4.3 million health workers are needed worldwide, with African countries needing to increase their health workforce by 140% to meet the minimum threshold of 2.5 health care professionals per 1,000 people. USAID plays a key role in improving child survival globally through research support. USAID has committed over $6 billion in the past 20 years to support global child survival efforts, with a significant portion allocated to addressing six major health problems that cause 90% of child deaths in developing countries. USAID allocates a significant proportion of its child survival funds to address health issues, with a focus on improving child and maternal health. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization states that many children die each year due to weakened immune systems from hunger and malnutrition. WHO-supported studies show that underweight children are more likely to die from infectious diseases. Children who are moderately to severely underweight are at a higher risk of death, with a five to eight times increased risk compared to well-nourished children. Malnourishment is linked to 45% of deaths from measles and over 60% of deaths from severe diarrhea in children. Good nutrition improves child survival, health, and cognitive development, while undernutrition weakens the immune system, making children more susceptible to diseases like diarrhea, pneumonia, measles, malaria, and tuberculosis. USAID's nutrition programs focus on micronutrient supplementation and fortification, including adding vital immune-building micronutrients like zinc, vitamin A, iron, and iodine to processed foods. Funds are also used for research on biofortified crops to enhance the micronutrient content of basic foods. USAID integrates micronutrient supplementation and nutrition programs with interventions like safe water and sanitation. Poor feeding practices in the first two years of life contribute to malnutrition-related infant and child deaths. Less than one third of infants are exclusively breastfed for the first six months, leading to disease risks from early introduction of inadequate and unsafe foods. \"USAID-supported study shows benefits of exclusively breastfeeding infants, reducing childhood diseases and mortality rates. Continued breastfeeding during diarrhea episodes protects infants. USAID integrates safe infant feeding practices in HIV/AIDS-affected communities. USAID invests $30 million annually in nutrition programs.\" USAID invests $30 million annually in nutrition programs, including Vitamin A, iodine, food fortification, anemia packages, and zinc. UNICEF emphasizes the importance of minimizing indoor pollution, adequate nourishment, exclusive breastfeeding, and Vitamin A and zinc supplements to prevent pneumonia in children. Immunizations against infections like Hib and pertussis are also crucial, along with expanding access to vaccines against Streptococcus pneumoniae. Since 2002, USAID has supported immunizations for nearly 500 million children and treated over 375 million cases of child pneumonia. The Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) strategy, developed by UNICEF and WHO with USAID support, integrates interventions for various childhood illnesses. USAID has expanded the IMCI strategy to address diarrhea, acute respiratory infections, malnutrition, and malaria in the world's poorest countries. Approximately 40% of the global population is at risk of malaria annually. Every year, over 500 million people, mostly in the world's poorest countries, are at risk of malaria. The disease is most prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa but also affects other regions like Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, and parts of Europe. Malaria is particularly deadly for children, with approximately 1 million infants and children under five dying each year in sub-Saharan Africa. USAID has been involved in malaria eradication efforts since the 1950s and proposed the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) in 2005 to increase support for international malaria programs by over $1.2 billion. The President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) aims to increase support for U.S. international malaria programs by over $1.2 billion from FY2006 through FY2010 in 15 targeted countries, reducing malaria deaths by 50% in those countries by 2010. USAID coordinates all PMI activities in partnership with the CDC. In its first year, PMI reached over 6 million people, and within two years, reached over 25 million. In its first year, PMI reached over 6 million people and within two years, reached more than 25 million. Activities included indoor residual spraying, distributing insecticide-treated nets, training health workers, and purchasing anti-malarial tablets. HIV/AIDS is preventable and treatable but not curable. Most of the 420,000 children who acquired HIV in 2007 got it from their infected mothers during pregnancy, birth, or breastfeeding. Interventions can reduce mother-to-child transmission risk to 2%. In resource-limited countries, about 33% of HIV-positive pregnant women receive drugs to prevent transmission. Nevirapine, costing $0.29 to $0.40 per dose, is commonly used for this purpose. WHO emphasizes the importance of timely administration to infants. The World Health Organization (WHO) stresses early diagnosis and treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART) for children with HIV. The cost of ART for children is higher than for adults, with fixed-dosed treatments being most effective but more expensive. In 2005, a one-year supply of a standard three-drug regimen for adults cost an average of $148 in low-income countries. The Clinton Foundation negotiated lower prices for pediatric ARTs, costing $0.16 per day or $60 per year. Other treatments like Cotrimoxazole for pneumonia can also improve child survival among HIV-positive children. Since 1986, USAID has spent $6 billion on HIV/AIDS interventions in over 100 countries. The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) has provided over $289.2 million to initiatives supporting 2.7 million orphans. Only 10% of the 4 million children needing pneumonia treatment are receiving it, which costs $0.03 per day or $10 per year. PEPFAR has allocated $289.2 million to support 2.7 million orphans and vulnerable children through various programs, including food and nutrition initiatives. These programs also benefit pregnant or lactating women and severely malnourished individuals on ART. Additionally, child-focused programs provide training, promote technology use, support income-generating activities, and connect families to essential health care and social services. PEPFAR has committed $1.5 billion for care and support services for people living with HIV/AIDS. In FY2006 and FY2007, $191.5 million was dedicated to pediatric treatment for 85,900 children. PMTCT services were provided to over 10 million pregnancies, including ART for HIV-positive women in over 827,000 pregnancies, preventing an estimated 157,000 infant HIV cases. Since 2002, USAID has provided over $1.5 billion for the treatment of child diarrhea with Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS), preventing an estimated 157,000 infant HIV infections through ART for HIV-positive women in over 827,000 pregnancies. USAID controls diarrheal disease by training health workers, promoting breastfeeding, and expanding community capacity to administer ORS. USAID's anti-diarrhea programs focus on hygiene, with handwashing with soap being emphasized to decrease diarrhea prevalence among children. However, handwashing with soap is not common in poorer communities, with soap often reserved for bathing or washing clothes and dishes. In some studies, a low percentage of mothers in Burkina Faso and Lucknow, India were observed using soap for handwashing after certain activities. In slums in Lucknow, India, 13% of mothers used soap after cleaning a child and 20% after defecating outside. USAID supports partnerships promoting handwashing with soap to reduce diarrhea by 30-40%. WHO states measles immunization is cost-effective, saving more lives per unit cost than other health interventions, costing less than $1 per dose. The measles vaccine, available for over 40 years, costs about $0.33 per dose through UNICEF. In some countries, it is combined with rubella and/or mumps vaccines as a measles-rubella (MR) or measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. MR costs about $0.65 per dose, while MMR costs $1.04 to $1.50 per dose through UNICEF. Measles vaccination coverage rates vary by region. WHO and UNICEF estimated in 2006 that immunization is cost-effective, saving more lives per unit cost than other health interventions. In 2006, WHO and UNICEF estimated that 80% of children worldwide were vaccinated for measles, up from 72% in 2000. Between 2000 and 2006, 478 million children received measles vaccinations in 46 priority countries, leading to a 68% decrease in global measles mortality. Africa saw the largest reduction in measles cases and deaths, with a 91% decline. USAID supports immunization programs in over 100 countries, partnering with organizations like GAVI and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Their maternal health programs aim to improve pregnancy outcomes in low-resource settings through various interventions. USAID supports maternal health programs in low-resource environments by providing interventions such as nutritional supplementation, treatment for parasitic worms, immunizations, prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission, malaria treatment, and syphilis detection. They advocate for skilled birth attendants and emergency obstetric care for home deliveries to reduce infant mortality. Birth attendants are trained to assist with infant breathing and resuscitation during childbirth. USAID supports maternal health programs by providing interventions like infant resuscitation, hygienic care, and breastfeeding promotion. They also educate communities on recognizing birth complications, arranging transportation to hospitals, and creating savings plans for healthcare costs. USAID addresses key causes of maternal mortality, such as postpartum hemorrhage, through low-cost interventions. To prevent postpartum hemorrhage deaths, USAID urges communities to ensure mothers give birth with a trained health care practitioner who can administer drugs and apply life-saving techniques. USAID-supported programs train birth attendants to manage labor's third stage, preventing 60% of hemorrhages. Infections cause nearly 10% of maternal deaths on average. Sepsis or infections cause 10% of maternal deaths in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean. Unhygienic delivery practices, such as using unclean hands or instruments, contribute to sepsis. USAID supports distributing delivery kits and ensuring trained attendants are present at each birth to prevent complications for mothers and babies. USAID trains birth attendants to prevent sepsis in mothers and babies, identify infections, and treat hypertensive disorders. They also educate healthcare providers on recognizing and treating pre-eclampsia and eclampsia to reduce maternal deaths in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean. Prolonged or obstructed labor can lead to serious complications for both the mother and baby, including obstetric fistula. This condition is more common in low-resource settings, especially among young girls and women who were stunted due to undernourishment and lack access to obstetric care. In Kenya, a study found that 45% of all cases were related to this issue. Obstetric fistula prevention programs aim to address the high prevalence of fistula cases among adolescents in Kenya by promoting delayed pregnancy until pelvic development, ensuring access to emergency obstetric care, and providing caesarean surgeries when necessary. USAID has been supporting fistula prevention and repair programs since 1989 and 2005, respectively, integrating them with other maternal health initiatives to increase access to emergency obstetrical care for women. Key activities to address maternal mortality include increasing access to emergency obstetrical care, postponing child marriage, training health practitioners to identify labor complications, and reducing stigma around obstetric fistula. Unsafe abortion contributes to 13% of maternal deaths globally, with regional variations. In Latin America and the Caribbean, it accounts for 12% of maternal deaths, while in Africa, about 4% of women die from unsafe abortions. USAID's international family planning programs have helped avert an estimated 4 million maternal deaths over the last 20 years. Appropriations to USAID's global health programs, including HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases, grew significantly from FY2001 to FY2003. Appropriations for HIV/AIDS programs during this time period reflect support for the President's International Mother and Child HIV Prevention Initiative, with a focus on tuberculosis and malaria programs. Congress also showed strong support for the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria with increased appropriations for U.S. contributions. U.S. support for global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs became a prominent topic from FY2004 to FY2008. The Administration's focus on HIV/AIDS, particularly through PEPFAR, raised questions about the funding for other global health interventions like child survival, maternal health, family planning, and reproductive health. Some Members of Congress raised concerns about the ability of recipient countries to handle the increasing HIV/AIDS funds due to strained health infrastructures. There were calls for better integration of HIV/AIDS with other health programs, such as TB and nutrition, as appropriations for HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria exceeded support for other USAID health programs. Congress provided significantly more funding for global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs compared to USAID's other health initiatives from FY2004 through FY2008. A total of $19.7 billion was allocated for HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria, while only $4.6 billion was appropriated for child survival, maternal health, vulnerable children, and family planning/reproductive health programs during the same period. This trend of higher funding for specific diseases continued throughout President George W. Bush's administration, with calls for increased spending on targeted, disease-specific programs. President's calls for higher spending on targeted disease-specific U.S. programs through key initiatives like the President's International Mother and Child HIV Prevention Initiative, PEPFAR, and the President's Malaria Initiative. While appropriations for other health issues have remained relatively unchanged, experts are concerned that life-saving interventions for women and children are being overlooked. Health programs for women and children in sub-Saharan Africa are underfunded despite being able to prevent two-thirds of child deaths. Advocates call for increased funding for maternal and child health programs, including voluntary family planning to improve outcomes. Voluntary family planning can improve maternal and child health by reducing high-risk pregnancies, preventing HIV/AIDS, reducing abortions, and stabilizing population growth. Some oppose funding family planning due to concerns about abortions and coercive practices. Family planning can also help improve the health outcomes of adolescent girls in rural areas of developing countries. In rural areas of developing countries, adolescent girls face higher mortality rates due to early marriage and childbirth. Research shows that girls under 20 are at increased risk of delivering low-birthweight babies and experiencing pregnancy complications like toxemia and anemia. Girls aged 15-19 are twice as likely to die from childbirth compared to women in their twenties, with those under 15 being five times more likely to die. Obstetric fistula is also more common among young girls, with one study in Kenya finding that 45% of cases were among adolescents. In Kenya, 45% of fistula cases are among adolescents. Preventing fistula involves delaying pregnancy until pelvic development is complete and performing necessary caesarean surgery. Repairing fistula costs around $300, which is unaffordable for many affected girls and women. Advocates suggest increasing health system funding to reduce maternal and child mortality by addressing various health strategies. Improvements in health systems and access to essential interventions like vaccinations are crucial for reducing mortality rates. UNICEF emphasizes the need for donor support to strengthen health systems in many countries. Advocates urge for better coordination of health assistance to improve efficiency and overall health outcomes. The International Health Partnership (IHP+) encourages donors to create compacts with countries to support national health plans for long-term financing from both national and international sources. Country compacts are agreements between the international community and recipient countries to achieve results through mutual accountability. They involve a single country health plan, monitoring and evaluation plan, budget harmonization, reporting process, and benchmarks for government performance. Global health experts emphasize the importance of recipient governments in improving health systems, while critics highlight the role of political will in low health spending in developing countries. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), lack of political will is a major reason for minimal health spending in developing countries. Health practitioners attribute 29% of unspent health funds to this issue. African countries with severe health worker shortages spend an average of $33 per person on health annually, while the U.S. government spends $2,548 per capita. African leaders have pledged to increase health spending, with the entire continent spending less than 1% of the world's health expenditure. Members of the African Union (AU) have committed to boosting health funding. In April 2001, African Union (AU) and Organization of African Unity (OAU) members signed the Abuja Declaration, pledging to allocate at least 15% of national budgets to healthcare. By 2004, 33% of AU states allocated 10% or more to health, 38% spent between 5-10%, and 29% allocated less than 5%. Only Botswana reported higher spending. Some African governments allocate less than 5% of their national budgets to health systems, with Botswana being the exception at 15%. Critics argue that structural adjustment programs and lending practices limit investments in public health and health worker education, leading to shortages in supplies and equipment. The International Development Research Center found that discussions on the impact of structural adjustment, conditional lending, and health reform on public health infrastructures are often biased. Results of these measures were mixed, and the organization does not support extreme arguments about the erosion of public health expenditure. Several bills introduced in the 110th Congress aimed to improve maternal and child health, including H.Amdt. 360 to H.R. 2764 which increased support by $5 million for FY2008. H.R. 5501 and S. 2731 authorized significant funding for global health initiatives. The House and Senate versions of H.R. 5501 authorized funding for international HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria interventions, with the House version including language on family planning and maternal health programs supported by the United States. The Senate version passed with a substitute amendment. The Senate passed H.R. 5501 by voice vote, 80-16, with a substitute amendment that included the language of S. 2731. H.R. 1302 and S. 2433, Global Poverty Act of 2007, aim to reduce global poverty and improve maternal and child health. The House also passed the bill by voice vote on September 25, 2007. The House and Senate passed bills in 2007 to improve global child survival and family health in developing countries. The Focus on Family Health Worldwide Act of 2007 amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to enhance family planning programs in developing countries. H.R. 2114, Repairing Young Women's Lives Around the World Act, provides support to the United Nations Population Fund for obstetric fistula prevention and treatment. H.R. 2604, United Nations Population Fund Women's Health and Dignity Act, offers assistance to save women's lives and reduce abortion rates. The bill aims to support activities to save women's lives, reduce unsafe abortions, promote family planning, and improve lives in developing countries. It was referred to the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Another bill, the International Child Marriage Prevention Act of 2007, authorizes funds to reduce child marriage. Additionally, the United Nations Population Fund Restoration Act of 2008 directs U.S. funding to the United Nations Population Fund for maternal and child health purposes. The Global Security Priorities Resolution calls for reducing nuclear weapons and preventing their proliferation to protect global security. It estimates significant savings from nuclear disarmament, directing a portion towards child survival, hunger, and universal education. The House resolution H.Res. 1022 affirms commitment to promoting maternal health and child survival through international investment. It recognizes the importance of maternal health and child survival for families, societies, and global development. The resolution was referred to the House Foreign Affairs Committee."
