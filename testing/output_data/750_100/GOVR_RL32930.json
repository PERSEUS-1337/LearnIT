    "content": "The NLRA, as amended, aims to improve the bargaining power of workers in the private sector by addressing the inequality of bargaining power between employees and employers. This is done to alleviate the burden on commerce, prevent depressions, and stabilize competitive wage rates and working conditions. The NLRA aims to address obstructions to commerce by promoting collective bargaining. It grants workers the right to join unions and bargain collectively. Employers must negotiate in good faith with the chosen union. Unfair labor practices are defined, and the act does not apply to certain industries. The NLRA excludes certain industries like railroads, airlines, and government workers. Unauthorized workers can participate in union activities under the NLRA. The NLRB, an independent federal agency, oversees secret ballot elections and resolves disputes related to unfair labor practices. The General Counsel's office oversees secret ballot elections, investigates unfair labor practice complaints, and supervises NLRB's regional offices. A bargaining unit is a group of employees represented by a union based on a \"community of interest\" regarding wages, hours, and working conditions. It may include employees from one employer, establishment, or occupation. The bargaining unit may consist of professional and nonprofessional employees, with guards excluded. The union and employer can agree on the unit, or the NLRB will decide. In a case involving certified nursing assistants at a healthcare center in Mobile, AL, the NLRB found the group appropriate for union representation. The NLRB Regional Director determined that the petitioned-for unit of CNAs at a healthcare center was appropriate for union representation. The CNAs assist residents with daily tasks, wear nursing uniforms, and are supervised by licensed practical nurses. The CNAs at a healthcare center wear nursing uniforms, work under licensed practical nurses, and must maintain certification from the state of Alabama. The employer argued for including other employees in the bargaining unit, such as resident activity assistants, a staffing coordinator, a maintenance assistant, a medical records clerk, and cooks, who have similar educational requirements as the CNAs. The CNAs at a healthcare center wear nursing uniforms, work under licensed practical nurses, and must maintain certification from the state of Alabama. The board voted in favor (3-1) of the CNAs, determining that the CNAs' petitioned-for bargaining unit was appropriate. The CNAs and service and maintenance employees have similar educational requirements and receive annual evaluations, pay raises, and benefits. Unlike the CNAs, other employees are not part of the nursing department and are not required to work specific shifts. The CNAs at a healthcare center were found to share a community of interest based on their distinct training, certification, supervision, uniforms, pay rates, work assignments, shifts, and work areas. The employer failed to prove an overwhelming community of interest with other service and maintenance employees. Rules for union organizing campaigns vary for employers, employees, and union organizers, including soliciting union support and distributing union literature. Specific campaign rules may differ from general rules due to exceptions. Employers may campaign against unionization by holding \"captive audience\" meetings during work hours. Supervisors can provide written information and hold individual meetings with employees. Employees can campaign for union support during work hours in various areas. Employees can campaign for union support in work and nonwork areas, but only on their own time. Distribution of union literature is allowed in nonwork areas if not permitted in work areas. Using the employer's e-mail for union activities can be restricted, as long as other causes or organizations are also prohibited. Employees can campaign for union support in work and nonwork areas on their own time. Union organizers cannot conduct campaigns on company property, but may meet with employees on union property or in inaccessible locations. Nonemployee union organizers may be allowed in the workplace under certain conditions. Employees can campaign for union support in work and nonwork areas on their own time. Union organizers may meet with employees on union property or public sidewalks outside of a business. They can also contact employees at home by phone or mail. Employers cannot interfere with employees' right to form or join a union, including threatening job loss or benefits for voting for unionization. An employer cannot threaten employees with job loss or benefits for union activities, including voting or joining. They also cannot use wage increases to discourage union participation. Employers must bargain in good faith on wages and working conditions. Employees have the right to organize and bargain collectively. Unions cannot coerce employees to join or not join. A union cannot coerce employees to join or not join, threaten job loss for not supporting unionization, or cause discrimination in employment conditions. Unfair labor practices can be filed by various parties, and the NLRB investigates such charges. The NLRB investigates filed charges to determine violations of unfair labor practices. If a charge has merit, efforts are made for a voluntary settlement before a hearing by an administrative law judge. The NLRA aims to prevent and remedy unfair labor practices without punishing employers, unions, or individuals. The NLRB can issue cease-and-desist orders and remedies for violations. In FY2011, $60.5 million in backpay or reimbursement of fees, dues, and fines was awarded to workers who were illegally fired for union activities, with estimates of 1,000 to 3,000 workers affected annually. In a study by Kate Bronfenbrenner, it was found that 25% of union campaigns resulted in workers being fired for union activities. The number of unfair labor practice charges filed peaked at 44,063 in FY1980 and stood at 21,629 in FY2012. 36.4% of the charges filed in FY2012 were found to have merit. Section 9(a) of the NLRA states that a union may be designated for collective bargaining by the majority of employees. Currently, there are three ways for employees to join or form a union: through a majority election conducted by the NLRB, voluntary recognition by the employer based on signed authorization cards from the majority of employees, or NLRB ordering recognition and bargaining if unfair labor practices have occurred. The NLRB conducts secret ballot elections for union certification, which can be requested by a union, worker, or employer. A petition for an election can be filed if at least 30% of employees have signed authorization cards. An employer may also request an election if a union claims to represent the employees. An employer can request an election if a union claims to represent a majority of its employees and wants to bargain. If a majority of employees in an NLRB-conducted election choose union representation, the union is certified as the bargaining representative. Certification does not mandate an initial contract agreement between the union and employer. After a petition is filed for an election, the employer and union may agree on the election details. If no agreement is reached, a hearing may be held at the NLRB office, where the regional director may order an election. In a secret ballot election, employees decide on union representation. If no union receives a majority, a runoff election is held between the top two choices. In an NLRB election, if no union receives a majority of the vote, a runoff election is held between the top two unions. The right to vote can be challenged by the employer or union, with the regional director deciding on challenged ballots. Objections to the election can be filed, and a decision can be appealed to the board. Alternatively, a secret ballot election can be conducted by a third party agreed upon by the union and employer. The NLRB conducts secret ballot elections for decertifying unions, with a petition requiring 30% of employees' signatures. A certified union is protected from decertification for a year. The NLRB conducted secret ballot elections for decertifying unions, with a petition requiring 30% of employees' signatures. In June 2011, the NLRB proposed changes to procedures for union representation petitions and elections. A final rule was issued on December 22, 2011, but implementation was suspended in response to a court decision. The NLRB suspended the implementation of changes to union representation petition and election procedures. The final rule from December 22, 2011, allowed hearing officers to limit pre-election hearings to matters relevant to the question of representation and consolidate pre-election and post-election requests for review. Under the new rule, pre- and post-election requests for review will be filed after an election. Special permission to appeal pre-election rulings will only be granted in \"extraordinary circumstances where it appears that the issue will otherwise evade review.\" According to the NLRB, current regulations do not provide a standard for the board to grant special permission for review of pre-election decisions. The December 22, 2011 rule eliminated the 25-day waiting period for board review of decisions by regional directors on challenges and objections to elections. Requests for review by the board would have been discretionary under the rule. In FY2010, the NLRB conducted 1,823 elections, with unions winning 62.3% of them, up from 46.6% in FY1994. Most elections had employer and union agreement on the bargaining unit and election details, with 89.3% based on consent. In FY2010, 89.3% of elections were based on consent or stipulated agreements between the two parties. Most elections are held within two months of filing a petition, with a median time of 38 days to proceed to an election. In FY2012, 93.9% of initial representation elections were conducted within 56 days of filing a petition. Post-election objections and challenges were filed in 115 cases in FY2011, with a median of 62 days to issue a decision or supplemental report for cases that resulted in an investigative hearing. In FY2011, the NLRB took a median of 62 days to issue a decision or supplemental report for cases that could be resolved without a hearing. A recent study estimated that within two years of winning an NLRB election, a contract had not been reached in over two-fifths of cases, a higher percentage than previous estimates. The NLRA allows for voluntary union recognition through card check agreements, where a majority or supermajority of employees sign authorization cards. A neutral third party often validates the signatures on these cards. A neutral third party validates signatures on authorization cards for collective bargaining contracts, which may include a card check arrangement for unorganized branches. Employees under voluntary recognition have 45 days to file a decertification or election petition. A card check arrangement can be combined with a neutrality agreement where an employer agrees to certain terms. A neutrality agreement in a union organizing campaign involves the employer remaining neutral and not attacking the union, while the union agrees not to criticize the employer. It may include providing access to company property, employee lists, and organizing drives at new branches. To gain an agreement from an employer for a card check campaign, unions may engage in corporate campaigns involving boycotts, rallies, public relations efforts, legal accusations, and support from various leaders. Another way for a union to be recognized by an employer is through a bargaining order issued by the NLRB. The NLRB may issue a bargaining order for an employer to recognize and bargain with a union if unfair labor practices have occurred, making a fair election unlikely. Each case is based on specific violations, and bargaining orders can be appealed to higher courts. Certification by the NLRB gives a union advantages, such as protection from decertification and representation by another union for a year after winning a secret ballot election. Voluntary recognition or bargaining orders do not result in NLRB certification. The Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 eliminated certification through methods other than NLRB-conducted elections. Under voluntary card check recognition, employees have 45 days to file a decertification petition or an election petition to be represented by a different union. The duration of an employer's duty to bargain depends on whether a union has been certified by the NLRB or recognized voluntarily by the employer. If a union wins an NLRB election, the employer must bargain for a year. With voluntary card check recognition, the employer must bargain for a \"reasonable period of time.\" In certain circumstances, an employer may withdraw recognition of a union. After one year, if an employer and a certified union have not reached a contract agreement, the employer may withdraw recognition of the union if both parties have engaged in good faith bargaining and the employer doubts, on the basis of objective information, that a majority of employees no longer support the union. Under voluntary recognition, an employer may withdraw recognition if no contract agreement has been reached after a reasonable period of time and the employer has reasonable doubt based on objective information. Before the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947, only a union or employee could request a secret ballot election. Section 9(c) of the Taft-Hartley Act gave employers the right to request an election if they had \"good faith\" doubt that the union was supported by a majority of employees, based on objective information. An employer's good faith doubt could stem from belief that authorization card signatures were obtained through misrepresentation or coercion. The \"Joy Silk doctrine\" required employers to recognize a union supported by a majority of employees or face a bargaining order. The doctrine was abandoned in 1969, allowing employers to voluntarily recognize a union or request an election if a majority of employees signed authorization cards. In a 1974 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court addressed employer actions regarding union recognition. In 1974, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that if an employer insists on an election, the union must file an election petition. The NLRB has recently reviewed cases involving voluntary recognition, such as a 2004 decision where employees filed a decertification petition after the employer recognized a union under a card check agreement. In December 2003, the UAW was recognized as the bargaining representative for workers at the St. Marys, Pennsylvania plant and the Upper Sandusky, Ohio plant of Dana Corporation. Both cases involved card check and neutrality agreements before union recognition. Employees filed decertification petitions after union recognition but before a contract agreement was reached. The NLRB dismissed decertification petitions at Dana and Metaldyne Corporations, citing the \"recognition bar\" doctrine. Employees represented by the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation petitioned the NLRB to review the dismissals, questioning if voluntary recognition should prevent decertification petitions within a reasonable time. The NLRB dismissed decertification petitions at Dana and Metaldyne Corporations, citing the \"recognition bar\" doctrine. Following a voluntary recognition, employees have 45 days to file a petition to decertify the union. A rival union also has 45 days to file an election petition, signed by at least 30% of bargaining unit employees. If a petition is not filed within 45 days, an election petition cannot be filed. On August 26, 2011, the NLRB reversed its decision in the Dana and Metaldyne cases regarding the recognition bar doctrine. In July 2003, Lamons Gasket and the United Steelworkers (USW) entered into a card check agreement. In November 2009, Lamons Gasket voluntarily recognized the USW as the sole representative of a unit of employees. Within 45 days, a decertification petition was filed by a bargaining unit employee supported by authorization cards signed by at least 30% of employees. The board overruled the previous decisions in a 3-1 vote. The NLRB reversed its decision on the recognition bar doctrine, setting a reasonable period of 6 months to a year after voluntary recognition before an election petition can be filed. This decision followed standards from the Lee Lumber case. The House Committee on Education and the Workforce requested the NLRB to provide a list of cases related to the Dana decision and Lamons Gasket decision, including election petitions, dismissals, and unfair labor practice charges. In August 2007, the NLRB allowed an employer to withdraw recognition of a union after the third year of a longer-term contract with Shaw's Supermarkets and the UFCW. After three years of a contract with the UFCW, Shaw's withdrew recognition of the union, leading to an appeal to the NLRB regarding the inability to initiate an election petition during the contract duration. The NLRB board voted 2-1 in favor of Shaw's decision to withdraw recognition of the union during the five-year contract, citing evidence of a loss of majority support. The dissenting member suggested a decertification election should have been held. When a union and employer cannot agree on a collective bargaining agreement, it is called an impasse. This may lead to a work stoppage, with workers striking or the employer locking out employees. To avoid this, a neutral third party can help reach a contract agreement. Mediation can be used to resolve the impasse, where a mediator assists in reaching an agreement without imposing a settlement on the parties. In arbitration, a mediator assists parties in reaching an agreement by defining issues, suggesting compromises, and identifying solutions. The arbitrator decides on resolving disputes in grievance or contract arbitration, determining terms of existing or new contracts. An arbitrator determines the terms and conditions of a contract through interest arbitration, which can be voluntary or compulsory, conventional or final-offer, and binding or nonbinding. In final-offer arbitration, the arbitrator may choose between the complete final offers of the employer and union or between the final offers on each issue. In final-offer arbitration, the arbitrator must choose between the union's or the employer's final offer, either as a compromise or selecting one outright. The arbitrator may choose the complete final offer (package) from one party or select final offers from each side on individual issues. The arbitration can be binding or nonbinding. Different forms of arbitration can be combined, such as Med-Arb which combines the roles of mediator and arbitrator. In Med-Arb, a neutral third party facilitates an agreement as a mediator, and if no settlement is reached, the neutral party becomes the arbitrator and decides on a settlement. Interest arbitration is commonly used in the public sector where strikes are limited, while in the private sector, parties may voluntarily opt for interest arbitration to resolve impasses in negotiations. This method has both advantages and disadvantages. Interest arbitration in contract negotiations has advantages and disadvantages. It can prevent strikes or lockouts but may change negotiating behavior. When a union and employer reach an impasse, they can use mediation or arbitration to avoid strikes or lockouts. Economic strikes can occur over wages, hours, or working conditions, with employers able to permanently replace striking workers. Interest arbitration in contract negotiations can have a \"chilling\" effect on negotiations as it may lead parties to not bargain seriously if they believe they can get a better settlement through arbitration. This can impose costs on both workers and employers, with replaced workers only able to be rehired when jobs become available. Interest arbitration in contract negotiations can have a \"chilling\" effect as parties may take extreme positions and be unwilling to compromise, leading to a \"narcotic\" effect on future negotiations. Conventional arbitration may prevent serious negotiations and make parties reliant on arbitration rather than engaging in productive bargaining. One proposal to address the chilling effect of conventional arbitration is final-offer arbitration. This method limits the arbitrator to choosing the last offer from either the union or employer, encouraging both parties to make more acceptable offers. This could lead to increased willingness to compromise and potentially reach a contract settlement independently. The arbitrator may choose between the complete final offer of one party or between final offers on each issue from both parties. The NLRA does not have a statutory exemption for small businesses, but the NLRB does not certify bargaining units of only one employee or have jurisdiction over employers with low revenues. Collective bargaining assumes multiple employees are involved. The NLRB has jurisdiction over employers affecting interstate commerce and sets administrative standards based on annual sales for union representation. Retail businesses need $500,000 in annual sales for NLRB jurisdiction. The NLRB has jurisdiction over employers affecting interstate commerce based on annual sales. Hotels, motels, nonretail businesses, private colleges, and symphony orchestras have specific revenue requirements for NLRB jurisdiction, established since August 1, 1959. The Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 allows the Board to establish jurisdictional standards. The NLRB has jurisdiction over employers affecting interstate commerce based on annual sales, with specific revenue requirements for certain types of businesses established since August 1, 1959. Section 14(c)(1) states that the Board may decline jurisdiction over a labor dispute if the impact on commerce is not substantial enough, but must assert jurisdiction if the employer meets the standards in effect on August 1, 1959. The NLRB may decline jurisdiction over a labor dispute if it does not have a substantial effect on interstate commerce. Smaller employers can still allow unionization through other means, such as voluntary recognition or a secret ballot election supervised by a third party. Section 14(c)(2) of the NLRA allows state agencies or courts to assume jurisdiction in such cases. The NLRB can decline jurisdiction over labor disputes not affecting interstate commerce. State agencies or courts can assume jurisdiction in such cases. The GAO estimated 5 million small employer employees lack collective bargaining rights under the NLRA due to jurisdictional standards. This estimate could vary with more recent data. Jurisdictional standards' dollar amounts are not adjusted for inflation, impacting employers meeting standards in 1959. The NLRB jurisdictional standards are not adjusted for inflation, affecting employers meeting the standards in 1959. Recent legislation proposes changes to union certification procedures, including secret ballot elections or card check certification. These changes could impact the level of unionization in the United States. The section discusses the potential impact of changes to union certification procedures, such as secret ballot elections or card check certification, on unionization levels in the United States. Supporters and opponents of card check certification argue about potential coercion and pressure on employees. Proponents of secret ballot elections argue that it provides privacy and confidentiality compared to signing authorization cards. Unions claim that employers have more access to employees during election campaigns, while employers argue that unionization may be costly to employees due to dues and higher wages. Research comparing card check certification and secret ballot elections is limited. Research suggests that card check certification leads to higher union success rates and more unionization drives compared to secret ballot elections. Combining card check campaigns with neutrality agreements further increases the success rate. In Canada, automatic card check recognition has shown higher union success rates than secret ballots. In Canada, union recognition laws vary by province. Some provinces require secret ballot elections for union recognition, while others allow card check recognition. Mandatory voting was repealed in British Columbia in 1993 but reinstated in 2001. Under card check recognition, a union is automatically recognized if enough employees sign authorization cards. The union success rate in Canada is higher under card check recognition than under secret ballots. A study of 171 union organizing campaigns between 1978 and 1996 in nine provinces found that card check recognition led to a nine percentage point increase in union success rate. In British Columbia, union recognition based on card checks was allowed until 1984, then required secret ballot elections from 1984 to 1992 before card checks were allowed again. Since 1993, union certification in Canada has allowed card checks instead of secret ballot elections. The union success rate increased by about 19 percentage points with card check recognition reinstated in 1993. Mandatory voting in 1984 led to a decrease in union success rate and fewer organizing drives. In Ontario, card check recognition was allowed before 1995, but secret balloting has been required since November 1995. After 1995, secret balloting became mandatory for union certification in Ontario. A study comparing certification applications before and after the switch to secret ballots found that the certification rate was higher with card checks. However, under secret balloting, larger bargaining units were organized, with an average size of 63.1 workers compared to 36.3 employees under card check recognition. The study compared union certification methods, showing that secret balloting resulted in larger bargaining units with an average of 63.1 workers, compared to 36.3 workers under card check recognition. The study also found that a one percentage point increase in unionization raised the short-term unemployment rate by 0.30 to 0.35 percentage points in Canada. The study found that union success rates are higher when card check recognition is combined with a neutrality agreement, with a success rate of 78.2% compared to 62.5% with only a card check agreement. This may be due to employers having less opportunity to campaign against unionization. Employers have less opportunity to campaign against unionization under card check recognition. Unions may have higher success rates with a neutrality agreement, as it reduces employer opposition. Requiring card check certification may increase union success rates, but its impact on reversing the decline in private sector unionization is uncertain. Shrinking employment in unionized firms and decertifications could counteract any membership increase. Employer opposition may also rise during the collection of authorization cards. Americans generally support unions, with 59% in favor according to a recent Gallup poll. According to recent polls, Americans are generally supportive of unions. In August 2008, 59% approved of unions while 31% disapproved. In March 2009, 53% favored a law making it easier for unions to organize, while 39% opposed it. Another poll in March 2009 showed that 33% agreed Congress should change the law to facilitate union formation, 40% disagreed, and 27% were unsure. According to recent polls, Americans generally support unions. A survey found that 32% of respondents believe a union should be formed if a majority of workers sign a card, without a secret ballot. However, 57% find it difficult to form a union. Other surveys provide information on secret ballot elections and card check. According to surveys, 75% of respondents prefer secret ballot elections for union formation, while only 12% support card check recognition. Another survey found that 22% of workers felt pressured during a union organizing campaign, compared to 6% who did not. The NLRA gives private sector workers the right to organize and bargain collectively over wages, hours, and working conditions. It also requires employers to bargain in good faith with a union chosen by a majority of employees, aiming to improve workers' bargaining power. The economic rationale for protecting workers' rights to organize and bargain collectively is to improve competition in labor markets. Competitive markets lead to efficient resource allocation, resulting in greater total output and consumer satisfaction. In competitive labor markets, workers are paid based on their contribution to output. Workers in competitive labor markets are paid based on their contribution to output, including compensation for unfavorable working conditions. The theory of compensating wage differentials recognizes individual preferences for different working conditions. Increasing workers' bargaining power can lead to higher wages, better benefits, and improved working conditions. In competitive labor markets, unionization can increase wages and employment in monopsonies. However, in competitive markets, higher union wages may lead to a misallocation of resources and reduce total economic output. Unions may lower employment in the unionized sector, leading to lower wages for nonunion workers. In competitive labor markets, governments may intervene to reduce earnings inequality and address changes in labor market competitiveness over time. Labor markets can vary in scale from local to international, making it challenging to measure and identify the appropriate market. Unionization is seen as a way to reduce earnings inequality and give workers a voice in the workplace. Some economists believe that greater earnings equality during a recession can boost aggregate demand and lower unemployment. Unions provide workers with alternative ways to address issues with management, such as dispute resolution and formal grievance procedures. Collective bargaining through unionization can help workers achieve higher wages, better benefits, and improved working conditions. The economic impact of using card check certification or secret ballot elections depends on policymakers' objectives. Depending on the competitiveness of labor markets, collective bargaining may either enhance or hinder resource allocation and economic efficiency. The bargaining power of workers can impact economic output, consumer satisfaction, and equality. Requiring card check certification may increase organizing campaigns and union success rates, while secret ballot elections could decrease them. This decision can affect the level of unionization based on labor market competitiveness. Requiring card check certification or secret ballot elections can impact economic efficiency and earnings inequality based on labor market competitiveness. The effects of these changes may be difficult to predict or measure."
