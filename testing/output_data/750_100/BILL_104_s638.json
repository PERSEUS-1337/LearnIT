The special representatives of the President of the United States and the Governor of the Northern Mariana Islands must adhere to the Agreement's requirements. Additional funds in fiscal years can be used for capital projects in American Samoa.

In fiscal years beyond 1997, up to $3 million annually can be allocated for addressing immigration, labor, and law enforcement issues in the Northern Mariana Islands, including detention and corrections needs. Projects will be outlined in a five-year infrastructure assistance plan developed by the Secretary of the Interior in consultation with the island governments.

Additionally, a provision allows for an emergency fund of up to $2 million per year, with a cumulative limit of $10 million, to be used in the event of natural disasters to supplement assistance for essential facility repair, replacement, or hardening. Additional contributions may be made within the allocated infrastructure funds to assist in the resettlement of Rongelap Atoll, with a total limit of $32 million from any Federal source after January 1, 1995. These contributions are contingent upon a satisfactory agreement to settle all obligations of the United States for resettlement activities. Federal agencies providing assistance in the Republic of the Marshall Islands can make funds available for the resettlement of Rongelap. The funds must be used solely for resettlement activities and will be audited. This does not limit ex gratia assistance for individuals who choose not to resettle. Federal agencies can provide funds for resettlement at Rongelap, with audits required. Ex gratia assistance is available for individuals who choose not to resettle, but only after full funding for Rongelap resettlement is confirmed by the Secretary to Congress. SEC. 2. FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE. Effective thirty days after enactment, the minimum wage provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act will apply to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, with minimum wage rates set at $2.75 per hour initially, increasing to $3.05 per hour on January 1, 1996. Effective January 1, 1997, the minimum wage rate in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands will be raised by thirty cents per hour annually until it reaches the wage rate set forth in the Fair Labor Standards Act. Once it equals the FLSA rate, the minimum wage in the CNMI will be aligned with the FLSA rate. SEC. 3. REPORT. The Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with other government officials, must report to Congress by March 15 each fiscal year on funds allocated for immigration, labor, and law enforcement activities. The report includes immigration data, such as the number of non-US citizen contract workers in the CNMI. The Immigration and Naturalization Service may require the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands to report on non-US citizen contract workers, foreign government interference, laws' effect on Federal interests, detention facilities adequacy, and computerized alien data accuracy. The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands may need to report on the accuracy of the computerized alien tracking system and its compatibility with the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Federal agencies may require funding from the Secretary of the Interior to fully enforce laws in the region. SEC. 4. IMMIGRATION COOPERATION. The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and the Immigration and Naturalization Service will work together to identify and potentially exclude or deport individuals posing security or law enforcement risks to the region. SEC. 5. CLARIFICATION OF LOCAL EMPLOYMENT IN THE MARIANAS.
