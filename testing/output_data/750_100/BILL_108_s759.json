    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Residential, Farm, Ranch, and Small Business Wind Energy Systems Act of 2003\" or the \"Small Wind Energy Systems Act of 2003.\" It introduces a credit for residential small wind energy systems under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Act allows a 30% tax credit for qualified wind energy property expenditures by individuals. The credit is capped at $1,000 per kilowatt of capacity and requires safety certifications for eligibility. Unused credits can be carried forward. The tax credit for qualified wind energy property expenditures can be carried forward to the succeeding taxable year if it exceeds the limitation imposed by section 26(a). The tax credit for property expenditure on qualified wind energy property installed in a dwelling unit in the US and used as a residence by the taxpayer includes installation fees. Qualified wind energy property refers to a wind turbine with the taxpayer as the original user for at least 5 years. A qualifying wind turbine must have a 5-year limited warranty covering defects in design, material, workmanship, and installation. It should be 75 kilowatts or less in rated capacity and meet the latest performance rating within one year of purchase. Expenditures for labor costs related to the onsite preparation, assembly, or installation of qualified wind energy property and for interconnecting such property to the dwelling unit or energy grid are considered for this section. Expenditures for swimming pools, hot tubs, or other energy storage mediums with functions other than storage are not considered for this section. Special rules apply for joint occupancy dwelling units regarding the allowable credit amount. The credit amount allowable for expenditures made by individuals on a dwelling unit in a calendar year is determined by treating them as one taxpayer. Each individual is eligible for a credit for the taxable year in which the calendar year ends. The credit amount for expenditures on a dwelling unit in a calendar year is determined by the ratio of individual expenditures to total expenditures. Tenant-stockholders in cooperative housing corporations are treated as having made their tenant-share. Individuals in condominium management associations are treated as having made their proportionate share of any expenditures of the association. For the purposes of this paragraph, a condominium management association is defined as an organization that meets specific requirements for a residential condominium project. If less than 80 percent of a qualified wind energy property is used for nonbusiness purposes and selling energy to others, only a portion of the expenditures for the property are allocated. For qualified wind energy property, only the portion of expenditures properly allocable to nonbusiness use and energy generation for sale to others is considered. Expenditures are treated as made when the property is installed and begins generating energy, except for expenditures related to building construction. Expenditures for building construction are treated as made when the taxpayer begins using the structure. The amount of any expenditure is the cost thereof. Property financed by subsidized energy financing affects the amount of expenditures made for a dwelling unit. Expenditures for building construction are treated as made when the taxpayer begins using the structure, with costs being the amount of the expenditure. Subsidized energy financing does not count towards expenditures for a dwelling unit. The basis adjustments reduce the increase in basis for qualified wind energy property by the amount of the credit allowed. This section does not apply to property installed after December 31, 2008. The credit allowed under subsection (a) for the taxable year shall not exceed the excess of the regular tax liability plus the tax imposed by section 55, over the credits allowable under this. The credit allowed under subsection (a) for the taxable year is limited by the regular tax liability plus the tax imposed by section 55, minus the sum of credits allowable under this subpart and section 27. Conforming amendments are made to sections 25C and 23(b)(4)(B) of the Code. The text chunk involves amendments to various sections of the Code, including inserting section 25C after certain references in sections 24, 25, and 26, as well as in section 904(h). Section 904(h) and 1400C(d) of the Internal Revenue Code are amended to include references to sections 25B, 25C. Additionally, section 23(c) and 25(e)(1)(C) are amended to include references to sections 25C and 1400C for taxable years before January 1, 2004. The Internal Revenue Code is amended to include references to sections 25C for taxable years before January 1, 2004. Section 1016 is amended to allow credits under section 25C, and section 1400C is also amended for taxable years before January 1, 2004. The Internal Revenue Code is amended to include references to section 25C for taxable years before January 1, 2004. The table of sections is updated to include section 25C after section 25B. The amendments made by section 25C for residential wind energy property apply to expenditures after December 31, 2002, in taxable years ending after that date. The amendments made by subsection (b) apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2003. Additionally, a credit is provided for business installation of small wind energy property. The amendment to section 48 of the Internal Revenue Code includes adding qualified wind energy property installed before January 1, 2009. This expands the definition of energy property for tax purposes. Qualified wind energy property refers to a qualifying wind turbine installed on a farm, ranch, or eligible small business in the United States, owned and used by the taxpayer. The taxpayer must ensure that the qualified wind energy property has a 5-year limited warranty for defects in design, material, workmanship, and installation to be eligible for the tax credit. The tax credit for qualifying wind turbines is limited to 30% of the property's basis or $1,000 per kilowatt of capacity. A qualifying wind turbine is defined as having a rated capacity of 75 kilowatts. A wind turbine with a rated capacity of 75 kilowatts or less must meet performance standards set by the American Wind Energy Association or the International Electrotechnical Commission within one year of purchase to qualify for the tax credit. Additionally, the turbine must meet fire and electric code requirements to be eligible for the credit. The energy percentage for qualified wind energy property is 30 percent, and for any other energy property, it is 10 percent. A conforming amendment is made to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The amendments made by this subsection apply to property placed in service after December 31, 2003, under rules similar to section 48(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986."
