Congress finds that approximately 60 percent of Indian tribe members and Alaska Natives live on or near Indian lands with a high unemployment rate of 45 percent. These individuals own over 197,000 businesses, generating more than $34 billion in revenue. The service industry is the largest sector, followed by construction and other industries. The number of businesses owned by Indian tribe members and Alaska Natives grew significantly from 1992 to 1997, with their gross receipts also showing a substantial increase. This growth far outpaced that of all businesses during the same period. Additionally, the Small Business Development Center program has been shown to be cost-effective, with clients receiving long-term counseling generating additional tax revenues in 1998. The Small Business Development Center program in 1998 generated $468 million in additional tax revenues, which was 6 times the program's cost to the Federal Government. Small businesses owned by Indian tribe members, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians receiving services under the program have a higher survival rate. Business counseling and technical assistance are crucial on Indian lands where similar services are scarce and expensive. Increased counseling assistance under the Small Business Development Center program is beneficial. The Small Business Development Center program aims to stimulate economies on Indian lands, foster economic development, and assist in creating and expanding small businesses owned by Indian tribe members, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians. Increased counseling assistance has been shown to reduce default rates associated with lending programs. The Small Business Development Center program aims to provide management, technical, and research assistance to small businesses owned by Indian tribe members, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians. It seeks advice from Tribal Councils on where assistance is most needed and ensures full access to business counseling and technical assistance for these groups. The Small Business Development Center program provides assistance to Indian tribe members, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians for business development. The Small Business Act is amended to provide an additional grant for eligible states funded by the Administration as a Small Business Development Center to assist Indian tribe members, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians with small business startups and expansions on Indian lands. The Small Business Act is amended to provide grants for eligible states with a population of at least 1% Indian tribe members, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians to support small business startups and expansions on Indian lands. Grant applicants must submit a specific form to the Administration for consideration. The Administration requires a specific application form for grant applicants, including details on goals, training capabilities, and location of proposed Small Business Development Center site. The applicant for a grant must provide details on the proposed Development Center site, grant funding needed, and consultation with local Tribal Councils. Matching funds requirements do not apply for this grant. The maximum amount of grants a single applicant can receive under this paragraph is $300,000 for one fiscal year. The Administration will issue final regulations within 180 days after the enactment of this paragraph, in consultation with the recognized Association, to carry out the provisions. The Administration will establish standards for educational, technical, and support services provided by Small Business Development Centers receiving assistance under this paragraph.
