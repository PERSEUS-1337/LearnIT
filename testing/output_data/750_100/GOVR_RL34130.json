    "content": "The 2008 farm bill expanded on renewable energy policies established in the 2002 farm bill, which included an energy title for grants, loans, and loan guarantees to support research and adoption of renewable energy systems. Interest in renewable energy has since increased due to rising petroleum prices. The 2008 farm bill, influenced by rising petroleum prices and increased biofuels production, supports ethanol and biodiesel with federal incentives and regulatory programs. It reflects the emphasis on biofuels mandated by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The 2008 farm bill reflects the increased role for biofuels mandated by the expansion of the renewable fuels standard (RFS) in EISA. It emphasizes facilitating production of biofuels from cellulosic feedstocks and includes a significant expansion of the overall RFS to 36 billion gallons by 2022. This shift is driven by concerns about economic and environmental issues associated with corn starch-based ethanol. Issues with corn starch-based ethanol include rising commodity prices since 2007, competition with petroleum in the marketplace, and increased demand for ethanol driving up corn prices. Ethanol production used 40% of U.S. corn in 2010, leading to higher feed costs, export prices, and domestic food inflation. Ethanol's profitability is tied to both petroleum and corn prices. The \"food versus fuel\" debate intensified during the 2008 farm bill debate as food price inflation accelerated both in the U.S. and globally, highlighting potential problems with replacing gasoline consumption with corn-based ethanol. Federal programs supporting renewable energy production, including the RFS, are outside the USDA's purview and have legislative origins outside the farm bill. The RFS, federal tax credits for biofuel blenders, and programs supporting biofuels production were established in various legislative acts such as the Energy Policy Act of 2005, American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, Tax Relief Act of 2010, and the 2008 farm bill. These initiatives aim to increase biofuels in the national fuel supply and support renewable energy production. The 2008 farm bill, similar to the 2002 farm bill, includes an energy title (Title IX) focusing on biofuels like ethanol and biodiesel. It maintains the structure of Title IX from the Senate-passed version, with 3 sections replacing provisions from the 2002 bill. The 2008 farm bill introduces 13 new provisions replacing those from the 2002 bill, focusing on biofuels infrastructure and renewable fertilizer. Key provisions include a new cellulosic ethanol production tax credit, promotion of cellulosic feedstocks production, and grants for biofuels research and production. The 2008 farm bill introduces new provisions focusing on biofuels infrastructure and renewable fertilizer, including incentives for cellulosic ethanol production, studies on biofuels market and environmental impacts, federal procurement of bio-based products, rural energy efficiency support, and biodiesel education. The 2008 farm bill energy title provides financial incentives and support for advanced biofuels production, including cellulosic biofuels. This includes grants and loan guarantees to leverage industry investments in new technologies and infrastructure. The Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) supports the production of dedicated crop and forest cellulosic feedstocks. The 2008 farm bill energy title provides financial incentives and support for advanced biofuels production, including cellulosic biofuels. This includes grants and loans for the development, construction, and retrofitting of commercial-scale refineries to produce advanced biofuels. Increased funding for advanced biofuels research is also provided through various programs that support and coordinate research, extension, and development efforts. Cellulosic ethanol is produced from cellulose and hemicellulose. Cellulosic ethanol is produced from cellulose, hemicellulose, or lignin derived from plants, offering long-term supply potential from various agricultural feedstock such as prairie grasses, fast-growing woody crops, and waste biomass materials. Native prairie grasses like switchgrass provide environmental benefits. Cellulosic ethanol, derived from plants like switchgrass, offers environmental benefits and has long-term supply potential. However, commercial production is limited, with only a few small refineries starting production in 2010. The slow progress has led the EPA to reduce the cellulosic biofuel mandates set by Congress for the years 2010 through 2012. The 2008 farm bill extends tax credits and tariffs on ethanol to promote cellulosic ethanol production. A producer tax credit of $1.01 per gallon is available for ethanol produced from qualifying cellulosic feedstocks to encourage investment. Additionally, an ethanol blender tax credit of $0.51 per gallon applies to all ethanol blended, including imports. The ethanol import tariff was reduced to $0.45 per gallon in January 2009 and extended to the end of 2010 by the farm bill. The tariff benefits the U.S. ethanol industry by protecting it from lower-cost imports and offsets the blender tax credit available to any ethanol blended into gasoline in the United States. The Job Creation Act of 2010 extended the ethanol blender tax credit and import tariff until the end of 2011. The tariff exceeds the blender tax credit by nine cents, imposing a punitive duty on imported ethanol. The impact of increased ethanol production on agricultural and rural economies was debated during the farm bill process. The farm bill includes provisions for reports on the impact of ethanol production on the farm economy, environment, and food prices. Studies such as the Comprehensive Study of Biofuels and Biofuels Infrastructure Study will be conducted by various government agencies. The Biomass Crop Assistance Program also requires an assessment of the economic impacts of expanded cellulosic biomass production. The 2008 farm bill authorizes over $1 billion in mandatory funding for various bioenergy programs, including the Biorefinery Assistance Program, Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels, Rural Energy for America Program, and Biomass Research and Development Act. This funding aims to support the expansion and conversion of biorefineries, with a focus on the economic impacts on rural economies. The 2008 farm bill authorizes significant funding for bioenergy programs, including the Biomass Research and Development Act and the Biorefinery Assistance Program. Discretionary funding for energy-related provisions in the bill totals over $1.7 billion, with most of the increase allocated to the Biorefinery Assistance Program. Mandatory funding comes through USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation. The 2008 farm bill authorizes significant funding for bioenergy programs, including the Biomass Research and Development Act and the Biorefinery Assistance Program. Discretionary funding for energy-related provisions in the bill totals over $1.7 billion, with most of the increase allocated to the Biorefinery Assistance Program. Funding levels are determined annually through the appropriations process, with a list of provisions and selected energy programs outlined for FY2010 through FY2012."
