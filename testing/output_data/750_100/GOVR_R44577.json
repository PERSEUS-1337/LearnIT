A conference committee was convened to reconcile differences between the two versions. The House and Senate passed their respective National Defense Authorization Acts for Fiscal Year 2017, containing provisions affecting military personnel. A conference committee reconciled differences between the two versions of the bill. The President signed the final bill into law on December 23, 2016. This report highlights selected personnel-related issues of congressional and constituent interest. Contact information for CRS analysts is provided for each issue. Some issues were previously addressed in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (P.L. 114-92) addressed military personnel issues, including active duty end-strengths for FY2001 in response to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Congress increased authorized personnel numbers over the next decade. Congress increased Army and Marine Corps personnel strength due to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but recent years saw reversals due to troop withdrawals and budget constraints. Air Force and Navy end-strengths have been declining since 2001. FY2016 and FY2017 authorized end-strengths are shown in Figure 1. The Administration's FY2017 budget proposed lowering end-strengths for all services, with the Senate bill approving the same as the Administration's request and the House bill also approving. The House bill approved higher end-strengths for the Army, Marine Corps, and Air Force compared to the Administration's request. The Navy end-strength was reduced in the House bill but still higher than the Administration's request. The final bill set minimum end-strengths equal to the authorized end-strengths for FY2017. The overall authorized end-strength of the Selected Reserves has declined by about 6% over the past 15 years, with reductions in Navy Reserve strength being a significant factor. Authorized end-strengths for the Selected Reserves were set at a level equal to FY2017 levels in the final bill. The FY2017 authorized end-strengths for the Selected Reserve saw reductions for four components and increases for two, as per the Administration's request. The House bill differed by increasing the Army National Guard and Army Reserve end-strengths. The FY2017 authorized end-strengths for the Selected Reserve were adjusted, with reductions for four components and increases for two, as per the Administration's request. The Reserve's end-strength was set to 205,000, with a focus on military pay raise concerns and recruiting high-quality personnel. The formula for automatic annual increase in basic pay is indexed to the Employment Cost Index (ECI), with a 2.1% increase for 2017 unless Congress or the President specifies otherwise. Basic pay increases are effective at the start of the calendar year. In the past three years (2014-2016), the President used alternative pay adjustment authority instead of Congress specifying an increase. The President invoked the alternative pay adjustment authority to set the military pay raise below the ECI. The FY2017 budget requested a 1.6% raise, lower than the statutory formula of 2.1%. The House bill aimed for a 2.1% raise, while the Senate bill proposed a 1.6% increase. The enacted bill specified a 2.1% raise, effective January 1, 2017. The military pay raise for FY2017 was set at 2.1%, effective January 1, 2017. All servicemembers are entitled to government-provided housing or a housing allowance, known as Basic Allowance for Housing in the United States. For those in the United States, the housing allowance is Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH), determined by paygrade, location, and dependents. Geographic location influences the cost of housing profiles, ensuring similar paygrades can afford comparable housing regardless of duty location. The Senate bill proposed changes to how Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) is calculated, focusing on geographic location and paygrade rather than dependents. It would base BAH on actual housing expenditures up to a maximum amount and adjust payments for servicemembers sharing living quarters based on the number of occupants. The new formula for Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) would adjust payments for servicemembers sharing living quarters based on the number of occupants. It would apply to certain members of the Armed Forces starting on January 1, 2018. The Senate provision on BAH eligibility requires DOD to submit proposed regulations by March 31, 2017. The enacted bill mandates a report on transitioning to a new pay structure by March 1, 2017. The conference report in 2017 discussed transitioning to a new pay structure that would eliminate Basic Allowance for Housing and Basic Allowance for Subsistence to recruit and retain a high-quality All-Volunteer Force. The provision aimed to address the evolution of BAH as an entitlement over the past 20 years. The housing allowance is intended as a housing benefit for military members in high-cost areas, shown by its tax-free nature and dependency status differentiation. The Secretary of Defense is directed to plan for a transition to a salary system aligning with the Department's use of the allowance. The military retirement system is a funded, noncontributory, defined benefit system that provides a monthly annuity to servicemembers after 20 years of qualifying service. Changes were enacted in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2016 to modernize and reduce the retirement system. The military retirement system will be modernized by reducing the retired pay multiplier, adding a 401k-type defined contribution element, allowing for a partial lump-sum payment of retired pay, and introducing continuation pay as a retention incentive. These changes will take effect on January 1, 2018, for servicemembers entering on or after that date and those with 12 years or less of service who are eligible and choose to enroll in the new system. Active duty military and veterans' groups closely monitor any alterations to the retirement system. Reductions in retired pay multiplier from 2.5% to 2.0% for those joining after January 1, 2018, have raised concerns about retaining certain occupational specialties. The FY2016 NDAA authorized DOD to provide continuation pay at 12 years of service for an additional 4-year commitment. A provision allows DOD to pay continuation pay between 8 to 12 years of service for a minimum 3-year commitment. The enacted bill allows for continuation pay between 8 to 12 years of service in exchange for a commitment of at least 3 additional years. It also amends procedures for calculating minimum pay for active and reserve component members, ensuring equal pay for reserve component members on active duty. The Senate bill proposed default contributions to the TSP should be to a Roth plan, which was not adopted. A Roth plan is beneficial for young, low-income individuals. Section 631 of the Senate bill was adopted, amending 10 U.S.C. \u00a71409. Section 631 of the Senate bill was adopted, amending 10 U.S.C. \u00a71409 to allow cadets, midshipmen, and reservists a 30-day election period for the new retirement system following commissioning or transfer to active duty. Military servicemembers can receive retired pay after 20 years of service, as per the Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act (USFSPA) of 1982. This act allows state courts to divide disposable military retired pay in divorce cases and grants certain benefits to former spouses. The amount of retired pay for a servicemember is calculated accordingly. The amount of retired pay for a servicemember is calculated based on pay grade and years of service at retirement. Up to 50% of disposable military retired pay can be divided in a divorce case. Proposed changes would use pay grade and years of service at the time of a divorce court order. The enacted bill authorizes this change and includes cost-of-living adjustments for spousal payments. The provision allows adjustments in spousal payments based on pay grade and years of service at the time of a divorce court order. It does not impact divorce settlements before the enactment date.

The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) provides a monthly survivor benefit to eligible recipients after a servicemember's death, usually 55% of the retired basic pay. Previously, the base amount for those who died on active duty was 75% of their basic pay, while reservists who died during inactive-duty training received less based on years of service. This disparate treatment was addressed in the FY2017 NDAA. The FY2017 NDAA addressed the disparate treatment in survivor benefits for those who died on active duty. Surviving spouses receiving both SBP and DIC have their SBP payments reduced by the amount of DIC, with SSIA offsetting the reduction. Sections 642, 643, 646, and 648 of the enacted bill amend certain provisions related to survivor benefits. Section 642 of the enacted bill eliminates differential treatment under the SBP for reserve component and active component members who die from an injury or illness during inactive-duty training. Section 643 allows DOD to withhold SBP payments from Combat Related Special Compensation when retired pay is insufficient. Section 646 extends survivor benefits under Title 10, United States Code. Section 646 of the enacted bill extends survivor benefits under Title 10, United States Code, to cover SBP premiums and pay SSIA until May 31, 2018. It also requires a report on affected individuals within 90 days of enactment. Nearly 65,000 surviving spouses are estimated to receive SSIA in FY2018. Section 648 mandates an independent assessment of SBP by an FFRDC, with a report on the results and recommendations to be submitted to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees. The report on Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) effectiveness includes comparisons with other benefits and alternative insurance options.

Contact: [author name scrubbed]. TRICARE is a DOD-administered health benefits program covering active duty servicemembers, retirees, family members, and survivors. The FY2017 Budget proposed changes to enrollment fees, deductibles, and co-pays, replacing TRICARE Prime, Standard, and Extra with TRICARE Select and Preferred options. New benefit structure includes enrollment fees, deductibles, co-payments, and annual catastrophic cap. The proposal includes changes to enrollment fees, deductibles, co-payments, and annual catastrophic cap for Medicare-enrolled retirees under TRICARE. It also involves increased pharmacy co-pays for retirees and military family members, with a focus on reducing TRICARE for Life expenditures. The MERHCF covers future medical treatment for Medicare eligible uniformed services retirees and dependents. Contributions for FY2017 are $4,252 per active duty servicemember and $1,723 per reserve component member. TRICARE proposals aim to save DOD money through pharmacy co-payment increases and new TRICARE for Life enrollment fees. The enacted bill includes provisions to establish a new TRICARE Select health plan option, set enrollment fees and deductibles for retirees joining TRICARE after January 1, 2018, and require an open enrollment period. The bill includes provisions for a calendar year enrollment period, an open enrollment period with a grace period, limited pre-authorization requirements for TRICARE Prime referrals, a submission of an implementation plan by the Secretary of Defense, and a pilot program. The bill includes provisions for a calendar year enrollment period, open enrollment with a grace period, limited pre-authorization for TRICARE Prime referrals, and a pilot program. It also proposes replacing TRICARE health plan options with a consolidated plan, increasing pharmaceutical co-pays, and establishing a new enrollment fee for future TRICARE-for-Life enrollees. The enacted bill includes a new enrollment fee for future enrollees in the TRICARE-for-Life program. It consolidates TRICARE Standard and Extra into a new TRICARE Preferred plan or a new TRICARE Choice plan. Section 701 amends Chapter 55 of Title 10 to specify cost-sharing amounts for active-duty family members and retirees under TRICARE Select and TRICARE Prime options. The bill includes new cost-sharing provisions for TRICARE beneficiaries, with dollar amounts indexed annually to retirement pay increases. Exceptions will be provided for disability retirees, dependents, and survivors. A new \"reserve and young adult\" category will be created for TRICARE Reserve Select and TRICARE Young Adult Program beneficiaries. Retired beneficiaries eligible for TRICARE before 2018 will face a $150 individual or $300 family annual enrollment fee. The bill introduces new cost-sharing provisions for TRICARE beneficiaries, with annual enrollment fees of $150 for individuals and $300 for families. A report by the Comptroller General is required by February 1, 2020, to review changes in health care coverage, appointment access, provider acceptance, and beneficiary satisfaction. TRICARE Prime beneficiaries may need referrals for care. TRICARE Prime beneficiaries must obtain a waiver or pay 50% of the allowed charge if care is received without a required referral. This was previously discussed in various CRS reports. TRICARE beneficiaries can fill prescriptions at military pharmacies, TRICARE mail-order pharmacy, or TRICARE retail network pharmacies. Active duty servicemembers pay no pharmacy co-payments at military pharmacies. Military pharmacies provide a 90-day supply of formulary medications for free. Generic medications are preferred over brand-name medications. Non-formulary medicines are generally not available at military pharmacies. The 2016 NDAA allowed a one-time $3 increase to pharmacy co-pays and required maintenance drug prescriptions to be filled through mail order or military pharmacies. The Administration's FY2017 budget proposed annual co-payment increases to save $300 million in FY2017 and $2 billion over fiscal years 2017 to 2021. The House-passed bill did not include a provision for a pharmacy co-payment increase. Section 702 of the FY2016 NDAA substituted a $3 increase in co-payments, which took effect on February 1, 2016. The Senate-passed bill would have allowed beneficiaries to continue receiving drugs at no cost in military medical facilities. The bill would have allowed beneficiaries to receive drugs at no cost in military medical facilities, with no changes to cost-sharing for certain groups. The Secretary of Defense could exclude drugs of little value and give preferential status to non-generic drugs on the TRICARE formulary. Implementing Section 702 of the bill would have reduced DOD's pharmacy costs by $640 million over 2017-2021 and decreased health care spending for TRICARE for Life beneficiaries by $2.7 billion over 2017-2026. This section would have treated non-generic drugs as generics for cost-sharing purposes under TRICARE. The Care Fund (MERHCF) would have seen a $1.5 billion reduction in accrual payments over 2018-2021 due to implementing Section 702. The Defense Health Agency (DHA) was established on October 1, 2013. The Defense Health Agency (DHA) was formed on October 1, 2013, to support Armed Forces medical services. It manages shared services, the TRICARE program, and oversees military treatment facilities. The DHA acts as the market manager for the National Capital Region Multi-Service Market. The conference report recommends consolidating all Military Treatment Facilities under a single agency to improve medical force readiness, beneficiary access to care, health outcomes, and reduce costs. The current structure of three separate health systems managed by each Service is seen as hindering rapid decision-making and innovation in healthcare delivery. The conference report proposes consolidating all Military Treatment Facilities under a single agency to enhance medical force readiness, beneficiary access to care, and reduce costs. This streamlined management structure aims to improve healthcare delivery efficiency and experience for beneficiaries by eliminating redundancy and generating monetary savings. Section 702 of the enacted bill mandates the Director of the Defense Health Agency to oversee the administration of each MTF starting October 1, 2018. Starting October 1, 2018, the Defense Health Agency will be responsible for managing all Military Treatment Facilities, including budget, IT, healthcare administration, policy, construction, and other relevant matters. Surgeons General of each service will advise the Secretary and oversee MTF administration. The Surgeons General of each service serve as principal advisors to the Secretary on health and medical matters, recruit, organize, train, and equip medical personnel. Section 702 requires the Secretary to develop an implementation plan and submit reports to the armed services committees by specified dates. The Government Accountability Office will review the DOD implementation plan. The enacted bill adds a new section to Title 10 of the United States Code requiring the Secretary of Defense to maintain medical facilities to support the medical readiness of the armed forces. The provision allows for exceptions when civilian health care facilities are unable to meet the needs of the Armed Forces and covered beneficiaries. The provision allows for exceptions when the Secretary determines that changes in facilities or services hinder a covered beneficiary's access to care through non-DOD providers. Current law specifies eligibility criteria for active component enlistees. The Senate bill proposed amending the citizenship requirements for reserve component enlistees to align with those for the active component, but this provision was not included in the conference bill. The current law requires reserve component enlistees to be citizens, lawful permanent residents, or have prior military service, with the option for waivers if enlistment is deemed vital to national interest. On January 28, 2016, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter announced new policies for maternity and parental leave under Chapter 40 of Title 10 United States Code. Maternity leave was extended from 6 to 12 weeks as part of the \"Force of the Future\" initiative to attract and retain talent in the Armed Forces. DOD sought legislative action to extend parental leave. The Department of Defense extended maternity leave to 12 weeks and sought legislative action to extend parental leave to 14 days. Parental leave for a servicemember whose spouse gives birth was first authorized in 2009 and is currently for a maximum of 10 days. Servicemembers who adopt a child are eligible for up to 21 days of leave since 2006. Parental leave is in addition to regular accrued annual leave. The enacted bill allows up to 12 weeks of total leave for the primary caregiver in connection with the birth of a child, with 6 weeks for convalescent leave. It also grants 6 weeks of leave for a primary caregiver in the case of adoption, and 21 days for secondary caregivers. The Secretary of Defense will define \"primary\" and \"secondary\" caregivers. Leave must be taken within a year of the event. The bill allows up to 12 weeks of leave for the primary caregiver in connection with the birth of a child, with 6 weeks for convalescent leave. It also grants 6 weeks of leave for a primary caregiver in the case of adoption, and 21 days for secondary caregivers. Leave must be taken within a year of the event, and the Secretary of Defense may prescribe regulations for servicemembers taking parental leave. The final bill includes a provision prohibiting military servicemembers from receiving leave not authorized by statute. Approximately 60% of active duty force have dependents, and supporters of paid parental leave argue it aids in recruitment and retention. The final bill includes a provision prohibiting military servicemembers from receiving unauthorized leave. Paid parental leave is supported for its benefits in recruitment and retention. Lengthening military maternity and parental leave is debated for its potential impact on military readiness. Congress has shown interest in improving the Defense Commissary system, authorizing $1.4 billion in funding in FY2016. The FY2016 NDAA authorized $1.4 billion in funding for commissaries, $100 million more than the President's budget request. This funding supports authorized patrons including active duty military members, retired personnel, disabled veterans, and DOD civilians overseas. The NDAA also required a plan for budget neutrality for DeCA and the military exchange system. The FY2016 NDAA authorized $1.4 billion in funding for commissaries, exceeding the President's budget request. A report released by DOD on June 7, 2016, emphasized the challenges of achieving budget neutrality for the commissary and exchange system, stating that privatization would not match the benefits provided by DeCA. Critics urge thorough evaluation by DOD and Congress before considering a pilot program. The DOD report on achieving budget neutrality for commissaries and exchanges by October 2018 did not provide a clear plan to operate without taxpayer dollars and maintain benefits. GAO found that only three out of seven mandated benchmarks were addressed in the report. The DOD report addressed three of the seven mandated benchmarks, but did not define specific metrics for each and only partially discussed the other four elements. Additionally, Section 652 of the FY2016 NDAA required a report on the Commissary Surcharge, Non-appropriated Fund, and Privately-Financed Major Construction Program of the Department of Defense. The report pending discusses reforms to the commissary system, allowing DeCA to set prices based on market conditions and customer demand, and accepting the Military Star Card as payment. These reforms aim to preserve benefits, ensure savings for patrons, provide value for taxpayers, and support morale, welfare, and recreational activities. Reforms to the commissary system include congressional oversight, common business practices, and private sector initiatives like variable pricing and private label products to recover costs and improve efficiency. The pricing program allows DeCA to add a markup to private label goods to offset operating costs. CBO estimates the markup will decrease spending by less than $500,000 over the next decade. DOD must develop a strategy to reduce reliance on appropriated funds for DeCA and military exchanges without compromising benefits or revenue. Commissaries can use flexible pricing to maintain savings levels. The Defense Department may convert the commissary agency to a non-appropriated fund entity if savings are maintained for six months. The Defense Secretary must ensure no DeCA employee faces a pay decrease. DOD can contract with grocery industry experts to improve the commissary system. Acceptance of the Military Star Card is authorized. The conference report authorizes acceptance of the Military Star Card at commissary stores. The memorandum discusses an audit of fresh produce contracts for the U.S. Pacific Command Theater. Congress has enacted legislation and appropriated funds for servicemember off-duty education, credentialing programs, and transition services. Contact information is available for further details. The final bill eliminates the requirement for third-party accreditation of credentialing programs, instead focusing on meeting quality assurance benchmarks. This supports servicemembers and veterans in translating military skills into post-service education and employment opportunities. Notable programs include the Transition Assistance Program (TAP), Credentialing Opportunities Online (COOL), and the DOD Skillbridge program (JTEST-AI). The Senate version did not adopt a provision limiting tuition assistance funds to education and training contributing to professional development. Sections 567 and 568 require DOD reports on transition initiatives for servicemembers to obtain merchant mariner licenses, assess college credit for military skills, and evaluate the JTEST-AI program. Section 3590 sets deadlines for TWIC applications for separating servicemembers. The final version requires DOD to provide information and application for TWIC cards to separating servicemembers as part of TAP. It also mandates notification about recoupment of separation payments and counseling on substance abuse during mandatory TAP training. The House bill's Section 566, authorizing a pilot program for job placement services for reserve component members, was not adopted. The most senior officers in the military are known as general officers (Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps) or flag officers (Navy) and hold important positions in the DOD. The most senior officers in the military are known as general officers or flag officers, holding ranks from 1-star to 4-star. The total number of general and flag officers in each grade is limited by statute, with Congress periodically reviewing and revising their number, duties, and compensation. Section 910 of the House bill would have required specific positions in the Armed Forces to be filled by general or flag officers of a particular grade. The House bill proposed reducing the number of active duty generals and admirals by 5 and establishing a new unified combatant command for cyber operations led by an admiral or general. The Senate bill aimed to reduce the number of authorized active and reserve general and flag officers. The Senate bill proposed reducing the number of authorized active and reserve General and Flag Officers (GFOs) by 25% as of December 31, 2017. The reductions would be more significant for higher-ranking GFOs, with the maximum number of 3-star and 4-star GFOs dropping from 206 to 111. Additionally, certain statutory grade requirements in various fields would be eliminated, allowing the Department of Defense to set grades as needed. The enacted bill requires the Secretary of Defense to reduce the total number of General and Flag Officers (GFOs) on active duty by 110 positions by December 31, 2022, amounting to an 11% reduction in authorized positions. However, since only 889 of the 962 authorized positions are currently filled, the reduction in GFO personnel will be smaller than the reduction in positions. The reductions in authorized positions for General and Flag Officers (GFOs) will be distributed among the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and joint pool. The Secretary of Defense can adjust these reductions for national security reasons, with notification to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees. Additional reporting requirements and temporary allocation of 30 GFO positions to the joint pool for contingency operations are included in Section 501. The provision mandates reporting requirements on implementation and a global manpower study for General and Flag Officers, with a 10% reduction in authorized positions. Results of the study are due to be submitted to Congress by April 1, 2017. The Unified Command Plan and Combatant Commands are discussed in Chapter 38 of Title 10 U.S.C., focusing on the qualifications of active duty officers in joint matters. There is ongoing debate regarding the adequacy of current qualification requirements in developing officers with a balanced mix of service and joint experiences. The definition of joint matters involves achieving unified action by integrated military forces across various domains, including national military strategy, strategic planning, command and control, national security planning, combined operations with allied nations, and acquisition matters. To become a joint qualified officer, individuals must complete specific joint professional military education requirements and a full tour of duty in a joint assignment. Joint duty assignments are typically two years for general and flag officers and three years for other officers, with the option for the Secretary of Defense to waive this requirement. Both the House and Senate bills aimed to standardize the length of joint duty assignments at two years for all officers. The bills aimed to standardize joint duty assignments at two years for all officers, expanding the definition of joint matters to include various duties under unified command. The Secretary of Defense could designate other joint matters in regulation. The enacted bill standardized joint duty assignments at two years for all officers and expanded the definition of joint matters to include various duties under unified command. The bill also modified the definition of joint duty assignment to require that the preponderance of the officer's duties involve joint matters. The Military Selective Service Act (MSSA) authorizes the Selective Service System (SSS) to deliver qualified civilian men for induction into the Armed Forces. Most males aged 18-26 in the US must register. The Military Selective Service Act requires males aged 18-26 in the US to register with Selective Service. Failure to register can result in penalties and loss of benefits. Women in the US have never been required to register for the draft, but recent policy changes have raised questions about this exemption. Some question the need for Selective Service registration for women, as recent policy changes have raised concerns about the exemption. The Senate bill proposed expanding registration to women turning 18 after January 1, 2018, but this provision was not included in the final bill. There are debates on the necessity of the Selective Service System and alternative methods for meeting emergency manpower needs. The final bill requires the Department of Defense to review the Selective Service System and analyze potential manpower needs in emergencies. It establishes the National Commission on Military, National, and Public Service to examine these issues over 36 months with a budget of $15 million. The provision establishes the National Commission on Military, National, and Public Service over 36 months with $15 million in funding in FY2017. Background: Issues of sexual assault and harassment in the military have received significant congressional and media attention in the past decade. In 2005, DOD issued its first department-wide sexual assault policies and procedures, building on recommendations from the Joint Task Force for Sexual Assault Prevention and Response. The task force became the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (SAPRO) that oversees service-level programs. DOD released its first Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR) strategic plan in May 2013 with an update in January 2015. Between 2012 and 2016, DOD implemented strategic initiatives and congressionally mandated actions related to military justice, investigations, sexual assault prevention, victim services, and reporting. The Senate bill would extend reporting requirements on sexual assault in the military until 2025. The Senate bill extends reporting requirements on sexual assault in the military until 2025, moving the deadline for annual reports to Congress to March 31. The estimated cost for preparing the FY2015 report was $6.9 million, which included findings from focus groups and surveys on sexual assault prevention and response in the military. Feedback from these studies highlighted concerns about retaliation associated with reporting. Studies show that servicemembers are worried about retaliation when reporting sexual assault. Concerns exist about the understanding of different types of retaliation, leading to confusion in investigations. Both House and Senate bills aimed to increase training for investigators, with the enacted bill adopting the Senate's provision. The House bill's proposal to align burden of proof requirements with other laws on retaliation investigations was not included in the final bill. The conferees are concerned about reports of retaliation against military personnel making protected communications. They intend to assess the impact of the bill's provisions on reducing retaliation in the military. Sections 543 and 545 require DOD to report on efforts to prevent and respond to retaliation in connection with military sexual assault. Congress has also raised concerns about discharge character for certain veterans. Congress has raised concerns about discharge character for certain veterans who experienced sexual trauma while serving in the military. Other-than-honorable discharges can impact eligibility for veteran's benefits, but servicemembers can appeal through a discharge review board. Additional medical assessments and enhanced discharge review board consideration are provided by law for servicemembers with PTSD or TBI in connection with combat. The enacted bill amends the law to include servicemembers and veterans who experienced PTSD or TBI. The enacted bill amends the law to apply to servicemembers and veterans who experienced PTSD or TBI in connection with sexual trauma, modifying the definition of sexual harassment in the military. The enacted bill modifies the definition of sexual harassment in the military for investigating complaints by commanding officers. In FY2014, there were 7,676 confirmed cases of child abuse or neglect in military homes, raising concerns about prevention and reporting in the Armed Forces. DOD's Family Advocacy Program (FAP) implements child and domestic abuse prevention initiatives, responds to suspected abuse cases, provides victim advocacy services, and shares data with states. Section 575 of the final bill requires DOD personnel to notify state child welfare agencies about suspected child abuse cases involving military members or their spouses. Section 574 of the bill mandates an annual report to Congress by the Family Advocacy Program on child and domestic abuse cases, with the first report due by April 30, 2017. This requirement will end after April 30, 2021. Section 578 would have required DOD schools and certain educational agencies to conduct employee criminal background checks. The final bill did not include a provision for employee criminal background checks. Instead, it urged the Department of Defense to work closely with local school districts to share best practices for developing comprehensive employment screening policies to ensure the safety of military children. The Department is directed to provide a report to Congress on these efforts. The Department of Defense is required to report to Congress within a year on efforts to identify and address any shortcomings in employee screening processes in local school districts educating military family members. In 2013, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel directed a comprehensive review of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and its implementation through the Manual for Courts-Martial (MCM) and service regulations, following a recommendation from Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Martin Dempsey. Secretary Hagel directed a review of the UCMJ and MCM, leading to the establishment of the Military Justice Review Group (MJRG) to propose legislative changes and implementing rules. The Department of Defense submitted the MJRG's work on December 28, 2015. The Department of Defense submitted the Military Justice Act of 2016 to Congress on December 28, 2015, proposing revisions to the UCMJ. The House bill included comprehensive changes to military justice, covering courts-martial composition, trial procedure, sentencing, and appellate matters. For instance, the House bill would allow the government to appeal sentences that violated the law or were plainly unreasonable. The House bill proposed significant revisions to the UCMJ, including changes to punitive articles and the creation of new offenses such as prohibited activities with military recruits and fraudulent activities. Previously, only servicemembers had the right to appeal sentences that violated the law or were plainly unreasonable. The proposed Senate bill addresses various aspects of military justice, including offenses such as fraudulent use of credit cards and retaliation. Differences exist between the House and Senate language, with the House allowing the government to appeal sentences that violate the law. The Senate bill proposed changes to military justice, including creating military-specific sentencing parameters and criteria. It differed significantly from the House language in its approach to offenses related to rape and sexual assault. The final bill includes a comprehensive revision of the UCMJ, with some language not included such as interim guidance on sentencing parameters, an increase in minimum punishment for sex-related offenses, and changes to Article 120. The final bill includes a revision of the UCMJ, with changes to Article 120 expanding the definition of sexual acts to include coercion through position, rank, or authority. The MOH review process has been criticized for being bureaucratic and lengthy, potentially leading to lost records and conflicting evidence. The MOH review process has faced criticism for being bureaucratic and lengthy, resulting in lost records and conflicting evidence. Efforts to maintain the integrity of the award process have led to reluctance in retroactively awarding the MOH or upgrading other awards. This has sparked concerns that deserving individuals are being denied earned medals, prompting periodic reviews by the DOD, including a recent year-long review announced on January 6, 2016.
