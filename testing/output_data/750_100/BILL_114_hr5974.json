In August 2013, Islamist-led mobs burned and destroyed Christian properties in Egypt after the government led by the Muslim Brotherhood was removed. The succeeding government, under President Sisi, announced that the army would rebuild the damaged churches at government expense. President Sisi made an appearance at a Coptic Christian Christmas liturgy in January 2015, and in January 2016, he promised to fix and renovate the churches that were burned during the 2013 sectarian violence. The Egyptian military and private citizens have restored a total of 49 out of 78 churches and Christian buildings damaged during the August 2013 sectarian violence. 29 buildings in 24 locations still need to be restored as of September 6, 2016. President Sisi promised to fix and renovate all damaged buildings by next year. In August 2016, Egypt passed a new law imposing burdens on church construction. Government approval for building churches has led to sectarian violence targeting Christians. In El-`Our, Minya, villagers protested the building of a new church in honor of beheaded Egyptian Christians. President Sisi approved the construction. Protestors armed with Molotov cocktails besieged a village church approved by President Sisi in response to Coptic Orthodox Church leaders' calls. They set fire to a Christian-owned vehicle and threw bricks at another Christian's house. Egyptian government officials engage in reconciliation sessions to address such incidents. The Coptic Christians in Egypt have been the indigenous people for over 2,000 years and represent the largest Christian community in the Middle East.
