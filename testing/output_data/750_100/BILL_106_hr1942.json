FINDINGS.\" The Congress finds that free trade agreements benefit citizens by improving income and prosperity through open markets, competition, and lower costs. APEC's 21 member economies aim for \"free and open trade\" by 2020 for developing countries and 2010 for developed countries. Continued economic growth in the Pacific Rim region is crucial for the strategic and economic interests of the United States, especially in light of the financial crisis affecting Asia. During 1989-1997, the United States focused on trade with countries like New Zealand, Australia, and Singapore to open markets amidst global economic challenges. Free trade agreements helped leverage market access for US goods and services, aligning with allies to promote trade liberalization in organizations like the World Trade Organization and APEC. The United States must continue promoting its interests in the Asia-Pacific region through trade negotiations for liberalization in the World Trade Organization and APEC. Building closer ties with friendly countries will have significant payoffs as negotiations proceed in the next century. Bilateral trade agreement negotiations are crucial. Bilateral trade agreement negotiations can positively impact multilateral and regional trade talks by expanding common areas of agreement on trade disciplines. This can lead to more successful negotiations with additional trading partners. Resolving trade and investment disputes between the United States and Pacific Rim countries through mutually agreed-upon disciplines and dispute settlement mechanisms is more effective than addressing issues individually. Free trade agreements between the United States and Pacific Rim countries will enhance cooperation and market access, ensuring mutually beneficial economic and political relations. Competing effectively in Pacific Rim markets will help stabilize the trade balance between the United States and countries in the region. The United States aims to enhance trade policy with eligible Pacific Rim countries to stabilize the trade balance in the region. The United States aims to eliminate tariff and nontariff barriers through bilateral free trade agreements with Pacific Rim countries, addressing regulatory barriers, foreign investment treatment, and intellectual property protection. The United States aims to eliminate barriers such as discriminatory standards, government measures like price controls, and unfair trade activities through free trade agreements with Pacific Rim countries. SEC. 3. PRENEGOTIATION CONSULTATIONS. Within 60 days of enacting the Act, the President will identify and consult with eligible Pacific Rim countries. If feasible, a ministerial meeting will be requested to discuss the conditions for starting formal negotiations on a free trade agreement. Within 6 months of ministerial meetings with eligible Pacific Rim countries, the US International Trade Commission will advise the President on the economic effects of providing duty-free treatment for their products on US industries and consumers. SEC. 4. MINISTERIAL MEETING RECOMMENDATIONS. The President recommends establishing a council of public and private sector officials to review aspects of the bilateral relationship for a free trade agreement. This includes analyzing trade and investment practices, customs laws, and harmonizing economic data. The council will review trade and investment practices, customs laws, and economic data. Within 6 months, a report on the bilateral relationship and prospects for a free trade agreement will be issued, including benefits, adverse effects, and dispute settlement mechanisms. The council will review trade and investment practices, customs laws, and economic data to determine the feasibility and desirability of negotiating free trade agreements with eligible countries. The President will make a determination on the feasibility and desirability of starting formal negotiations for a free trade agreement with a Pacific Rim country or countries, based on reports from bilateral councils and advice from the Advisory Committee for Trade Policy Negotiations. The President will determine the feasibility of establishing a free trade area with a Pacific Rim country based on factors like WTO membership and interest in a bilateral agreement. The country has pursued trade liberalization and economic reforms to achieve a market-driven economy, demonstrating affinity for US trade policy objectives. It is actively participating in preparations for the World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference. The country, from November 30 to December 3, 1999, has shown commitment to US objectives for the World Trade Organization negotiations, working to eliminate export requirements, harmonize standards, and increase economic opportunities for small- and medium-sized businesses through deregulation. The country is working to eliminate trade barriers, provide national treatment for foreign investment, accommodate US market access objectives, resolve trade disputes with the US, and improve dispute settlement mechanisms in bilateral trade relationships. The United States will benefit from improved dispute settlement mechanisms and enhanced market access by eliminating trade barriers and structural impediments. The President must consult with specific congressional committees regarding the implementation of the Act. The Act defines eligible Pacific Rim countries as WTO members and APEC economies."
