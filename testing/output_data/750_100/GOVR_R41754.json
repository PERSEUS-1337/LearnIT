    "content": "The Senate Appropriations Committee reported a bill appropriating funds for the Departments of Transportation and Housing and Urban Development for FY2013. The bill recommends $3.210 billion for activities funded under the Community Development Fund account, including funding for HUD's Community Development Block Grant Program and Section 108 loan guarantees. The President's federal budget request for FY2013 includes $3.143 trillion for discretionary spending. The budget proposal for FY2013 includes $3.143 billion for the Community Development Fund account under the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Community Development Block Grant program is the largest federal source of financial assistance for neighborhood revitalization and economic development, allocated to 1,176 entitlement communities. The Obama Administration's budget request for FY2013 includes $3.143 billion for the Community Development Fund account under the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Grants are used to address housing, community, and economic development needs in metropolitan cities, states, and insular areas. The Administration's FY2013 budget proposal includes a 4.5% increase in funding for CDF account activities, totaling $135 million. This increase would reinstate funding for the Sustainable Communities Initiative and transfer funding for Section 4 capacity building activities from another HUD account. Specifically, $100 million is requested for the Sustainable Communities Initiative, which had no funding in FY2012 but received $99 million in FY2011. The Administration's FY2013 budget proposal includes a $135 million increase in funding for CDF account activities. This includes $60 million for the Capacity Building for Community Development and Affordable Housing program, which is being transferred from the Self-Help Housing Assistance account to the CDF account. Funding for the CDBG formula grants would remain unchanged from FY2012, with $2.948.1 billion requested for FY2013. The Administration's FY2013 budget includes $60 million for Indian tribes, $7 million for insular areas, and $100 million for the SCI program. The SCI program activities are recommended for reinstatement with a funding request of $100 million to support planning-oriented grants. Planning Grants. $46 million competitively awarded to regional organizations in up to 25 metropolitan areas to support the development of sustainable communities in collaboration with DOT, EPA, and other federal agencies. Grant awards focus on housing, transportation, economic development, energy, and land use planning. Community Challenge Grants. $46 million competitively awarded to up to 50 communities to reform building codes, land use, and zoning ordinances. $8 million allocated for a research initiative by HUD, DOT, and EPA to evaluate the benefits of sustainable growth efforts, including Regional Integrated Planning Grants and Community Challenge Grants. The Administration is requesting $3 million for technical support in developing a residential energy modeling system, common energy standards, and sources of funding for energy efficiency improvements. This is in addition to the $8 million allocated for a research initiative on sustainable growth efforts. Communities can borrow up to five times their annual CDBG allocation for 20 years by collateralizing it to attract private capital for economic development, housing, and infrastructure projects. The borrowed funds must support job creation and meet CDBG program goals, benefiting low to moderate-income individuals or addressing community challenges. The Administration's budget proposes doubling the program's loan commitment ceiling from $240 million in FY2012 to $500 million in FY2013 to help local governments finance job creation activities. Additionally, the program may be revamped by charging a fee-based assessment to borrowers accessing the program. The Administration proposed revamping the program by charging a fee-based assessment to borrowers, eliminating the need for a credit subsidy. In FY2013, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $3.210 billion for CDF activities, including $3.100 billion for CDBG formula grants. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $3.210 billion for CDF activities in FY2013, including $3.100 billion for CDBG formula grants. The bill also supports the Administration's $60 million funding request for Indian tribes and recommends restoring funding for SCI activities with an appropriation of $50 million, half of the amount requested by the Administration. Additionally, HUD would allocate $12.5 million of the appropriated amount to SCI activities in communities with populations less than 500,000. The bill supports the Administration's budget request for SCI activities in communities with populations less than 500,000, including converting Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based program and increasing the loan guarantee commitment to $500 million for FY2013. The Senate committee bill recommends continued funding for Section 4 activities at $35 million but does not support transferring the program from its current account. The House Appropriations Committee reported the Transportation and Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies Appropriations act on June 20, 2012. The bill, H.R. 5972, recommends $3.404 billion for activities funded under the CDF account, including $3.344 billion for CDBG formula grants. This is 13% more than the previous year's appropriation and 8% more than recommended in the Senate bill, S. 2322. H.R. 5972 supports the Administration's $60 million funding request for Indian tribes but does not include a set-aside of CDBG funds for a new round of funding. The House bill, H.R. 5972, does not set aside CDBG funds for new SCI activities. Instead, it recommends $2 million for closeout and evaluation of previous SCI awards. The program is unauthorized and lacks support from the House Financial Services Committee. The bill also rejects the Administration's proposal to convert Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based structure, opting instead for $6 million in loan subsidies to support a $244 million loan guarantee ceiling. The House bill, H.R. 5972, recommends $6 million in loan subsidies to support a $244 million loan guarantee ceiling. It also suggests continued funding for Section 4 activities at $35 million but does not support transferring the program from its current account. During floor debate, amendments calling for funding reductions or elimination of CDBG and Section 108 loan guarantee programs were introduced but not approved. During the House floor debate on H.R. 5972, several amendments proposing funding reductions or eliminations for CDBG and Section 108 loan guarantee programs were introduced but ultimately defeated. During the second half of 2011, Congress debated the Administration's budget recommendations for FY2012, focusing on reducing federal spending to address the deficit. A proposed amendment to allocate more Neighborhood Stabilization Program funds for demolition was challenged as legislation in an appropriation bill. The chair sustained the point of order, emphasizing the need to balance federal spending control with funding for activities supporting private sector job growth. The Obama Administration proposed restructuring the CDF account in the FY2012 budget to support private sector job creation and defend the CDBG program against funding cuts. The Obama Administration proposed restructuring the CDF account in the FY2012 budget by reducing funding for CDBG formula grants, eliminating funding for NI and EDI programs, and transferring SCI to a new account. The proposed funding level was $3.804 billion, representing a 14.5% reduction. The Obama Administration proposed restructuring the CDF account in the FY2012 budget by reducing funding for CDBG formula grants and eliminating funding for NI and EDI programs. The proposed funding level was $3.804 billion, representing a 14.5% reduction. For FY2012, the Administration requested an 11.5% increase in funding for the CDBG states and entitlement communities formula components of the CDF account, from $3.296 billion appropriated in FY2011 to $3.684 billion. Additionally, funding for CDBG grants to insular areas and Indian tribes was requested at $7 million and $65 million, respectively.

The proposed funding level was $3.804 billion, representing a 14.5% reduction. For FY2012, the Administration requested an 11.5% increase in funding for the CDBG states and entitlement communities formula components of the CDF account, from $3.296 billion appropriated in FY2011 to $3.684 billion. Additionally, funding for CDBG grants to insular areas and Indian tribes was requested at $7 million and $65 million, respectively. The Administration also requested $25 million for Rural Innovation Grants and $23 million for Guam to address community development needs arising from the relocation of military facilities and personnel to the island. The Administration's FY2012 budget proposed restructuring the CDF account by reducing funding for CDBG formula grants and eliminating NI and EDI programs. They recommended transferring SCI programs to a new stand-alone account and requested $150 million for FY2012 to support Regional Integrated Planning Grants and Community Challenge Grants. The Administration's FY2012 budget proposed $40 million for Community Challenge Grants to reform building codes and land use, $10 million for Housing-Transportation Integration Research, and doubling the loan commitment ceiling to $500 million. The Administration proposed increasing funding to help local governments finance job creation activities in light of credit market difficulties. They suggested charging a fee to borrowers accessing the program to eliminate the need for a credit subsidy, but Congress rejected this proposal. The House Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, HUD, and Related Agencies approved a draft bill for FY2012. The Subcommittee on THUD approved a draft bill on September 8, 2011, recommending $3.501 billion for CDF activities. The draft bill included $3.466 billion for CDBG formula grants and $35 million for Indian tribes. The accompanying draft report noted a recommendation to eliminate the program in the FY2012 Budget Resolution. The draft bill recommended shifting funding priorities for community development activities, including reducing funding for CDBG Indian Tribes from $64 million to $35 million. It emphasized that states and local communities should use more of their own taxes for these activities to increase transparency and accountability. The subcommittee draft bill recommended maintaining the current structure of Section 108 loan guarantees, including appropriating $6.8 million in credit subsidies to support $275 million in loan guarantees. It also rejected the Administration's proposal to restructure the program to a fee-based system, citing concerns about increased costs and hindering capital investment in distressed areas. Additionally, the bill included a provision to lower the ceiling on the percentage of funds grantees could use to cover CDBG expenses. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended reducing CDBG administrative expenses from 20% to 10% of the grantee's allocation in the Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development Appropriations Act for FY2012. The proposed CDF funding would decrease to $3.0 billion, with an additional $400 million for CDBG disaster assistance. This was $500 million less than FY2011 appropriations and $280.4 million less than requested. The Senate bill recommended $2.851 billion for CDBG formula funding, reducing it by 13.7% from FY2011 levels. It also suggested $90 million for the Sustainable Communities Initiative, $60 million less than requested. Senator Inouye submitted an amendment to H.R. 2112, the Agriculture, Farm and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, on October 13, 2011. The Senate approved a consolidated appropriations bill known as the \"Minibus\" on November 1, 2011. One of the approved amendments, S.Amdt. 796 proposed by Senator Coburn, aimed to prevent the use of grants from the bill to repay federal loans, impacting programs like the CDBG and Section 108 loan guarantee. The Section 108 loan guarantee program allows CDBG funds to be used as collateral to secure and repay Section 108 loan guarantees in case of default. States and communities have used CDBG funds to cover revenue shortfalls associated with the repayment of bonds for Section 108 projects. The House requested a conference to reconcile differences in the bill, leading to the approval of the conference version of H.R. 2112 by the House and Senate. The conference version of H.R. 2112 was approved by the House and Senate on November 17, 2011, and signed into law as P.L. 112-55 on November 18, 2011. The act allocated $3.308 billion for CDF activities, including $300 million for CDBG disaster activities. The funds were mainly for core CDBG programs, with $60 million for Indian Tribes and $2.948 billion for formula grants to states, entitlement communities, and insular areas. The $2.948 billion for CDBG formula grants is 10.7% less than in FY2011. The FY2012 CDF funding was 19.6% less than requested by the President, 15% less than recommended by the House, but 3.4% more than recommended by the Senate. Funding for previous activities like the Sustainable Communities Initiative was not directly funded, but could be carried out with CDBG and Transformation Initiative funds. The decrease in CDBG funding and elimination of other program funding aimed to reduce federal spending for deficit reduction. P.L. 112-55 did not include a provision from the Senate version of H.R. 2112. The House recommended reducing the percentage of CDBG funds for administrative expenses from 20% to 10%, but this provision was not included in the final act. The act did include a provision for a study by the GAO on the effectiveness of CDBG and HOME block grant programs, to be completed within 180 days. The P.L. 112-55 act required a study to be completed within 180 days and a progress report on grantee accountability within 120 days. HUD was also directed to analyze the use of CDBG funds for matching fund requirements. Additionally, the Administration's proposal to convert Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based program was not supported by Congress for the third year in a row. P.L. 112-55 maintained the Section 108 loan guarantee program structure with $5.952 million in credit subsidies for $240 million in commitments. It also prohibited states from diverting proceeds from notes sales to other communities. Additionally, $400 million in CDBG supplemental disaster assistance was included in the FY2012 appropriations. The FY2012 appropriations included $400 million in CDBG supplemental disaster assistance for states and local governments to manage recovery efforts in declared disaster areas. Funds were to be used for disaster relief, long-term recovery plans, housing restoration, infrastructure, and economic revitalization. Eligible recipients had to submit a detailed disaster recovery plan to receive funds. The FY2012 appropriations included $400 million in CDBG supplemental disaster assistance for states and local governments to manage recovery efforts in declared disaster areas. The act allowed HUD to waive certain provisions governing the use of CDBG funds, exempting $100 million from spending limits. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2011 included a provision appropriating $3.508 billion for the Community Development Fund (CDF), with a mandatory rescission of 0.2% and a discretionary transfer to the Department's Transformation Initiative. This reduced the CDF account's total appropriation to $3.501 billion, approximately 16% below the original amount. The CDF account's total appropriation was reduced to $3.501 billion, approximately 16% below the original amount. The Community Development Block Grant program was targeted for significant budget reductions in an earlier version of a consolidated appropriations bill. Funding for HUD's Community Development Fund, including the CDBG program, was initially targeted for reduction to reduce the federal budget deficit. The House-passed H.R. 1 bill aimed to reduce federal budget deficit by cutting funding for discretionary programs by $61 billion. The CDF account, including the CDBG program, was among those targeted for cuts. However, the bill failed to win Senate approval, leading to renewed negotiations between the Obama Administration and Congress. After failed Senate approval, negotiations between the Obama Administration and Congress led to the signing of P.L. 112-10, the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2011, to avoid a government shutdown. $3.508 billion was appropriated for activities in the CDF. P.L. 112-10 allocated $3.508 billion for CDF activities, with $3.343 billion for CDBG formula funds. The act included a 0.2% mandatory cut and a 1% transfer to HUD's Transformation Initiative, reducing the CDF account to $3.501 billion and transferring $35 million. The P.L. 112-10 allocated $3.501 billion for CDF activities, which is 21.3% less than the previous year's appropriation. The FY2011 appropriation is 133% higher than recommended by H.R. 1. The FY2011 appropriation for CDF activities is 133% higher than recommended by H.R. 1. It includes funding for the CDBG program, which provides grants to various entities, and the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) aimed at regional land use and housing coordination. P.L. 112-10 reduced funding for CDBG formula grants by 16.4%. The House passed H.R. 1, reducing funding for the CDF account by 66.3% below FY2010 levels. It also prohibited funds for earmarks and the Administration's Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI). Funding for the CDBG program was not allocated among its components. The CDBG program allocates funds to entitlement communities, states, insular areas, and Indian tribes. The House-passed H.R. 1 reduced funding for the CDF account by 66.3% and prohibited funds for earmarks and the SCI. Senator Inouye made adjustments to the allocation of funds among CDBG components. Senator Inouye submitted an amendment to H.R. 1 for Senate consideration, which included $4.230 billion for CDF activities, with $3.990 billion allocated for the CDBG program. The amendment aimed to freeze CDBG formula grant funds at the FY2010 level, with insular areas receiving $7 million and Indian tribes $40 million. The Senate bill aimed to freeze CDBG formula grant funds at FY2010 levels, allocating $40 million to Indian tribes. FY2011 CDBG appropriations were $3.296 billion, a 16.4% decrease from FY2010. FY2012 saw a further reduction to $2.942 billion for entitlement communities and states, a 10.7% decrease from FY2011. The average grant amount for entitlement communities declined from $2.4 million in FY2010 to $1.7 million in FY2012, a 29.1% reduction. The average state allocation also decreased by 25.4% from $23.2 million in FY2010 to $17.3 million in FY2012 due to lower appropriations and an increase in qualifying communities. This represents a decline in resources available for local community and economic development. The proposed reduction in funding in H.R. 1 would impact long-term community and economic development plans, forcing states and local governments to postpone or terminate activities supporting job creation, public facilities, and services. This would also affect non-profit organizations serving as resources. The reduction in funding in H.R. 1 would impact non-profit organizations managing CDBG-funded public services, facilities, and activities for low and moderate income households. This reduction would also affect long-term community and economic development plans, forcing states and local governments to postpone or terminate activities supporting job creation and public services. The CDBG program faces reduced funding, impacting entitlement communities' projects and support for community-based organizations. FY2010-2012 distribution data shows decreased allocations, affecting job creation and public services. The CDBG program saw reduced funding in FY2010-2012, with allocations decreasing for entitlement communities. P.L. 112-10 and P.L. 112-55 reduced formula allocations by 16.4% and 25.1% respectively. 70% of the funds for CDBG eligible activities are allocated to cities and urban areas. In each fiscal year, 70% of CDBG funds are allocated to entitlement communities, while the remaining 30% goes to nonentitlement communities. Formula A is used to allocate funds to metropolitan cities and urban counties. Formula A, created in 1974, allocates CDBG funds to metropolitan cities and urban counties based on weighted factors: population (0.25), poverty (0.50), and overcrowded housing (0.25). The CDBG program, established in 1977 with the passage of P.L. 95-128, allocates funds to metropolitan cities and urban counties based on factors like population growth lag, poverty share, and housing built before 1940. The CDBG program allocates funds to metropolitan cities and urban counties based on population, poverty, and housing factors. HUD uses the most recent census data and OMB reports for fund allocation. HUD will use Census Bureau data from the 2010 Decennial Census and the 2005-2009 American Community Survey (ACS) five-year estimates for CDBG fund allocations, allowing for more accurate reflection of demographic changes. Prior to FY2012, HUD used the 2000 Decennial Census for data sources. HUD released a study in December 2011 on the impact of using 2010 Census and ACS data for CDBG fund allocations. The study assumed constant eligible entities and appropriations from FY2011 to FY2012 to isolate the effect of the new data sources on fund distribution. Key findings from the study were provided. Communities in Puerto Rico, the Mid-Atlantic, and Pacific/Hawaii regions saw a decline in CDBG allocations due to changes in data sources, while those in the Rocky Mountain, Great Plains, and Midwest regions experienced an increase. The introduction of new data sources led to changes in CDBG allocations, with principal cities and urban counties receiving more funds while other entitlement cities saw a decrease. Factors such as poverty rates, overcrowding, and housing age influenced these changes. States like New Mexico and Puerto Rico experienced the largest funding declines. The report discusses a decline in funding for entitlement communities, with factors such as poverty rates and overcrowded housing influencing the changes. It includes a comparison of funding allocations for entitlement communities and a review of the CDF account's funding history from FY2000 to FY2011. Figure 1 illustrates the distribution of the primary components of CDF. The report can be found at http://www.huduser.org/publications/pdf/cdbg_redis_eff.pdf. The distribution of the primary components of the CDF account has fluctuated between $3.772 billion and $5.112 billion from FY2000 to 2010. FY2011 saw the lowest appropriation in over a decade, with the CDBG-formula component funding level being a topic of debate. Supporters advocate for increased funding due to a perceived decline in appropriations. Supporters of the CDBG program have pushed for more funding, citing a decrease in appropriations and the growing number of entitlement communities. Critics argue that funding increases are not justified based on the program's performance scores. The CDBG program's funding has been justified based on the PART score and the need to reduce domestic discretionary spending to lower the federal budget deficit and national debt. From FY2000 to FY2010, the average grant amount for CDBG entitlement communities decreased by 26.7%. However, since FY2008, the average allocation has increased by 9% to $2.4 million in FY2010. The average allocation for CDBG entitlement communities increased by 9% to $2.4 million in FY2010 but decreased to an estimated $1.9 million in FY2011, 34.5% less than FY2000. The decline is due to fewer dollars appropriated and more entitlement communities. The number of jurisdictions receiving direct allocations increased by 155 from FY2000 to FY2011. In FY2010, $1.183 billion was allocated among the 50 states and Puerto Rico for distribution to nonentitlement communities. The average state allocation declined from a high of $25.5 million in FY2002 to $21.1 million in FY2008 before rebounding to $23.2 in FY2010. However, the FY2011 average state allocation of $19.1 million reverses that upward trend. The FY2011 estimated average allocation is 23.3% less than the FY2000 amount. The FY2011 estimated average allocation for CDBG formula grants is 23.3% less than the FY2000 amount and 17.7% less than the FY2010 average state allocation. Program funding declined by 40% in inflation-adjusted constant dollars from $4.235 billion in FY2000 to $2.545 billion in FY2011. Appropriations for CDBG formula grants have fluctuated between $3.5 billion and $4.3 billion in current dollars over the last decade. The CDF includes other programs with smaller appropriations and narrower objectives. From FY2000 to FY2011, appropriations for set-aside programs in the CDF account varied significantly, with Congress allocating $647 million in FY2001 but only $61 million in FY2007. Earmarks were eliminated in FY2007, leading to fluctuations in the number and funding of set-aside programs. In FY2007, Congress allocated $61 million in the CDF account, eliminating all earmarks. In FY2010, $509 million was appropriated for CDF set-aside activities, with a focus on Economic Development Initiative (EDI) and Neighborhood Initiative (NI) earmarks. However, funding for these earmarked accounts was eliminated in FY2011 due to Congress's decisions on categorical grant programs. In FY2000 to FY2011, funding for specific programs in the CDF account fluctuated, with a significant decline in CDBG-related set-asides and earmarks by 59.4% from FY2000 to FY2008. However, there was a rebound in FY2009 and FY2010 before declining again in FY2011. Earmarked funding for EDI and NI programs was eliminated in FY2011 due to Congress's decisions on categorical grant programs. The Obama Administration's Sustainable Communities Initiative introduced congressional earmarked projects funded by the EDI and NI programs as dominant elements of CDBG-related set aside appropriations. Earmarks have been a source of debate in recent Congresses, with all earmarks removed from the CDF account in FY2007. New rules for disclosure of earmark requests were implemented by both houses of Congress. Since FY2007, EDI and NI earmarks have been included in subsequent legislation appropriating funds for CDF activities. In FY2008 and FY2009, EDI and NI earmarks were the main components of CDBG-linked set asides programs, with appropriations twice the amount for other activities. Congress did not fund NI and EDI earmarks in FY2011 but has used CDBG framework for supplemental appropriations for disaster relief and recovery efforts. The curr_chunk discusses various assistance programs aimed at responding to events like terrorist attacks, natural disasters, and economic recessions. This includes funding for acquiring, rehabilitating, and reselling foreclosed properties, as well as supporting job creation efforts. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) allocated disaster relief and Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) funding to states or communities meeting specific criteria. CDBG disaster funding is only given to communities designated as disaster areas by a presidential declaration, with Congress deciding on supplemental funds beyond FEMA's typical assistance. The NSP-1 and NSP-3 rounds provided additional support for stabilizing neighborhoods. Funds from NSP-1 and NSP-3 were allocated to states based on mortgage-related factors. Each state had to distribute a portion of these funds to local governments with high rates of mortgage issues. Direct allocation of NSP funds to communities was limited by Congress. The Neighborhood Stabilization Program allocated funds based on mortgage-related factors to states, which then distributed funds to local governments with high mortgage issues. Direct allocation of funds to communities was limited by Congress, with specific thresholds for NSP-1 and NSP-3 funds. NSP-2 funds were awarded competitively to various entities, including for-profit partners. Representative Gary Miller introduced a bill to rescind $1 billion in NSP-3 funds. H.R. 861 aims to rescind $1 billion in NSP-3 funds allocated under the Wall Street Reform Act. The House Financial Services Committee conducted a hearing on NSP and federal foreclosure mitigation programs, and later approved an amendment requiring HUD to publish a notice of termination for the NSP program on its website within five days of the bill's enactment. During the House Financial Services Committee hearing on H.R. 861, Representative Miller criticized the NSP-3 program as ineffective and wasteful, advocating for its funding to be rescinded due to the need to address federal debt and deficit. Other members defended the program's success in assisting communities impacted by foreclosures. During a House Financial Services Committee hearing, Representative Miller criticized the NSP-3 program as ineffective and wasteful, advocating for its funding to be rescinded. However, other members defended the program's success in assisting communities impacted by foreclosures. HUD's Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development stated that NSP is expected to impact 100,000 properties in the nation's hardest-hit markets, with 36,000 units already under construction. Additionally, NSP is estimated to support more than 93,000 jobs nationwide. The House passed the measure on March 16, 2011, with a vote of 242 to 182, estimating that NSP will support over 93,000 jobs nationwide."
