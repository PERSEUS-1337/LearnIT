    "content": "In February 2002, the Bush Administration proposed \"Clear Skies\" to amend the Clean Air Act by placing emission caps on electric utility emissions of SO2, NOx, and Hg. The caps would be imposed in two phases: 2010 (2008 for NOx) and 2018. Clear Skies was introduced in the 108th Congress as H.R. 999 and S. 485, and a modified version was introduced in the 109th Congress as S. 131. In the 109th Congress, a modified version of Clear Skies (S. 131) introduced by Senator Inhofe has become the focus of congressional hearings and potential markup. The debate surrounding the Administration's Clear Skies proposal has focused on its cap-and-trade implementation scheme, aiming to deliver guaranteed emissions reductions of SO2, NOx, and mercury at a fraction of command and control costs. EPA highlights the increased certainty for industry, regulators, consumers, and citizens. EPA has proposed cap-and-trade regulations to control NOx emissions and achieve Clear Skies' reductions over 28 eastern states and the District of Columbia for SO2 and NOx. Additionally, EPA has proposed regulations for similar mercury reductions, although their legality is in question. The provisions in Clear Skies aim to alter, delete, or hold in certain aspects of the Clean Air Act. The Clear Skies program aims to modify or eliminate certain sections of the Clean Air Act for affected electric generating units and industrial sources. The Administration believes that certain provisions of the Clean Air Act are no longer necessary under Clear Skies. EPA Administrator Whitman stated that New Source Review may no longer be needed under Clear Skies legislation. The Clear Skies program aims to simplify regulations under a new piece of legislation, combining and eliminating various aspects such as regional haze, BART, MACT standards, NOx SIP Call, 126 Rule, and acid rain for utilities. The potential impact of Clear Skies legislation on the Clean Air Act structure for electric generating units is examined in a report. The Clear Skies legislation proposes changes to the Clean Air Act for electric generating units and industrial sources opting into the program, focusing on Title I regulations. Distinctions in regulatory structure impact utility planning based on location, age of facility, and fuel type. Specific requirements for SO2, NOx, and particulate matter differ despite amendments in the 1990 Clean Air Act. The Clean Air Act, established in 1970 and expanded in 1977, remains the backbone despite the addition of Title IV in 1990. Title IV did not alter the Act's basic requirements but was a supplemental provision. The Act set National Ambient Air Quality Standards and New Source Performance Standards to protect air quality. The Clean Air Act of 1970 established National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) to limit air pollutants and emissions from new facilities. NAAQS cover criteria pollutants like SO2, NOx, and PM, with EPA setting primary standards for public health protection. States are responsible for implementing and enforcing NAAQS with specific compliance deadlines. EPA periodically reviews NAAQS based on the latest health data. States are primarily responsible for implementing and enforcing National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) through State Implementation Plans (SIPs). The 1970 Clean Air Act mandates states to require new sources to use Lowest Achievable Emissions Rate (LAER) technology to ensure emissions do not increase. The 1970 Clean Air Act established emission standards for existing and new sources of air pollution. Existing sources in nonattainment areas must install Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT), while new sources must adhere to New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for SO2, NOx, and PM10. EPA reviews these standards every eight years. The Clean Air Act requires the review of emission standards every eight years. New sources must comply with NSPS regardless of location. Mechanisms for addressing interstate pollution include regional commissions and the NOx SIP Call, which controls emissions from 20 states and the District of Columbia. Under the NOx SIP Call, affected states are given emission budgets to achieve in any way they choose. EPA encouraged states to implement the rule through a cap-and-trade program. Existing sources in nonattainment areas are subject to state controls to meet NAAQS, while sources in attainment areas are mostly free from controls. Major new sources, including fossil fuel-fired electric generating facilities, must comply with NSPS as the minimum requirement. The 1977 Clean Air Act introduced the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program, focusing on ambient concentrations of SO2, NOx, and PM in clean air areas. It allows for some increase in pollution concentrations based on classification, with Class I areas like national parks having very little degradation allowed. The Clean Air Act's Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program classifies areas into Class I with minimal degradation allowed and Class II with moderate degradation permitted. States can reclassify Class II areas to Class III, allowing for degradation up to the NAAQS. New sources in PSD areas must undergo preconstruction review (NSR) and install Best Available Control Technology (BACT). State permitting agencies determine BACT on a case-by-case basis, ensuring it is at least as stringent as federal NSPS. The regional haze program complements the PSD program by focusing on visibility impairment from air pollution in national parks and wilderness areas. Sources built between 1962 and 1977 must install Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) to reduce pollutants like sulfates, organic matter, and nitrates. EPA's 1999 regional haze program aims for more stringent controls to improve visibility. The EPA implemented a regional haze program in 1999 to enforce stricter controls on NOx and SO2 emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating facilities. The program also includes regulations for hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) such as mercury, with the first phase focusing on implementing Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards for major sources of these pollutants. EPA Administrator determines MACT standards, which must be as stringent as the best controlled similar source. In the second phase, additional regulations may be promulgated to address any \"residual risks\" from hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) after the implementation of MACT. Electric utilities were given special treatment under Section 112, requiring an affirmative finding that regulation under Section 112 is \"appropriate and necessary\" for such units before issuing MACT standards. EPA must report to Congress on the hazards to public health from electric generating units' emissions of HAPs. In December 2000, EPA found that regulation under Section 112 is \"appropriate and necessary\" for electric generating units before issuing MACT standards. However, in January 2004, EPA proposed a cap-and-trade program as its preferred approach instead of the MACT standard. States can implement more stringent standards for hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) under current law. Under current law, states can enforce stricter standards for hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) than federal regulations. Some states like Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey, and Wisconsin have already done so. Clear Skies proposes changes to current regulations, including the establishment of national cap-and-trade programs for utility emissions of NOx and mercury, and the extension of the Title IV cap-and-trade program for SO2. Some changes add new authorities or programs, while others remove existing authority, such as the hazardous air pollutant provisions of Section 112. The proposed changes under Clear Skies include modifications to existing authorities related to mercury emissions from utilities and opt-in facilities in other industries. Additional authorities include cap-and-trade programs for SO2, NOx, and Hg, national emission standards for new EGUs, and the option for sources in other industries to join the cap-and-trade program. A new \"transitional area\" category may replace traditional nonattainment area designations. The proposed changes under Clear Skies include modifications to existing authorities related to mercury emissions from utilities and opt-in facilities in other industries. This includes changes to major sources, hazardous air pollutants provisions, and Section 126 regulations on interstate air pollution control. The Clear Skies proposal includes stricter requirements for accepting petitions after the moratorium, reducing noncompliance penalties in the new SO2 cap-and-trade program, preempting state NOx and mercury regulations, eliminating NSR for major source modifications, removing BART requirements for visibility protection, establishing a 50 km zone for PSD requirements around Class I areas, and exempting affected units in PSD Class II areas. The Clear Skies proposal includes a cap-and-trade program for SO2, NOx, and Mercury, replacing Title IV of the Clean Air Act. It also extends deadlines for meeting ozone and PM 2.5 NAAQS, imposes moratoriums on certain provisions in ozone nonattainment areas, and exempts affected units in PSD Class II areas. The revised and expanded version of the Clear Skies proposal introduces a multi-pollutant cap-and-trade program with caps on emissions of SO2, NOx, and Hg in two phases. Phase 1 sets caps for EGUs in 2008 and 2010, while Phase 2 caps would take effect in 2018. Allowance trading program provisions are similar to those of the existing Title IV program under S. 131. The Clear Skies proposal introduces a multi-pollutant cap-and-trade program with caps on emissions of SO2, NOx, and Hg in two phases. Allowances would be allocated free to EGUs based on historic fuel usage, with adjustments for factors specified in the bill. National Emission Standards for SO2, NOx, and Hg emissions from new and reconstructed EGUs would be established under the program. The National Emission Standards for SO2, NOx, and Hg from new and reconstructed EGUs are more stringent than current NSPS. Standards for NOx and particulate matter are lower than current NSPS, while the Hg standard is stricter for some units but allows more emissions for others. The standards would apply to fewer units compared to the current NSPS. The proposed legislation S. 131 would allow non-utility sources to opt into the cap-and-trade program for SO2, NOx, and Hg emissions if their emissions are vented through a stack or duct. Alternative methods for determining allowances based on heat input or product output are established, with optional base periods for emissions calculation. The proposed legislation S. 131 allows non-utility sources to opt into a cap-and-trade program for SO2, NOx, and Hg emissions. Units would receive allocations based on baseline emissions, with exemptions from compliance deadlines for hazardous air pollutants under certain regulations. The proposed legislation S. 131 allows non-utility sources to opt into a cap-and-trade program for SO2, NOx, and Hg emissions. Opt-in units would be permanently exempt from regulations if accepted by the EPA, and would not be considered major sources for 20 years. This exemption is contingent on proper operation and maintenance of pollution control equipment. Establishment of an Optional \"Transitional Area\" Category in Place of Nonattainment Designations under ClearSkies would allow areas to be designated as \"transitional\" instead of \"nonattainment\" for new ozone and PM 2.5 standards if they are projected to meet the standards by December 31, 2015. EPA modeling shows that a significant portion of nonattainment counties could qualify for this transitional status, with the potential for other areas to qualify by implementing additional local controls. The effects of Clear Skies include extending deadlines for reaching attainment and removing statutory requirements for nonattainment areas under Part D until after 2017. It also exempts affected units from major source requirements for a period of 20 years. Clear Skies extends deadlines for reaching attainment and exempts affected units from major source requirements under PSD and nonattainment provisions of the Clean Air Act for 20 years. Units located within 50 km of Class I areas remain subject to PSD requirements. Clear Skies exempts affected units from nonattainment NSR, LAER, and offset requirements, limiting additional controls on existing EGUs. To qualify for exemptions, units must show emissions control and good combustion practices within three years. Additionally, Clear Skies revises Section 112 of the Clean Air Act to preclude regulation of hazardous air pollutants. Section 112 of the Clean Air Act would be revised under Clear Skies to exclude regulation of hazardous air pollutants emitted by electric utility steam generating units, except for non-mercury pollutants based on public health concerns and individual source considerations. Controls would need to be supported by a peer-reviewed study with public notice and comment opportunities. Clear Skies would establish a moratorium on the use of petitions to control interstate air pollution, based on peer-reviewed studies and public comment, with compliance deadlines for cap-and-trade program units set for January 1, 2018. Compliance with hazardous air pollutant regulations would be exempted for units opting into the program. The amendment establishes a moratorium on petitions to control interstate air pollution under Section 126 of the Act, with more stringent requirements for acceptance of such petitions after the moratorium. If granted, upwind sources must shut down or implement controls within three years. The amendment sets a moratorium on Section 126 petitions for controlling interstate air pollution, with stricter requirements after the moratorium. The Administrator cannot require SIPs for affected units before December 31, 2014. Emission reductions must be cost-effective and meet attainment dates for nonattainment areas. Clear Skies would replace the Clean Air Act's existing Section 411 in 2008, reducing penalties for noncompliance with the sulfur dioxide cap-and-trade program. Noncompliance penalties were $2,000 per ton of excess emissions in 1990. The penalties for noncompliance with the sulfur dioxide cap-and-trade program under Clear Skies would be set at $2,000 per ton, without inflation adjustments, reducing the penalty by about one-third initially. The bill also clarifies that states can enforce limits more stringent than those provided in the legislation. The Clear Skies Act prohibits states from interfering with the transfer, sale, or purchase of allowances, allowing increased emissions in another jurisdiction. It limits the ability to control out-of-state pollution and eliminates the New Source Review for Modifications of EGUs. The Clear Skies Act exempts EGUs and opt-in facilities from NSR for 20 years, but establishes National Emission Standards for new EGUs. These standards do not apply to \"modified\" units but do apply to \"reconstructed\" units, defined as replacing components exceeding 50% of the fixed capital cost. Standards also apply only if it is feasible to meet them. The Clean Air Act does not have a specific cost criterion for modifications requiring NSR, but it is considered to be below a 50% threshold. EPA's attempt to establish a 20% threshold was criticized and stayed by the U.S. Court of Appeals. BART requirements for major sources in operation between 1962 and 1977 are eliminated. BART aims to ensure visibility protection in national parks and wilderness areas. Clear Skies would exempt certain facilities from BART for 20 years. PSD requirements apply to new sources near Class I areas to prevent adverse impacts on visibility. Under the PSD program, Class I areas must have new sources obtain permits to prevent visibility impacts within 100 km. Clear Skies exempts facilities in Class II areas from offsetting emissions to maintain air quality. Extension of Deadlines for the Ozone and PM2.5 NAAQS under Clear Skies would create a new \"transitional\" area classification for areas that can demonstrate attainment of standards by December 2015, exempting them from penalties until then. The Clean Air Act proposed extending deadlines for ozone and PM2.5 NAAQS under Clear Skies, creating a transitional area classification exempt from penalties until 2015. Nonattainment areas failing to meet standards by 2015 would face designation and be required to implement controls to achieve attainment by 2022. Subpart 2 of the Act outlines specific requirements for ozone nonattainment areas. The EPA has proposed to maintain requirements for areas failing to meet the 1-hour ozone standard, including LAER standards, offset requirements, RACT, inspection programs, vapor recovery, reformulated gasoline use, and penalties for emissions. Transitional areas under Clear Skies would be exempt from nonattainment classification. Under Clear Skies, transitional areas may roll back statutory requirements if they demonstrate attainment by 2015. Reclassifying ozone and PM 2.5 nonattainment areas as \"transitional\" eliminates conformity requirements for federally funded projects. Failure to demonstrate transportation conformity can result in a suspension of federal funds. Under Clear Skies, proposed legislation would reclassify most ozone and PM 2.5 nonattainment areas as \"transitional,\" eliminating conformity requirements until 2018. Changes to Title I would affect electric generating units (EGUs) and industrial sources opting into the program, with a significant structural change being the removal of location as a variable for controlling EGUs. Under Clear Skies, emission limitations and allowance system for EGUs would not be based on location or state/local government restrictions. States' ability to set stringent rules on EGUs in nonattainment areas would be eliminated. Under Clear Skies, state and local governments would be unable to influence emissions of EGUs in nonattainment areas. State enforcement mechanisms like NSR would be eliminated for EGUs covered by Clear Skies, limiting the effectiveness of state standards in controlling emissions. Preventing states from restricting allowance trading could result in additional allowances being created by state legislation aimed at achieving attainment or protecting local habitats. Under Clear Skies, state and local governments would be unable to influence emissions of EGUs in nonattainment areas. Additional allowances could be created by state legislation for local habitats or scenic areas, which could be sold to upwind utilities. The state would have limited ability to prevent or seek relief from neighboring utilities' emissions until after 2014. Clear Skies aims to establish a new \"transitional\" designation for areas not meeting air quality standards, reducing the need for stronger state and local standards in most cases. Under Clear Skies, transitional areas would be designated based on EPA or state modeling to show attainment by December 2015, avoiding nonattainment status and the need for additional controls. Clear Skies aims to protect Class I areas within 50 km of facilities, but the sufficiency of this measure is debatable. States and localities face challenges in protecting areas not meeting Class I requirements. Under Clear Skies, states and localities struggle to meet Class I requirements due to limitations on imposing controls on EGUs and opt-ins. The controversy over EGU age remains unresolved, with Title I and Title IV of the CAA imposing stricter requirements on new sources. Clear Skies aims to reduce this disparity by creating allowance reserves for new sources, although the allocation formulas for existing sources are not specified. Under Clear Skies, existing sources would have more generous allocation formulas than new sources, which are on a first-come, first-serve basis. Once the reserve is exhausted, no further allowances are available for new sources. Existing units would maintain an advantage over new facilities in receiving allowances for controlling mercury and other HAPs from Electric Generating Units. Under Clear Skies, regulations for mercury and other hazardous air pollutants would change. Unit-specific standards would no longer apply to new or existing EGUs or industrial sources in the cap-and-trade program, making it harder to address areas with high mercury concentrations. States setting stricter standards would not have full control. Under Clear Skies, regulations for mercury and other hazardous air pollutants would change. States setting stricter standards would not have full control as any extra reductions achieved by state legislation would create additional allowances for sale to upwind utilities. The Administrator would retain authority to address non-mercury HAPs under stringent conditions, with standards not implementable before 2018. Former Administrator Whitman has identified the need for peer-reviewed studies on public health concerns. Former Administrator Whitman has identified the central issue in Clear Skies' interaction with the Clean Air Act regarding utility controls for achieving NAAQS. Clear Skies will not meet ozone or fine particulate NAAQS within current compliance deadlines. EPA's analysis shows some nonattainment areas will not achieve necessary reductions in time. Clear Skies, as currently drafted, would limit states' options for achieving necessary reductions in nonattainment areas. The opt-in provision creates uncertainty about the reach of Clear Skies, potentially reducing state and local authorities' ability to meet NAAQS or maintain PSD increments. Similar issues are expected with Clear Skies' mercury controls. Clear Skies proposes modest controls on mercury from electric utilities, limiting state options for further reductions. The Administration argues that industrial sources opting into Clear Skies would reduce state control options. The Administration argues that reductions will be achieved sooner and less expensively under Clear Skies compared to the Clean Air Act, despite extending compliance deadlines for states. The early reductions in a market-based cap-and-trade program may lead to overcontrol initially, but could also be used to increase emissions later. The flexibility of using banked allowances under a cap-and-trade program can complicate compliance strategies for state and local authorities."
