    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nuclear Non-Proliferation Policy Act of 1998\". The Congress finds that the proliferation of nuclear weapons is a major threat to national security, especially in unstable regions. The United Nations Security Council has declared that the spread of all weapons of mass destruction poses a threat to international peace. The United Nations Special Commission on Iraq was established to prevent nuclear proliferation. Aside from the 5 declared nuclear weapon states, other nations are pursuing nuclear weapons capabilities. Regional nuclear arms races increase the risk of nuclear weapon use. Concerns have been raised about deteriorating conditions at nuclear weapons sites in Russia. Concerns about nuclear weapons sites in Russia have raised fears of nuclear material and weapons falling into the wrong hands, increasing the risk of proliferation. Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Iraq had a secret nuclear weapons program undetected by the International Atomic Energy Agency. In October 1994, North Korea and the United States signed an agreement to exchange North Korea's existing nuclear reactors and reprocessing equipment for modern light water reactor technology. North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons capability and potential political and economic crises on the peninsula make it a concern. The economic crisis on the peninsula has raised concerns about nuclear proliferation in North Korea. Brazil, Argentina, and South Africa previously had nuclear weapons programs but have renounced them and accepted IAEA safeguards. The United States' security interests align with South Korea's nuclear policy. The United States supports various nuclear weapons free zones, including the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty and the African Nuclear Weapons Free Zone Treaty. The IAEA plays a crucial role in countering proliferation through its Strengthened Safeguards System program. The United States supports immobilizing plutonium for energy and mixing it with low-enriched uranium for commercial nuclear reactors. Plutonium from dismantled warheads poses storage and disposal challenges and could be converted into nuclear warhead fuel if in the wrong hands, affecting the effectiveness of the IAEA's safeguards system. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, extended indefinitely, aims to strengthen international nonproliferation efforts. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 reinforces US commitment to the treaty and enhancing controls over nuclear transfers. The United States aims to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and technology, roll back proliferation, and prevent nuclear weapon use worldwide through a comprehensive nonproliferation policy. The United States aims to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and technology worldwide through a comprehensive nonproliferation policy outlined in SEC. 3. The United States aims to prevent nuclear proliferation by pursuing objectives such as placing fissile materials under international controls, ratifying the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, and ending the production of new nuclear warheads through agreements with Russia. The Federation aims to end the production of new types of nuclear warheads and negotiate multilateral agreements to reduce strategic nuclear arsenals globally. The Federation aims to halt the production of weapons-usable fissile materials through multilateral agreements with Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty member states. This includes ending production by January 1, 2008, placing existing stockpiles under international controls, and requiring all nuclear facilities for peaceful purposes to be under IAEA safeguards. Strengthening IAEA safeguards is also a priority. To enhance nonproliferation efforts, the Federation advocates for strengthening IAEA safeguards to ensure compliance with commitments and providing necessary support for safeguard reforms. Additionally, they propose bolstering nuclear export controls, imposing sanctions on proliferators, increasing transparency on approved export licenses, and ratifying the IAEA's model protocol. The Federation advocates for strengthening IAEA safeguards, reducing incentives for nuclear weapons acquisition, and promoting regional security agreements. They also propose a \"no first use\" policy with other nuclear weapon states. The Federation advocates for strengthening IAEA safeguards, reducing incentives for nuclear weapons acquisition, and promoting regional security agreements. They propose a verifiable bilateral agreement with Russia to dismantle all tactical nuclear weapons and extend this zero option to all nuclear weapon states. They also advocate for ratifying the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty and the African Nuclear Weapons Free Zone Treaty, and monitoring North Korea's activities. (13) Monitor North Korea's activities regarding nuclear reactor replacement to prevent weapons development. (14) Initiate START III negotiations with Russia before START II takes effect. SEC. 4. REQUIREMENTS FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICY. The President must report to Congress annually on actions taken to implement policy objectives, including those of the Russian Federation and other countries, and obstacles encountered. The President must report annually to Congress on actions taken to implement policy objectives, including those of the Russian Federation and other countries, and any obstacles encountered. Each report should be unclassified, with a classified appendix if needed. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"fissile materials\" refer to highly enriched uranium and plutonium, \"highly enriched uranium\" is uranium enriched to 20% or more in U-235, \"IAEA\" stands for the International Atomic Energy Agency, \"IAEA safeguards\" are safeguards in an agreement with the IAEA, and \"no first use\" policy means not being the first to use nuclear weapons in a conflict. The term \"non-nuclear weapon state\" refers to a country that has not acquired nuclear weapons. The term \"Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty\" refers to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons signed in 1968. The term \"nuclear weapon state\" refers to a country that is a nuclear-weapon state as defined by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The START I treaty was signed in 1968 in Washington, London, and Moscow. The START II treaty was signed in 1991 between the US and the USSR. The START III treaty was discussed between President Clinton and President Yeltsin. The START III treaty was discussed between President Clinton and President Yeltsin at a summit meeting in Helsinki, Finland in March 1997."
