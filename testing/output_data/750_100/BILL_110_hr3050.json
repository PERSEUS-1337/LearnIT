    "content": "The consent of Congress is given to an interstate forest fire protection compact known as \"THE GREAT PLAINS WILDLAND FIRE PROTECTION AGREEMENT\" between State, Provincial, and Territorial wildland fire protection agencies. The Great Plains Wildland Fire Protection Agreement aims to prevent and control forest fires in the region by maintaining adequate firefighting services and providing reciprocal aid among member states like South Dakota, North Dakota, Wyoming, and Colorado. The compact becomes effective once ratified by two or more member states. The Great Plains Wildland Fire Protection Agreement allows state foresters to act as compact administrators, coordinating forest fire prevention and control efforts among member states. Each state can develop and implement a forest fire plan. The Great Plains Wildland Fire Protection Agreement allows state forest fire control agencies to provide aid to each other when requested, while ensuring protection at home. The Great Plains Wildland Fire Protection Agreement allows state forest fire control agencies to provide aid to each other when requested. Employees rendering outside aid have the same powers, duties, rights, privileges, and immunities as comparable employees of the state they are aiding. No liability is held for acts or omissions during the aid process. The Great Plains Wildland Fire Protection Agreement allows state forest fire control agencies to provide aid to each other when requested. Liability for any equipment or supplies used in the aid process is assumed by the requesting state. The aiding state will be reimbursed for any loss, damage, or expenses incurred during the operation. Each member state providing aid under the Great Plains Wildland Fire Protection Agreement will be reimbursed for all costs incurred, including materials, transportation, wages, and maintenance. Workers compensation benefits must also be provided to employees and contract firefighters sent to assist another state. The compact includes provisions for reimbursement of costs incurred by member states providing aid. Compact administrators can establish procedures for claims and reimbursement in accordance with state laws. \"ARTICLE VI outlines procedures for reimbursement of costs incurred by member states providing aid under the compact.\" The compact does not allow any member state to reduce their forest fighting forces, equipment, services, or facilities. Each state must maintain adequate resources for forest fire protection as if the compact was not in place. The compact does not limit a state's power to prevent and control forest fires. The compact requires states to maintain resources for forest fire protection and does not affect existing relationships with the US Forest Service. \"Representatives of the United States Forest Service may attend meetings of the compact administrators. The provisions of Articles IV and V of this compact regarding reciprocal aid in combating forest fires apply between states that are party to this compact and other regional compacts if the other state's Legislature has approved mutual aid provisions.\" The compact remains binding until a state takes action to withdraw, which becomes effective six months after notice is sent to all parties."
