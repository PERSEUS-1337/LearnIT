The Corps develops, operates, and maintains the infrastructure of these commercial waterways. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers manages inland waterways, including navigation channels, harbors, locks, and dams, through dredging and water management. Costs for maintenance and construction are funded by the Corps and the commercial user industry. Congress is considering proposals for future financing of the inland waterway system. Congress is grappling with proposals for future financing of the inland waterway system, as the current revenue source is insufficient to cover nonfederal costs of major capital expenditures. This ongoing shortfall is limiting new construction projects and is expected to continue unless changes are made by Congress. Recent proposals highlight issues with inland waterways, including debates over fuel tax vs. lock usage fees. The user industry suggests raising fuel tax and federal share for waterway costs. Inland waterways have been vital for transport since before rail and highway systems. Inland waterway development in the early 1800s was initially managed by states until the Supreme Court granted the United States authority over interstate commerce in 1824. The federal government then started funding and supporting waterways for commerce. Despite decreased reliance due to other transportation modes, inland waterways still play a significant role in transporting goods, accounting for 4%-5% of total commercial tonnage annually. Inland waterways are important for transporting bulk goods over long distances, especially for specific commodities like grain, oilseed, coal, petroleum, chemicals, metals, cement, sand, and gravel. They are a primary means of transport for the nation's exports and account for a significant percentage of commercial tonnage shipped. Actual traffic on inland waterways has remained somewhat flat over the last 20 years in terms of tonnage and ton-miles, while overall freight tonnage for all modes of domestic shipping has increased at an average annual rate of 1.2% from 1997 to 2007. The Department of Transportation projects that overall freight tonnage will double over the next 25 years, with inland waterway traffic expected to increase at a slower rate compared to rail and highway shipping. The federal government invests in inland waterways due to their value to the nation, with investments dating back to the early 1800s. Almost all tonnage on inland waterways comes through the Mississippi and Ohio River System via bulk shipping on barges. The federal government historically funded inland waterway projects, but legislation in the 1970s and 1980s introduced user cost-sharing requirements. The Inland Waterways Revenue Act of 1978 and the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 established the current financing system for Corps inland waterway projects. The Inland Waterways Revenue Act of 1978 and the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 introduced user cost-sharing requirements for inland waterway projects. These acts established a fuel tax on commercial barges, cost-share requirements, and the Inland Waterways Trust Fund to fund investments in construction, shifting financial responsibility to commercial operators. The Inland Waterways Trust Fund (IWTF) was established in 1978 with a fuel tax of $0.04 per gallon, increasing to $0.10 by 1986 and eventually to $0.20 by 1994. The fund was not utilized until WRDA 1986, which also increased the fuel tax and introduced cost-sharing for waterway expenditures. WRDA 1986 introduced a cost-sharing process for inland waterway expenditures, with construction projects funded on a 50/50 basis between the IWTF and the Treasury's General Revenue fund. Operations and maintenance costs remained a federal responsibility. Expenditures from the IWTF for construction projects required authorization from Congress and annual discretionary appropriations. The IWTF, along with subsequent Water Resources Development Acts, funds inland waterway projects. WRDA 1986 maintained 100% federal funding for most costs, except for construction and major maintenance. Federal spending on O&M exceeds other expenses. The Inland Waterways Users Board (IWUB) was established as part of the IWTF to represent shipping interests on inland waterways. It consists of 11 members and gives commercial users a voice in federal decision-making. The Inland Waterways Users Board (IWUB) was established to represent shipping interests on inland waterways and inform federal decision-making on IWTF projects. It meets regularly to make recommendations to the Secretary of the Army and Congress. The IWTF balance has varied between 1986 and 2011, with balances increasing from 1992 to 2002. The executive branch has proposed increasing fees on the user industry and requiring the IWTF to fund some operations and maintenance expenditures. Beginning in FY2005, appropriations from the IWTF increased significantly as the Bush Administration requested and Congress appropriated greater investments in IWTF-funded projects. These increasing expenditures significantly exceeded annual fuel tax collections going into the IWTF and interest on the IWTF balance, causing balances to fall sharply from 2005 to 2010. From 2005 to 2010, Congress implemented measures to reduce stress on the Inland Waterways Trust Fund (IWTF) and prevent unsustainable balance levels. These measures included exempting major rehabilitation projects from cost-sharing requirements, limiting projects with access to the IWTF, providing over $400 million in construction funding under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, and exempting this funding from IWTF cost-share requirements. These actions helped limit costs to the IWTF for ongoing projects. Congress implemented measures to reduce stress on the Inland Waterways Trust Fund (IWTF) from 2005 to 2010, including exempting major rehabilitation projects from cost-sharing requirements and limiting projects with access to the IWTF. Recent actions have prohibited new contracts requiring IWTF funding since FY2009, stabilizing the trust fund balance. Funding for new projects is expected to be limited, with most going to the Olmsted Locks and Dam project on the Ohio River. Most of the funding is expected to go to the Olmsted Locks and Dam project on the Ohio River, which could increase the backlog for Corps inland waterways projects. Long-term options and proposals to address this situation are discussed in the \"Inland Waterway Financing Proposals\" section. Concerns have been raised about inefficiencies and inequities in the Corps project planning process for inland waterways investments. In response to concerns about inefficient project implementation and use of tax dollars in the executive branch, the Corps implemented reforms in FY2006, including risk-based cost estimates and prioritized funding for high-risk projects. While improvements were recognized, advocates still push for additional structural reforms in the planning process due to cost overruns and project planning issues. The Olmsted Locks and Dam project has faced cost overruns and planning issues, with the estimated cost increasing from $775 million to $2.9 billion. The project was 49% complete as of January 1, 2013, with the lock components finished but the dam and demolition components still ongoing. The lock components of the Olmsted Locks and Dam project were completed in 2013. The dam and demolition components are scheduled for completion in 2020 and 2024, respectively. Concerns about the financing system for fuel-taxed inland waterways have led to various proposals by different administrations and industry groups. The user proposal differs significantly from the Administration's proposal, suggesting an increase in the fuel tax and a higher federal share for inland waterway investments. Past administrations have also proposed increasing commercial user fees on inland waterways, with the Bush Administration suggesting a lock usage fee in 2008 to address concerns about potential IWTF shortfall. The proposal in 2008 suggested a usage fee to replace the fuel tax and generate additional revenue for the IWTF. The fee would phase in charges for commercial barges based on lock chamber size, with adjustments tied to IWTF balances after 2012. The Bush Administration argued that this approach would improve equity in waterborne commerce investments. The Bush Administration proposed a lock fee to improve equity in waterborne commerce investments, but both the House and Senate appropriations committees rejected it due to the burden it would pose on lock users. Congress provided temporary relief through stopgap measures and requested the executive branch to revisit its approach. The Obama Administration's budget requests to Congress have each proposed some form of new user fee for inland waterways. The Bush Administration proposed a lock fee to improve equity in waterborne commerce investments, but Congress rejected the proposal. The Obama Administration continued to propose user fees in its budgets, but Congress generally rejected these proposals. The Obama Administration proposed inland waterway user fees in its budgets, but Congress has generally rejected these proposals. The FY2013 and FY2014 budgets assumed $80 million in new revenues from a user fee, but none of these proposals have been enacted. Additionally, the 2011 Obama Administration plan for deficit reduction included a specific inland waterway financing structure recommendation to Congress. The Obama Administration proposed specific inland waterway user fees to Congress, including a two-tier annual fee for commercial shippers set by the Corps to achieve revenue targets. All inland waterway shippers would pay a new annual fee in addition to the existing fuel tax, with vessels using locks paying a higher fee. The proposed legislation did not specify the fee amount but outlined revenue targets in Table 3. The Obama Administration proposed inland waterway user fees based on revenue targets, aiming for an additional $1 billion in revenues over 10 years. The proposal included adding 39 new segments to the existing inland waterway system. The Obama Administration proposed inland waterway user fees to generate additional revenue, but the proposal was opposed by the industry and not enacted. In response, the Inland Waterways Users Board (IWUB) introduced its own proposal, the Inland Marine Transportation Systems Capital Investment Strategy Team report, which has been favored by the industry and introduced as legislation in Congress. The IWUB report recommended a new financing system and proposed changes for inland waterways, including increasing user fees by $0.06-$0.09 per gallon. The IWUB report recommends increasing user fees by $0.06-$0.09 per gallon, modifying cost-share requirements for inland waterway investments, increasing overall spending on inland waterways, and enhancing IWUB involvement in project planning and construction. The IWUB report proposes increasing the inland waterway fuel tax rate by $0.06-$0.09 per gallon, aiming to generate approximately $112 million per year in fuel tax revenues for the IWTF. The IWUB report proposes increasing the inland waterway fuel tax rate by $0.06-$0.09 per gallon to generate approximately $112 million annually. Most of the new revenue would be saved for future years to replenish balances. The proposed tax increase would not be indexed for inflation or include a capital recovery mechanism. Additionally, the report suggests shifting more of the cost for inland waterway projects to the federal government by increasing federally funded investments and decreasing 50/50 cost-sharing projects. The IWUB report recommends exempting dam-related expenses and rehabilitation projects under $100 million from cost-sharing requirements. It also suggests capping IWTF funds to discourage construction cost overruns, impacting overall cost-share for IWTF projects. Critics argue that this would result in additional hidden costs. The IWUB report proposes increasing federal share for inland waterways projects, exempting some from cost-sharing, and capping IWTF funds to control construction costs. This would raise federal share from 50% to around 70% for certain projects over 25 years. Full funding requires increased funding from IWTF and General Revenue fund. The suite of investments proposed in the IWUB report requires annual expenditures averaging $380 million, a significant increase over historical averages. Most of the increase would come from the General Revenue fund initially to allow the trust fund balance to rebuild. The IWUB proposal in the report requires $1.33 billion in federal funding over the first five years, with federal requirements exceeding 50% of the total investments. More new funding is needed from the federal government than the IWTF, with expected trends shown in Figure 4. The report also suggests reforms to improve cost-effectiveness of IWTF projects. The report proposes reforms to increase the involvement of the IWUB in Corps project delivery for IWTF investments, including appointing IWUB representatives to project design teams and obtaining sign-off on project plans. The IWUB seeks these changes to enhance cost-effectiveness. The IWUB report proposes changes to increase their involvement in Corps project planning for IWTF investments, prioritizing projects based on asset condition and performance impact. The IWUB report suggests prioritizing projects based on asset condition and performance impact, without proposing mandatory funding for new projects. The final decision on funding would still be made by Congress or the Corps, but the report recommends using selection criteria similar to those in the report to increase the likelihood of project selection. Some groups advocate for shifting costs away from the federal government and increasing user-financed share of inland waterway costs. An analysis by the Congressional Budget Office in the 1990s found that the current tax system failed to cover operational costs, suggesting a user fee structure instead. The Congressional Budget Office found that the current tax system for inland waterways does not cover operational costs, suggesting a user fee structure to increase economic efficiency. Proposed increases in fees aim to shift costs from the federal government to users. Recent proposals suggest increasing user contributions for inland waterway expenditures to make them \"self-funding.\" The estimated savings from these proposals total $1.5 billion over the next five years. The proposal aims to raise user fees on inland waterways to cover construction, operations, and maintenance costs, potentially saving $4 billion over 10 years. Specific recommendations on fee structures are lacking, but new fees could take various forms to better reflect operating costs. The proposals aim to introduce new fees for operating inland waterways, such as annual licensing fees, congestion pricing, tolls, and lockage fees. These proposals suggest changes to the current financing system and raise questions for Congress about the level of investment needed for the inland waterway system. Changes to inland waterways financing have been enacted in the 113th Congress through the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-121). This legislation made limited changes, including authorizing project delivery recommendations, increasing federal responsibility for rehabilitation costs, and reducing cost-sharing requirements for the Olmsted project. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 made changes to inland waterways financing, including reducing cost-sharing requirements for the Olmsted project and authorizing efforts to study revenue collection efficiency and alternative financing options for the Inland Waterways Trust Fund. The House Appropriations Committee funded the Olmsted Project under the newly enacted WRRDA cost-sharing requirement of 15% from the IWTF, allowing for significant funding for other inland waterways construction projects. The changes enacted in WRRDA are seen as insufficient to finance all needed waterway projects. Some support standalone legislation like H.R. 1149 (the WAVE4 Act) to address long-term solvency of the IWTF, including a fuel tax increase and cost-sharing alterations. The RIVER Act, similar to the WAVE4 Act, proposes a fuel tax increase of $0.09 per gallon and shifts the responsibility of dam construction and rehabilitation costs to the federal government for expenditures less than $50 million. Congress faces issues with various inland waterways proposals. The level and urgency of infrastructure investments on federal waterways are a central issue for Congress. Commercial users argue for additional investment due to aging infrastructure, expanded capacity needs, and positive environmental benefits. However, taxpayer and environmental advocacy groups oppose increased federal funding for inland waterways. Advocacy groups oppose increased federal funding for inland waterways, arguing that the shipping industry overstates benefits. Despite disagreements, most agree that current financing is inadequate. The Corps is expected to have appropriations for just one lock replacement project through at least FY2016. The Corps of Engineers may put IWTF construction projects on hold due to insufficient revenue, aging infrastructure, and declining efficiency of inland waterway assets. Locks in the US are past their intended design age, leading to overall lock unavailability. The Corps of Engineers may face challenges in funding IWTF construction projects due to aging infrastructure and declining efficiency of inland waterway assets. Some argue for new lock construction, while others advocate for maintenance of existing locks to extend their lifespan at a lower cost. Some groups argue against new lock construction due to high costs compared to benefits, suggesting small-scale improvements instead. The Corps relies on traffic forecasts for new navigation alternatives, which can be challenging to predict due to various factors. The Corps projects a 70% increase in total domestic freight traffic by 2020, with a 2% annual increase in waterway traffic between 2010 and 2035. Shipping interests suggest that improving inland waterway efficiency could reduce pressure on highway and rail shipments. Improving inland waterway efficiency could reduce pressure on highway and rail shipments. Future lock upgrades or new construction may increase demand for inland waterways, but this would depend on various external factors. Some groups question the need for new lock construction based on flat or decreasing traffic at certain locks. Critics have also challenged previous traffic projections by the Corps. Shipping interests criticize Corps' traffic projections as overly optimistic and advocate for increased investment in inland waterways. Studies show barge shipping is more efficient and environmentally friendly than rail or highway shipping. Industry studies have found that railroads are less fuel-efficient than inland waterways, with the latter contributing fewer greenhouse gas emissions per mile. Other benefits of inland waterways include reduced highway congestion and noise. However, taxpayer and environmental groups question the environmental benefits of barge shipping, citing concerns about industry fuel-efficiency calculations that do not consider technical factors like river flow constraints. Environmental groups highlight concerns about the negative impact of inland waterway projects on riparian habitat and species due to alterations in natural river flows caused by structural changes like locks, dams, and levees. They argue for the use of conversion factors to accurately compare fuel efficiency among different modes of transportation. Increased construction and expansion of inland waterways can have negative environmental effects, such as increased turbidity, bank erosion, and reservoir-like effects. Congress may need to consider changes to the system that finances these investments, including proposals for additional revenue like an increase in the fuel tax or new annual fees. The White House proposed new annual fees in addition to the current fuel tax to the Joint Committee on Deficit Reduction. The IWUB suggested increasing the existing fuel tax to rebuild the trust fund balance and fund new investments, but some groups argue that the associated federal cost share increases are unacceptable. The Obama Administration proposed new user fees in 2011 to address inadequate revenues from commercial users on the inland waterway system. The proposal includes raising fuel taxes and adding new fees for non-lock users, with lock users facing even higher fees. The Administration's proposal includes raising fuel taxes and adding new fees for non-lock users, with lock users facing even higher fees. They argue that commercial shippers, who benefit the most from waterway investments, should continue to pay for new capital investments. The IWUB and Congress have opposed the new proposal, stating that targeting users of individual segments goes against the idea of the inland waterways as a whole. The user industry opposes the proposed new fee as it delegates fee-setting authority to the Secretary of the Army, with restrictions. Congress has considered alternative revenue-raising methods, such as lock usage fees, in the past. Lock usage fees, annual licensing fees, tolls, ton-mile charges, and capital recovery concept were proposed as alternatives to fuel tax for raising revenues on inland waterways. User industry opposes new fee delegation to the Secretary of the Army. User fees could automatically adjust to recover capital investments by the government, potentially increasing when the IWTF balance drops. This concept is seen in the Obama Administration proposal, tying user fees to trust fund balances after FY2022. Critics argue that planning for constantly changing taxes is challenging. Congress could consider additional means to increase the reliability of revenue for inland waterways, such as an automatic adjustment for inflation in fuel tax or a new lockage fee. This adjustment could boost future revenues and enhance the purchasing power of IWTF funds, which have decreased significantly since 1994. Some view this adjustment as a hidden cost. If no long-term solution is enacted to address the IWTF revenue shortfall, Congress may need to take measures to ensure trust fund solvency. Options could include capping IWTF withdrawals at current fuel tax revenues or temporarily halting new contracts to focus on ongoing work, potentially impacting investments in the inland waterway system. Congress might also exempt some IWTF investments from cost-sharing requirements. Congress is considering exempting some IWTF investments from cost-sharing requirements, which could have additional costs to taxpayers. The current cost-share arrangement for inland waterway projects is being questioned for balance. WRDA 1986 established cost-sharing requirements for construction and major lock rehabilitation projects, while routine operations and maintenance were fully federally funded. The IWUB proposal aims to modify cost-sharing arrangements for inland waterway projects, shifting funding for dams and minor rehabilitation to 100% federal funding. This change is justified by the significant benefits dams provide to the U.S. population. The IWUB proposes a new threshold of $100 million for major lock rehabilitation projects, increasing federally funded maintenance and rehabilitation projects. It also suggests making all cost overruns for IWTF construction projects a 100% federal responsibility. The IWUB proposes making all cost overruns for IWTF construction projects a 100% federal responsibility, shifting costs towards the federal government. Critics argue this represents an additional hidden cost not reflected in estimates. The cost-share arrangement would shift to approximately 68% federal, 32% non-federal. The cost-share arrangement for IWTF construction projects would shift to approximately 68% federal, 32% non-federal. Critics argue that this shift would increase federal costs significantly, potentially exceeding 90% of the total expenses. The Obama Administration's proposals recommend altering user fees but not the overall cost-share between federal and nonfederal expenditures for inland waterways. This would require new revenues from users, but the cost-share structure would remain at 50/50. Some groups advocate for shifting more costs to waterway users, including operations and maintenance expenses, currently funded by the government. Congress has previously rejected these proposals but may reconsider due to cost-cutting efforts. The IWUB has requested Congress to provide reforms for Corps IWTF planning processes to increase involvement and improve project prioritization. Industry users believe these reforms will reduce cost overruns, which have been a problem in the past. Previous studies by the Corps identified factors contributing to cost overruns, such as inaccurate construction schedules and costs, cost escalation, and non-optimal funding. The IWUB has requested Congress to reform Corps IWTF planning processes to increase involvement and improve project prioritization. Concerns about conflicts of interest may arise from non-federal entities' degree of involvement in decision-making. The Corps' method for prioritizing inland waterway projects may receive congressional attention, as decisions are currently made without a formal set of criteria. The IWUB report recommends a priority ranking system for Corps inland waterway projects, which could limit Congress's role in project selection and funding by utilizing specific criteria for project authorization and funding decisions. The IWUB report suggests a priority ranking system for Corps inland waterway projects, potentially reducing Congress's involvement in project selection and funding. This shift aligns with the federal approach to project allocations for other agency programs."
