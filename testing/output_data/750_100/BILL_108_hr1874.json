    "content": "The Act is titled the \"David Jayne Homebound Reform Act of 2003\" and includes a demonstration project to clarify the definition of homebound. The \"David Jayne Homebound Reform Act of 2003\" includes a demonstration project where medicare beneficiaries with chronic conditions can be deemed homebound for receiving home health services under the medicare program, regardless of the purpose, frequency, or duration of absences from home, if certified by a physician with a permanent and severe condition that will not improve. The \"David Jayne Homebound Reform Act of 2003\" allows medicare beneficiaries with chronic conditions to receive home health services if they have a permanent and severe condition, require assistance with daily living activities, need home health services to leave home, and require assistance to leave the home. The Secretary will collect data on the quality of care provided in the demonstration project. The Secretary will report to Congress on the demonstration project's impact on Medicare beneficiaries' quality of care, patient outcomes, and costs. Waiver authority will be granted to ensure compliance with the project. The Secretary has the authority to waive compliance with Medicare requirements for demonstration projects, without waiving any applicable penalties or remedies under the Social Security Act. Authorization of appropriations is also provided. Authorization of appropriations is provided from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Supplementary Insurance Trust Fund for the costs of the demonstration project under this section. Definitions include \"Medicare beneficiary\" as an individual entitled to benefits under part A or enrolled under part B, and \"home health services.\" The curr_chunk defines key terms such as \"home health services,\" \"activities of daily living,\" and \"Secretary.\" These definitions are important for understanding the context of the demonstration project funded by the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Supplementary Insurance Trust Fund. The curr_chunk clarifies the definition of homebound for determining eligibility for home health services under the Medicare program. The curr_chunk amends sections of the Social Security Act to provide assistance for individuals with permanent and severe conditions requiring help with daily activities and home health services to achieve a functional condition allowing them to leave home. The amendments to the Social Security Act allow individuals with severe conditions to receive assistance for daily activities and home health services, enabling them to leave home without disqualification based on the purpose, frequency, or duration of absences. The effective date for these amendments is contingent upon the Secretary of Health's decision by December 1, 2006. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must submit a report to Congress by December 1, 2006, analyzing the impact of a demonstration project on home health services under the Medicare program. The project will end on January 1, 2007, unless the Secretary finds that the clarification of the definition of homebound is effective. The Secretary must report to Congress by December 1, 2006, on the impact of a demonstration project on home health services under Medicare. If the clarification of the definition of homebound causes a significant increase in Medicare expenditures, the report must include specific data on the increase. The Secretary must report to Congress by December 1, 2006, on the impact of a demonstration project on home health services under Medicare, including specific recommendations to exempt permanently and severely disabled homebound beneficiaries from restrictions on the length, frequency, and purpose of their absences from home to qualify for services without incurring additional costs to the Medicare program. Technical amendments to Sections 1814(a) and 1835(a) are also included. Technical amendments to Sections 1814(a) and 1835(a) of the Social Security Act involve allowing homebound beneficiaries to leave home and making adjustments to the placement of certain sentences within the Act."
