This action is subject to the same provisions as exclusions under section 1128. The Secretary may impose a civil monetary penalty of up to $10,000 on a physician or professional who fails to cooperate in validating prescriptions. This penalty applies to items and services provided by a specific provider or supplier. The Prompt Pay Provisions in sections 1816(c)(2) may be revised.

Amendments to the Social Security Act require program integrity measures for Medicare enrollments and renewals. Consultation with the OIG is necessary for implementing these amendments. The Secretary of Health and Human Services consults with the Inspector General to identify providers or services at risk of fraud under Medicare, Medicaid, or the State children's health insurance program. Additional funding may be appropriated for this purpose. The amendments made by this section will take effect upon the enactment of the Act. Section 1128G(b) of the Social Security Act will apply to providers and suppliers approved for participation six months after the Act's enactment. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will issue regulations within 6 months of the Act's enactment, which will be effective immediately on an interim basis. There will be a public comment period, and the Secretary may make changes based on feedback."
