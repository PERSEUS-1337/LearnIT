Increased average fuel economy standards are being amended in Section 32902 of title 49, United States Code to include non-passenger automobiles and classes based on vehicle attributes related to fuel economy. The Secretary will ensure that non-passenger automobiles have a fuel economy standard of at least 27.5 miles per gallon for model year 2022 and beyond. Additionally, regulations will be set for passenger automobiles to achieve the maximum feasible average fuel economy level. The Secretary will set separate fuel economy standards for different classes of passenger automobiles based on vehicle attributes. The average fuel economy standard for passenger automobiles for model year 2022 and beyond will be at least 35 miles per gallon. Additionally, there will be an alternative minimum standard for passenger automobiles. The alternative minimum standard for domestically manufactured passenger automobiles shall be the greater of 27.5 miles per gallon or 92 percent of the projected average fuel economy. The alternative minimum standard for domestically manufactured passenger automobiles is 92 percent of the projected average fuel economy published by the Secretary. This standard applies only if the average fuel economy standard for passenger automobiles, excluding any credits transferred by the manufacturer, is established based on vehicle attributes. The section allows manufacturers to comply with a less stringent fuel economy standard if they do not transfer credits from other categories of automobiles. Manufacturers can choose to comply with an attribute-based standard or a single corporate average fuel economy level during a transition period of the first 3 model years. The amendments made by this section shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act, with a transition period for passenger automobiles until a new standard is prescribed. The amendments made by this section, effective upon enactment, include technical and conforming changes to Chapter 329 of title 49, United States Code, defining a 'non-passenger automobile' as one that is not a passenger automobile.

The Secretary of Transportation will provide up to 50% of the cost for a campaign to educate drivers on transportation fuel savings. Private funds can also be accepted to supplement the campaign. Appropriations are authorized as needed for this initiative."
