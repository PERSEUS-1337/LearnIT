    "content": "The \"Welfare to Work Act of 1994\" may be cited as the short title. The Congress expresses its sense regarding the act. The Congress acknowledges the challenges faced by welfare recipients in finding entry-level jobs leading to permanent employment. They believe that workfare programs are not a sufficient solution and that funds currently used for AFDC payments could be more economically valuable if exchanged for work. To break the cycle of welfare, maximize the economic value of AFDC payments by exchanging them for work. Provide recipients with a pathway to permanent employment and support businesses in hiring them through a one-year tax credit for wages paid leading to termination of AFDC eligibility. SEC. 3. REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR HIRING AFDC RECIPIENTS. An amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 introduces a new section providing a tax credit for businesses hiring AFDC recipients, aiming to transition them to permanent employment and break the cycle of welfare dependency. A tax credit is allowed against the tax imposed for the taxable year based on qualified first-year wages, with 50% credit for wages up to $6,000 and 25% credit for wages between $6,000 and $12,000. Qualified first-year wages are defined as wages for services rendered in the 1-year period from the start of employment. The 1-year period for qualified first-year wages starts from the beginning of employment. The period can be reduced by prior service with other employers if wages were considered qualified first-year wages. Qualified wages are those paid to qualified former AFDC recipients. The term 'wages' is defined as per section 51(d) without paragraph (4) for qualified former AFDC recipients certified by the designated local agency. The Social Security Act prohibits replacing existing workers to obtain credit for wages paid to qualified former AFDC recipients. This excludes individuals who are members of a targeted group. The text discusses technical amendments related to certain expenses and credits under the Internal Revenue Code. It mentions rules similar to those in section 51 and section 52 that apply for the purposes of this section. The table of sections for subpart C of part IV of the Internal Revenue Code is amended by adding a new item. The amendments made by this section apply to individuals who start working for the employer after the enactment of this Act."
