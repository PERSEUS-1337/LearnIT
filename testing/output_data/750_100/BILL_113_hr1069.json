The TANF Substance Abuse Prevention Act requires states to implement a drug testing program for applicants and recipients of assistance under the state TANF program.

Testing may be done randomly or at set intervals after the initial screening. The TANF Substance Abuse Prevention Act mandates drug screening and testing for individuals receiving state TANF assistance to identify illegal drug use. Grants under section 403 cannot be used to assist individuals who have not been screened for drug use or tested for illegal drugs if deemed at high risk of substance abuse. Substance abuse screening is required for individuals receiving state TANF assistance to identify potential drug abuse through an effective survey administered by interview or self-test. A transition rule applies to those already receiving assistance on the effective date of this requirement. State TANF assistance recipients must undergo drug screening after the 3rd month of approval, with testing for high-risk individuals. Waiver authority for this requirement is limited. The Secretary cannot waive the provisions of drug screening for TANF assistance recipients. Illegal drug is defined as a controlled substance. If assistance is denied, the State must continue providing assistance to other family members. The amendments made by this section regarding assistance for family members shall take effect on the 1st day of the 1st calendar quarter that begins on or after the date that is 1 year after the enactment of this Act. The amendments made by this Act require State legislation for State plans under the Social Security Act to meet additional requirements, without being considered non-compliant solely for not meeting them before the specified deadline. The Act requires State legislation to meet additional requirements for State plans under the Social Security Act, beginning after the close of the 1st regular session of the State legislature following the Act's enactment. Each year of a 2-year legislative session is considered a separate regular session."
