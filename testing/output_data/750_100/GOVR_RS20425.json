    "content": "The 1999 Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act (SHVIA) builds upon the 1988 Satellite Home Viewer Act (SHVA) regarding consumer access to television signals via satellite dishes. Major companies like EchoStar and DirecTV offer satellite TV services through their DBS systems. Rainbow DBS, a subsidiary of Cablevision, also provides satellite channels through Voom. The 1999 law, SHVIA, allows satellite companies to rebroadcast local network signals in the same market area, in addition to distant network signals. This gives consumers greater access to broadcast network television programming via their satellite dishes. The SHVIA law distinguishes between local and distant network signals, with local signals being received within a network affiliate's local area and distant signals coming from elsewhere in the country. Eligibility for receiving distant network signals via satellite is determined by the \"Grade B\" contour. Consumers living inside the Grade B contour were not allowed to receive distant network signals via satellite, while those outside (in \"white areas\") could. Some satellite companies transmitted signals to consumers inside Grade B contours, leading to court challenges. A Miami judge's decision in 1998 resulted in over 2 million consumers having their distant network signals terminated by satellite companies. EchoStar appealed to the Supreme Court in 2002, but the case was declined. In 2002, EchoStar appealed to the Supreme Court regarding the termination of distant network signals for over 2 million consumers. The FCC determined that new subscribers must not be able to receive a Grade B signal to access distant network signals under the SHVIA law. The FCC concluded that consumers can seek a waiver to receive distant network signals via satellite if they believe they are not getting a Grade A or Grade B signal. Consumers must apply to their satellite company for the waiver, which is then forwarded to the local network affiliate. The affiliate has 30 days to decide on granting the waiver. If granted, the consumer can receive distant network signals. If a waiver is denied, consumers can request a signal intensity test from their satellite company. The test is conducted jointly by the satellite company and the local affiliate, with the cost covered by the \"loser\" of the test. Exceptions are made for recreational vehicles and commercial trucks. Consumers using RVs or commercial trucks may receive distant network signals until December 31, 2004 if they do not receive a Grade B signal from a local affiliate, have a satellite dish on their vehicle, or had been receiving illegal signals terminated under 1998 court rulings. SHVIA permits DBS companies to provide \"local-into-local\" service, transmitting local broadcast TV signals to consumers in the designated market area. There is confusion regarding whether DBS companies are required to offer this service. The SHVIA permits DBS companies to offer \"local-into-local\" service, transmitting local broadcast TV signals in a designated market area. There is confusion about whether DBS companies must provide this service due to the \"must carry\" provision, which requires DBS companies to carry all local broadcast stations in a market if they choose to offer local broadcast programming in that market. This does not mean they have to carry local broadcast programming nationwide. Cable companies were not subject to the same requirements. The SHVIA allows DBS companies to offer \"local-into-local\" service, transmitting local broadcast TV signals in designated market areas. DBS companies oppose the must-carry requirement and have expanded their local-into-local service in various markets. EchoStar offers local-into-local in 152 markets, while DirecTV offers it in 106 markets, with plans to add more as capacity allows. There are 210 designated market areas in the US, meaning some smaller communities do not receive local signals. EchoStar and DirecTV offer local-into-local service in various designated market areas (DMAs) in the US. EchoStar serves 152 DMAs, while DirecTV serves 106 DMAs with plans to expand. The number of DMAs served does not necessarily reflect the percentage of the population able to receive local-into-local service. Congress passed the LOCAL Act in 2000 to ensure that small and rural areas without access to local-into-local service from EchoStar or DirecTV can still receive local television via other satellite options. The 1999 law extended the compulsory copyright license for satellite carriers to retransmit distant network and superstation signals at government-set prices, avoiding the need for individual negotiations with copyright owners. The 1999 law extended the compulsory copyright license for satellite carriers to retransmit distant network signals until December 31, 2004. The 108th Congress is considering further extension and potential changes to pricing. Satellite companies have a permanent compulsory copyright license for retransmitting local signals, while cable companies also have a permanent compulsory copyright license. The 1999 law allows satellite companies to offer local-into-local television service and extends must-carry requirements for satellites starting January 1, 2002. It also applies syndicated exclusivity, sports blackout, and network nonduplication rules to satellite retransmission of nationally distributed superstations. Subscribers affected by the 1998 court decision can have their distant network signals restored or continued until December 31, 2004.

Subscribers affected by the 1998 court decision can have their distant network signals restored or continued until December 31, 2004, with certain criteria and waivers in place. The 1999 law extends satellite copyright licenses for distant network and superstation signals, introduces a new license for local network signals, reduces royalty payments for satellite companies, eliminates waiting periods for cable subscribers, and allows national PBS feed until January 1, 2002. The 1999 law extended satellite copyright licenses for distant network and superstation signals, introduced a new license for local network signals, reduced royalty payments for satellite companies, eliminated waiting periods for cable subscribers, and allowed national PBS feed until January 1, 2002. After that date, local PBS stations would need to be carried in markets where local-into-local service is provided. In 1999, a proposed loan guarantee program to ensure subscribers in small and rural markets benefit from local-into-local provisions was deleted before final passage due to objections by Senator Gramm. Congress later passed the \"Launching Our Communities Access to Local Television Act\" (LOCAL) as Title X of the FY2001 Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations Act. The \"Launching Our Communities Access to Local Television Act\" (LOCAL) was enacted as Title X of the FY2001 Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations Act. It created a board to select recipients of loan guarantees for up to $1.25 billion in loans to build systems for consumers to receive local television signals, prioritizing underserved areas and high-speed Internet access. The LOCAL Act created a board to select recipients of loan guarantees for up to $1.25 billion in loans to build systems for consumers to receive local television signals in underserved areas. The Board issued regulations for the LOCAL Television Loan Guarantee Program and opened a 60-day application period after returning an incomplete application. The Board rescinded a decision to open another 60-day application period for the loan guarantee program administered by the Rural Utilities Service. Funding for the program was allocated through the FY2002 Agriculture appropriations act and the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act. GAO criticized the slow progress of the program in its annual reviews. The FCC's second report emphasized the need for accurate reporting of administrative costs and the selection of an independent entity to test for interference with DBS systems in the 12.2-12.7 Gigahertz frequency band, known as the \"Northpoint provision\". The FCC is considering granting a license for a terrestrial wireless system called MVDDS to offer TV programming and data services similar to DBS. Interference tests conducted by the MITRE Corporation in 2001 showed that MVDDS could coexist with DBS if certain mitigating techniques are used. DBS operators were concerned about interference, while Northpoint saw potential for mitigating steps. The FCC decided that MVDDS and DBS could co-exist with mitigating steps. Northpoint objected to the decision and did not participate in the auction, which raised $118.7 million. Legislation proposed to eliminate the auction requirement for fixed terrestrial services like MVDDS. Legislation proposed to eliminate the auction requirement for fixed terrestrial services like MVDDS in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band. Similar language was in the Senate-passed version of the FY2004 Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations bill."
