    "content": "The Act titled \"Debt Management and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2015\" requires the Secretary of the Treasury to report to Congress before reaching the debt limit.  \n\nSubchapter II of 31 USC is amended by adding a requirement for the Secretary of the Treasury to report to the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Ways and Means before the public debt reaches a certain limit. The Secretary of the Treasury must provide a debt report to the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Ways and Means before the public debt reaches a certain limit. The report includes historical debt levels, current debt amount, future projections, federal revenue levels, and drivers of future debt. The Secretary of the Treasury must report on future debt composition, meeting debt obligations if the limit is raised, and reduction measures if the limit is not raised. The Secretary has started implementing measures to control future debt accumulation, including specifying current measures in use. Additionally, if the President suggests a balanced budget amendment to Congress, a detailed explanation of proposals to reduce public debt in the short and medium term is required. The curr_chunk discusses the impact of an increased debt limit on future Government spending, debt service, and the position of the United States dollar as the international reserve currency. It also includes projections of fiscal health and sustainability of major direct-spending entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare. The curr_chunk discusses the President's plan to publicly disclose reduction measures used to avoid defaulting on government obligations when the debt limit is reached. The curr_chunk discusses the total dollar amount of reduction measures used and estimated amount still available, along with the date when all measures will be exhausted, leading to government default. It also mentions any extraordinary measures taken by the Secretary. The curr_chunk discusses the Secretary's plan for funding government obligations if the debt limit is not raised, including the duration and cost of these measures. It also addresses the Administration's ability to prioritize paying principal and interest on the national debt over other obligations. The curr_chunk discusses the progress report on implementing the President's proposals if the debt limit is reached, with a requirement for a detailed report if a Secretary has appeared at least once. The Secretary of the Treasury is responsible for public access to information. The Secretary of the Treasury is required to provide public access to information by placing a link on the Department of the Treasury's homepage to a repository of information, including debt reports, detailed explanations, progress reports, and other necessary information for at least 6 months. The term 'reduction measures' in this section refers to specific actions such as issuing debt through the Federal Financing Bank and suspending investments in the Government Securities Investment Fund of the Thrift Savings Fund. The reduction measures include suspending investments in the stabilization fund, new investments in the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, and selling assets before maturity. Other measures may also be taken as determined by the Secretary. The Secretary may determine appropriate measures, including other actions as necessary. The House of Representatives passed a report before reaching the debt limit on February 11, 2016. Karen L. Haas attested to this."
