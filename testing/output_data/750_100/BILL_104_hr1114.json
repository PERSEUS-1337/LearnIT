Section 13(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act is amended to allow 16- and 17-year-old employees to load materials into scrap paper balers and paper box compactors that are safe and cannot be operated while being loaded. Paper box compactors can be considered safe for 16- or 17-year-old employees to load if they meet specific safety standards set by the American National Standards Institute. The safety standards for scrap paper balers and paper box compactors include an on-off switch with a key-lock controlled by employees 18 years or older. The switch must be kept off when not in use, and employers must provide notice to 16- and 17-year-old employees. The safety standards for scrap paper balers and paper box compactors require 16- and 17-year-old employees to only load the machines, while employees under 18 cannot operate or unload them. The Secretary will publish a standard certified by the American National Standards Institute to protect minors' safety. Employers must report any injuries or fatalities of employees under 18 involving scrap paper balers or paper box compactors. Employers must report injuries or fatalities of employees under 18 involving the baler or compactor. Reports must include details such as employer and employee information, incident date, injury description, and how the incident occurred. These reports are used by the Secretary to assess the impact of safety measures on children. Employers must report injuries or fatalities of employees under 18 involving the baler or compactor, including details like employer and employee information, incident date, injury description, and how the incident occurred. Reports must be submitted promptly to the Secretary within 10 days of the incident. The Secretary cannot solely rely on these reports to determine violations of child labor laws and regulations. The Secretary must conduct an investigation and inspection before determining violations of child labor laws. Reporting requirements expire 2 years after enactment. SEC. 2 amends Section 16(e) of the Fair Labor Standards Act to include penalties for violations of section 12 or section 13(c)(5). SEC. 3 clarifies that Section 1 does not affect the exemption for apprentices and student learners.
