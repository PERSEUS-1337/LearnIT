    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Paleontological Resources Preservation Act\" and includes definitions for key terms. The Paleontological Resources Preservation Act defines \"casual collecting\" as the non-commercial collection of common invertebrate and plant paleontological resources with minimal disturbance, determined by the Secretary. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior for lands under their control, or the Secretary of Agriculture for National Forest System Lands. \"Federal lands\" include lands controlled by the Secretary of the Interior (excluding Indian lands) or National Forest System lands controlled by the Secretary of Agriculture. The term \"Indian Land\" refers to lands of Indian tribes or individuals held in trust or with restrictions against alienation by the United States. The term \"State\" includes the fifty States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and other U.S. territories. A \"paleontological resource\" is fossilized remains, traces, or imprints of organisms preserved in the earth's crust. A paleontological resource refers to organisms preserved in the earth's crust that provide information about the history of life on earth, excluding materials associated with archaeological resources or cultural items. The Secretary is responsible for managing and protecting paleontological resources on Federal lands using scientific principles. Plans for inventory, monitoring, and use of these resources must be developed in accordance with agency laws. Coordination between the Secretaries of Interior and Agriculture is encouraged. The Secretary will establish a public awareness program to educate about the importance of paleontological resources. Additionally, there will be a collection program for these resources. The Act requires a permit for collecting paleontological resources on Federal lands, except for casual collecting on certain lands without a permit. The Act requires a permit for collecting paleontological resources on Federal lands, except for casual collecting on certain lands without a permit. Previous permits issued before the enactment of this Act are not affected. The Secretary may issue a permit for collection if the applicant is qualified, the activity furthers paleontological knowledge or public education, and is consistent with applicable management plans. Permits for collecting paleontological resources on Federal lands must adhere to management plans and ensure the protection of natural and cultural resources. The permit will include terms set by the Secretary to maintain the collected resources as property of the United States. The permit for collecting paleontological resources on Federal lands in the United States includes requirements for preserving resources in an approved repository, restricting release of specific locality data without permission, and allowing modification, suspension, or revocation by the Secretary for various considerations. The permit for collecting paleontological resources on Federal lands may be revoked if a person working under the permit is convicted under section 7 or assessed a civil penalty under section 8. The Secretary has the authority to restrict access to or close areas to protect paleontological resources and ensure public safety. SEC. 6. CURATION OF RESOURCES. Paleontological resources collected under a permit must be deposited in an approved repository. The Secretary can make agreements with non-Federal repositories for curation. A person is prohibited from excavating, damaging, or altering paleontological resources on Federal lands without following the regulations. Additionally, exchanging or transporting these resources from Federal lands is also restricted if the person knew or should have known that the resources were obtained illegally. A person is prohibited from making false records or labels for paleontological resources excavated from Federal lands, with penalties for violations. Penalties for violating the prohibition on false records or labels for paleontological resources include fines or imprisonment up to 10 years. If the value of resources and restoration costs are under $500, the penalty is a fine or imprisonment up to one year. Prior to the enactment of this Act, any person in lawful possession of a paleontological resource is exempt from penalties. SEC. 8. CIVIL PENALTIES. The Secretary may assess penalties for violations of regulations or permits under this Act after a hearing. Penalties are determined based on factors like scientific or fair market value. Each violation is considered a separate offense. The Secretary may assess penalties for violations based on factors like the scientific or fair market value of the resource, cost of response, restoration, and any other relevant factors. For multiple offenses, the penalty amount may be doubled. The Secretary may assess penalties for violations based on factors like the scientific or fair market value of the resource, cost of response, restoration, and any other relevant factors. The penalty for a single violation cannot exceed double the cost of response, restoration, and repair of resources, plus double the scientific or fair market value of resources destroyed or not recovered. Judicial review of the penalty order can be filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The penalty order can be judicially reviewed in the District Court for the District of Columbia or the district where the violation occurred within 30 days. The court will base its decision on substantial evidence from the record made before the Secretary. Failure to pay the penalty within 30 days may result in further consequences. Within 30 days after a final assessment order or court judgment upholding a penalty, the Secretary may request the Attorney General to file a civil action in a US district court against the person. The district court has jurisdiction to collect penalties from individuals who fail to pay on time, with no review of the penalty's validity or amount allowed. Penalties collected under this section shall be used to protect, restore, or repair paleontological resources and sites, without the need for further appropriation. Hearings during proceedings must adhere to section 554 of title 5, United States Code. Individuals failing to pay civil penalties may also be responsible for attorneys' fees and collection costs. The actions authorized under this section include acquiring sites with resources, protecting, monitoring, and studying them, providing educational materials to the public, and paying rewards as specified in section 9. Rewards and forfeiture are addressed in section 9. The Secretary may pay rewards from penalties collected under section 7 or 8 to individuals who provide information leading to civil or criminal violations. The reward amount is determined by regulations or is half of the penalty, up to $500 if no regulation exists. \"State or local government officials performing official duties are eligible for payment under this subsection. Paleontological resources involved in violations may be subject to civil or criminal forfeiture, including vehicles and equipment used in the violation.\" The Act allows for the seizure and forfeiture of paleontological resources, with provisions for remission or mitigation of forfeiture. The Secretary can transfer seized resources to educational institutions for scientific or educational purposes. SEC. 10. CONFIDENTIALITY.\n\nInformation about paleontological resources requiring a permit is exempt from disclosure unless disclosure furthers the Act's purposes, poses no risk to the resource, and complies with other laws. The Secretary will issue regulations to implement the Act, allowing for public input. Additionally, there are savings provisions in place. The Act does not affect activities permitted under existing mining laws, leasing laws, or laws regulating mining activities. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 and the Organic Administration Act do not impose additional restrictions on activities permitted under existing laws related to reclamation and multiple uses of Federal lands. The Act also does not apply to casual collecting of certain natural resources or affect non-Federal lands. The Paleontological Resources Preservation Act does not affect non-Federal lands or interfere with the protection of paleontological resources on Federal lands by other laws. It also does not grant any rights or benefits to individuals not acting as officers or employees of the United States. No individual who is not an officer or employee of the United States acting in that capacity can file a civil action in a US court to enforce any provision or amendment made by the Paleontological Resources Preservation Act. Authorization of appropriations is granted to carry out the Paleontological Resources Preservation Act."
