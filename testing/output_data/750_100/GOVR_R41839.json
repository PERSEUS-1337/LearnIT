    "content": "The Dodd-Frank Act reformed the U.S. financial regulatory system by establishing the CFPB within the Federal Reserve System. The CFPB consolidates regulatory authority over various consumer financial products and services. The CFPB, established by the Dodd-Frank Act, supervises institutions offering mortgage lending, credit card lending, loan servicing, debt collection, and other consumer financial services. It enforces federal consumer laws like TILA and RESPA to protect consumers. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) was established by the Dodd-Frank Act to oversee various consumer financial products and activities. The Bureau's powers became effective at different times, with most authorities set to go into effect on the designated transfer date of July 21, 2011. The appointment of a Director can also affect the Bureau's authority to exercise its powers. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) was established by the Dodd-Frank Act to oversee consumer financial products. The Bureau's powers are affected by the appointment of a Director. The President has not appointed a Director yet, limiting the Secretary's authority to perform the Bureau's functions. The Secretary has interim authority over the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau until a Director is appointed, as outlined in Section 1066 of the CFP Act. Subsection 1066(b) grants the Treasury Department the power to provide administrative services to support the Bureau before the designated transfer date. The CFP Act grants the Treasury Department interim authority to provide administrative services to support the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau until a Director is appointed. The Secretary's powers under section 1066(b) include tasks like human resources and securing access to communication services. The Secretary has limited authority to perform the functions of the Bureau until a Director is confirmed by the Senate. The Secretary's powers do not expire until a Director is appointed. The Secretary's authorities under subsection 1066(a) do not expire until a Director is appointed, and the majority of the CFPB's authorities do not go into effect until the designated transfer date. Subtitle F transfers consumer financial protection functions from seven \"transferor agencies\" to the Bureau. The Bureau will receive authority from seven transferor agencies, including the OCC, OTS, FRB, FDIC, NCUA, FTC, and HUD, to prescribe rules and guidelines under Federal consumer financial laws. This transfer includes rulemaking authority under 18 consumer laws previously held by these agencies. The CFPB will receive authority from multiple agencies to enforce consumer financial laws over larger depository institutions, coordinate employee transfers, and prescribe rules and guidelines under Federal consumer laws. The CFPB will receive authority from various agencies to enforce consumer financial laws, transfer personnel, and implement rules under Federal consumer laws. Identified personnel must be transferred to the Bureau within 90 days of the designated transfer date. The Secretary may exercise all transferred authorities under subtitle F of the CFP Act. The Bureau will receive authority to enforce consumer financial laws, transfer personnel, and implement rules under Federal consumer laws. The Secretary may exercise all transferred authorities under subtitle F of the CFP Act until a CFPB Director is appointed. These authorities include consumer compliance supervisory and enforcement powers over larger depository institutions and the power to issue rules to implement consumer laws. The Bureau's powers under subtitle F include enhanced consumer protection authorities for non-depository financial institutions, new rulemaking powers, and limited enforcement powers over smaller depository institutions. The CFPB has powers to supervise non-depository financial institutions such as providers of payday loans, mortgage loans, mortgage brokerage services, foreclosure relief services, and student loans, as outlined in CFP Act section 1024. The Bureau also has flexibility to identify other institutions for supervision. The CFPB, under the CFP Act section 1024, has the authority to supervise non-depository financial institutions by conducting examinations, imposing reporting requirements, and ensuring compliance with consumer laws. This includes identifying \"larger participants\" in consumer financial markets and detecting risks to consumers. The CFPB's authority under section 1024 allows it to supervise non-depository financial institutions by setting eligibility standards and enforcing consumer compliance. This gives the Bureau similar supervisory powers over non-depository institutions as federal banking regulators have over depository institutions. The Bureau's new rulemaking powers under section 1024 of the CFP Act allow it to prescribe regulations, issue orders, and issue guidance to administer consumer financial laws and prevent evasions. Subtitle C provides more specific regulatory authority, such as declaring acts or practices related to consumer financial products and services. The Bureau has rulemaking authority to regulate consumer financial products and services, including disclosures and model forms. Enforcement powers over smaller depository institutions are limited, with the Bureau playing a back-up role. The CFPB has limited enforcement powers over smaller depository institutions, playing a back-up role to banking regulators. It can refer potential enforcement actions and participate in examinations on a sampling basis. The Bureau will have access to examination reports prepared by banking regulators of these institutions. The CFPB has limited supervisory and enforcement authority over smaller depository institutions, with the ability to require them to submit reports directly to the Bureau. These new powers are not considered \"administrative services\" under the CFP Act, and do not fall within the scope of the Secretary's interim Bureau authorities. The Bureau's actions have mainly been administrative or preparatory in nature, awaiting the appointment of a Director to exercise substantive authorities. No regulations have been proposed, no enforcement actions taken, and no supervisory activities initiated. The Bureau has not taken any binding enforcement actions or exercised supervisory powers over financial institutions. Instead, it has engaged with various parties, collected information on consumer financial products and services, complaints, and personnel transfer, conducted planning meetings, hired new personnel, and secured office space and websites. These administrative and preparatory steps align with its current actions. The administrative and preparatory steps taken by the Bureau align with its current actions and responsibilities outlined in the Treasury Department's CFPB annual report and Federal Register notice. These actions are in line with the CFP Act subsections 1066(a) and 1066(b). After the designated transfer date, the Bureau will acquire consumer compliance supervisory and enforcement powers over larger depository institutions, as well as rulemaking authority under TILA, RESPA, and other consumer laws. This potential expansion of interim powers would increase the likelihood of the Bureau having broader authority if a Director has not been appointed. The potential expansion of interim powers by the Bureau would lead to substantive actions impacting financial institutions in consumer markets. For instance, the FRB proposed regulations under TILA to impose origination standards on certain mortgage lenders. The 474-page proposal was issued on April 19, 2011, open for comments until July 22, 2011. On July 21, 2011, the authority to prescribe regulations under TILA will transfer to the Bureau. The authority to prescribe regulations under TILA will transfer to the Bureau, not the FRB. Final regulations imposing mortgage origination standards must be prescribed by the Bureau. The Secretary may also have the authority until a Bureau Director is appointed. The Secretary's authority under the CFP Act may be subject to interpretation, leading to potential lawsuits from parties claiming actions exceed authority. Lawsuit outcomes are unpredictable due to various factors."
