    "content": "The Act titled \"Consumer Assurance of Radiologic Excellence Act of 2003\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 outlines the findings and purposes of the Act. Congress finds that over 300 million medical imaging exams and radiation therapy treatments are conducted annually in the US, with 7 out of 10 Americans undergoing these procedures each year. These procedures have a significant impact on public health, safety, and interstate commerce, making it crucial to prioritize public health and safety. (4) To minimize unnecessary radiation exposure during medical imaging and therapy, personnel must have appropriate education and credentials.\n(5) State governments should oversee accreditation and certification programs to ensure a continuous supply of qualified individuals.\n(6) All individuals involved in medical imaging or therapy, including those at Federal facilities, must be properly trained and certified. Facilities conducting medical imaging or radiation therapy must demonstrate competence through education, training, and experience. The responsibility for ensuring the safety and efficacy of procedures lies with both State and Federal Governments, as these facilities impact interstate commerce with patients traveling across state lines for services. In 1981, Congress enacted the Consumer-Patient Radiation Health and Safety Act of 1981 (Public Law 97-35) to establish Federal standards for accreditation of education programs for medical imaging and radiation therapy personnel. Twenty-two years after the Consumer-Patient Radiation Health and Safety Act of 1981, 13 States do not require licensure for medical imaging and radiation therapy, while 37 States regulate radiographers, 28 States license radiation therapists, and 22 States license nuclear medicine technologists. The purposes of this Act are to ensure accreditation of education programs and licensure or certification for individuals involved in medical imaging and radiation therapy to guarantee safety and accuracy in these procedures. SEC. 3 amends the Public Health Service Act to include a new section on the quality of medical imaging and radiation therapy. The Secretary will establish standards for the safety and accuracy of medical imaging and radiation therapy, including licensure, certification, and accreditation. Exemptions are provided for physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. The Secretary will ensure individuals meet these standards before undergoing procedures. The Secretary will ensure individuals meet standards for medical imaging and radiation therapy by completing a national exam and meeting other requirements. Approved bodies will certify educational programs. The Secretary will establish standards for accrediting educational programs and administering exams. Approved organizations must meet these standards and provide required assurances. Minimum standards will be set for certification, recordkeeping, curriculum approval, instructor approval, fee charging, and additional requirements. To be certified as an approved body, an organization must comply with set standards, notify the Secretary of any changes, and provide necessary information. Withdrawal of approval is possible if these requirements are not met. The Secretary may withdraw certification of an approved body if it fails to meet standards. Accreditation or examination completion remains valid until expiration in such cases. The Secretary may withdraw certification of an approved body if it fails to meet standards, with accreditation or examination validity lasting until a reasonable period for obtaining new accreditation or completing another examination. Existing State standards are considered compliant unless determined otherwise by the Secretary. The Secretary may withdraw certification of an approved body if it fails to meet standards, with accreditation or examination validity lasting until a reasonable period for obtaining new accreditation or completing another examination. State standards are considered compliant unless determined otherwise by the Secretary. The Secretary shall periodically evaluate the performance of each approved body and include the results in a report submitted to relevant committees. Delivery of and payment for services must be done within a specified timeframe. The Secretary will establish regulations within 18 months to ensure medical imaging and radiation therapy programs meet standards. Alternative standards for rural areas will be determined by the Secretary for payment of these services. The Secretary will establish regulations within 18 months to ensure medical imaging and radiation therapy programs meet standards in rural areas. Alternative standards may be developed to guarantee quality access to these services. The Secretary will establish regulations within 18 months to ensure medical imaging and radiation therapy programs meet standards in rural areas. An approved body is defined as a nonprofit organization or State agency certified by the Secretary to accredit or administer examinations for individuals in medical imaging or radiation therapy. The term 'perform' in medical imaging or radiation therapy refers to directly exposing a patient to radiation or a magnetic field for imaging or therapy, and positioning the patient for exposure. The term 'plan' in medical imaging or radiation therapy involves preparing for a procedure by evaluating site-specific information and customizing it for the patient. Radiation therapy refers to procedures intended for disease treatment in humans. Radiation therapy is a method used for the mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in humans through the emission of radiation."
