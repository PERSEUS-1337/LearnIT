    "content": "Federal job training and employment programs have aimed to connect vulnerable youth to work and school since the 1930s. These young people are typically low-income with barriers to employment, such as dropping out of school or being in foster care. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 provides job training and related services for unemployed and underemployed individuals, including youth. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 provides job training programs for youth, including the WIA Youth Activities formula program, Job Corps, and YouthBuild, all under the Department of Labor. These programs aim to connect youth to educational and employment opportunities. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 aims to connect youth to educational and employment opportunities through programs like WIA Youth Activities and Job Corps. Funding for WIA programs continues through annual appropriation acts, with potential reauthorization in the 112th Congress. Relevant provisions of H.R. 803 and S. 1356 are discussed in this report. The Workforce Investment Act of 2013 includes programs like WIA Youth Activities, Job Corps, YouthBuild, and Reintegration of Ex-Offenders, providing job training and employment services for youth. The Workforce Investment Act of 2013 includes programs like WIA Youth Activities, Job Corps, YouthBuild, and Reintegration of Ex-Offenders, providing job training and employment services for youth. Additionally, there are other programs such as Youth Opportunity Grants (YOG) and a demonstration program for juvenile and adult offenders that offer job training and services. Although WIA's authorization expired in FY2003, Congress continues to appropriate funds for youth job training programs, except for the YOG program which has not been funded since FY2003. The Division of Youth Services in DOL's Employment and Training Administration administers programs like Youth Activities, Job Corps, YouthBuild, Reintegration of Ex-Offenders, and Youth Opportunity Grants. These programs aim to connect low-income youth to educational and employment opportunities, with YouthBuild specifically targeting high school dropouts. The Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program focuses on youth offenders and those at risk of dropping out. The program provides employment and educational services through different entities. For example, the Youth Activities program requires local areas to provide specific elements like mentoring to youth. YouthBuild participants engage in construction-related activities, while Job Corps offers residential services for youth. The Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program provides residential services for youth, including mentoring, educational services, and reentry services. Funding for Youth Activities is allocated by DOL to states, which then distribute the funds to local WIBs. Job Corps centers are operated through competitively awarded agreements with nonprofit and for-profit organizations. DOL also collaborates with USDA for Forest Services. DOL collaborates with USDA Forest Service for Job Corps programs on USDA lands. YouthBuild and Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program award grants to nonprofit organizations for youth employment. Congress is working on reauthorizing WIA, with recent hearings addressing issues in youth programs. The Senate HELP Committee held listening sessions in April 2009 to discuss positive aspects of WIA and potential improvements. Stakeholders spoke about refining the Youth Activities grant program. A subsequent hearing in July 2009 focused on updating WIA to meet changing economic demands. In October 2009, the House Education committee also addressed WIA reauthorization. During the 112th Congress, hearings were held to address declining youth employment and modernizing job training programs under WIA. The House Education and Workforce Committee discussed reauthorizing WIA with the Workforce Investment Improvement Act of 2012 (H.R. 4297). The Senate HELP Committee released discussion drafts in June 2011. During the 112th Congress, discussions were held on reauthorizing WIA with the Workforce Investment Improvement Act of 2012. In the 113th Congress, H.R. 803, the SKILLS Act, was introduced by Representative Virginia Foxx and ordered reported by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. The committee ordered the bill reported on March 6, 2013. The House passed the bill on March 15, 2013. In the Senate, the Workforce Investment Act of 2013 was introduced on July 24, 2013. Issues raised during the WIA reauthorization process include consolidating workforce programs. States may have more flexibility to target funds for workforce programs for adults, dislocated workers, and youth. Advocates believe consolidation could increase efficiency and reduce costs, but some worry that at-risk youth may be overlooked. Congress may need to consider the role of one-stop centers and oversight bodies for youth programs. Coordination between the workforce system and other systems serving youth, like education, is also a concern. Greater coordination is needed between the workforce system and other systems serving youth, such as education, to meet the varied needs of youth as intended by WIA. Congress is interested in the effectiveness of youth workforce programs, with only Job Corps having completed an impact evaluation so far. DOL has awarded a contract for an impact evaluation of YouthBuild. Congress is also focused on issues specific to Youth Activities and Job Corps. Issues specific to Youth Activities and Job Corps include discussions on youth eligibility requirements, concerns about income eligibility excluding needy youth, challenges in obtaining proof of income, the necessity of requirements to ensure enrollment of vulnerable youth, and the emphasis on serving older youth. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 is also a relevant factor in this discussion. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 temporarily allowed youth ages 22 through 24 to access services under the Youth Activities program. Stakeholders have raised concerns about the school status of youth in the program and the eligibility age for participation. Congress has considered proposals for federal funding for states to operate Job Corps. Congress has considered proposals to provide federal funding for states to operate Job Corps centers, due to concerns about mixed performance outcomes and low-performing centers. A 2011 report by the Government Accountability Office found overlap in federal workforce programs, with varying models and services provided. The Government Accountability Office recommended consolidating administration of selected workforce programs, including the Employment Service and training services under Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. Legislation in the 113th Congress aimed to consolidate certain workforce programs. Legislation in the 113th Congress aimed to consolidate multiple workforce programs, including those serving youth, under Title I of WIA. The Workforce Investment Improvement Act of 2013 (H.R. 803) would merge Youth Activities, YouthBuild, and Reintegration of Ex-Offenders into a single Workforce Investment Fund allocated to states for employment and training activities. Job Corps would remain separate, with significant changes proposed. Required activities would include providing \"work ready services\" in one-stop delivery. The Workforce Investment Improvement Act of 2013 aims to consolidate workforce programs for youth under Title I of WIA. It would provide work-ready services in one-stop delivery systems, including core and intensive services, internship, and work experience. Funding allocation to states is based on factors like the number of disadvantaged youth. Funding is then distributed to local workforce investment areas. No separate funding stream is included for youth workforce. The bill does not have a separate funding stream for youth workforce training but requires states to set aside funding from the WIF for a competitive grant program for individuals with barriers to employment, including low-income youth aged 16 or older. States can award grants to local boards or nonprofits to provide employment and training services. State and local workforce investment boards must outline strategies and services in their plans. The bill requires states to set aside funding from the WIF for a competitive grant program to assist at-risk and out-of-school youth in acquiring education, skills, credentials, and employment experience. This includes dropout recovery activities, remediation of academic skills, work readiness training, and internships in in-demand industries. The bill aims to assist at-risk youth aged 16-24 through education, skills training, and work experience. Concerns have been raised about potential reduced youth services under the proposed WIF due to lack of specific funding allocation. S. 1356 aims to support at-risk youth aged 16-24 through education, skills training, and work experience. Concerns have been raised about potential reduced youth services due to the bill not setting aside a minimum amount of funding specifically for youth. The bill would maintain existing youth programs and establish Youth Innovation and Replication Grants to improve education and employment outcomes for youth through competitive grants to states and localities. Congress may need to consider the role of one-stop centers in serving youth if youth programs are consolidated with other workforce programs. One-stop centers play a crucial role in connecting youth to job training and employment services, even if they are not eligible for specific youth programs. These centers, which are part of nearly 20 federal programs, offer various methods to attract youth, such as active recruitment efforts by local directors. Some local WIB directors actively recruit youth for one-stop centers, but challenges exist in attracting them. Recommendations include catering more to youth and better training service professionals on youth matters. DOL encourages targeting youth at one-stop centers. DOL encourages one-stop centers to enhance youth connections by co-locating youth program staff, coordinating outreach, and customizing facilities to be more \"youth-friendly.\" Under H.R. 803 and S. 1356, states would be required to continue funding one-stop centers for job search and assistance, without specifying how youth would be served. The bills also raise questions about the consolidation of youth services and the role of youth councils within local WIBs. The youth council consists of members with expertise in youth policy, representatives from various agencies, and parents of eligible youth. The National Youth Employment Coalition has noted challenges in youth councils evolving beyond advisory roles to WIBs, as highlighted in a 2002 GAO report. In its 2002 report, GAO identified challenges with establishing youth councils, such as difficulty in getting youth or parents to participate due to transportation issues or conflicting schedules. A 2002 report for DOL highlighted \"enabling conditions\" for innovative youth councils, including the presence of an established intermediary organization and strong school-to-career partnerships. Stakeholders recommend a stronger role for youth councils, enabling greater flexibility in partnerships and priorities. They suggest developing a comprehensive youth plan to coordinate activities. The councils are required to develop a comprehensive youth plan to coordinate activities and consolidate funding streams. Reauthorization legislation may make youth councils optional, with state boards needing representatives with youth interests. State and local workforce investment boards must address the needs of vulnerable youth in their plans. S. 1356 proposes changing local workforce investment boards to local workforce development boards (LWDB) and requires LWDBs to establish three standing committees for the one-stop system, youth services, and disability services. The youth committee must include community-based organizations serving eligible youth. Existing entities can fulfill committee requirements if they meet the criteria. Congress may consider eliminating or making youth councils optional, but should look to best practices for facilitating youth workforce activities. Coordination between the workforce and education systems is a concern, with provisions in WIA intended to address this issue. Local boards are required to have representatives from the education system. Some stakeholders suggest that greater coordination between education and workforce systems can help meet the needs of youth as intended by WIA. Existing WIA infrastructure like one-stop centers and youth councils can facilitate this coordination, as discussed at a Senate HELP Committee's listening session on WIA and youth in 2004. The Senate HELP Committee's listening session in 2004 discussed the collaboration between workforce and education systems under WIA. A 2004 GAO report highlighted the need for improvements in the Youth Activities program, noting that about half of youth received services through various entities. Some educators were hesitant to partner, according to GAO. Some educators were cautious about partnering with WIA for youth development services, citing concerns about the program being targeted only towards at-risk youth. At a 2009 hearing, officials testified about challenges in collaboration between the Department of Labor and Department of Education. Assistant Secretary of Labor Jane Oates testified about the collaboration between the Department of Labor and Department of Education on youth services. The School-to-Work program was a successful example of their joint efforts, providing grants for work-based learning and job training programs. Congress could learn from the program's successes. H.R. 803, the reauthorization legislation passed by the House in 2013, includes provisions for coordinating workforce and education systems. It allows local areas to include education officials on workforce investment boards, but this coordination is not mandatory. The local plan under H.R. 803 requires local areas to identify strategies and services for youth education and skills for the labor market. The Senate bill S. 1356 also addresses coordination with the education system, requiring states to submit a Unified State Plan every four years covering various programs under WIA. The plan under WIA must include an analysis of state economic conditions, state vision and goals for workforce preparation, and may cover programs like adult education, vocational rehabilitation, and youth programs. Congress and stakeholders are concerned about the effectiveness of youth programs under WIA. The evaluation of youth programs under WIA, including Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild, has shown that they have met or exceeded their goals. The common measures used across these programs have been successful in assessing their performance as required by Section 172 of WIA. The evaluation of programs under WIA is required by law to assess their effectiveness relative to cost. Legislation from the 113th Congress would mandate independent evaluations every five years. Limited information exists on the overall effectiveness of these programs, as highlighted in a 2011 GAO report on workforce programs. The 2011 GAO report highlighted limited information on the effectiveness of workforce programs, with only 5 out of 47 programs having impact studies since 2004. None of the programs studied were youth programs authorized under WIA. The 2011 GAO report emphasized the lack of information on the effectiveness of workforce programs, with only a few impact studies conducted since 2004. Specifically, youth programs authorized under WIA have not been thoroughly evaluated for their impacts on participants. However, there are ongoing efforts to assess the impact of the YouthBuild program on youth employment and other outcomes, with initial results expected in 2015. The DOL completed a process evaluation of the Job Corps program to assess center practices related to job placement, earnings, and education. The study focused on general center management, academic training, Career Technical Training (CTT), and student life. Results on the program's impact on youth employment are expected in 2015. The Job Corps program was evaluated in the late 1990s to early 2000s to assess its impact on youth ages 16-24. Factors linked to strong performance included robust student support, staff accountability, and partner relationships. The Job Corps program was evaluated in the late 1990s to early 2000s for youth ages 16-24. A follow-up report analyzed the longer-term impacts on earnings and employment rates 5 to 10 years after enrollment. Positive employment effects diminished over time, but increased earnings were found for youth aged 20-24 at the time of application. The benefits for older youth aged 20-24 outweighed the costs in the program. WIA specifies performance measures for Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild. Concerns have been raised about disincentives for serving youth with barriers to employment. H.R. 803, the WIA reauthorization bill, addresses these issues. The WIA reauthorization bill, H.R. 803, aims to eliminate current youth core performance measures and introduce new indicators for participants in the Workforce Investment Fund. These new measures include entry into unsubsidized employment, retention in unsubsidized employment, change in earnings, and attainment of postsecondary credentials. The WIA reauthorization bill, H.R. 803, introduces new indicators for eligible youth in activities funded by the WIA Youth Activities program. These indicators include entry into education, training, or employment; retention in education, training, or employment; earnings for employed individuals; attainment of industry-recognized credentials; and unsubsidized employment in a related field. The WIA reauthorization bill, H.R. 803, introduces new indicators for eligible youth in activities funded by the WIA Youth Activities program, including entry into education, training, or employment; retention in education, training, or employment; earnings for employed individuals; attainment of industry-recognized credentials; and unsubsidized employment in a related field. States may also require additional performance indicators, and the DOL Secretary must establish performance measures for Job Corps center operators based on these indicators. State and local performance measures under WIA assess the effectiveness of workforce investment activities to optimize the return on investment of federal funds. State performance measures include core indicators for youth programs. The core indicators for youth programs under WIA vary by age group, with different indicators for ages 14-18 and ages 19-21. States negotiate with DOL to establish performance levels for each indicator. Some stakeholders argue that performance measures for youth programs may not accurately reflect the progress of at-risk youth, leading programs to prioritize higher-functioning individuals to meet targets. In a 2008 report, the Government Accountability Office found that some programs only accepted youth at specific grade levels to ensure goal achievement. DOL officials were aware of WIBs implementing program contracts that may discourage lower-skilled youth. DOL issued guidance in 2010 on strategies to help service providers assist youth in need while meeting performance goals. The GAO report recommended strategies to improve provider performance in serving youth, including using real-time indicators, factoring participant characteristics, and promoting interagency collaboration. The GAO report suggested using common measures for career education and employment programs to provide flexibility for working with youth at different ability levels. The 2010 DOL guidance encourages the adoption of \"real-time\" indicators like changes in attitudes, behaviors, knowledge, and skills to track youth progress during or after program completion. Examples include learning gains, grade improvements, and increased retention rates in alternative education. Some suggest adjusting performance levels for workforce investment boards to better serve higher-risk youth populations. Insights from the Job Training Partnership Act could inform adjustments for local areas serving the neediest youth in WIA reauthorization. The JTPA allowed for adjustments to national performance standards set by the DOL for youth and other populations. Governors could adjust standards for service delivery areas (SDAs) based on economic and demographic factors, similar to local workforce investment boards. This process aimed to \"level the playing field\" across areas with different conditions, using DOL adjustment models or state-developed approaches under JTPA. Job Corps under WIA must establish over 20 core performance metrics, including measures like entered employment and average wage. DOL has added 33 performance metrics based on GPRA requirements to assess program performance. The DOL Office of the Inspector General raised concerns about Job Corps' implementation of performance metrics, including inaccurate reporting, lack of established targets, and miscalculated costs for program participants. The final regulation for YouthBuild, issued in February 2012, outlines performance indicators for grantees, including placement in employment or education, attainment of a degree, literacy and numeracy gains, and other indicators required by the Secretary. The final regulation for YouthBuild, issued in February 2012, outlines performance indicators for grantees, including placement in employment or education, attainment of a degree, literacy and numeracy gains, and other indicators required by the Secretary. DOL will provide details of the performance indicators in administrative guidance. DOL has issued guidance to grantees as part of the process for awarding grants. In addition to the three common measures, DOL has two other goals for the program: retention rate and recidivism rate. Under H.R. 803, stakeholders are discussing eligibility criteria for the YouthBuild program, including serving out-of-school and older youth. States and local areas would need strategies to assist participants who are re-arrested within a year of enrollment. In March 2013, states and local areas would need strategies and services to assist at-risk youth, defined as low-income individuals with barriers to employment, and out-of-school youth aged 16-24. States and localities would not be required to serve a specific percentage or allocate a minimum amount of funding for these services. Eligibility for the Youth Activities formula program includes being age 14-21, low-income, and having barriers like basic literacy deficiency, school dropout, homelessness, pregnancy, or being an offender. The WIA Youth program serves at-risk youth, including those who are homeless, pregnant, offenders, or in need of additional assistance. There is debate over the requirement for youth to prove their low-income status for eligibility. State and local officials have found it challenging to document income eligibility for many potentially eligible youth. The WIA Youth program faces challenges as potentially eligible youth struggle to provide required documentation of their low-income status, diverting resources from service delivery. State and local officials find it difficult to verify income eligibility for many youth. Some needy youth may face challenges in proving their eligibility for the WIA program, such as providing documentation for involvement in foster care or the criminal justice system. States have requested waivers for certain eligibility criteria under WIA. States and local areas can request waivers for certain requirements under WIA, but participant eligibility cannot be waived. While states have the authority to establish their own policies for verifying eligibility, stakeholders argue that WIA regulations do not provide enough flexibility in documenting income and eligibility factors. Some states and localities preferred using certain eligibility criteria from WIA's predecessor, the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), for in-school and out-of-school youth. Eligibility criteria included participation in the federal free lunch program, Title I programs, or meeting the definition of \"economically disadvantaged.\" Some stakeholders suggest expanding eligibility criteria for out-of-school youth under WIA to include residency in high-poverty areas and certain at-risk groups like dropouts and homeless youth, aiming to serve the most vulnerable youth. The goal of WIA is to serve vulnerable youth, but it is uncertain how changing eligibility requirements to be based on means-tested programs or residency would impact the number of eligible youth. Stakeholders question if the Youth Activities program should focus more on out-of-school youth, including those not working. WIA mandates that 30% of funds be used for out-of-school youth activities. The 2002 and 2004 GAO reports found challenges in recruiting and retaining out-of-school youth for WIA programs due to higher costs and difficulties in maintaining contact, especially with transportation issues. Some stakeholders suggest allocating more WIA Youth funding to dropouts and high-risk youth, including those not in school or lacking credits to graduate. Previous legislation aimed to prioritize out-of-school youth, while others argue for serving in-school youth as well. Some bills argue for maintaining current funding for out-of-school youth but increasing technical assistance. DOL has provided guidance on serving out-of-school and at-risk in-school youth. In response to concerns, DOL recommended strong alternative education programs for out-of-school youth. The Department of Labor (DOL) recommended strong alternative education programs for out-of-school youth, including dropouts and those at risk of dropping out. In FY2007, DOL funded the Multiple Education Pathways Blueprint Grants to reconnect youth who have dropped out to various education pathways in seven midsize cities. Additionally, a 2004 report highlighted successful strategies in serving out-of-school youth, such as providing technical assistance and resources like Minnesota's list of resources. Minnesota compiled resources for out-of-school youth, including articles, guides, and Job Corps strategies. Some areas hired service providers for GED programs and vocational training. WIA eligibility is for ages 14-21, with the ARRA of 2009 temporarily extending services to age 24. The WIA Youth services have expanded the upper age limit to reach more unemployed young adults. Research shows that young people are taking longer to transition to adulthood due to factors like delayed marriage, high living costs, and more educational opportunities. Vulnerable youth face challenges like family conflict and obstacles to independence. The research literature shows that older youth face challenges such as family conflict and obstacles to securing adequate employment. They are more likely to be disconnected, not working or in school, compared to younger youth. There is a debate on whether WIA should target these older, disconnected youth in any reauthorization legislation. However, increasing the age limit for youth in the program could strain resources if funding remains stable. According to a GAO report, 7% of approximately 300,000 youth were affected by oversight of ARRA activities. According to a GAO report on oversight of ARRA activities, about 7% of the 300,000 youth in the Youth program funded by ARRA were ages 22 through 24, totaling around 21,000 youth. DOL has advised workforce investment systems to co-enroll older youth in both the Youth Activities program and Adult Activities program to meet their individual needs. This allows older youth to receive mentoring services under the Youth program and be eligible for services under the Adult program. In the Youth program, individuals aged 18-21 can access an individual training account (ITA) for occupational skills training. The participation of youth in the Youth and Adult programs is unclear. Exiters aged 19-21 in the Youth program have increased from 28.1% in 2008 to 34.8% in recent years, compared to 10% of youth aged 18-21 in the Adult program. The Youth program offers more academic services like tutoring and alternative secondary school services, while the Adult program focuses on job search assistance and workplace training with related instruction. The Youth program emphasizes leadership development and community service, while the Adult program focuses on occupational skills training and employment links, primarily for participants in the training component. Training activities include on-the-job training, workplace training with related instruction, private sector programs, skill upgrading, and entrepreneurial training. The Youth program also provides supportive services. The Youth program emphasizes leadership development, community service, and adult mentoring, while the Adult program focuses on occupational skills training, job counseling, and referrals to supportive services. The Department of Labor published a request for comment on selecting low-performing centers for closure based on performance ratings. The Department of Labor is considering closing low-performing centers based on three primary criteria: Performance rating, On-board strength, and Facility condition. They also plan to ensure at least one center remains in each state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, and exempt certain centers from closure. The Department of Labor is considering closing low-performing centers as part of its reform agenda to improve performance. While cost is not cited as a driving factor, budget constraints emphasize the need to maximize results for students and taxpayers. The comment period for the closures has ended. The Department of Labor is considering closing low-performing centers to improve performance and maximize results for students and taxpayers. H.R. 803 includes provisions to improve and close underperforming centers, with new performance measures and a program improvement plan for low-performing centers. The bill H.R. 803 aims to close low-performing centers based on a 10-year performance audit, ranking them on performance and incidents of violence. The DOL Secretary must submit a report to Congress identifying centers in the bottom quintile, and close them within 12 months of enactment. The DOL Secretary is to close low-performing centers ranked in the bottom quintile based on a 10-year performance audit. Previous proposals aimed to close inefficient Job Corps centers to improve program efficiency, but they were not implemented. Legislation in the 104th Congress also sought to close underperforming centers based on an audit and specific criteria. The DOL plans to close 25 underperforming Job Corps centers based on an audit and specific criteria. There is a proposal to transfer operation of Job Corps from the federal government to the states, but some Members object to this idea. The DOL plans to close 25 underperforming Job Corps centers based on specific criteria. There is a proposal to transfer operation of Job Corps from the federal government to the states, with arguments for and against the change. The Workforce Investment Act of 2013 would direct the Secretary to determine when a center is to be closed. The Workforce Investment Act of 2013 proposed closing underperforming Job Corps centers and transferring operations to states. It would eliminate existing performance indicators, establish new performance levels, and require a performance improvement plan within a one-year period. The Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration (ETA) introduced common measures for workforce programs like Youth Activities and Job Corps in 2003 to improve program performance reporting. Measures include placement in employment or education, degree attainment, and literacy and numeracy gains. The Employment and Training Administration (ETA) introduced common measures in 2003 for programs like Youth Activities and Job Corps to improve performance reporting. These measures are not meant to replace existing statutory reporting requirements and are used to assess program performance under the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA). The common measures introduced by the Employment and Training Administration in 2003 aim to improve performance reporting for programs like Youth Activities and Job Corps. These measures, first enacted in 1993, require federal agencies to measure program performance. Table A-1 outlines the goals and outcomes for Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild programs for PY2011 and PY2012. The goals for the common measures are set ambitiously by the Department of Labor (DOL) and may need adjustments for individual grantees. The Department of Labor (DOL) sets ambitious goals for programs like Youth Activities and Job Corps, with performance targets developed using regression analysis. The regression model for Youth Activities considers factors like program results from the prior year, current labor market conditions, and individual characteristics to adjust for the effects of the business cycle and labor market conditions on employment and training outcomes. The Department of Labor sets performance targets for programs like YouthBuild and Job Corps based on regression analysis. Common measures include placement in employment or education, with both programs meeting or exceeding goals in PY2011 and PY2012. The Department of Labor sets performance targets for programs like YouthBuild and Job Corps based on regression analysis, including placement in employment or education. Placement measure refers to the share of youth enrolled in postsecondary education, advanced training, or employed in the first quarter after the exit quarter. Attainment of a Degree or Certificate measures the share of youth participants who attain a diploma, GED, or certificate by the end of the third quarter. The Department of Labor measures the attainment of a diploma, GED, or certificate by youth participants, excluding those in postsecondary school. Work readiness certificates do not qualify as diplomas. Youth who are deficient in basic skills and not in school are also included in the measurement. The measure of literacy or numeracy gains for out-of-school youth participants focuses on the increase in educational functional levels. Each youth undergoes an initial assessment in reading, writing, and math before starting the program. The measure of literacy or numeracy gains for out-of-school youth participants focuses on assessing educational functional levels. Youth must take pre-tests within 60 days of receiving services and be tested regularly after entering the program, with a maximum of one year. Those not basic skills-deficient are excluded to focus on remediation. DOL provides guidance on test types, accommodations for disabilities, and the purpose of excluding certain individuals."
