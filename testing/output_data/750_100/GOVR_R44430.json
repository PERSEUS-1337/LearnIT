The Obama Administration's FY2017 request for OVW was $489 million, slightly higher than the FY2016 appropriation of $480 million, with a proposed transfer of $326 million from the Crime Victims Fund. The Obama Administration's FY2017 request included increases for grants to combat domestic violence, civil legal assistance, violence on college campuses, abuse against the elderly, and tribal justice systems. Additionally, funding was proposed for initiatives to reduce firearm lethality in domestic violence cases and enhance responses to campus sexual assault. The Obama Administration's FY2017 request proposed increasing funding for grants to combat domestic violence, civil legal assistance, violence on college campuses, abuse against the elderly, and tribal justice systems. Congress adopted a $326 million transfer from the Crime Victims Fund to supplement direct appropriations for the Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31), but largely declined to support the rest of the Administration's proposals. Congress did not fully support the Obama Administration's proposals to increase funding for grants to combat domestic violence, civil legal assistance, violence on college campuses, abuse against the elderly, and tribal justice systems. However, Congress did fund STOP grants at the same level as the previous year in FY2017. The Office of Justice Programs manages various grant programs related to justice and victim services. The Research, Evaluation, and Statistics account funds the operations of the Bureau of Justice Statistics and the National Institute of Justice. The Obama Administration requested a $154 million budget for FY2017, a 32.8% increase over the previous year. This includes funding increases for the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the National Institute of Justice, and a forensic sciences improvement program. Additionally, funding was requested for two new initiatives. The Administration requested funding for two new initiatives: a clearinghouse for information on evidence-based programs ($3 million) and an incident-based crime statistics program ($10 million). Congress provided $89 million for the Research, Evaluation, and Statistics account for FY2017, with a decrease in funding largely due to moving funds for the Regional Information Sharing System. The State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance account funds various grant programs to improve criminal justice systems. Examples include the JAG program, Drug Courts program, SCAAP, and DNA backlog reduction grants. The Obama Administration's FY2017 request was $1.098 billion, 22.1% less than FY2016. Funding for the State Criminal Alien Assistance program was proposed to be eliminated. The Obama Administration proposed cutting funding for various programs, including SCAAP, Coverdell Forensic Sciences, grants for trafficking victims, John R. Justice program, and tribal assistance. However, grants to assist trafficking victims from the Crime Victims Fund would still be funded. Additionally, 7% of funding from State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance accounts would support tribal programs. The Obama Administration proposed reducing funding for various programs under the State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance account, including the JAG program, National Criminal History Improvement program, and DNA backlog reduction initiatives. However, it also suggested increasing funding for reentry initiatives authorized under the Second Chance Act and programs for children exposed to violence. The Obama Administration proposed increasing funding for reentry initiatives authorized under the Second Chance Act, programs for children exposed to violence, grants for residential substance abuse treatment, and programs to assist people with mental illness in the criminal justice system.

The Obama Administration proposed increased funding for various programs, including $15 million for the Byrne Competitive Grant program, $20 million for grants to improve fairness in the justice system, and $5 million for the Violence Reduction Network to reduce violence through data-driven strategies. Congress reduced funding for the State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance account by 9.1%, or $128 million, for FY2017. Some of the reduction is due to Congress choosing to fund several programs as set-asides from the JAG program instead of funding them as individual line items under the State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance account. Congress also reduced top-line funding for JAG by $73 million. Congress reduced funding for the JAG program by $73 million for FY2017, resulting in a decrease in available funding from $347 million to $335 million. Funding for tribal assistance programs was eliminated, but DOJ was authorized to use up to 7% of certain accounts for tribal justice assistance programs. Additionally, $103 million was provided for an opioid initiative under the State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance account. The funding for the opioid initiative under the State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance account includes money from various programs such as Drug Courts, Veterans Treatment Courts, Residential Substance Abuse Treatment, Prescription Drug Monitoring, and programs for individuals with mental illness in the criminal justice system. Additionally, $13 million was allocated for programs authorized by the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016 authorizes funding for programs to address opioid abuse reduction. Congress did not fund new programs proposed by the Obama Administration.

Additionally, funding was requested to be restored to the Juvenile Accountability Block Grants and for a Smart on Juvenile Justice Initiative. The Obama Administration proposed funding increases for various juvenile justice programs in FY2017, but Congress reduced funding for Juvenile Justice Programs account by 8.6%. This led to cuts in funding for JJDPA Part B state formula grants, youth mentoring grants, and Title V grants. In FY2017, Congress reduced funding for Juvenile Justice Programs, including cuts to JJDPA Part B state formula grants, youth mentoring grants, and Title V grants. The Obama Administration's proposed new programs were not funded, but funding for the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Office increased by $74 million compared to FY2016. The Obama Administration requested a $42 million increase in funding for the COPS hiring program in FY2017. Congress appropriated $222 million for the COPS account, a 4.5% increase from the previous year. Funding for the COPS hiring program was increased from $187 million to $195 million. Congress increased funding for the COPS hiring program to $195 million, but after set-asides, actual funding remained at $137 million. They also provided a $3 million increase for the Anti-heroin Task Forces program and set aside $8 million for the POLICE Act of 2016. The Administration requested $500 million for the 21st Century Justice Initiative in its FY2017 budget for the DOJ. This proposed program aimed to invest $5 billion over 10 years in criminal justice reform efforts, focusing on reducing crime, unnecessary incarceration, and building community trust. States could use the funding to achieve these objectives. The 21st Century Justice Initiative aimed to invest $5 billion over 10 years in criminal justice reform efforts.

Congress did not provide funding for this program."
