The TANF Emergency Response and Recovery Act of 2005 allows for the advance payment of TANF block grants for the first quarter of fiscal year 2006. Grants and payments can be made until December 31, 2005, with adjustments to certain provisions of the Social Security Act. The TANF Emergency Response and Recovery Act of 2005 allows for advance payment of TANF block grants until December 31, 2005, with adjustments to provisions of the Social Security Act. Amendments include changing dates from 2005 to 2006 and extending the National Random Sample Study of Child Welfare and Child Welfare Waiver Authority. Activities authorized by sections 429A and 1130(a) of the Social Security Act will continue through December 31, 2005, with necessary appropriations from the Treasury. Grants and payments can be made until the first quarter of fiscal year 2006 at the same level as the first quarter of fiscal year 2005. Reimbursement of states for TANF benefits provided to assist families affected by Hurricane Katrina. Eligibility for Payments From the Contingency Fund: States will be considered needy if they provide short-term, nonrecurring cash benefits to families affected by Hurricane Katrina. The State will receive funding under the Social Security Act if families affected by Hurricane Katrina are not receiving cash benefits from any other state program. The total amount of funding will not exceed the cash benefits provided to the needy State. The State will receive funding under the Social Security Act for families affected by Hurricane Katrina, with no State match required. The funding amount will not exceed the cash benefits provided to the needy State. SEC. 4. Availability of additional TANF funds for hurricane-damaged states. Beginning with the enactment of this Act until the end of fiscal year 2006, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama are eligible for loans under the Social Security Act. The total loan amount for these states cannot exceed 20% of the State family assistance grant for fiscal year 2006. Additionally, loans made to these states may be forgiven. Forgiveness of Loans: States of Louisiana, Mississippi, or Alabama are not penalized for failing to repay loans or make interest payments under the Social Security Act. States or tribes affected by Hurricane Katrina can use unspent TANF funds to provide benefits and services without time limitations. Receipt of temporary TANF benefits by families affected by the hurricane does not trigger work requirements or time limits under the TANF program. Benefits provided under a State program funded under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act to meet a family's subsistence needs resulting from Hurricane Katrina will not be considered assistance for certain purposes. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will waive TANF penalties for hurricane-damaged states (Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama) due to Hurricane Katrina until the end of fiscal year 2006. This waiver is granted if the failure to comply with TANF provisions was a result of Hurricane Katrina or the state's reasonable conduct in addressing the needs of hurricane victims. SEC. 8. EMERGENCY DESIGNATION. Each amount provided in this Act is designated as an emergency requirement."
