    "content": "The Act titled \"Women and AIDS Research Initiative Amendments of 1993\" establishes a general program of research regarding women and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). This includes a new section for research specifically focused on women. The Secretary will establish a program for biomedical and behavioral research on HIV cases in women, including prevention research. Grants may be provided to entities for research on HIV transmission to women. The program will focus on research to prevent HIV transmission to women, including studying the relationship between virus infection and other sexually transmitted diseases. Measures for preventing virus exposure and transmission will also be explored, such as preventing STDs that facilitate virus transmission. The program aims to develop rapid, inexpensive STD diagnostic tests and single-dose therapies for women. It also focuses on prevention methods and programs to reduce substance abuse among women. Research on virus infection symptoms is also included. The program focuses on research on virus infection symptoms, gynecological infections, breast changes, hormonal changes, menses, and menopause changes. It also includes treatment and behavioral research on prevention, as well as clinical trials for women's gynecological evaluations. The Secretary must ensure that female subjects infected with HIV undergo gynecological examinations before participating in trials and receive appropriate follow-up services. Results of these examinations should be analyzed to understand the relationship between gynecological conditions and HIV infection. The Secretary will conduct clinical trials to determine the effectiveness of standard treatments for gynecological conditions that arise as a result of HIV infection. Additionally, trials will assess the effectiveness of certain treatment protocols for HIV-infected individuals. The Secretary will conduct or support clinical trials to determine if treatment protocols approved for men with certain cases are effective for women with the same cases. Support services, including transportation, child care, medical and mental health services, treatment for drug abuse, and social services, will be provided to women participating in these trials. Services under this program will address the specific needs of women participating in clinical trials, including training for trial conductors. Prevention programs will also focus on sexual transmission. The Secretary will conduct or support research on barrier methods for preventing sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV, that women can use without their partner's knowledge. Priority will be given to research needs identified at a National Institutes of Health meeting. The Institutes of Health sponsored a meeting in May 1993 on the development of topical microbicides, focusing on early infectious processes, formulation and evaluation of new preparations, clinical testing for safety and efficacy, and studies on acceptability and compliance. The Secretary will also conduct epidemiological research on barrier methods for preventing sexually transmitted diseases, prioritizing research needs identified at the meeting. The Secretary will conduct or support epidemiological research to determine risk factors for HIV infection in women, including the use of contraceptive methods, tampons, the relationship with other STDs, and substance abuse. The Secretary is conducting a study on HIV infection in women, including risk factors like substance abuse and sexual activity. The study aims to monitor the progression of HIV in women compared to men, with a focus on the Women's Interagency HIV Study involving at least 5,000 participants. The Secretary is conducting a study on HIV infection in women, ensuring at least 5,000 women are included, increasing study sites, and having a minimum 8-year study period. The study also focuses on the relationship between CD4 cells and other markers in women with HIV. The study on HIV infection in women focuses on serious illnesses related to gynecological and other conditions not currently included in the CDC's list for surveillance. The term 'human immunodeficiency virus' refers to the agent for acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Authorization of appropriations is provided for clinical trials. Authorized appropriations of $20,000,000 for fiscal year 1994 and necessary sums for 1995-1996 for subsection (c)(1), $10,000,000 for fiscal year 1994 and necessary sums for 1995-1996 for subsection (c)(2), and appropriations for subsection (c)(3) are provided. Authorized appropriations of $10,000,000 for fiscal year 1994 and necessary sums for 1995-1996 for subsection (c)(3), and $15,000,000 for fiscal year 1994 and necessary sums for 1995-1996 for subsection (c)(4) to carry out prevention programs. Authorized appropriations of $30,000,000 for fiscal year 1994 and necessary sums for 1995-1996 for subsection (d)(1), $10,000,000 for fiscal year 1994 and necessary sums for 1995-1996 for subsection (d)(2), and $15,000,000 for fiscal year 1994 and necessary sums for 1995-1996 for an interagency study under subsection (e). The authorized appropriations include $15,000,000 for fiscal year 1994 and necessary sums for 1995-1996."
