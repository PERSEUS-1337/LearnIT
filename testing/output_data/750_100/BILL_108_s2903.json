    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nonprofit Athletic Organization Protection Act of 2004\". Congress finds that amateur sports and education-based athletics are vital for youth development, promoting leadership, teamwork, and discipline. Participation in these activities is linked to academic success and social growth. Nonprofit organizations prioritize the well-being of young people through sports, despite the risk of injuries. Participation in school sports and amateur competition benefits young people by reducing obesity levels, promoting fitness in adulthood, and providing age-appropriate competition opportunities through playing rules. Sport involves intense physical activity and a certain element of danger, with rules makers needing to make anticipatory decisions and balance tradeoffs. Injuries are inherent in sports, and athletes assume these risks by participating in competition. Allowing lawsuits based on rule development is deemed unfair. Rules makers are facing more negligence lawsuits for their decisions on amateur sports rules. Defending these claims repeatedly will harm their ability to provide services and deter top coaches, officials, and administrators from participating in rules committees. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, economic loss refers to pecuniary loss from harm, including loss of earnings, medical expenses, and loss of business opportunities. Harm includes physical, nonphysical, economic, and noneconomic losses. Noneconomic loss encompasses physical and emotional pain and suffering. The term \"nonprofit organization\" refers to any organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and exempt from tax under section 501(a) of such Code. A nonprofit athletic organization is a nonprofit organization primarily focused on adopting rules for athletic competitions and practices. It includes employees, agents, and volunteers. The term \"State\" includes the District of Columbia, and any commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States. SEC. 4. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY FOR NONPROFIT ATHLETIC ORGANIZATIONS. Liability protection is granted to nonprofit athletic organizations for harm caused by their acts or omissions in adopting rules for sanctioned competitions or practices, as long as they were acting within their duties and properly licensed or authorized. Liability protection is granted to nonprofit athletic organizations for harm caused during competitions or practices in the state where the harm occurred, as long as it was not due to willful misconduct. Employees, agents, and volunteers are not exempt from civil actions brought by the organization. Exceptions to nonprofit athletic organization liability exist. Exceptions to nonprofit athletic organization liability protection include state laws that require adherence to risk management procedures and make the organization liable for the acts of employees, agents, and volunteers. The limitation on liability for nonprofit athletic organizations does not apply to certain claims under federal, state, or local laws, including antitrust, labor, environmental, defamation, tortious interference of contract law, civil rights law, and discrimination protection. SEC. 5. PREEMPTION. This Act preempts State laws inconsistent with it, except for laws providing extra liability protection for nonprofit athletic organizations' rule-making activities. SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act takes effect upon enactment and applies to claims for harm caused by nonprofit athletic organizations filed after the effective date, only if the harm or conduct occurred after that date."
