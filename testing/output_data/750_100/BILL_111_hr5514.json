    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Activity Based Total Accountability Act of 2010\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purpose section. The Congress finds that the Federal Government sends billions of dollars to the States annually, including significant amounts for health care, transportation, housing, education, and agriculture. States receive this funding through various means such as grants, loans, and direct appropriations. Every State spends Federal taxpayer dollars on common activities like health care, transportation, housing, education, and agriculture. It is important for taxpayers, legislators, and agencies to have access to objective performance data to identify government activities and their costs. Activity-based total accountability can determine which States are most effective with taxpayer dollars and promote competition among States. The Act aims to improve government accountability at the State level by requiring annual accountings in a format that includes unit-cost data, promoting competition among States to be more efficient with tax dollars. The Act requires annual accountings at the State level in a format that includes unit-cost data to promote competition among States for efficiency with tax dollars. Each State receiving Federal financial assistance must submit a State fiscal accounting report to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 15 days before the end of the fiscal year. The report includes a one-page summary of total funding and expenditures for each budget entity, along with a unit-cost summary for each entity. The Director must publish all reports received under this section on their website within 30 days. SEC. 4. STANDARDIZATION OF STATE FISCAL ACCOUNTING REPORTS. The Director will standardize State fiscal accounting reports for comparison purposes. Each State government must submit a description of programs and activities within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Director will establish a uniform system for classifying State government programs and activities based on descriptions submitted by each agency. This system will be based on relevant data, including information from the most recent census. The Director will identify completed instances of agency activities and establish performance measures for each activity, linking them electronically in reports. The unit-cost summary for a budget entity of a State government must be one page long and include funds available, agency activities, and a reconciliation of funds with expenditures. The statement of funds available for a budget entity must identify each source of funds and the total amount available. Sources include State appropriations laws and Federal financial assistance. The Director may determine additional sources for a department or agency. SEC. 7. AGENCY ACTIVITY LINE ITEM LISTINGS. SEC. 7. AGENCY ACTIVITY LINE ITEM LISTINGS. Line item listings for agency activities must identify the activity, total funds expended, number of activity units, and unit cost. Relevant details about the agency activity should also be described. The agency activity line item listings must describe conduct, purposes, and beneficiaries of the activity. Special rules apply for determining expenditures when no method of measuring accomplishment exists. The agency activity line item listings must describe conduct, purposes, and beneficiaries of the activity. Expenditures for agency activities must be consistently allocated to similar activities. Payments to contractors or subordinate entities must be included in total expenditure amounts. Unit-cost of agency activities is determined by a specific formula. The formula in paragraph (1) defines UC as the unit-cost of the agency activity, m as the amount described in subsection (a)(1)(B), and q as the number described in subsection (a)(1)(C). This formula helps in reconciling funds available with adjusted expenditures. SEC. 8. RECONCILIATION OF FUNDS AVAILABLE WITH ADJUSTED EXPENDITURES. This section outlines the process of reconciling adjusted expenditures of a budget entity with funds available for expenditure or obligation. Adjusted expenditures are determined by the formula AE = EXP + PT + REV. The formula for reconciling adjusted expenditures includes terms such as AE for adjusted expenditures, EXP for total expenditures, PT for pass-throughs, and REV for reversions. A budget entity can classify amounts as pass-throughs or reversions based on criteria set by the Director. SEC. 9. NONCOMPLIANCE.\n\nIf the Director finds that a State government failed to submit a timely State fiscal accounting report, 10% of Federal financial assistance will be withheld for the following year. \n\nSEC. 10. RULES.\n\nThe Director can create necessary rules for implementing this Act.\n\nSEC. 11. DEFINITIONS. SEC. 11. DEFINITIONS.\n\nDefines \"State government\" as the government of States, the District of Columbia, and other U.S. territories. \"Budget entity\" refers to State agencies or the State judiciary. \"Agency activity\" is major operational activities of a budget entity. \"Federal financial assistance\" includes amounts determined appropriate by the Director."
