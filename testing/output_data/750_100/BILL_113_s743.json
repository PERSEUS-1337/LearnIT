The \"Marketplace Fairness Act of 2013\" authorizes Member States under the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement to require sellers not qualifying for the small seller exception to collect and remit sales taxes for remote sales sourced to that State. States can enforce this authority 180 days after the enactment of the Act, as long as changes to the Agreement comply with minimum simplification requirements. States can exercise authority under the \"Marketplace Fairness Act of 2013\" 180 days after the State publishes notice of intent, but no earlier than 180 days after the Act's enactment.

The \"Marketplace Fairness Act of 2013\" allows States to exercise authority to require sellers to collect sales taxes if they adopt minimum simplification requirements. This authority can begin no earlier than 6 months after the State enacts legislation specifying the applicable taxes and products/services. The \"Marketplace Fairness Act of 2013\" allows States to require sellers to collect sales taxes if they meet minimum simplification requirements, including a single entity responsible for tax administration, return processing, and audits for remote sales. The \"Marketplace Fairness Act of 2013\" allows States to require remote sellers to file a single sales and use tax return with a designated tax administration entity, following the same frequency as nonremote sellers. The \"Marketplace Fairness Act of 2013\" allows States to impose uniform sales and use tax requirements on remote sellers, including sourcing all remote sales in compliance with set definitions. The \"Marketplace Fairness Act of 2013\" allows States to impose uniform sales and use tax requirements on remote sellers, including providing software for calculating and filing taxes.

They must be given 90 days notice of any tax rate changes by the state or locality. The \"Marketplace Fairness Act of 2013\" allows relief from tax liability for remote sellers and software providers if they are not given 90 days notice of tax rate changes. States can only require tax collection from remote sellers with over $1,000,000 in total remote sales. For the purposes of determining if the threshold is met, gross annual receipts from remote sales of 2 or more related persons shall be aggregated. Ownership relationships designed to avoid these rules are also considered. SEC. 3. LIMITATIONS. The Act limits the impact on taxes, nexus determination, and seller choice. It clarifies that only sales and use taxes apply, does not change nexus standards, and allows remote sellers to choose software providers. The Act clarifies that states cannot license or regulate sellers, require qualifications for intrastate business, impose unrelated taxes, or interfere with interstate commerce. It also prohibits new taxes on products or services not previously taxed. The Act only applies to remote sales, not intrastate sales or sourcing rules. States must comply with intrastate provisions of the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement. The Act does not affect the Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS AND SPECIAL RULES. In this Act, a \"certified software provider\" is defined as a person who provides software to remote sellers for tax compliance and is certified by a State. \"Locality\" and \"local\" refer to any political subdivision of a State. A \"Member State\" is defined as a state under the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement. The term \"person\" includes individuals, trusts, estates, partnerships, corporations, and governments. A \"remote sale\" refers to a sale into a State where the seller would not legally be. The term \"remote seller\" refers to a person making remote sales in a State. A \"sourced\" remote sale is where the product or service is received by the purchaser, based on delivery instructions provided by the purchaser to the seller. The seller is not required to pay State or local sales taxes unless specified by this Act. When no delivery location is specified, a remote sale is sourced to the customer's address known to the seller or obtained during the transaction. If the address is unknown and a billing address cannot be obtained, the sale is sourced to the seller's address. State authority granted under section 2(a) must comply with the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement sourcing provisions.
