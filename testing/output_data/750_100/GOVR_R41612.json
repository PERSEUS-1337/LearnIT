    "content": "The United States has been a major provider of global food aid for over 55 years, with a historical focus on agricultural development. However, funding for this assistance has decreased from 20% of U.S. official development assistance in 1980 to around 5% in 2007. Critics argue that this decline has reduced the U.S.'s capacity to provide agricultural assistance. President Obama made alleviating global hunger a top priority in his inaugural address. In 2009, the Obama Administration pledged $3.5 billion over three years for a global hunger and food security initiative called Feed the Future. The initiative aims to promote agricultural development, increase food production, and improve food security and nutrition, especially for vulnerable populations like women and children. This is seen as a critical moment in U.S. foreign assistance history, particularly in agriculture development. Some argue for reform of American food aid and foreign assistance, emphasizing the need for innovative approaches with local buy-in and private sector engagement to achieve global food security objectives effectively and sustainably. Congress plays a central role in funding and oversight of agricultural development programs for global food security, involving various U.S. agencies and international organizations like USAID, USDA, and the World Bank. The 112th Congress may consider legislation to authorize and fund aspects of the food security initiative, building on similar efforts in the previous Congress. Bills introduced included provisions to increase support for agricultural development, international agriculture research, and food security safety net assistance. Legislation to revise the authorizing statute for U.S. foreign assistance could also impact the global food security initiative. The 112th Congress may consider legislation to authorize and fund aspects of the food security initiative, building on similar efforts in the previous Congress. The primary objectives of this report are to provide a context for the state of food insecurity in the world, overview of the Obama Administration's global hunger and food security initiative, and issues that the 112th Congress may consider in relation to agricultural development and global food security. The global food crisis in 2009 led to over 1 billion people being undernourished, with the number decreasing to 925 million in 2010. The proportion of hungry people increased due to food and economic crises, even before the recent global recession. According to FAO data, the number of undernourished people globally had been slowly increasing for the past decade. Hunger reduction gains were reversed in Latin America and the Caribbean due to food and economic crises. The recent food and economic crises have reversed the declining trend in the proportion of undernourished people globally. The proportion of hungry people in the world had dropped from 20% in the early 1990s to 16% in the mid-2000s, but rose by a percentage point in 2008. Progress in meeting the Millennium Development Goals of reducing hunger, alleviating poverty, and improving health for the world's poor has slowed. The global trend of reducing hunger, alleviating poverty, and improving health for the world's poor has slowed or reversed. In 2010, an estimated 578 million people suffered from chronic undernourishment in Asia and the Pacific, 239 million in sub-Saharan Africa, 53 million in Latin America and the Caribbean, 37 million in the Near East and North Africa, and 19 million in developed countries. The 2010 hunger figure marked a 9.6% decline from 2009, with the reduction mostly seen in Asia. In 2010, an estimated 578 million people suffered from chronic undernourishment in Asia and the Pacific, 239 million in sub-Saharan Africa, with the highest rates of food insecurity. The 2010 Global Health Index (GHI) showed improvement, falling from 19.8 to 15.1, with variations by region and country. The GHI score decreased significantly in various regions, with the most progress seen in Southeast Asia and Latin America. South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa had the highest GHI scores, but South Asia showed more improvement since 1990. The causes of hunger differ between these regions, with factors like low nutritional, educational, and social status of women contributing in South Asia. In South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, factors like low nutritional, educational, and social status of women contribute to high child mortality and underweight children. Most countries with high GHI scores are in these regions, where progress in reducing hunger has been slower compared to Latin America. Many countries have reduced their Global Hunger Index (GHI) scores by 50% or more in the past few decades. One-third of countries made modest progress, reducing their scores by 25-49.9%, while another third decreased their scores by 0-24.9%. However, nine countries, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa, saw an increase in their GHI scores, with conflict and political instability being major factors. The Democratic Republic of Congo experienced a GHI increase of over 65%, while Swaziland's high prevalence of HIV/AIDS and inequality severely impacted food security. The prevalence of HIV and AIDS, along with high inequality, has severely affected food security despite higher national incomes. In the Gambia, undernourishment increased due to lower social protection spending for vulnerable households. In Zimbabwe, economic collapse led to more underweight children and child mortality. Some countries, like Angola, Ethiopia, and Ghana, made significant progress in improving their Global Hunger Index scores between 1990 and 2010. Ghana was the only country in sub-Saharan Africa to achieve noteworthy improvements. Ghana was the only country in sub-Saharan Africa among the top performers in improving their Global Hunger Index (GHI) score since 1990. President Obama pledged $3.5 billion over three years for global agricultural development and food security at the G8 Summit in Italy. The Global Partnership for Agriculture and Food Security was launched to combat hunger and poverty. The G8 summit established a goal of mobilizing $20 billion over three years for Agriculture and Food Security to combat hunger and poverty. The initiative focuses on promoting sustainable production, productivity, and rural economic growth through five principles including supporting comprehensive strategies and improving coordination among donors. The G8 leaders pledged to provide sustainable funding to enhance world production capacity and reverse the trend of decreasing official development assistance for agriculture, as stated in the L'Aquila declaration. The initiative aims to support country and regional agricultural strategies through country-led efforts. The Accra Agenda for Action (AAA) outlines steps for reforming development aid, with developing countries taking control of their own futures through country-led strategies and donors committing to better coordination. The G8 also agreed to support country and regional agricultural strategies in sub-Saharan Africa. The G8 agreed to support the Comprehensive Africa Agricultural Development Program (CAADP) in sub-Saharan Africa, focusing on improving food security, nutrition, and increasing incomes of smallholder farmers. CAADP aims to raise agricultural productivity by at least 6% per year and increase public investment in agriculture to 10% of national budgets per year. The L'Aqulia declaration leverages the Comprehensive Framework for Action (CFA) of the U.N. High Level Task Force on Global Food Security Crisis, focusing on immediate and long-term actions to address global food price challenges. The CFA proposes enhancing emergency food assistance, boosting smallholder farmer food production, and ensuring nutrition security. The L'Aqulia declaration, based on the Comprehensive Framework for Action (CFA), focuses on immediate and long-term actions to address global food price challenges. It includes nutrition interventions, safety nets, boosting smallholder farmer food production, adjusting trade and tax policies, and managing the macroeconomic situation. For longer-term food security, it calls for expanding social protection systems, sustaining smallholder farmer-led food availability growth, improving international food market accessibility, and developing an international biofuels consensus. The G20 Summit in 2009 endorsed the L'Aquila food security initiative and proposed the establishment of a World Bank Food Security Trust Fund for medium- and long-term investments in agricultural productivity. At the G20 Summit, countries pledged $2 billion to support the Global Partnership for agricultural productivity in low-income countries. The United States collaborated with private sector actors for food security efforts. FAO convened a World Summit on Food Security in Rome with 60 heads of state and 191 ministers attending. At the World Summit on Food Security in Rome, 60 heads of state and 191 ministers endorsed the Global Partnership to reduce hunger by half by 2015. FAO reported that agricultural output needs to increase by 70% to feed a population of over 9 billion by 2050. The U.S. State Department leads global hunger and food security initiatives. The U.S. State Department leads the Administration's global hunger and food security initiative, known as the \"Feed the Future\" (FtF) Initiative. The initiative was officially launched in May 2010, with a new guiding strategy document and implementation documents released by the State Department. The strategy and implementation documents were developed through a consultative process within the United States government and with the global community. The Feed the Future (FtF) Initiative, led by the U.S. State Department, collaborates with various stakeholders globally to promote sustainable food security. The initiative is based on principles established at L'Aquila and focuses on gender, environment, and climate change. FtF aims to accelerate inclusive agriculture sector growth and improve nutritional status in specific countries. The Feed the Future (FtF) Initiative, led by the U.S. State Department, focuses on interventions to improve agricultural productivity, expand markets, and develop policies for smallholder farmers. Progress will be measured through changes in agricultural production and income levels of farmers in rural areas. The Feed the Future (FtF) Initiative, driven by country-owned plans, aims to improve agricultural productivity and income levels of farmers in rural areas. It also focuses on strengthening links between agriculture and nutrition outcomes through coordination with host governments and other partners. Progress in nutrition will be measured through changes in prevalence. The Feed the Future (FtF) Initiative aims to improve nutrition by measuring changes in stunted and wasted children, and underweight women. It includes investments in regional programs, the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program, partnerships with countries like Brazil, India, and China, and global research and innovation. FtF does not explicitly include traditional U.S. food aid funding but maintains a commitment to providing emergency food assistance. The Feed the Future (FtF) Initiative focuses on providing emergency and humanitarian food assistance in 20 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean. These countries were selected based on criteria such as chronic hunger, potential for agricultural-led growth, regional synergies, host government commitment, and resource availability. FtF investments will occur in two phases depending on the country's needs. Phase 1 countries are preparing their country investment plans (CIPs) with assistance in capacity-building, technical support, stakeholder consultations, and policy improvement. Phase 2 countries have completed CIPs outlining priority areas, financial needs, targets, and desired results. Phase 2 countries must commit resources and establish a policy environment for agricultural development and nutrition. FtF plans to partner with countries to develop and implement CIPs. The Administration's FY2011 budget request includes $1.64 billion for the Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) roundtable process, which is about 3% of the total international affairs budget. The FY2011 request for Feed the Future (FtF) activities is compared to the estimated FY2010 allocations. The U.S. State Department notes that $200 million for nutrition activities funded through the Global Health and Child Survival account are part of the food security effort. The Administration's FY2011 budget request for Feed the Future (FtF) is about 40% greater than the estimated FY2010 allocation, with a significant portion going towards a newly created multilateral trust fund for global food security at the World Bank. This request does not include food and agriculture-related supplemental appropriations for Haiti, which focus on emergency food aid and debt cancellation, activities not covered under the FtF framework. The Administration's FY2011 budget request for Feed the Future (FtF) represents only a portion of foreign assistance for food and agriculture activities. Additionally, there is a separate request for $4.2 billion for humanitarian and emergency assistance, including funds for Food for Peace Title II, Migration and Refugee Assistance, International Disaster Assistance, and Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance. These programs also support food security and agricultural development. During the 111th Congress, there was a discussion about reforming U.S. foreign aid to address national security challenges and development needs. Critics have pointed out inefficiencies in aid programs not aligned with national security interests. The Obama Administration attempted to address these issues through potential reforms. The Obama Administration attempted to address issues with foreign aid through potential reforms, including the launch of the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) in 2009. Led by the Secretary of State, the QDDR aimed to develop a whole-of-government approach to U.S. development policy. Despite delays, Secretary Clinton released the findings in a strategy document titled \"Leading Through\" in 2010. The QDDR, released in December 2010, outlined a strategy to enhance American civilian power and align with national interests. It included foreign policy objectives, recommended strategies, and organizational reforms. Additionally, the Administration launched the PSD-7 in August 2009 to address global development policy. The PSD-7, initiated in August 2009, authorized a U.S. government-wide review of global development policy to determine the roles and advantages of various agencies. Led by key officials, including the President's National Security Advisor, the review aims to enhance the effectiveness of U.S. development policy. Key NSC staff are involved in addressing development, democracy, and regional issues as part of the review process. The PSD-7 review focuses on global development policy, emphasizing economic growth and democratic governance. It aims to elevate development as a key pillar of U.S. foreign policy. The Administration's approach has been widely discussed in the development community. The QDDR will contribute to the PSD by assessing how its recommendations fit into broader interagency efforts. The PSD-7 review, focusing on global development policy, aims to elevate development as a core pillar of American power. The process has been delayed, and it is unclear if final outputs will be made public. President Obama announced a new directive on Global Development in 2010. Global Food Security is highlighted in the President's Policy Directive along with Climate Change and Global Health. The directive mandates coordination among agencies to implement the directive starting from the FY2012 budget process. In November 2010, a new Bureau for Food Security (BFS) was established at USAID to lead efforts in implementing President Obama's Feed the Future initiative. The Bureau for Food Security (BFS) will coordinate interagency efforts for President Obama's Feed the Future initiative, expanding partnerships with private sector and NGOs. The 112th Congress faces issues on agricultural development, global food security, and U.S. foreign aid reform. The U.S. pledged $3.5 billion over three years at the G8 Summit in 2009 for the Global Agriculture and Food Security Partnership. Congressional appropriations measures will consider funding requests. Congress is considering FY2011 appropriations for agricultural development and food security within the Feed the Future Initiative. The House bill included $1 billion for food security and agricultural development, 38% less than the Administration request. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a FY2011 State-Foreign Operations funding bill, allocating $54.22 billion, which is $1.40 billion less than the House subcommittee draft and $2.61 billion below the Administration's request. The bill included $1.3 billion for food security and agriculture development programs under the Feed the Future initiative, $344 million less than the Administration's request. The federal government's funding has been extended through continuing resolutions, with the most recent one continuing funding at FY2010 levels until March 4, 2011. There may be further debate on funding priorities related to food security and agricultural development due to the current fiscal situation and changes in congressional leadership. There is skepticism about meeting the G8 commitment of $22 billion over three years for the Global Partnership. Some skepticism exists in the international community regarding the G8 pledge to the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program Trust Fund. The total amount pledged was US$914 million, but only US$263 million has been received. Concerns have been raised about the lack of strong leadership at USAID for global development efforts. The Obama Administration faced criticism for delays in appointing key positions at USAID, leading to a \"leadership vacuum\" that allowed other federal agencies to take on development roles traditionally handled by USAID. Some critics question if the development approach divided among federal agencies undermines USAID's authority and resources. Concerns have been raised about the decline in staff capacity at USAID, with senior government officials noting the issue. Secretary Gates highlighted the imbalance and inadequate capacity in the United States' national security apparatus, attributing it to the consequences of the 1990s when key instruments of U.S. power abroad were reduced. The hiring of new Foreign Service officers was frozen, leading to a significant decrease in staff at the U.S. Agency for International Development. In 1980, USAID had 2,000 permanent foreign officers, which declined to about 1,000 by 2008. Currently, USAID only has two engineers, 16 agriculture experts, and 17 education experts. These staff cuts have had detrimental impacts on USAID's on-the-ground effectiveness. The staff cuts at USAID have led to reduced on-the-ground effectiveness and technical expertise. USAID now contracts out a large portion of its foreign aid program, resulting in less coherence, effectiveness, flexibility, and leverage with other funders. Fragmentation in agricultural development assistance and difficulty managing numerous small projects have been documented. Since the launch of the Feed the Future initiative, USAID has been addressing staff shortages by hiring additional agriculture foreign-service officers. In the 1950s and 1960s, U.S. land-grant universities helped establish counterpart institutions in developing countries. The Title XII \"Famine Prevention and Freedom from Hunger\" amendment in 1975 further supported these efforts. Since the 1975 \"Famine Prevention and Freedom from Hunger\" amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, USAID's support for capacity building and agricultural research has declined significantly. Post-graduate training has decreased by over 90% from 1989 to 2005, leading to weaker institutional capacity. USAID has also reduced support for agricultural research projects, impacting long-term outcomes and institutional capacity. USAID has acknowledged the importance of long-term institutional building for aid effectiveness. However, funding and support for training and capacity-building programs, especially in agriculture, have not been restored. Questions remain about the sufficient institutional capacity in both the United States and developing countries. Some have raised concerns about the institutional capacity in the United States and developing countries, particularly in Africa, to effectively implement agricultural research and development programs. African governments and donors have been hesitant to invest in science and technology for agriculture. Several U.S. agencies, including USAID, the State Department, and USDA, are involved in agricultural development and food security assistance. The USAID, State Department, USDA, MCC, Treasury Department, and USTR are directly involved in providing agricultural development and food security assistance. Interagency coordination is crucial in this area, as noted by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. The need for collaboration among various agencies has been highlighted to improve foreign assistance efforts. The Chicago Council recommended creating an Interagency Council on Global Agriculture within the Executive Office of the President to provide leadership and maintain consistent priorities among U.S. government agencies. The Government Accountability Office highlighted coordination issues between USDA, USAID, and the Millennium Development Corporation in providing food and development aid. The Feed the Future initiative is working on addressing these challenges. The Feed the Future initiative aims to improve U.S. food security efforts by enhancing interagency coordination. USAID is designated as the lead implementation agency, but coordination with other government entities is still unclear. Funding implications of this whole-of-government approach are yet to be determined. In the late 1990s, donors and aid agencies recognized the need for coordination to harmonize strategies and activities, reducing costs on aid recipients. The potential funding implications of a whole of government approach have not been clearly articulated by the Administration, and bills in Congress suggest the need for interagency coordination in addressing global hunger. It remains uncertain if these issues will be a priority in the future. The United States works with other donors and international bodies to make aid more effective and efficient. This includes coordination with countries like Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, and the European Union, as well as participation in global summits sponsored by the United Nations. In 2003, Paris in 2005, and Accra in 2008 played a crucial role in donor coordination, setting development goals, and creating new mechanisms like country-led strategies for aid. Donors agreed to increase aid predictability and flexibility. The United States aligning with other donors has implications for its bilateral assistance, including USAID support for agriculture in Africa. The USAID supports the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) to boost agricultural productivity in Africa. The Administration's global food security initiative aligns with U.N-sponsored multilateral forums like the Accra Agenda for Action on aid effectiveness. Some argue aid reform is slow, while others believe the U.S. should prioritize independence from other donors. Some argue for U.S. independence in foreign assistance, prioritizing activities aligned with strategic interests. The Feed the Future Guide emphasizes country-led planning for program ownership and sustainability. Concerns exist over donor control and developing countries' capacity for strategic planning. Some countries lack capacity for strategic planning and accountability, leading to concerns about government-led strategies excluding civil society and private sector actors. Coordination between U.S. food aid and Feed the Future programs is minimal, despite Food for Peace aid being a significant component of U.S. food security assistance. Title II food aid is a significant component of U.S. food security assistance, with the Administration's FY2011 request including $1.69 billion for Food for Peace Title II food aid. The United States is implementing U.S. food aid programs in the 20 Feed the Future focus countries. Key questions revolve around coordinating U.S. commodity food aid with Feed the Future activities at the country level and how food aid can support the objectives of Feed the Future. Additionally, the Feed the Future strategy emphasizes cross-cutting initiatives such as gender and global health. The Feed the Future strategy emphasizes cross-cutting initiatives such as gender, global health, environmental sustainability, and climate change. However, it is unclear how these issues will be integrated into country plans, the resources needed, progress tracking metrics, and coordination with other USG initiatives. The Administration is working on components of the Feed the Future results framework, but it is unclear which agency will be responsible for monitoring progress. It is also uncertain when results will be realized, if the initiative will achieve MDG1 in the 20 countries, and how often Congress will receive updates."
