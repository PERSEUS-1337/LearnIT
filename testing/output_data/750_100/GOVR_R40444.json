    "content": "Eligibility for health benefits under CHIP is available to different groups through various federal authorities and mechanisms, including children, pregnant women, parents, and childless adults. Title XXI defines a targeted low-income child as someone under age 19 without health insurance, not eligible for Medicaid before March 31, 1997. States can set the income level for targeted low-income children up to 200% of the federal poverty level. Under current statutory and regulatory authority, states can expand eligibility for all children under 19 years of age to any level they choose. CHIPRA reduces federal CHIP payments for higher-income CHIP children, using the regular Medicaid federal matching rate for those with family income exceeding 300% of poverty. States can expand eligibility for children under 19 years of age to any level they choose, with exceptions for states with federal approval plans or state laws for federal approval. States may provide assistance to qualifying children through Medicaid programs or separate CHIP programs. Medicaid rules apply when covering low-income children, while separate CHIP programs follow Title XXI guidelines. Title XXI rules apply to separate CHIP programs that provide coverage to targeted low-income children. States with approved state CHIP plans are entitled to pre-determined federal allotments based on a distribution formula. Targeted low-income children covered under a CHIP-financed Medicaid expansion are entitled to benefits under Medicaid law. Individual entitlement does not exist for targeted low-income children covered in these programs. States can cover targeted low-income children under Medicaid by expanding their programs through new eligibility groups or by adjusting financial rules. Many states opt to cover these children under existing Medicaid pathways rather than through the Title XXI optional coverage group. This strategy reduces administrative burden. States may provide coverage to targeted low-income children through separate CHIP programs, defining eligibility based on factors like geography, age, income, resources, residency, disability status, and access to other health insurance. This approach reduces administrative burden compared to establishing a new coverage group under Title XXI. Prior to CHIPRA, states could cover adult pregnant women in three ways: through Section 1115 waivers, CHIP state plan amendments, or a family coverage option in group health plans. In October 2007, 17 states provided pregnancy-related services to adult females through CHIP funds. 6 states used \u00a71115 waivers, and 12 states extended coverage to unborn children of adult pregnant women. Most states covered unborn children of undocumented aliens as well. In FY2008, CHIPRA added a new state option to cover pregnant women under CHIP through a state plan amendment. States must meet certain conditions to implement this option, including Medicaid income standards for pregnant women and CHIP cost-sharing protections. Pregnant women can be covered under CHIP with eligibility criteria similar to CHIP children. Coverage includes prenatal, delivery, and postpartum care, with infants born to these women eligible for Medicaid or CHIP. States can provide temporary enrollment for up to two months (presumptive eligibility). Infants born to pregnant women covered under CHIP are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP up to age one. States can continue coverage for pregnant women through waivers. Legal immigrants arriving after August 22, 1996, were ineligible for Medicaid or CHIP for five years, but coverage was permitted at state option after the five-year bar. The law requires sponsors' income and resources to be considered for legal immigrants in means-tested programs like Medicaid and TANF. CHIPRA allowed states to waive the five-year bar for Medicaid or CHIP coverage for pregnant women and children lawfully residing in the US. The CHIP state plan option allows states to provide coverage for pregnant women and children who are lawfully residing in the US and eligible for such coverage. States that elect this option must ensure that the cost of care will not be considered against an individual's sponsor. Individuals must undergo redetermination processes to maintain eligibility. Under Section 1115 of the Social Security Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services has the authority to modify aspects of CHIP programs, including expanding eligibility to populations not typically covered. States may cover childless adults and parents of Medicaid and CHIP-eligible children. Individuals initially eligible under this provision must provide further documentation if their legal residence status changes. States with CHIP funds have covered adults through waivers, initially effective for five years and subject to renewal every three years. Prior to 2007, waiver renewals were approved even for states facing federal CHIP shortfalls. However, since 2007, waiver renewals have not been approved or states have transitioned adult populations out of CHIP coverage. As of January 7, 2009, 4 states have CMS authority to use CHIP funds to extend coverage to certain childless individuals. CHIPRA terminates CHIP coverage of nonpregnant childless adults by the end of 2009. States with existing waivers for childless adults can apply for Medicaid waivers to continue coverage, tied to budget neutrality standards. Budget neutrality standards for future fiscal years will be linked to waiver spending in preceding years. Under CHIPRA, coverage of parents with CHIP parent coverage waivers is allowed, but starting in FY2012, spending will be subject to a set-aside amount and matched at the state's regular Medicaid FMAP unless certain coverage benchmarks are met. In FY2013, states meeting benchmarks will receive an amount between the regular and enhanced FMAPs for parents. CHIPRA also prohibits waiver spending. CHIPRA prohibits waiver spending under the set-aside for parents with family income exceeding eligibility thresholds as of February 4, 2009. It includes provisions for Medicaid and CHIP access/enrollment, authorizing $100 million in outreach grants for FY2009-2013. 10% allocated for national enrollment campaign, 10% for Native American children, and 80% for state/local distribution. CHIPRA authorizes $100 million in outreach grants for Medicaid and CHIP enrollment. 10% is allocated for a national campaign, 10% for Native American children, and 80% for state and local governments and community-based organizations. Grant funds target proposals addressing cultural and linguistic barriers to enrollment. States must describe procedures to reduce administrative barriers and revise them as needed. CHIPRA allows states to use \"Express Lane\" agencies to determine eligibility for children under 19 (or up to 21) for Medicaid or CHIP. This helps reduce barriers to enrollment by streamlining the process. Under CHIPRA, states can implement automatic enrollment through Express Lane eligibility determination with family consent, using reported income from state tax records. Families may qualify for lower premiums or better coverage under Medicaid if income is directly assessed by the state. CHIPRA eliminates the need for signatures on Medicaid or CHIP applications under penalty of perjury. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA) mandated proof of citizenship and identity for Medicaid applicants. CHIPRA allows states to use Social Security Numbers (SSNs) verified by the SSA as an alternative. SSNs alone do not confirm citizenship. CHIPRA also includes a citizenship requirement. CHIPRA adds a citizenship documentation requirement for CHIP, with states able to use verified Social Security Numbers as an alternative. Table 1 displays each state's CHIP program type, upper-income eligibility, and enrollment data. New Jersey has the highest upper income eligibility limit at 350% of the FPL for children in CHIP. CHIP enrollment in FY2008 reached nearly 7.4 million children, with 5.3 million covered in separate state programs and 2.1 million targeted low-income children under Medicaid. Waiver authority under CHIP has been used to expand coverage for adult populations, with 12 states reporting enrollment of about 335,000 adults, mostly parents. In FY2008, CHIP enrollment for adults decreased compared to previous years due to waivers not being renewed or scaled back. Michigan, New Mexico, and Minnesota had more adult CHIP enrollees than children. States have flexibility in designing their CHIP programs to cover low-income children under Medicaid, create a separate CHIP program, or use a combination of both approaches. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 gave states the option to enroll specified groups, including children, in new benchmark and benchmark-equivalent benefit plans as an alternative to traditional Medicaid benefits. Under EPSDT, children in Medicaid eligibility groups receive well-child care, immunizations, and other screening services, as well as necessary medical care. States can choose to create separate CHIP programs with additional benefits. States can choose to create separate CHIP programs with different benefit options, including a benchmark benefit package, benchmark equivalent coverage, or any other health benefits plan approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Benchmark benefit packages can include plans like the Blue Cross/Blue Shield preferred provider option offered under FEHBP, state employee health coverage, or health coverage offered by a health provider. Benchmark-equivalent coverage is a package of benefits with the same actuarial value as one of the benchmark benefit packages. It must cover inpatient and outpatient hospital services, physicians' services, lab and x-ray services, and well-baby and well-child care, including immunizations. Benchmark-equivalent coverage for CHIP programs must include at least 75% of the actuarial value of coverage under the benchmark plan for additional services like prescription drugs, vision, and hearing services. Abortions are only covered in cases of rape, incest, or to save the mother's life. All 50 states, the District of Columbia, and five territories have CHIP programs, with some using Medicaid expansions. CHIP programs in the United States vary in their approach, with some using Medicaid expansions, separate state programs, or a combination of both. Benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans are often based on state employees' health plans, while secretary-approved plans are modeled after Medicaid. CHIPRA made changes to mental health and substance abuse coverage under CHIP, ensuring that financial requirements and treatment are consistent with medical and surgical benefits. CHIPRA made changes to mental health and substance abuse coverage under CHIP, ensuring that financial requirements and treatment limitations are no more restrictive than those for medical and surgical benefits. State CHIP plans that cover EPSDT services are considered to meet these mental health parity requirements. CHIPRA also expanded dental care under CHIP, making it a required benefit that includes services for disease prevention, oral health promotion, restoration of oral structures, and treatment of emergency conditions. States have the option to offer dental services through benchmark dental benefit packages modeled after existing medical benchmark plans. The new law expands dental care under CHIP, including services for disease prevention, oral health promotion, restoration of oral structures, and treatment of emergency conditions. States must report detailed information on children's dental care in their annual reports and for EPSDT reporting purposes. Information on dental providers and covered services will be available to the public. GAO will conduct a study on children's access to dental care under Medicaid and CHIP, with recommendations for addressing barriers. The study will provide recommendations for federal and state actions to address barriers to dental care, including the use of mid-level providers. CHIPRA allowed for dental-only supplemental coverage for children enrolled in employer-sponsored coverage who meet CHIP eligibility criteria. The provision in CHIPRA allows states to offer dental coverage consistent with new benchmark benefits plans or cost-sharing protections for dental coverage under CHIP. States can set the upper income level for this benefit up to their separate CHIP programs' level. States cannot offer dental-only supplemental coverage unless specific criteria are met. States can provide dental coverage under CHIP up to their program's income level, with limitations on eligibility. They cannot offer more favorable dental coverage for children with dental-only supplemental coverage compared to those eligible for full CHIP benefits. States have the option to waive eligibility waiting periods for children with dental-only coverage. States can use CHIP funds for employer-based health insurance if the plan is cost-effective and does not replace existing group health coverage for targeted low-income children. Premium assistance programs must meet CHIP minimum benefits and cost-sharing requirements, with children typically needing to be without group coverage for four to six months. Medicaid expansion CHIP programs may also offer premium assistance if the employer plan is comprehensive and cost-effective for the state. Under Medicaid, enrollment in an employer plan must be cost-effective compared to direct Medicaid coverage. States must provide \"wrap-around\" benefits for services not covered by private plans, which can be challenging for many employer plans and states to meet all requirements. CHIPRA created a new state plan option for providing premium assistance under waivers to meet requirements for CHIP and Medicaid. States can offer premium assistance for Medicaid and CHIP-eligible children and parents with access to employer-sponsored insurance, if the employer pays at least 40% of the total. Under CHIPRA, states can provide premium assistance for Medicaid and CHIP-eligible individuals with access to employer-sponsored insurance. The employer must pay at least 40% of the total premium, and the coverage must be offered in a nondiscriminatory way. Individuals eligible for both CHIP and employer-based coverage can choose to enroll in regular CHIP instead of the premium assistance program. The subsidy will cover the difference in out-of-pocket premiums for the worker and their child(ren). The CHIPRA allows states to offer premium assistance for Medicaid and CHIP-eligible individuals with access to employer-sponsored insurance. The subsidy covers the difference in out-of-pocket premiums for the worker and their child(ren), and a separate test is established for family coverage. If the CHIP cost of covering the entire family in the employer-sponsored plan is less than regular CHIP coverage for the eligible individual(s) alone, the premium assistance subsidy can be used to pay the entire family's share of the premium. CHIPRA allows states to establish employer-family premium assistance purchasing pools for eligible individuals with access to employer-sponsored insurance. The law streamlines coordination between public and private coverage, including Medicaid-expansion CHIP programs. The provision in CHIPRA allows states to streamline coordination between public and private coverage by making the loss of Medicaid/CHIP eligibility a \"qualifying event\" for purchasing employer-sponsored coverage. It also requires health plan administrators to disclose benefit package information to states for evaluating the need for wraparound coverage. Cost-sharing in health insurance includes out-of-pocket payments like premiums, deductibles, and copayments, which states can impose for some beneficiaries and services under Federal law. Federal law allows states to impose cost-sharing for certain CHIP beneficiaries and services. Medicaid-covered low-income children must follow Medicaid's cost-sharing rules, with most children being exempt. Children aged 18 in Medicaid expansions under CHIP may face service-related cost-sharing. The DRA gives states the option for premiums and cost-sharing for low-income children under CHIP Medicaid-expansion programs. No premiums are allowed for children in families with income under 100% FPL. For children in families with income under 100% FPL, no premiums are allowed, and cost-sharing is limited. For those with income between 100%-150% FPL, no premiums but up to 10% cost-sharing. Above 150% FPL, premiums are allowed with up to 20% cost-sharing. Total cost-sharing cannot exceed 5% of family income. Preventive services for children are exempt from DRA. The DRA allows states to impose cost-sharing for Medicaid services, with exemptions for preventive care for children. Cost-sharing amounts will be adjusted for inflation. Special rules apply to prescription drugs and non-emergency ER visits. States can require Medicaid premiums for continued eligibility, and providers may deny care for non-payment. CHIP programs may also charge premiums based on family income. The DRA allows states to impose cost-sharing for Medicaid services, with exemptions for preventive care for children. Premiums for families with incomes under 150% FPL are limited by federal Medicaid regulations. Cost-sharing for higher-income families above 150% FPL can be imposed in any amount, ensuring parity with lower-income families. Cost-sharing for higher-income children in CHIP is subject to a 5% out-of-pocket limit of family income. States must inform families of these limits and provide a way to stop payments once reached. Preventive services are exempt from cost-sharing for all CHIP families, including newborn visits, physical exams, and associated lab tests. CHIPRA 2009 expanded data collection and reporting for CHIP and Medicaid, including child health quality measures and standardized reporting formats. It also focused on routine physical examinations, laboratory tests, immunizations, preventive dental services, and improving pediatric care quality. CHIPRA 2009 expanded reporting requirements for CHIP and Medicaid, including data on eligibility criteria, access to care, and premium assistance. A new federal commission, MACPAC, was established to review policies affecting children's access to benefits under both programs. CHIPRA 2009 expanded reporting requirements for CHIP and Medicaid, including data on eligibility criteria, access to care, and premium assistance. Regular reports to Congress detail findings and recommendations for improving access and quality of care for children under Medicaid and CHIP. The Secretary of HHS is required to conduct a federal evaluation of 10 states with approved CHIP plans to assess access and quality of care. The new federal evaluation in the early 2000s will assess outreach and enrollment strategies, cost-sharing effects on utilization, and factors related to disenrollment and retention of children in CHIP. Federal financing includes total appropriations for states' CHIP allotments, reallocation of unspent funds, and factors like matching rates and caps on administrative expenses. BBA 97 allocated around $40 million. The funding for CHIP allotments varied annually from approximately $4.2 billion for FY1998-FY2001 to under $3.2 billion for FY2002-FY2004, then increased to about $4.1 billion for FY2005-FY2006 and roughly $5.0 billion for FY2007. The drop in funding during FY2002-FY2004, known as the \"CHIP dip,\" was due to budgetary constraints. The 110th Congress passed bills to reauthorize CHIP funding for FY2008-FY2012, but they were vetoed by President George W. Bush. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 provided CHIP allotments for FY2008-FY2009, with additional funds appropriated due to projected federal CHIP fund shortfalls in certain states. CHIPRA provided a national appropriation for CHIP allotments totaling $68.9 billion from FY2009 to FY2013. The allotment of the annual federal CHIP appropriation among the states is determined by a formula set in law. Prior to CHIPRA, the territories received 0.25% of the national appropriation, with the remainder allocated to the states. The national appropriation for CHIP allotments under CHIPRA was $68.9 billion from FY2009 to FY2013. The territories received 0.25% of the total, while the states' allotments were based on a formula using survey estimates of low-income uninsured children. The allotments were adjusted by a geographic factor and limited to ensure consistency with past allotments. The CHIP allotments for states and territories are separate funding accounts, with allotments available for a certain period of time. Prior to CHIPRA, allotments were available for three years, but now they are only available for two years. States can draw from the earliest active account until fully expended, then move to the next available allotment. FY2009 federal CHIP allotments for states are the largest. The FY2009 federal CHIP allotments for states are determined by the state's FY2008 federal CHIP spending, multiplied by a growth factor, or the state's FY2008 federal CHIP allotment, multiplied by a growth factor, or the state's own projections of federal CHIP spending for FY2009. The largest of these amounts will be increased by 10% and will serve as the state's FY2009 federal CHIP allotment, subject to national appropriation adequacy. If not adequate, allotments will be reduced proportionally. For FY2010, state allotments for CHIP will be calculated based on FY2009 CHIP allotment, FY2006 unspent allotments redistributed, spending in FY2009, and Contingency Fund payments. FY2011 and FY2013 allotments will be \"rebased\" on prior year spending. For FY2012, state CHIP allotments are calculated by multiplying the state's growth factor with the prior year's federal CHIP spending. Unspent allotments are redistributed to other states at the end of the period. Redistribution rules vary by fiscal year, with BBA 97 specifying eligibility criteria for states to receive unspent funds. In FY2006, Congress appropriated an additional $283 million to cover projected shortfalls in 12 states for the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Illinois and Massachusetts had higher CHIP spending than anticipated, resulting in shortfalls totaling approximately $100 million. In FY2007, $147 million in unspent funds from FY2004 was available for redistribution, with a bill passed in the closing hours of the 109th Congress to specify how the funds would be redistributed. The NIH Reform Act of 2006 required funds to be redistributed to states facing shortfalls in fiscal year 2007, delaying shortfalls until the end of March 2007. The CHIP provisions called for an initial redistribution of unspent FY2005 allotments to further delay shortfalls. The NIH Reform Act of 2006 required states to have double their projected spending in federal CHIP funds to forgo unspent FY2005 balances by March 31, 2007, providing an additional $138 million for shortfall states. Shortfalls for the fiscal year were projected at over $600 million in 12 states, with delays until May 2007. In May 2007, P.L. 110-28 allocated $650 million to cover federal CHIP fund shortfalls in 10 states for FY2007. Federal CHIP financing from 1998 to FY2007 totaled $600 million in 12 states. For FY2008, MMSEA redistributed unspent FY2005 funds to states with shortfalls and appropriated $1.6 billion for remaining shortfalls. MMSEA appropriated up to $1.6 billion for states' remaining shortfalls in FY2008, with actual funding totaling just under $1 billion. In FY2009, unspent FY2006 allotments were redistributed to states facing shortfalls before March 31, 2009. An additional $275 million was appropriated for states' remaining shortfalls through March 31, 2009. The increased FY2009 allotments from CHIPRA should prevent federal CHIP funding shortfalls for the second half of FY2009. Under CHIPRA, unspent funds for redistribution in FY2009 would first go to shortfall states and then towards bonus payments. A Child Enrollment Contingency Fund was created to prevent states from CHIP funding shortfalls, with direct payments to shortfall states not exceeding 20% of the national allotment. Under CHIPRA, a Child Enrollment Contingency Fund was established to prevent CHIP funding shortfalls. Payments from the fund cannot exceed 20% of the national allotment, with reductions if necessary. CHIP operates as a federal-state matching program, with a state's share of program spending determined by the enhanced FMAP. The enhanced FMAP for CHIP ranges from 65% to 83.09%, with a ceiling of 85% and a floor of 65%. Federal spending for CHIP administrative expenses is limited, including activities like data collection and outreach. A 10% cap applies to state for federal matching purposes. Under CHIP, a 10% cap applies to state non-benefit expenses for federal matching purposes. This cap is tied to the dollar amount that a state draws down from its annual allotment to cover benefits and non-benefit costs. No more than 10% of federal funds can be used for non-benefit costs, including administrative expenses. Federal CHIP bonus payments are available to states that increase Medicaid child enrollment and implement specific outreach and enrollment activities. Federal CHIP bonus payments are available to states that increase Medicaid child enrollment and implement specific outreach and enrollment activities, funded by an initial $3.225 billion appropriation in FY2009."
