    "content": "Some in the 112th Congress wanted to cut international affairs spending, including foreign aid programs, to reduce the federal budget deficit. However, others believed a strong foreign affairs budget was crucial for promoting national security and foreign policy interests, potentially saving money by avoiding costly military interventions. Congress considered budget cuts to address these concerns. Congress considered the FY2013 Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Agencies appropriations in the context of the Budget Control Act of 2011. A continuing resolution was passed to fund government programs until March 27, 2013. Legislation (H.R. 933) was passed to fund federal programs for the remainder of FY2013. The Senate approved an expanded version of the bill on March 20, 2013, and the House adopted it the next day. The legislation was signed into law on March 26, 2013 (P.L. 113-6). The State-Foreign Operations appropriation supports international affairs programs and activities, including foreign economic and security assistance, contributions to international organizations, State Department and USAID operations, public diplomacy, and international broadcasting programs. The State-Foreign Operations appropriation bill supports international affairs programs, including foreign economic and security assistance, contributions to international organizations, State Department and USAID operations, public diplomacy, and international broadcasting programs. However, it does not cover all international affairs programs, such as food aid and certain commissions funded through other appropriations bills. The State-Foreign Operations appropriations bill supports international affairs programs. A chart illustrating the bill's organizational structure is provided in Appendix A, with abbreviations in Appendix B. The report focuses on funded accounts and appropriations figures for international affairs in Appendix C and D. Recent congressional activity related to the bill is summarized in Table 1, including President Obama signing the FY2013 Defense and Military Construction/VA bill on March 26, 2013. President Obama signed the FY2013 Defense and Military Construction/VA bill on March 26, 2013, funding most State-Foreign operations accounts for the remainder of FY2013 at the FY2012-enacted level. The Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2013, funded the government until March 27, 2013. H.J.Res. 117 was passed by the House to fund the federal government through March 27, 2013. It provided a slight increase in funding for State and Foreign Operations non-OCO activities. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a bill for FY2013 State-Foreign Operations with a total of $52.3 billion. The Senate approved a bill for FY2013 State-Foreign Operations with a total of $52.3 billion, including $2.3 billion in Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds. This was 5% below the requested amount and 2% below the FY2012 estimated level. The House Appropriations Committee also approved a bill totaling $48.5 billion, which was 12% less than requested and 9% below the FY2012 estimated level. The House Appropriations Committee approved a bill for FY2013 State-Foreign Operations totaling $48.5 billion, which was 12% less than requested and 9% below the FY2012 estimated levels. The bill allocated $15.8 billion for the Department of State and Related Agencies accounts, including $2.9 billion in Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding, and $32.9 billion for Foreign Operations accounts, including $5.4 billion in OCO funding. The House allocation for the State-Foreign Operations subcommittee was $48.38 billion, including $8.2 billion in OCO funds, almost 12% below the Administration's request and nearly 9% below. The Senate Appropriations Committee allocated $53.02 billion for the State-Foreign Operations subcommittee, which is 3% less than the Administration's request. This included $3.2 billion in Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds. The Obama Administration sought a 2.6% increase above the estimated FY2012 level for the Department of State-Foreign Operations and Related Agencies in its FY2013 budget request to Congress. The Obama Administration's FY2013 budget proposal for the Department of State-Foreign Operations totaled $54.9 billion, including $46.6 billion for the core budget and $8.2 billion for war-related Overseas Contingency Operations. This represented a 2.6% increase over the FY2012 funding levels. The Obama Administration's FY2013 budget proposal for State-Foreign Operations included a 4.5% increase in State Department accounts and a 0.1% increase in Foreign Operations accounts. The budget also requested funds for a new bilateral economic aid account, the Middle East and North Africa Incentive Fund, and $800 million for the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund. The FY2013 budget proposal for State-Foreign Operations included a slight increase in State Department Administration of Foreign Affairs funding, a slight decrease in bilateral economic aid, and a small increase in security assistance funding. These three categories make up more than 85% of the total funding requested. The FY2013 budget proposal for State-Foreign Operations included funding for State Department operations, International Organizations, International Peacekeeping activities, International Broadcasting, and entities like the National Endowment for Democracy. For a detailed breakdown of funds requested, refer to Appendix C. The FY2013 budget proposal for State-Foreign Operations included a 4.5% boost in funding for the State Department and Related Agencies accounts, totaling $18.8 billion. This amount supported key efforts such as the military-to-civilian transition in Iraq and State Department-led initiatives in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The State Department is leading efforts in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq after the military-to-civilian transition. The Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review is driving internal reorganizations, with a focus on personnel issues. The State Department is managing a wide-ranging policy agenda in Iraq post-military transition, with a reduced budget request for FY2013 at $2.7 billion, reflecting the intent to \"normalize\" the U.S. presence. The FY2013 budget request for State Department operations in Iraq was reduced to $2.7 billion, with plans for embassy branch offices in Diyala and Mosul being postponed. Cost-saving measures included a 25% reduction in State Department presence, decreased security contracts, and completion of construction funded in FY2012. The House appropriations bill allocated $2.8 billion for operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, with increased security funding for staff in these frontline states. The Senate Appropriations Committee bill provided $2.1 billion for Department of State operations in Iraq in FY2013, in line with State's revised operational assumptions following reforms outlined in the QDDR. The QDDR outlined reforms including the establishment of a new Bureau of Energy Resources and elevation of the Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism to a Bureau. The Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization activities were absorbed into the Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations. Funding for State Department's Counterterrorism mission increased from $3.2 million in FY2011 to $19 million. The FY2013 budget request included $19 million for the new Bureau of Counterterrorism, with funds for 12 new positions. The Bureau of Energy Resources also sought 22 additional direct-hire positions at a cost of $5.4 million. The Bureau of Energy Resources requested $5.4 million in additional funding in the FY2013 budget to strengthen market incentives, enhance human resource expertise on energy matters, and establish regional hubs in Istanbul, Singapore, Johannesburg, and Rio de Janeiro. The House Appropriations Committee did not include $5.4 million and 22 new positions for the Bureau of Energy Resources. The Senate Appropriations Committee report did not mention this Bureau, but funding within the D&CP could support new hires. The Administration's FY2013 request for the Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations (CSO) saw an 86% increase in funding, with a restructuring to decrease staffing levels by 64 positions for a more agile and expeditionary approach. The proposed change aims to create a more flexible response capacity with a smaller staff, reducing overhead while increasing deployment capacity. The Civilian Response Corps model is being modified to fund experts only when deployed, resulting in a reduction of 76 members from the current 144. The House Appropriations Committee's FY2013 proposal allows the Secretary of State to transfer up to $35 million for Conflict and Stabilization Operations. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposal for FY2013 included no funding for Conflict and Stabilization Operations but authorized up to $56.5 million to be transferred from Diplomatic & Consular Program funding to this account. The Administration's FY2013 request for additional human resources D&CP was $2.5 billion, $71.2 million above its FY2012 request. The FY2013 request included $24.9 million to increase State's staffing by 121 new positions as part of the \"Diplomacy 3.0\" initiative. Secretary Clinton aimed to boost Foreign Service Officers by 25% by 2014, but with the proposed funding, there would be an 18% growth since 2008, hiring 82 FSOs and 39 civil servants. The Department of State postponed its goal of 25% growth in the Foreign Service due to budget constraints. The Administration requested $81.4 million for the final phase of Overseas Comparability Pay implementation for FSOs. Prior to 2009, Foreign Service employees faced a 23.1% pay cut when transferring abroad, compounded by reduced employer contributions to the Thrift Savings Plan. Entry and mid-level employees were particularly affected. State officials noted that entry and mid-level Foreign Service employees were significantly impacted by the pay differentials, which could lead to increased attrition and recruitment challenges. Congress had previously approved two OCP adjustments since 2009, reducing the pay differential by nearly 70%. The FY2013 request aimed to bring the comparability pay level to the Washington, DC, locality pay rate. However, the House Appropriations Committee recommendation for FY2013 did not include funding for hiring above attrition. The FY2013 budget did not include funding for hiring above attrition. The requested extension of authority for overseas comparability pay was rejected by the committee, stating it should be addressed by the authorization committee. The Senate Appropriations Committee also did not include overseas comparability pay authority or funding in its FY2013 proposal. The U.S. opposes Palestinian statehood outside of negotiations with Israel. U.S. law prohibits funding to U.N. agencies accepting Palestine as a full member. $80 million was sought for UNESCO contributions, but withheld since Palestine's admission. The House committee report sought $80 million for UNESCO contributions but stated it would withhold U.S. contributions to UNESCO. The report also included language prohibiting ESF assistance to the Palestinian Authority if they gain full membership in the United Nations without a negotiated Israeli-Palestinian agreement. The Senate legislation did not recommend funding for UNESCO within the CIO account. The Senate legislation did not recommend funding for UNESCO within the CIO account, citing legal restrictions and explicit prohibitions on U.S. funding to UNESCO and other U.N. entities granting full membership to the Palestinian Authority. The proposed budget included less funding than requested for the International Organizations and Programs account, which covers U.S. voluntary contributions to UNESCO for FY22013. The Foreign Operations budget, managed by USAID and the State Department, includes U.S. contributions to multilateral financial institutions like the World Bank and funds for various foreign assistance agencies. The Foreign Operations budget request for FY2013 totaled $36.07 billion, with a 0.1% increase from the previous year. It includes funds for international financial institutions like the World Bank and activities for trade promotion. The budget also supports ongoing foreign assistance initiatives such as the Global Health Initiative and funding for war-related efforts. The FY2013 Foreign Operations budget request included funding for international financial institutions, trade promotion, Global Health Initiative, and war-related efforts in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. A new regional funding account for political transitions in the Middle East and North Africa was also proposed, but faced opposition in Congress due to policy issues like restrictions on international family planning programs and aid conditions for certain countries and entities. The FY2013 Foreign Operations budget request included funding for various programs, including support for political transitions in the Middle East and North Africa. Recent popular uprisings in the region have raised questions about the U.S. role in foreign political transitions. Members of the 112th Congress have shown interest in supporting these uprisings. The Administration proposed a $770 million Middle East and North Africa Incentive Fund (MENA IF) in its FY2013 budget to support U.S. engagement in the evolving situation in the Middle East. This fund would include $65 million for the Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) and $5 million for the Office of Middle East Programs. Members of the 112th Congress were interested in supporting popular uprisings in the region but had concerns about accountability and unintended consequences. The Administration proposed a $770 million Middle East and North Africa Incentive Fund (MENA IF) in its FY2013 budget to support U.S. engagement in the evolving situation in the Middle East. $700 million of the fund would have been unallocated funds intended to provide incentives for beneficiary countries to move toward democracy, while allowing for State Department flexibility and transparency in supporting Arab Spring countries in transition. The funds would have been allocated in close consultation with Congress and could have been used for humanitarian relief. The Administration proposed a $770 million Middle East and North Africa Incentive Fund (MENA IF) in its FY2013 budget to support U.S. engagement in the evolving situation in the Middle East. Some Members of Congress expressed concerns about the proposed MENA IF, which some believe would have given the Administration too much discretion and Congress too little opportunity for oversight. The House committee bill provided no funding for a new account, but would have allocated $175 million within the Economic Support Fund (ESF) account and $25 million in the Foreign Military Finance account for \"Middle East Response,\" including the funding of MEPI and OMEP and no less than $50 million for Jordan. The Senate committee report included $1 billion for MENA IF, 30% more than the requested $770 million. MEPI funding would increase to $70 million. Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan are top aid recipients due to their strategic significance in the Global War on Terror. The Administration requested $6.8 billion for aid to these countries in FY2013. The Administration sought $2.1 billion in foreign operations funds for Iraq in FY2013, with $1.8 billion designated as OCO. The request included $1 billion for the Police Development Program, described as the cornerstone of U.S. security engagement in Iraq. The Police Development Program in Iraq faced scrutiny in 2012 amid reports of reduction, but the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad defended its importance. Despite doubts about its effectiveness due to security challenges and Iraqi indifference, House legislation expressed support for the program without specific funds allocated for Iraq. The House report expressed support for the Police Development Program in Iraq, funded through the INCLE program. The Senate did not allocate funds for the program in FY2013, citing Iraqi disinterest and State Department planning issues. The Administration requested $2.5 billion for Afghanistan, with $1.2 billion for the program. The Administration requested $2.5 billion in foreign operations funds for Afghanistan, with almost half designated as OCO. The increase reflected a surge in infrastructure and economic growth investments, as well as justice sector program ramping up. The House legislation withheld assistance until security certification, while the Senate bill included $1.8 billion for foreign operations. The Senate bill allocated $1.8 billion in foreign operations funds for Afghanistan, stating that less funding would be needed as the Afghan government takes control of more programs. The Administration's FY2013 budget requested $2.2 billion for Pakistan, including $800 million for the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund. This was a 6% increase from FY2012, focusing on civilian assistance for energy, economic growth, stabilization, education, and health. The House legislation did not specify an aid level for Pakistan, but prohibited assistance if Pakistan is uncooperative in anti-terrorism efforts. The Senate bill included $842.3 million for Pakistan, with new conditions on aid including withholding $33 million in Foreign Military Financing. The budget request included roughly $7.9 billion for the Administration's Global Health Initiative (GHI) through State-Foreign Operations appropriations, compared to the FY2012 enacted level of $8.2 billion. The proposed cut of approximately $300.0 million was the largest foreign operations account reduction requested, in dollar terms, and would have represented the end of a decade-long growth trend in global health funding. The budget request included a decrease in global health funding, except for an increase in funding for family planning and the Global Fund. Proposed reductions were for bilateral HIV/AIDS activities, with the Administration claiming goals could still be met through efficiencies and reduced costs. Both House and Senate proposed more funding than the request, with the House providing slightly more at $8 billion for global health. The House legislation provided $8 billion for global health, slightly more than the request, including $1.3 billion for the U.S. contribution to the Global Fund. The Senate proposed $8.5 billion for the Global Health Initiative (GHI), 8% more than requested, with $1.7 billion for the Global Fund. Feed the Future (FtF), the Obama Administration's food security initiative, remains a priority with a FY2013 request of $1.1 billion in Foreign Operations funds. The FY2013 request included $134 million for the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP), managed by the World Bank. The House proposal for FY2013 supported the goals of Feed the Future (FtF) but did not specify a funding level, except for $99.8 million allocated for GAFSP. The Senate recommended $1.2 billion for agricultural and food security assistance, including $200 million specifically. The FY2013 request for programs supporting the Global Climate Change Initiative (GCCI) was $770 million, with funds flowing through various appropriations accounts. The initiative focuses on climate change activities such as adaptation, clean energy technologies, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions through sustainable landscapes, with a significant portion of funding going through World Bank Trust Funds. The FY2013 funding for the Global Climate Change Initiative (GCCI) would be channeled through World Bank Trust Funds, leveraging contributions from other countries. The House and Senate had differing proposals for GCCI funding in FY2013. The House legislation did not mention GCCI and recommended zero funding for certain climate funds, while the Senate committee did not set a minimum funding level for climate change programs. The Senate committee recommended $111 million for Sustainable Landscapes under the GCCI, and allocated $139.4 million for the GEF, $100.0 million for the Strategic Climate Fund, and $300.0 million for the Clean Technology Fund, exceeding the Administration's requests. Additionally, $643 million was requested for family planning and reproductive health activities in FY2013, a topic of contentious debate in Congress for over three decades. Recent congressional debate primarily focuses on policy over funding concerns, specifically regarding the Mexico City policy and U.S. funding of the UNFPA. The Mexico City policy, implemented by President Reagan in 1984, requires foreign NGOs receiving USAID family planning assistance to certify they will not promote abortion. The policy has been rescinded and reissued by past administrations, most recently by President Obama in January 2009. The Mexico City Policy, implemented by President Reagan in 1984, requires foreign NGOs receiving USAID family planning assistance to certify they will not promote abortion. The policy has been rescinded and reissued by past administrations, most recently by President Obama in January 2009. The proposed FY2013 House legislation included language that would codify the Mexico City Policy, while the Senate bill did not. Previous Administrations have also suspended grants to UNFPA due to evidence of coercive family planning practices in China, citing violations of the \"Kemp-Kasten\" amendment. The George W. Bush Administration suspended U.S. contributions to UNFPA from FY2002 to FY2008. The George W. Bush Administration suspended U.S. contributions to UNFPA from FY2002 to FY2008 following an investigation of family planning programs in China. President Obama resumed U.S. contributions in 2009, with a proposed $39 million for UNFPA in FY2013. The House proposed $461 million for family planning and reproductive health activities, excluding UNFPA, while the Senate proposed $700 million, including $44.5 million for UNFPA. Both bills included the Kemp-Kasten amendment. The AEECA account, a remnant of the SEED Act of 1989 and the Freedom Support Act of 1992, was proposed to be dissolved in FY2013. The House legislation merged AEECA funds with ESF, GHP, and INCLE accounts, with a funding cut of 18% from FY2012. This change was not meant to signal diminished support for former Soviet and Eastern bloc states transitioning to democracy and free market economies. The Senate proposal includes a provision for funds from ESF and other accounts to assist AEECA-eligible countries without specifying a minimum funding level. U.S. national security, trade promotion, and humanitarian interests drive most international affairs activities, with a historical focus on anti-communism during the Cold War. During the Cold War, U.S. foreign policy had an anti-communist focus and also aimed at promoting economic development, trade, education, health care, human rights, and environmental protection. After the Cold War, new objectives emerged, including nuclear non-proliferation, drug control, peace efforts in the Middle East, regional stability, religious freedom, and combating human trafficking. The focus shifted significantly after the 9/11 attacks towards counterterrorism efforts. Following the 9/11 attacks, U.S. foreign aid and diplomatic programs shifted focus to emphasize national security objectives, particularly in efforts to counter terrorism. President Bush's 2002 National Security Strategy established global development as a key pillar of U.S. national security, alongside defense and diplomacy. Foreign assistance budget justifications began highlighting the war on terrorism as a top priority, with a focus on aiding \"front-line\" states. The Bush Administration made global development a key pillar of U.S. national security post-9/11, with a focus on aiding \"front-line\" states in the war on terrorism. Foreign aid was used as a tool of national security, with large reconstruction programs in Afghanistan and Iraq. Efforts also included increased aid to combat HIV/AIDS globally through the creation of PEPFAR. Diplomatic security and public diplomacy in Muslim communities were key priorities for the State Department. The Bush Administration prioritized global development as a key aspect of U.S. national security post-9/11, focusing on aiding \"front-line\" states in the war on terrorism. Efforts included increased aid to combat HIV/AIDS globally through the creation of PEPFAR. The Obama Administration continued many of these initiatives, such as the Millennium Challenge Corporation and robust assistance to Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. Funding for these initiatives has been requested within Overseas Contingency. The Obama Administration's Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) in 2010 named USAID as the leading agency for development assistance. Reforms for the Department of State included the establishment of the Bureau of Energy and elevating the Office of the Coordinator for Stabilization and Reconstruction. In FY2012, the Department of State proposed using OCO funds for \"extraordinary, but temporary, costs\" in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. Congress expanded the OCO designation to include additional accounts and countries. The OCO designation allows for funding of additional accounts and countries, separate from budget caps. However, OCO funds are subject to automatic reductions. This approach is similar to using supplemental appropriations for international affairs. The use of supplemental international affairs appropriations for activities in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere in FY2002-FY2010 was criticized by the Obama Administration. They pledged to request funds through the regular budget process starting in FY2010, resulting in a sharp increase in base funding. In FY2010, supplemental international affairs funds were requested and enacted for activities in Haiti, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan. FY2011 was the only year in the last decade where all international affairs funding was part of the base budget before the OCO approach was adopted in FY2012. OCO allows all funding to be considered simultaneously in the regular appropriations process. For FY2013, the Administration requested $8.24 billion, about 15% of the international affairs request. The Administration requested $8.24 billion for FY2013, with about 15% designated as OCO. The House legislation designated $8.3 billion as OCO, while the Senate bill designated $2.3 billion, largely due to no funding for the Iraq Police Development program. State Department-Foreign Operations funding trended upward until 2011, with a spike in FY2004 for Iraq and Afghanistan reconstruction. FY2011 saw a significant reduction in foreign affairs spending to meet deficit reduction goals. FY2012 and FY2013 funding leveled off due to deficit reduction efforts, remaining below FY2009 levels after adjusting for inflation. State-Foreign Operations appropriations for the past decade in both current and constant dollars show a spike in foreign aid in 2004, with a slight increase in State Department funding. In recent years, State Department and related agencies funding trends upward at a steeper rate than overall foreign affairs spending. The George W. Bush and Obama Administrations aimed to boost human resource capacity at the Department of State. Foreign aid appropriations have shown a similar trend to the overall State-Foreign Operations budget, with funding levels stabilizing in FY2012 and FY2013. Israel and Egypt were the top recipients of U.S. foreign aid before 9/11 and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Israel and Egypt have been top recipients of U.S. foreign aid since the Camp David Peace Accords in 1978. Iraq and Afghanistan moved into the top five recipients due to reconstruction efforts, but aid to Iraq has decreased. Pakistan has also received increased aid to combat extremist organizations. Funding for these countries includes temporary OCO appropriations. Top aid recipients in FY2013 remained the same as FY2012. In FY2013, the top five aid recipients remained the same as FY2012. Israel received $3,100 million in FMF, Afghanistan received $2,505 million with $1,237.9 million as OCO funds, Pakistan received $2,228 million with $800 million for PCCF, and Iraq received $2,045 million with $1,750 million as OCO funds. Aid to Africa was set to decline by 10% under the FY2013 budget request. Under the FY2013 budget request, aid to Africa would decrease by 10% to $6.4 billion, aid to the Near East would increase by 12% to $9.0 billion, and aid to South Central Asia would increase by 6% to $5.3 billion. Aid to Africa supports health programs, while aid to South Central Asia is mainly for war-related costs in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Near East region's aid is dominated by assistance to Israel, Iraq, Egypt, and Jordan. In FY2013, the Western Hemisphere saw a decline in funding for Colombia, while Europe and Eurasia had a 14% decrease due to progress in the region. Aid to East Asia and Pacific remained consistent. Congress has shown interest in various aid sectors like education and health. The Administration's budget requests for FY2012 and FY2013 were compared for key interest areas, showing a decrease in funding for most sectors in FY2013. Congressional appropriators' priorities were not reflected in the comparison. The FY2013 funding request showed decreases in most sectors compared to FY2012, with reductions in Food Security, Global Climate Change, Sustainable Landscapes, Neglected Tropical Diseases, Nutrition, Maternal and Child Health, Higher Education, Clean Energy, and Basic Education. Increased funding was emphasized for Gender Funding and Science, Technology, and Innovation. The FY2013 funding request showed decreases in most sectors compared to FY2012, with reductions in various areas. Innovation funding increased by 85% over last year's request."
