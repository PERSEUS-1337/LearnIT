    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Our Nation's Trade, Infrastructure, Mobility, and Efficiency Act of 2007\" or the \"ON TIME Act of 2007\". The growth in international trade, especially containerized trade, is straining the nation's transportation network and contributing to traffic congestion near major U.S. international gateways. Between 2000 and 2005, the value of international trade increased from $2 trillion to $2.6 trillion, with the number of containerized trade shipments rising from 59 million to 81 million 20-foot equivalent units. The growth in international trade has led to a significant increase in freight shipments congestion. The United States is involved in multiple free trade agreements and negotiations, contributing to the rise in traffic congestion within the country. Traffic congestion in US cities is worsening, leading to Americans wasting 4.2 billion hours in traffic and buying 2.9 billion extra gallons of fuel annually, costing $78 billion. Over 200 freight bottlenecks result in $8 billion in economic losses and 243 million hours of delay each year. To maintain current transportation conditions, $235 billion was invested in 2006 by all levels of government. To improve transportation and reduce congestion, the government invested $235 billion in 2006, $304 billion in 2015, and plans to invest $472 billion in 2030. Additionally, to address major transportation needs and reduce freight congestion, a total investment of $288 billion in 2006, $368 billion in 2015, and $561 billion in 2030 is required. The government aims to reduce freight congestion and enhance transportation system reliability to improve the quality of life for US citizens.
