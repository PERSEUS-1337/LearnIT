    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Americans with Disabilities Act Restoration Act of 2007\". Congress finds that in enacting the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, it intended to establish a clear prohibition of discrimination on the basis of disability. However, decisions of the Supreme Court have narrowed the scope of protection, leaving out individuals Congress intended to protect. Congress recognized in enacting the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 that physical and mental impairments should not hinder a person's full participation in society, but prejudice and societal barriers often prevent talented individuals with disabilities from doing so. Congress modeled the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 definition of disability on section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which encompassed actual and perceived limitations imposed by society, as recognized by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court emphasized in School Board of Nassau County v. Arline that society's myths and fears about disability can be as limiting as physical impairments. Congress incorporated this concept into the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, recognizing that discrimination based on physical or mental impairments is often unrelated to the actual limitations caused by the impairment itself. The Supreme Court has ruled that the definition of \"disability\" in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 needs to be interpreted strictly, creating a demanding standard for qualification as disabled. This has led to a narrowing of the application of the definition in various ways, contrary to congressional intent. The Supreme Court has narrowed the application of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, excluding individuals who have mitigated their impairments through measures like medication and assistive devices, contrary to congressional intent. The Act aims to eliminate discrimination and establish enforceable standards. The curr_chunk emphasizes the need for strong, enforceable standards to address discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, in response to Supreme Court decisions that have narrowed the scope of protection. The curr_chunk clarifies the definition of disability in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 to ensure protection for individuals facing adverse treatment based on impairment or prejudiced attitudes. The curr_chunk explains that discrimination can occur due to disabilities or the failure to remove societal and institutional barriers. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 addresses discrimination based on disabilities and the need to remove societal and institutional barriers. Section 2(a) of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 is amended to emphasize that physical and mental disabilities are natural parts of human experience and should not hinder a person's right to fully participate in society. Discrimination often prevents individuals with disabilities from participating, despite their talents, skills, abilities, and desire to do so. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 is amended to address discrimination against individuals with disabilities, emphasizing their right to participate fully in society. It highlights the history of unequal treatment, restrictions, and political powerlessness faced by individuals with disabilities, and discourages classifications and selection criteria that exclude them. Individuals with disabilities should be strongly disfavored, subjected to skeptical examination, and permitted only for compelling reasons, not based on prejudice or stereotypes about disability. SEC. 4. DISABILITY DEFINED. Section 3 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 is amended to define \"disability\" as a physical or mental impairment, a record of such impairment, or being regarded as having such an impairment. The determination of an individual's physical or mental impairment should not consider mitigating measures, the impact of these measures, episodic manifestations, or the nature of the impairment. The term 'mitigating measure' refers to any treatment, medication, device, or other measure used to eliminate, mitigate, or compensate for the effect of an impairment. This includes prescription medications, personal aids, reasonable accommodations, and auxiliary aids. The term 'mental impairment' refers to any mental or psychological disorder, while 'physical impairment' refers to any physiological disorder or condition affecting the body. The term 'record of a physical or mental impairment' refers to a history of conditions affecting various body systems such as neurological, musculoskeletal, special sense organs, respiratory, cardiovascular, reproductive, digestive, genitourinary, hemic and lymphatic, skin, and endocrine. The term 'regarded as having a physical or mental impairment' refers to being perceived or treated as having such an impairment, regardless of whether the individual actually has one. SEC. 5. ADVERSE ACTION. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 is amended to include discrimination against individuals using mitigating measures or experiencing side effects as discrimination under the Act. SEC. 6. DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF DISABILITY. SEC. 6 of the Americans with Disabilities Act is amended to prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability. SEC. 7 amends Section 103(a) of the Americans with Disabilities Act to clarify the definition of a qualified individual with a disability. SEC. 8 provides a rule of construction. Section 501 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 is amended to ensure broad construction of the Act's provisions for comprehensive prohibition of discrimination based on disability. Regulations by the Attorney General, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and Secretary of Labor are required within 180 days of the Americans with Disabilities Act Restoration Act of 2007. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 is amended to broaden the prohibition of discrimination based on disability. Regulations by various agencies are required to implement the provisions of the Act, as amended by the Americans with Disabilities Act Restoration Act of 2007. The Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board will issue supplementary guidelines to supplement existing regulations.
