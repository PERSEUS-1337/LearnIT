    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship Act of 1994\". The Congress recognizes the Department of Energy's unique mathematics and science capabilities that contribute to education. There is a need to enhance collaboration between the Department of Energy, other federal agencies, and the mathematics and science education community, which includes nationally recognized teachers. Elementary and secondary school mathematics and science teachers play a crucial role in effective education programs. A pilot program has shown the effectiveness of having outstanding teachers serve in professional staff capacities in the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Act establishes a national fellowship program for exceptional math and science teachers, known as \"Albert Einstein Fellows\". The Act defines key terms such as \"contractor\" as a nonprofit educational organization administering the fellowship program, \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of Energy, \"elementary school\" and \"local educational agency\" as per the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The Education Act of 1965 defines the term \"outstanding\" for math or science teachers who have received national or state recognition and a sabbatical leave from teaching. The Education Act of 1965 defines \"secondary school\" as per section 1471(21) and allows teachers to take sabbatical leave for fellowship programs. The Education Act of 1965 allows teachers to take sabbatical leave for fellowship programs. SEC. 5 authorizes the fellowship program. The Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship Program allows 10 outstanding math or science teachers to receive fellowships each fiscal year. The Secretary can reduce the number of fellowships if the appropriated amount is less than authorized. The Secretary can reduce the number of fellowships awarded under the Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship Program if the appropriated amount is less than authorized. Priority is given to awarding fellowships to selected individuals, including 2 teachers in the Senate and 2 teachers in the House of Representatives. Fellowships under this Act will be awarded for a 10-month period, with one teacher each in various government departments and agencies. The Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship Program will award fellowships for 10 months, coinciding with the academic year. The Secretary can contract with a third party to administer the program, including developing the application process and promoting the program in professional publications. The Albert Einstein Fellowship Program will select 10 outstanding math and science teachers through an initial screening process. Applications will be invited from teachers in various recognition programs. The responsibilities of the fellowship program include selecting science teachers, making final selections, providing orientation, establishing a reporting and evaluation program, and submitting annual reports. The fellowship program under this Act requires the Secretary to submit annual reports by August 31, 1995, and manage all funds received, including expenses for selection processes and agreements with educational agencies. The contractor must use funds for fellowship recipient salaries, Federal insurance contributions, administrative expenses, orientation program, relocation expenses, and final selection interviews. The contractor may seek funding from non-Federal sources to establish an account for fellowship recipients' expenses, including travel and professional meetings. The 20 semifinalists will be invited to Washington, D.C., for interviews after the initial screening process. Final selections will be made in accordance with specific criteria. The contractor shall develop a process for selecting fellowship recipients under this Act, with key individuals making final selections for assignments in the House of Representatives and Senate. The Minority Leader of the Senate and other key officials will select fellowship recipients to be assigned to the Senate, while other officials will select recipients for assignments within their respective departments or agencies. Each individual selected for a fellowship will interview in different sections within the department they will be placed in before the fellowship period begins. The fellowship recipients will be paid at a rate not exceeding GS-13 of the General Schedule. $550,000 is authorized for fiscal year 1995, with additional funding for fiscal years 1996 through 2001."
