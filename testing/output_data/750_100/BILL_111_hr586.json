    "content": "The Act titled \"Civil Rights History Project Act of 2009\" highlights the importance of individuals standing up for their rights and beliefs, as demonstrated by the Civil Rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s through events like the Montgomery Bus Boycott, sit-ins, Freedom Rides, March on Washington, and the drive for voting rights in Mississippi and the March to Selma. The Civil Rights movement had many leaders like Thurgood Marshall, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Rosa Parks, but there were also lesser-known individuals whose impact was equally significant. Participants in the movement hold valuable first-hand memories that, when recorded, will provide a detailed history of a crucial period in our Nation's past. A project to collect oral histories of individuals from the Civil Rights movement is important for future generations to learn about their struggle and sacrifice. This coordinated Federal project would highlight efforts to collect and interpret articles related to the movement, serving as a model for future projects in museums, libraries, and universities nationwide. The Library of Congress and the Smithsonian Institution are involved in this initiative. The Library of Congress and the Smithsonian Institution are designated to collect, preserve, and provide access to oral histories of individuals who participated in the American Civil Rights movement. This federally sponsored project aims to coordinate the collection of video and audio recordings to build upon the efforts to document this important part of history. The establishment of a joint project at the Library of Congress and the National Museum of African American History and Culture aims to collect video and audio recordings of participants in the American Civil Rights movement to preserve their memories for future generations. The Librarian of Congress and the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution will establish an oral history project to survey audio and video recordings of Civil Rights movement participants to avoid duplication of efforts and enhance existing collections. The oral history project aims to collect video and audio recordings, as well as written materials, related to personal histories of individuals involved in the Civil Rights movement. The collected materials will be cataloged and indexed for preservation. The Librarian and the Secretary will make the collection available for public use through the Library of Congress and the National Museum of African American History and Culture. The Secretary's duties under this Act will be carried out through the Director of the National Museum of African American History and Culture. The Librarian and the Secretary may also collaborate with other entities for carrying out activities. The Secretary may conduct activities through agreements and partnerships with government and private entities, consult with interested persons, and develop guidelines for acquiring recordings under the project. The Librarian and the Secretary can procure temporary services under title 5, United States Code. The Librarian and the Secretary can collect video and audio recordings and materials from individuals, starting with the oldest ones. They can also utilize volunteers, reimburse for travel expenses, and make advances of money in accordance with the law. The Civil Rights History Project aims to collect recordings from individuals involved in the movement for racial equality in the US from 1954 to 1968. Private donations are encouraged to support these activities. The Civil Rights History Project accepts donations of funds and in-kind contributions to support activities under section 3. Donated funds to the Librarian of Congress for these activities are deposited into a dedicated account and used solely for this purpose. The Librarian cannot deposit funds not intended for supporting these activities into the account. Authorization of appropriations is also mentioned. Authorization of appropriations for the Civil Rights History Project includes $500,000 for fiscal year 2010 and necessary sums for fiscal years 2011 through 2014. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
