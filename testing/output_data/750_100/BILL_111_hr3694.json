    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Removing Excess Litigation Involving Energy on Federal Lands Act\" or the \"RELIEF Act\". Congress finds that the United States spends over $1 billion per day importing crude oil, representing the largest wealth transfer in history. The US has significant oil and natural gas reserves in the outer Continental Shelf. Environmental groups have legally challenged leases in the Alaskan Outer Continental Shelf and the 5-year national leasing program. Congress finds that legal challenges to the 5-year national Outer Continental Shelf leasing program significantly delay energy resources reaching the American public, coming at a high cost to the economy. Expedited judicial review is deemed necessary to prevent abuse of the US judicial system. SEC. 3 grants exclusive jurisdiction to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia over causes and claims related to covered energy projects. SEC. 4 specifies that all causes and claims must be filed within 60 days of the action or decision by a Federal official, or they will be barred. SEC. 5 sets a deadline of 180 days for resolving proceedings related to covered energy projects in the District Court for the District of Columbia. Failure to comply with the deadline will result in dismissal of the cause or claim with prejudice. SEC. 6 allows for appellate review of district court judgments only by the Supreme Court. SEC. 7 establishes a deadline for appeals to the Supreme Court. SEC. 7 sets a deadline for resolving district court judgments within 180 days if a writ of certiorari is granted by the Supreme Court. All related proceedings take precedence over other matters before the Supreme Court. In judicial review of Federal actions under this Act, administrative findings are presumed correct unless proven otherwise by clear evidence. Prospective relief can only be granted if narrowly drawn, minimally intrusive, and necessary to correct a violation of Federal law. SEC. 9. LEGAL FEES.\n\nAny person filing a petition for judicial review under this Act must pay legal fees to prevailing parties unless the Court finds their position justified. \n\nSEC. 10. EXCLUSION.\n\nThis Act does not apply to disputes between lease parties regarding lease obligations. SEC. 11. COVERED ENERGY PROJECT DEFINED. The term \"covered energy project\" refers to actions or decisions by Federal officials regarding leasing Federal lands for energy exploration, development, production, processing, or transmission, including actions under such leases."
