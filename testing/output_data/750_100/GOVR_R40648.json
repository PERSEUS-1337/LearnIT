    "content": "Several tax options have been proposed to finance health care reform, including restricting itemized deductions for high-income taxpayers and modifying the tax exclusion for employer-provided health care. The Senate Finance Committee provided a list of options for health-related tax provisions, such as increasing taxes on alcoholic beverages and imposing an excise tax on non-diet sweetened beverages. The House and Senate proposed various tax options to finance health care reform, including a surtax on high-income individuals and an excise tax on insurers for high-cost plans. President Obama also suggested a compromise proposal. President Obama proposed a compromise plan based on H.R. 3590, with changes to revenue provisions. The plan delays the tax on high-cost employer plans to 2018, raises exemption thresholds, and adds a 3.8% tax on unearned income for high-income households. The House passed the Senate proposal H.R. 3590 and H.R. 4872 on March 22, 2010. The House passed the Senate proposal H.R. 3590 and H.R. 4872 on March 22, 2010. The President signed H.R. 3590 on March 23 and H.R. 4872 on March 30. Detailed revenue estimates of the tax proposals are in the Appendix, showing differences in effects on behavior and income distribution. The tax changes may impact higher-income taxpayers more heavily (progressive change), equally on all taxpayers (proportional change), or lower-income taxpayers more heavily (regressive change). For example, limits on itemized deductions and taxes on high incomes affect top earners, while health-related income and payroll-tax exclusions impact middle-income brackets more proportionally. Excise taxes tend to be regressive, affecting lower-income classes more. Excise taxes are regressive and impact lower-income classes more heavily. The distributional analysis in the report focuses on the financing mechanism, not the overall effects of health care reform proposals. Despite regressive revenue sources, the proposal may still benefit lower-income individuals. The report also reviews revenue raisers in House and Senate bills, as well as proposals by President Obama and the Obama Administration. The final legislation includes revenue raisers such as increased Medicare tax, fee on health insurance providers, \"Cadillac\" tax on employer health insurance premiums, and fee on branded drugs. The cellulosic biofuel credit is also a significant provision over a 10-year period. The largest revenue raisers in the legislation include the Medicare tax (44%), Cadillac tax (22%), health insurance fees (14%), and fees on medical devices and corporate reporting (4% each). The cellulosic biofuel provision has expired. The House Ways and Means Committee announced revenue provisions for health care reform, including a tax on high-income individuals. Legislation like the America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009 (H.R. 3200) included many of these provisions. The Affordable Health Care for America Act, H.R. 3962, passed in 2009, included modifications to the initial provisions of H.R. 3200. The main changes involved revising the surtax on high-income taxpayers and adding new revenue raisers. The original proposal in H.R. 3200 aimed to generate $583.1 billion for FY2010-FY2014, with $543.9 billion coming from a surtax on individual taxpayers. The Joint Committee on Taxation proposed a surtax on individual taxpayers to generate $543.9 billion. The surtax would be based on adjusted gross income, with rates of 1% to 5.4% for different income levels. The proposal also included a provision to raise $8 billion by adjusting the definition of medical expenses for health savings accounts. The plan proposed raising $8 billion by adjusting the definition of medical expenses for health savings accounts. It also included revenue raisers related to international taxation and tax evasion, such as a delay in the revised allocation of interest for the foreign tax credit, a provision to raise $26.1 billion over 10 years, a provision to raise $7.5 billion related to the use of treaties to avoid U.S. tax, and a provision to codify the economic substance doctrine. The proposal in H.R. 3962 includes revenue raisers such as a 5.4% surtax on incomes over $1 million for joint returns and $500,000 for single taxpayers, raising $460.5 billion over FY2010-FY2014. It also includes provisions related to international taxation and tax evasion introduced in H.R. 3200. The revised allocation of interest for the foreign tax credit in H.R. 3200 was included in other legislation and the current repeal provision is projected to raise $6.0 billion. The economic substance doctrine provision was modified to include penalties for underpayments and is estimated to raise $5.7 billion. Additionally, H.R. 3962 includes restrictions on health-related tax provisions. The plan includes limiting health flexible spending arrangements, increasing penalties for nonqualified distributions from health savings accounts, disallowing deductions for Medicare Part D subsidies, imposing a 2.5% excise tax on medical devices, and requiring information reporting on payments to corporations. The proposal includes extending requirements to corporations for third-party reporting and tax compliance, with a small loss for health benefits extension and a small gain from fees on health plans. It also excludes Indian Tribe health benefits from gross income and includes a tax on the sale of medical devices. The House bill proposal includes a surtax on high-income individuals, targeting the top 1.2% of taxpayers, with the highest surtax affecting only two-tenths of 1% of taxpayers. The surtax would impact 0.3% of taxpayers according to the committees' summary. The surtax in H.R. 3962 would affect 0.3% of taxpayers, with concerns raised about its impact on small businesses and entrepreneurship. Only about 4% of businesses would be affected by the surtax initially, with 1.2% of unincorporated businesses expected to pay the revised surtax. Higher-income individuals would bear a larger share of the surtax burden due to their higher income levels. The IRS statistics show that a small percentage of individuals with income over $1 million and $500,000 account for a significant share of overall income. Business income is more concentrated in higher-income levels. Labor income makes up three-quarters of total income, with the rest split between passive capital income, pensions, and business income. In the top 1%, labor income is less than half of total income. Individuals with incomes over $1 million contribute to 33% of unincorporated business net income, while those with incomes over $500,000 contribute to 39%. This concentration is mainly seen in partnership and Subchapter S firms. Returns with adjusted gross income of $1 million or more make up 7.5% of total proprietorship income, and returns with income over $500,000 make up 12.6%. In partnership and Subchapter S firms, returns with income over $1 million account for 49% of net income, while those with income over $500,000 account for 64% of net income. A 2007 Treasury study showed that taxpayers at the top tax rate are responsible for 61% of business flow-through income. Most partnership income is in limited liability companies or limited partnerships. The Treasury study indicated that high-income taxpayers accounted for only 46% of active positive business income, with only 22.8% having business income that was more than half of total income. This suggests that much of the income from these businesses is passive investment income. The Treasury study found that high-income taxpayers accounted for only 46% of active positive business income, with 22.8% having business income more than half of total income. This indicates that much of the income from these businesses is passive investment income, including corporate dividends and capital gains. Partnership income, mostly from finance, real estate, oil and gas extraction, and services, does not necessarily contribute to entrepreneurship and job creation. About 8% of total income was from real estate and oil and gas, 19% from finance and insurance. The Treasury study found that high-income taxpayers accounted for only 46% of active positive business income, with much of it being passive investment income. This income is derived from various sectors such as finance, real estate, oil and gas, and services. Only 8% of total income was from real estate and oil and gas, 19% from finance and insurance, 15% in professional services, and 5% in health. The data suggest that small business income is associated with passive investments, stockbrokers, lawyers, doctors, and accountants, who may not be significant sources of job creation for lower and moderate-income individuals. The argument that small businesses are important as sources of new jobs is questioned due to job loss. Small businesses create more net new jobs, but evidence is unclear due to migration across size classifications. This sector offers more opportunities to women and minorities but pays less, is less stable, and has fewer benefits. There is no need for a permanent policy to create jobs, although a stimulus may be necessary in an economic downturn. The economy creates its own jobs over time, so there is no need for a permanent policy aimed at job creation. Excluding income from certain business operations could mitigate the impact on small businesses. Flow through income, which is a significant portion of the top 1%'s income, could be excluded from a surcharge to minimize revenue loss. The proposal in the initial bill would sacrifice around one-quarter of revenue, with potential smaller losses if certain income sources were not excluded. One provision would disallow spending on over-the-counter medications in tax-favored plans. Other revenue-raising provisions have minor effects. The Senate proposal discusses health-related tax expenditures, limits on flexible spending accounts, and conforming medical expenses definitions for health savings accounts. Significant provisions relate to corporation taxes and the tax gap, with a brief discussion on the excise tax on medical devices. The excise tax on medical devices is discussed in both the House and Senate bills. The Senate proposes a fixed fee for medical devices, while the House bill imposes a 2.5% tax on manufacturers and importers. This tax is expected to be passed on to consumers for ordinary medical devices with multiple producers. The excise tax on medical devices is expected to be passed on to consumers, with some costs potentially absorbed by insurers and producers. However, for unique devices under patent, producers may absorb some costs. The tax could discourage investment in new devices, but this effect may be reduced if consumers have health insurance coverage. The interest allocation proposal would repeal a 2004 provision allowing worldwide interest allocation for the foreign tax credit. This change would impact firms with more foreign taxes paid than allowable credits, increasing allowable foreign tax credits and reducing U.S. tax liability. The 2004 provision allowed worldwide interest allocation for the foreign tax credit, impacting firms with more foreign taxes paid than allowable credits. Another provision aims to reduce \"treaty-shopping\" by imposing withholding taxes on certain payments to foreigners. The third provision aims to codify the economic substance doctrine, which disallows tax benefits for arrangements lacking economic substance. This provision addresses the interpretation differences among courts and recent legislative proposals. President Obama's budget proposals and recent legislative proposals have included provisions requiring transactions to meet objective and subjective tests for profit. Penalties are imposed to reduce tax avoidance. H.R. 3962 also includes a provision for information reporting on payments to corporations by firms. Some tax attorneys are concerned that specific rules may provide a roadmap for passing the test. The current law requires firms to report payments of $600 or more to other firms, except for corporations. This reporting helps enforce tax compliance for self-employed individuals. Small businesses are increasingly incorporating, leading to potential compliance issues. However, this provision increases the compliance burden on businesses. The provision modifies the cellulosic biofuels producer credit to exclude fuel with significant water, sediment, or ash content, like black liquor, which was previously eligible for the credit. This change could simplify reporting requirements by not requiring firms to determine corporate or noncorporate status. The black liquor provision, originally eligible for a fuel credit, was viewed as unintended and aimed at reducing fossil fuel use in the paper industry. The alcohol fuel mixture credit expired in 2009. For more information, refer to CRS Report RL34494 and CRS Report R40468. Under current law, firms must report payments to unincorporated businesses providing services over $600 per year on form 1099-MISC. If they can't get the vendor's taxpayer ID, they must withhold taxes to increase third-party reporting and address unreported income, especially from small businesses. Other income types have higher compliance rates. The reporting requirements for payments to large corporate firms aim to increase compliance rates. However, only a small fraction of firms currently file this information return, and it is unclear how many noncompliant firms exist. The proposed expansion of reporting services payments to corporations has been suggested for years to improve compliance. The expansion of reporting requirements aims to increase compliance rates by including small firms in corporate status and reporting goods along with services. This change could simplify compliance for firms and increase the share of firms expected to file these forms. The expansion of reporting requirements aims to increase compliance rates by including small firms in corporate status and reporting goods along with services. Simplifying compliance for firms and increasing the share of firms expected to file these forms may lead to more successful enforcement of information reporting. However, businesses have criticized these provisions for adding unnecessary costs and administrative burdens without justifying the potential revenue gain. There are concerns that the IRS may not have the resources to effectively utilize the additional information provided. If these concerns persist, there may be a need to scale back the proposal, which has sparked controversy. The proposal in the final bill is causing controversy. One option is to raise the minimum reporting requirement, while another is to only report additional information to the IRS, not the payee. The Senate Finance Committee reported the America's Healthy Future Act of 2009, with a provision for a 40% excise tax on health coverage exceeding certain amounts. This provision was scaled back in the final bill, which raises $398.1 billion in revenues. H.R. 3590, passed by the Senate, raises $398.1 billion in revenue. It includes a 40% excise tax on high health coverage, a reduced fee on medical devices, an increase in payroll tax for high-income earners, a 10% excise tax on indoor tanning facilities, and other provisions. The Senate bill, H.R. 3590, raises revenue through various measures including a 40% excise tax on high health coverage, a reduced fee on medical devices, an increase in payroll tax for high-income earners, and a 10% excise tax on indoor tanning facilities. Additionally, it includes provisions related to insured and self-insured plans, adoption credit, and assistance for state student loan repayment programs for health professionals. The Senate bill, H.R. 3590, includes measures such as a 40% excise tax on high health coverage, increased penalties for nonqualified distributions from health savings accounts, and limits on deductions for medical costs and remuneration. The Senate bill, H.R. 3590, includes various revenue-raising provisions such as fees on medical devices, health insurance providers, branded drugs, and indoor tanning facilities. It also imposes an additional 0.9% HI payroll tax on wages exceeding $200,000. The revenue raising provision in the Senate bill includes an additional 0.9% HI payroll tax on wages over $200,000 for singles and $250,000 for joint returns, projected to raise $86.8 billion. Other provisions include requirements for non-profit hospitals, employer reporting on W-2 health benefits value, and a safe harbor for nondiscrimination rules in cafeteria plans for small employers. There are also revenue losing provisions such as a therapeutic discovery project credit and exclusion of funds for state student loan repayment programs for health professionals. The Senate bill includes provisions for an additional 0.9% HI payroll tax on high-income earners, requirements for non-profit hospitals, employer reporting on W-2 health benefits, and a safe harbor for nondiscrimination rules in cafeteria plans for small employers. Other provisions involve a therapeutic discovery project credit, exclusion of funds for state student loan repayment programs for health professionals, and an excise tax on health insurance coverage, drugs, medical devices, and cosmetic procedures. The provision in the Senate bill would tax employer benefits to recipients, with a 40% rate similar to the top income tax rate. This tax is expected to increase premiums or reduce benefits for high-income taxpayers, leading to higher tax liability and potentially reducing demand for medical care. It is estimated to generate $148.9 billion in revenue over 10 years. The Senate bill proposes taxing employer benefits at a 40% rate, expected to generate $148.9 billion in revenue over 10 years. Thresholds for increased limits on benefits would be adjusted based on CPI plus one percentage point, with higher limits for certain professions and age groups. The Senate bill proposes taxing employer benefits at a 40% rate, expected to generate $148.9 billion in revenue over 10 years. Limits for health insurance plans would be $9,850 for single plans and $26,000 for family plans for qualifying individuals. A study showed that 90% of plans would be unaffected, with limits being more generous than those of most Members of Congress. If health care costs continue to rise, more plans may fall under the tax over time. The excise tax approach in the Senate bill aims to discourage rising health care costs by taxing employer benefits at a 40% rate. The revenue estimates suggest that more plans may fall under the tax over time. The tax would be collected at the insurance-company level or health insurance plans' costs would be reduced, potentially impacting lower-income employees. The excise tax proposed in H.R. 3590 aims to address rising healthcare costs by taxing employer benefits at a 40% rate. Questions remain on how self-insured firms would be treated and if the tax would be deductible. The proposal would increase the HI payroll tax for high earners. The provision in H.R. 3590 increases Medicare funding by 0.9% for earnings over $200,000 for single individuals and $250,000 for joint filers, raising $86.8 billion. Employers collect the tax on income over $200,000, with employees responsible for any discrepancies. This tax targets high-income earners and is progressive, but does not apply to capital income. Health insurance provider fees generate $59.6 billion in revenue. Health insurance providers and medical devices contribute significant revenue through fees and excise taxes, totaling $106.3 billion from FY2010 through FY2019. The fees on branded drugs generate $22.2 billion, while medical devices contribute $19.2 billion. Fees for health insurance providers increase over time, reaching $10 billion annually, and medical device fees are set at $3 billion per year after 2017. The fee on branded drugs is $2.1 billion per year, while fees on insured and self-insured plans are smaller at $2.6 billion. These fees finance the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust fund and expire after September 31, 2019. The taxes could potentially increase prices, reduce producer profits, and be passed on to insurance companies and consumers. Fees for drug development aim to capture windfall from increased demand due to expanded health insurance coverage. Revenue collected through fixed amounts with shares based on sales. Medical device fee exempts devices under $100, excluding small items like pregnancy tests. Both medical device and branded drug fees have sliding scales to reduce impact on small producers. Total sales determine apportionment for medical device fees. For the medical device fee, sales over $5 million are apportioned with 50% counted between $5 million and $25 million. Drug fees vary from 0% to 100% based on sales ranges. Insurance premiums over $25 million have half included, and third-party administrators have amounts between $5 million and $10 million halved. The medical device fee excludes $5 million and half of amounts between $5 million and $10 million. Fees are not deductible. Imposing a fixed amount tax with apportionment creates a tax at the margin based on individual firm sales share. H.R. 3590 also imposes a 10% excise tax on indoor tanning facilities, raising $2.7 billion over 10 years. The final bill included a provision for a 10% excise tax on indoor tanning facilities, expected to raise $2.7 billion over 10 years. Additionally, there was discussion about taxing cosmetic producers, but this provision was not included in the bill. Nonprofit hospitals' tax-exempt status is based on meeting a \"community benefit\" standard, with concerns about charity care levels. A 2006 study found they provided slightly more charity care than for-profit hospitals, with federal tax exemptions estimated at $6 billion in 2002. In 2002, federal tax exemptions for nonprofit hospitals were valued at about $6 billion. Hearings were held by the Senate Finance Committee in 2006 and the House Ways and Means Committee in 2005 on the topic of charitable care and community benefits at nonprofit hospitals. Senator Grassley raised concerns in a staff discussion draft in 2007 regarding charity care, community benefits, asset conversion, and joint ventures at nonprofit hospitals. In 2007, Senator Grassley authorized a round-table to discuss a staff draft expressing concerns about nonprofit hospitals' charity care standards. An interim report by the IRS found that nonprofit hospitals spent an average of 7.4% of revenues on charity care. The proposal aims to establish specific standards for nonprofit hospitals to qualify for exempt status, including a community needs standard and a minimum level of charitable patient care. This could potentially increase charity care levels without significantly impacting revenues. Flexible spending accounts (FSAs) allow for tax reductions to fund certain benefits. Flexible spending accounts (FSAs) allow employees to opt for salary reduction to contribute to benefits, including health reimbursement arrangements. Concerns about FSAs include the \"use it or lose it\" nature of the plan, leading to excessive spending. Options for raising revenue include limiting contributions or eliminating them. The House and Senate bills limit health FSAs to $2,500 and index amounts by the CPI after 2011. Over-the-counter medication costs are not deductible for expenditures exceeding the 7.5% floor but are covered under health savings accounts. This provision aligns eligible spending for employer accounts with the itemized deduction rules. The House and Senate bills limit health FSAs to $2,500 and index amounts by the CPI after 2011. Expenditures on over-the-counter medication like aspirin would not qualify as tax-excludible expenses from these accounts. Individuals can deduct medical expenses above 7.5% of adjusted gross income, estimated to cost $10.7 billion per year. This provision is aimed at taxpayers with high medical costs relative to income, especially those without insurance or for uncovered costs like mental health care, dental care, and long-term care. It is claimed by about 12 million taxpayers, or 9% of tax returns. The medical expense deduction is claimed by about 12 million taxpayers, or 9% of tax returns. It tends to benefit middle-class taxpayers more than other itemized deductions. Higher-income groups claim a smaller percentage of the medical expense deduction compared to other itemized deductions. The deduction may incentivize individuals to forgo insurance and has an uneven subsidy. The Senate bill increases the floor for medical expense deduction to 10%, remaining at 7.5% for individuals aged 65 and older. Blue Cross and Blue Shield, along with other tax-exempt companies from 1986, are eligible for a special 25% deduction of claims and expenses exceeding surplus. They are also exempt from a rule on unearned premiums taxation. The 1986 tax provisions removed the tax exemption for Blue Cross and Blue Shield and other tax-exempt companies, replacing it with a special 25% deduction for claims and expenses exceeding surplus. This change was due to the perception that their activities were similar to commercial insurance. The tax benefit also benefits shareholders and other groups. The Obama Administration released a compromise proposal based on H.R. 3590, with modifications to the revenue provisions. The proposal includes a tax on high-cost health insurance plans, delaying its effective date to 2018 and raising the exemption amount to $27,500 for families and $10,200 for individuals. The Obama Administration's proposal modifies the tax on high-cost health insurance plans by raising the exemption amount to $27,500 for families and $10,200 for individuals. To offset the revenue loss, the proposal broadens the Medicare HI tax for high-income taxpayers, including a 0.9% increase on the HI tax rate to 2.35% for certain earners and a 2.9% assessment on unearned income for others. The President's compromise proposal includes revenue provisions for high-income earners, clarifying tax credits for certain byproducts and codifying the economic substance doctrine. It also reduces and delays the tax on high-cost insurance, resulting in a significant revenue decrease. The House passed the Senate bill, H.R. 3590, increasing revenue from $148.9 billion to $32 billion. The additional Medicare tax on high-income taxpayers' investment income raises revenue to $210.2 billion. Health insurance benefits paid by firms for employees are excluded from taxes. Health coverage can be provided through insurance or self-insurance, with employers paying claims. Employees may choose health coverage as part of a cafeteria plan. Deductible contributions can be made through health savings accounts (HSAs) and flexible spending accounts (FSAs), which can be excluded from taxable income. The Senate Finance Committee has considered capping the exclusion for employer-supplied health insurance. Some suggest eliminating the exclusion altogether, with options including a dollar limit based on a benchmark plan. The Advisory Panel on Tax Reform proposed a cap on employer exclusion for health insurance, which is the largest health-related income tax benefit. The employer exclusion is estimated to cost $132.7 billion in revenue loss in 2008, with additional tax revenue losses of $93.5 billion from excluding benefits from the payroll tax. The Urban Brookings Tax Policy Center estimated that capping health benefits would result in revenue losses of $144.8 billion in 2010, growing at an average of 8% per year. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimated the revenue effect of capping health benefits at $14 billion in 2010, $25 billion in 2011, and continuing to rise, which is about 10% of the total revenue lost. The revenue from capping health benefits is estimated to be about $25 billion in 2011, representing 10% of total revenue lost from tax exemptions. The amount raised depends on whether the cap is indexed and for what type of inflation. If not indexed, it could reach $226.5 billion in 2019, while indexing for general price inflation would result in $174.6 billion in 2019. Capping health benefits could raise significant revenue, with estimates ranging from $4.9 billion to $188.8 billion in 2019, depending on indexing and inflation rates. Caps need to be indexed to health price inflation for a steady revenue stream. The employer exclusion for health benefits has been criticized for favoring high-income employees and incentivizing the purchase of excessive insurance, leading to increased healthcare costs. Higher-income individuals benefit more from this exclusion due to their higher marginal tax rates. The payroll-tax exclusion benefits lower-income families more than higher-income families. Payroll taxes are flat rate taxes, with the Social Security portion subject to an income cap. Excluded income from health insurance benefits does not increase with income, as group plans provide the same coverage for everyone. The tax benefit from the payroll-tax exclusion is not expected to keep pace with income, suggesting that repealing the tax benefit would not necessarily be progressive. The tax effects as a percentage of income are highest in the middle income brackets, indicating a proportional tax change across much of the population. The tax effects of repealing the payroll-tax exclusion would be a proportional tax change across middle income brackets, with smaller burdens on lower- and higher-income taxpayers. The average tax increase cannot be directly tied to the size of the health insurance benefit package. The exclusion of employer-provided health insurance from taxes averages around 20% to 25%, resulting in excluded income of approximately $15,000. This exclusion helps reduce adverse selection in the health care market by balancing costs and participation. Concerns exist that altering tax subsidies may decrease employer participation in providing health insurance. A cap on tax subsidies could potentially address this issue. Imposing a cap on tax subsidies for employer-provided health insurance could address the issue of excessive purchasing of insurance without affecting coverage. However, determining includable income for tax purposes and assigning income to employees could lead to inequities and administrative burdens. Factors affecting the true economic costs of health insurance include geographic location, number of individuals covered, age, sex, health status, and plan generosity. Employer-provided health insurance costs are influenced by factors such as age, sex, health status, and plan generosity. Group characteristics can lead to implicit cost shifting, where the young may subsidize the old and small families may subsidize large ones. Varying insurance benefits by family size, age, and location are legitimate concerns, but varying by health status goes against the risk-sharing objective of insurance. Most proposals for health insurance consider variations by family coverage, not necessarily age. However, adjusting for age individually could lead to higher costs for older individuals, reflecting the benefits of insurance but burdening younger individuals with lower incomes. This could also shift the burden towards higher incomes, as older individuals tend to earn more. Adjusting for age in health insurance benefits could lead to higher costs for older individuals, burdening younger individuals with lower incomes and potentially discouraging their participation. Imputing income from health benefits without considering age may result in inequities across employees, with higher tax imputations for firms with more women, older employees, and less healthy workforce. Adjustments may be needed for characteristics like geographic location and firm size to address these disparities. The Senate Finance Committee is considering reformulating the exclusion of benefits included in income as a deduction, credit, or a combination of the two to equalize treatment across taxpayers of different incomes. This provision could be governed by rules similar to COBRA benefits, allowing for continuation of insurance on leaving a job. An alternative approach to equalizing treatment across taxpayers of different incomes is to restrict deductions for employers, reducing or eliminating deductions for insurance costs above a certain threshold. This would also generate revenue and discourage overly generous benefits. The Senate Finance Committee's report listed various health-related income tax expenditures, with the second-largest being the revenue loss from excluding Medicare benefits from income for tax purposes, estimated at $40.6 billion. Modifying this provision would pose administrative challenges and has not been included in the options. Additionally, the exclusion of medical benefits for military dependents and retirees was considered. The curr_chunk discusses the tax benefits of health savings accounts (HSAs) for individuals with high-deductible employer health plans. Contributions to HSAs are tax-deductible, with investment earnings and income not taxed if used for medical expenses. Contributions have a dollar cap, and distributions for non-medical purposes are subject to additional tax. The cost of foregone taxes due to HSAs is around $0.5 billion per year, expected to increase. The Finance Committee options paper discusses limiting contributions to HSAs under high deductible health plans and increasing penalties for non-medical uses, exacerbating adverse selection by attracting healthier individuals. The Senate Finance Committee proposal aims to limit contributions to HSAs for non-medical uses and include HSA contributions under a general employer cap. It addresses the uncertainty surrounding FICA tax exceptions for students, particularly medical residents. The Senate Finance Committee proposal aims to clarify regulations regarding educational institutions and study definitions, establish a dollar limit for exceptions, and extend Medicare coverage and taxes to all state and local employees. This provision would increase health insurance payroll taxes that finance Medicare, leading to higher Medicare costs in the future. The Senate Finance Committee proposal includes increasing Medicare costs by expanding coverage and imposing taxes on alcoholic and sugared beverages. Other suggestions include raising tobacco taxes, although this was recently increased to fund the state children's health insurance program. Alcoholic beverage taxes vary based on the type of beverage, with distilled spirits taxed at $13.50 per proof gallon. Alcoholic beverage taxes vary based on the type of beverage. Distilled spirits are taxed at $13.50 per proof gallon, equivalent to $0.21 per ounce of alcohol. Beer is taxed at $18 per barrel, around $0.10 per ounce of alcohol. Wine is taxed at $1.07 per gallon for table wine with 12.5% alcohol, amounting to $0.07 per ounce of alcohol. These taxes are levied per unit and have not been revised since 1991, with their real value decreasing over time due to inflation. The alcohol taxes, last revised in 1991, have not kept pace with inflation. Studies show that the external costs of alcohol exceed current taxes, unlike tobacco. Alcohol consumption is somewhat responsive to price changes and has health and accident-related consequences. Alcohol taxes are regressive, collecting a larger percentage of low-income individuals' income. Limited distributional data on federal excise taxes is available, with the latest from a 1990 study. Expenditures on alcoholic beverages as a percentage of income by quintile show the relative burden of alcohol taxes is more concentrated in lower income classes. The regressivity of alcohol taxes is higher in lower income classes due to the price disparity between expensive and inexpensive alcohols. This makes excise taxes more regressive than sales taxes. The proposal aims to increase taxes on alcohol, bringing them in line with distilled spirits. This change would result in higher taxes on beer and wine, making them more expensive for consumers. The proposal aims to increase alcohol taxes, aligning them with distilled spirits. This would result in higher taxes on beer and wine, making them more expensive for consumers. The tax on table wine at a 12.5% alcohol level would be $3.88 per gallon, with potential revenue increases of $5.7 billion per year. The proposal aims to increase alcohol taxes, resulting in higher prices for beer and wine. Price elasticity estimates suggest that consumption is not highly responsive to price, with elasticity values of 0.16 for beer, 0.58 for wine, and 0.39 for spirits. Overall elasticity for a proportional price change is 0.52. The proposal suggests increasing alcohol taxes, leading to higher prices for beer, wine, and spirits. Elasticity estimates indicate a slight decrease in consumption: 0.8% for beer, 4.7% for wine, and 0.6% for spirits. Older estimates were higher: 1.5% for beer, 8.1% for wine, and 2.2% for spirits. The proposal suggests imposing a tax on non-diet sweetened beverages, with estimates indicating it could raise significant revenue. However, the impact of these beverages on health and society costs has not been extensively studied. Some may argue against singling out this particular food source for taxation, as other unhealthy items could also be targeted. Taxes could be imposed on unhealthy items like candy, snacks, and fast food. Taxpayers can choose between a standard deduction or itemizing deductions, including state and local taxes, mortgage interest, charitable contributions, medical expenses, and casualty losses. The largest deductions are for mortgage interest and taxes, with income taxes making up almost 60% of the total. President Obama's tax proposals include capping the value of itemized deductions for the top two tax rates to 28%, which is expected to raise revenues by about $25 billion. Itemized deductions benefit only about one-third of taxpayers. The proposal to cap the value of itemized deductions for high-income taxpayers at 28% is expected to raise revenues by about $25 billion. This change would primarily affect taxpayers with incomes over $250,000, with the top 2% of incomes being targeted. High-income taxpayers, specifically those in the $500,000-and-over income class, account for around one-fifth of itemized deductions. The $500,000-and-above class contributes significantly to charitable contributions deductions, raising concerns about the potential impact on charitable giving. Several studies suggest a modest 1% reduction in charitable giving due to the limit on tax benefits. Higher-income individuals favor health, art, and education causes, which would be more affected by the limit. Excluding charitable deductions from the cap could mitigate this impact, sacrificing about one-quarter of deductions. President Obama proposes base-broadening provisions to increase compliance and reduce the tax gap, with revenues dedicated to financing health care reform. Burman suggests limiting all itemized deductions to 15%, projected to raise $141 billion in 2011. Excluding charitable deductions from the cap would sacrifice about one-quarter of the expected revenue gain. The tax provisions proposed by President Obama aim to increase compliance and reduce the tax gap, with revenues dedicated to financing health care reform. These provisions result in about $1 billion of revenue gain when fully in place. Another set of provisions raises around $5 billion to $6 billion per year, primarily through revisions in tax accounting methods and estate tax limitations. The largest revenue loss comes from restrictions on valuation discounts for family-owned assets for estate tax purposes. The tax provisions proposed by President Obama aim to increase compliance and reduce the tax gap, with revenues dedicated to financing health care reform. These provisions result in about $1 billion of revenue gain when fully in place. Other income tax provisions could potentially provide additional revenues, including rate increases, widening rate brackets, expanding the base, or increasing the tax rate on favored income items. Burman suggests reducing the indexing of the rate. Burman proposes reducing the indexing of rate brackets to CPI minus 1% to adjust for cost of living changes. This could raise $8 billion in 2010 and $50 billion in 2019, growing over time to help finance healthcare. Other suggestions include increasing the capital gains tax and taxing carried interest as ordinary income. The Treasury's \"Greenbook\" outlines revenue estimates for various tax reforms, including raising rates on capital gains and dividends ($5 billion), taxing carried interest as ordinary income ($3 billion), and repealing LIFO inventories ($6 billion). International tax reforms in the President's proposal could raise over $20 billion. Additional revenue could come from increasing payroll taxes. One option to increase revenue is by raising payroll taxes, either through rate increases or raising the earnings ceiling. Eliminating the Social Security earnings cap could also generate significant revenue. Alternatively, implementing a new revenue source like a value-added tax (VAT) or a carbon tax could raise substantial funds. Implementing a new revenue source like a value-added tax (VAT) or a carbon tax could raise substantial funds, but it comes with administrative compliance problems and may not be worth the costs if very large revenue sources are not desired. The carbon tax or cap and trade system would also be difficult to put into place quickly and involve important program issues. These taxes would also be regressive. Table A-1 compares revenue provisions in H.R. 3962 and H.R. 3590 with those enacted into law in P.L. 111-148 and P.L. 111-152."
