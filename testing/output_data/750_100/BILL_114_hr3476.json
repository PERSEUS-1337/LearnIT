    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\" is a condensed summary of the section's title and its purpose. The Act is titled the \"Prevent a Government Shutdown Act of 2015\" and was created in response to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which set spending caps and required deficit reduction through negotiations or sequestration. The Act aimed to avoid arbitrary cuts by encouraging lawmakers to find alternative solutions. Negotiations following the initial sequester in 2013 led to a two-year agreement setting higher levels of defense and non-defense discretionary spending for fiscal years 2014 and 2015. A similar agreement is needed to prevent deep budget cuts in the upcoming fiscal year starting on October 1, 2015. Senator John McCain and Representative Mac Thornberry are involved in the discussions. Senator John McCain and Representative Mac Thornberry have criticized the impact of defense spending cuts under sequestration, stating that it undermines the capabilities, readiness, morale, and modernization of the armed forces. Senior military leaders have testified that with defense spending at sequestration levels, they cannot execute the National Military Strategy. The impact of cuts on non-defense discretionary (NDD) spending is evident, affecting economic recovery, business growth, public health, education, oversight, scientific research, infrastructure, and emergency response efforts. NDD United, representing over 2,500 organizations, highlights the negative consequences of these self-imposed cuts. The sequester threatens emergency response efforts worldwide and impacts bills cutting funding for education, housing vouchers, and veterans affairs. It weakens defense, future investments, and harms vulnerable Americans, risking economic stability. Eliminating the sequester would boost GDP by 0.4% in 2016 and 0.2% in 2017, creating 500,000 jobs next year and 300,000 in 2017. Relief from the sequester would allow Congress to pass appropriations legislation on time, preventing a government shutdown. The 2013 Government shutdown cost the economy 120,000 private-sector jobs, shrunk GDP growth by 0.2% to 0.6%, resulted in 6.6 million days' worth of work lost, $500 million in visitor spending at national parks lost, $4 billion in delayed tax refunds, 6,300 children losing access to Head Start, and delayed food safety inspections. To prevent another Government shutdown and fund vital services for fiscal year 2016, immediate negotiations on a budget agreement are necessary. This should include raising discretionary spending caps for defense and non-defense, eliminating the non-defense sequester, and reducing the defense sequester. Congress should consider offsetting the cost of sequester relief with deficit reduction from closing special interest tax loopholes. It is crucial to provide sequester relief regardless of reaching an agreement on offsetting deficit reduction by closing special interest tax loopholes. Bipartisan, bicameral agreement reached on sequester relief. A bipartisan measure will be negotiated to increase discretionary spending limits for fiscal years 2016 and 2017, with provisions to reduce the deficit. Members will be appointed within one day of the Act's enactment. (b) Appointment of Members: The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Minority Leader of the House, Majority Leader of the Senate, and Minority Leader of the Senate will each appoint individuals to negotiate the measure described in subsection (a). \n(c) Approval and Consideration of Measure: The measure described in subsection (a) will be approved. The measure in subsection (a) requires approval from appointed individuals. If approved, it will be considered under specific procedures, with dates substituted as mentioned. SEC. 3. ALTERNATIVE ADJUSTMENT TO DISCRETIONARY SPENDING LIMITS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2016 AND 2017. If the measure described under section 2(a) is not enacted into law before October 1, 2015, the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 will be amended to adjust the Security and Nonsecurity Discretionary Spending Limits. This includes changing the dollar amounts to $559,600,000,000 and $573,393,000,000 in certain sections. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 will be amended to adjust discretionary spending limits for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. Adjustments made before the enactment of this Act by the Office of Management and Budget will have no force or effect.
