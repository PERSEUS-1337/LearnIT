    "content": "President Bush signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004, which included the Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies Appropriations bill. The total funding agreed upon was $89.8 billion, with an across-the-board rescission of 0.59%. An additional $1.1 billion was allocated for transportation and election reform projects. On November 21, 2003, Congress passed a continuing resolution for FY2004 funding, extending funding for programs to January 31, 2004. The Senate passed a bill recommending $91.0 billion for Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies, $5.1 billion more than requested. The House passed H.R. 2989 for FY2004 funding. The FY2004 Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies Appropriation bill, H.R. 2989, provides $85.8 billion. Key differences from the Administration request include an additional $4.4 billion in highway funding and the deletion of $3.4 billion for airport grants. Congress combined appropriations for the Department of Transportation and the Department of the Treasury starting in FY2004. Starting in FY2004, Congress is considering combining appropriations for the Department of Transportation, Department of the Treasury, Postal Service, Executive Office of the President, and General Government provisions into a single bill due to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security and reorganization of subcommittees. In FY2004, appropriations for various departments were combined into a single bill due to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. The United States Coast Guard, Transportation Security Administration, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, Customs Service, and United States Secret Service were transferred to DHS. Budget numbers were adjusted for comparison with previous years. The House divides its appropriation bill into six titles, while the Senate has a different division. The FY2003 Consolidated Appropriations Resolution (P.L. 108-7) included a 0.65% across-the-board rescission for the Departments of Transportation and Treasury. The FY2003 figures in this report reflect the rescission, differing slightly from the figures in P.L. 108-7. The Administration's FY2004 budget request for these departments is also discussed. The FY2004 budget request for the Departments of Transportation and Treasury, along with the Executive Office of the President and Related Agencies, was $85.9 billion, $740 million lower than the FY2003-enacted figure. The allocation of funding within the request is detailed in Table 2. The Senate divides the budget differently from the House, putting the Postal Service into the \"Related Agencies\" Title. The Postal Service appropriation has been subtracted from the Senate and Conference totals for Title V. During House deliberations on H.R. 2989, funding for two programs was struck on points of order. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 reduced transportation funding by $3.425 billion and $47 million for specific programs. Total funding in the bill dropped from $89.3 billion to $85.8 billion. The Department of Transportation and Department of the Treasury appropriations for FY1999-FY2003 were adjusted for comparison with FY2004 figures by subtracting and adding specific agencies. The Department of Transportation and Department of the Treasury appropriations for FY1999-FY2003 were adjusted for comparison with FY2004 figures by subtracting and adding specific agencies. FY2001 and FY2003 figures include across-the-board rescissions, while the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 contains an across-the-board rescission not reflected in these figures. The Administration's FY2004 budget proposed a DOT budget of $54.3 billion, 2.6% below FY2003's enacted level. The budget request aligned with TEA-21 and FAIR21 authorizing acts, with some proposed changes to highway and transit funding structure in line with the Administration's reauthorization proposal. The curr_chunk discusses the funding structure in line with the Administration's reauthorization proposal for the Department of Transportation appropriations. Figures from an FY2004 Transportation-Treasury Appropriations bill Conference Report Budget Authority table are provided, noting that totals may not always match the Administration's totals due to differing treatment of offsets. The curr_chunk discusses supplemental appropriations and funding actions for transportation programs. Funding for two programs was struck during House deliberations on H.R. 2989, reducing total transportation funding in the bill. These figures reflect an across-the-board rescission included in P.L. 108-7. The figures reflect a 0.65% rescission in P.L. 108-7 and do not include a 0.59% rescission in H.R. 2673. Additional funding of $52 million was added to the Essential Air Service program, bringing the total FY2004 funding to $102 million. $187 million was allocated for the Appalachian Development Highway System. Despite a $81 million decrease in FMCSA appropriation, Congress provided an extra $111.5 million for motor carrier safety grants. NHTSA's FY2004 request includes $100 million transferred from FHWA. NHTSA's FY2004 request includes $100 million transferred from FHWA, previously administered by NHTSA. Congress postponed Amtrak's repayment of a $100 million loan from DOT in FY2003 and FY2004. RSPA's total resources for FY2003 may be seen as $119 million, and for FY2004 as $132 million. Rescissions of unobligated previous years' contract authority are also noted. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004 provides the FAA with $13.93 billion in funding, a $440 million increase over the FY2003 enacted level. The FAA received funding of $13.5 billion in FY2004, slightly lower than the amounts proposed in the House and Senate bills. The majority of the increased funding would be used for Operations & Maintenance expenses, with no major new initiatives in the legislative proposals. Funding for the FAA primarily comes from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. In FY2004, the FAA received $13.5 billion in funding, with a focus on Operations & Maintenance expenses. The majority of funding comes from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, with a general fund contribution of $3.4 billion agreed upon by both the House and Senate for that year. The FY2004 Act raised the general fund contribution to $4.5 billion and allocated $7.5 billion for Operations and Maintenance spending. This funding split has been a key part of the annual FAA budget debate. The FY2004 Act increased funding for FAA personnel salaries and air traffic control system costs. The Facilities and Equipment budget saw a slight decrease to $2.91 billion, aligning with proposed spending cuts. The FY2004 Act increased funding for FAA personnel salaries and air traffic control system costs. The Facilities and Equipment budget saw a slight decrease to $2.91 billion. In spending proposed in both the House and Senate, a Senate proposal to transfer $100 million of F&E money to the Airport Improvement Program was dropped in Conference. Unobligated F&E funds of $30 million are subject to rescission in P.L.108-199. F&E funding is used primarily for capital investment in air traffic control and safety. There are no significant new F&E spending initiatives in P.L. 108-199, although the bill does include new funding direction through project earmarking. Research, Engineering, and Development (RE&D) expends $119.4 million in P.L. 108-199, slightly more than the House and Senate proposals. The Essential Air Service (EAS) program receives funding from user fees collected from foreign aircraft overflights. Despite an annual authorized funding level of $50 million, additional funding has been necessary from other sources. In FY2003, $102 million was provided for the EAS program, showing continued support in Congress. The FY2004 Act provides $102 million for the Essential Air Service (EAS) program, with $50 million from regular authorization and $52 million from the aviation trust fund. It rejects the overflight fee as the main funding source and includes a provision against a pilot cost-sharing program. This funding level opposes the Bush Administration's proposal to halve the EAS program size. The FY2004 Act maintains funding for the Essential Air Service program at $102 million, rejecting the Bush Administration's proposal to reduce its size. The Airport Improvement Program receives $3.425 billion in funding, $25 million above the Administration's request. The FY2004 Act recommended $20 million in AIP funds for the Small Community Air Service Program, with priority given to projects at 171 listed airports. However, during floor debate, the AIP provision was removed from the bill. The Senate-passed bill provided $3.5 billion for AIP, including a $100 million transfer from the facilities and equipment account. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 (P.L. 108-199) provides $3.4 billion for AIP grants, with a prohibition on using the funds for airport changes needed for bulk explosive detection systems. The Act does not include a $100 million transfer from the facilities and equipment account as in the Senate-passed bill. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 (P.L. 108-199) prohibits the use of AIP grants for certain airport improvements and a pilot program. The FHWA budget provides funding for the Federal-Aid Highway Program. The FHWA budget for FY2004 requested $30.2 billion, a decrease of $2.2 billion from the previous year. The proposed obligation limitation was set at $29.3 billion, with funding for exempt programs increased to $931 million. The budget aimed to continue FHWA's major programs while proposing some changes. The FY2004 FHWA budget requested $30.2 billion, a decrease of $2.2 billion from the previous year. It proposed a new $1.0 billion Infrastructure Performance and Maintenance initiative, distributing funds for \"ready-to-go\" projects addressing congestion and infrastructure conditions. States had to commit funds within six months, with reallocation for unobligated funds. On the revenue side, the budget aimed to redirect revenues from the 2.5 percent tax. The House-passed FY2004 Appropriations bill (H.R. 2989; H.Rept.108-243) proposed redirecting revenues from the 2.5 cents-per-gallon excise tax on gasohol to the highway trust fund, adding roughly $600 million to fund revenues. The bill allocated $34.6 billion for FHWA, $2.2 billion more than FY2003, with an obligation limitation of $33.4 billion. The Senate-passed FY2004 appropriations bill set the obligation limitation at $33.4 billion, $1.8 billion above FY2003 levels and $4.1 billion above the President's request. The total included exempt obligations of $931 million, with heavily earmarked federal-aid highway discretionary programs. The bill provided a total of $34.8 billion for FHWA, with an obligation limitation of $33.8 billion, roughly $500 million above the House bill. Earmarking for discretionary programs was also prominent in the Senate bill. The Senate-passed FY2004 appropriations bill directed $175 million for surface transportation projects earmarked in the report language. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 provided $34.7 billion for FHWA, slightly higher than the House total and slightly lower than the Senate total. This is an increase of more than 6% over the FY2003 enacted total and more than 12% over the Administration's budget request. The FY2004 appropriations bill allocated $33.8 billion for FHWA, similar to the House and Senate bills. The discretionary programs were heavily earmarked, including Interstate Discretionary, Bridge Discretionary, Ferry Boats, TCSP, National Corridor Planning, and CORBOR. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 earmarks funds for various programs including Interstate Maintenance, National Highway System, Surface Transportation, Congestion Mitigation, and Highway Bridge Replacement. This departure from traditional practice includes earmarking over $1 billion of unobligated core program funds, which were previously under state control. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 earmarks funds for various highway programs, including Interstate Maintenance and Highway Bridge Replacement. Projects are funded from state core program funds or STP funds. The federal share is 100%, a departure from past practice. Additionally, nearly $300 million in unobligated core formula funds can be used for Miscellaneous Highway and Highway Safety Programs. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 allocates nearly $300 million in unobligated core formula funds for interagency transfers and project earmarks. Most of the funds go to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Additional funds are provided for construction projects and Amber Alert grants. An extra $150 million is designated for the Appalachian Development Highway System. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 allocates $150 million for the Appalachian Development Highway System, adding 65 miles. TEA-21 Funding Framework is extended until April 30, 2004, with expectations of retaining existing program funding. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) continued existing highway and transit programs from its predecessor legislation, ISTEA. Key highway programs within FHWA include National Highway System, Interstate Maintenance, Surface Transportation Program, Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation, and Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) includes various highway funding programs such as National Highway System, Interstate Maintenance, Surface Transportation Program, Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation, and Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement. These programs are apportioned annually and not subject to program-by-program appropriation. Additionally, there are \"exempt\" funds for minimum guarantee funding and emergency relief, as well as \"allocated\" programs under direct control of FHWA or other governmental entities. The FMCSA, created in 2000 under the MCSIA, enforces federal motor carrier safety regulations for interstate operations. The FMCSA enforces federal motor carrier safety regulations for interstate commercial truck and bus operations, administers grants and programs for truck and bus safety activities, conducts inspections of Mexican-domiciled commercial drivers and vehicles entering the United States, advances Intelligent Transportation Systems, and reviews carriers transporting property and passengers. Funding for FMCSA activities comes from the federal Highway Trust Fund. The FMCSA receives funding from the federal Highway Trust Fund for administrative expenses, research, and financial assistance to states for truck and bus safety programs. The FY2004 Administration requested $447 million, an increase of $134 million from the previous year. The conference committee allocated $366 million for FY2004, with $176 million for administrative expenses and $190 million for safety grants and information systems. The conference agreement allocated $190 million for motor carrier safety grants and information systems, along with an additional $111.5 million for various other FMCSA programs. The budget for FMCSA's administrative and operations expenses in FY2004 was $176 million, including funds for research, technology, and regulatory development. Activities funded include enforcement to reduce unsafe carriers and drivers, and outreach efforts for education. The allocated funds support FMCSA activities such as enforcement, outreach, and establishing a medical review board. This includes rent, administrative infrastructure, personnel compensation, outreach efforts, and advancing truck and bus standards. The allocated funds support FMCSA activities including establishing a medical review board and funding agency information systems for motor carrier safety oversight. Grants are provided to states for the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program, covering up to 80% of enforcement costs. The Senate bill included $47 million for border inspection stations for trucks, while the conference agreement for FY2004 includes $170 million for the truck and bus safety program. An additional $20 million is allocated for information systems and safety initiatives, with $111.5 million for various initiatives such as southern border inspection facilities and CDL. NHTSA funding of $47 million supports border inspection facilities, $23 million for southern border operations grants, and $21 million for CDL improvement grants. The funding aims to improve traffic safety through behavioral and vehicle programs, reducing impaired driving, enhancing occupant protection, and ensuring compliance with federal safety regulations. Grants are also provided to states for highway traffic safety programs. The Administration requested $665 million for NHTSA in FY2004, an increase of $231 million from FY2003. $447 million was designated for traffic safety grants to states, focusing on occupant protection measures. The Administration requested $665 million for NHTSA in FY2004, with $447 million designated for traffic safety grants to states. $218 million was allocated for NHTSA's operations and research activities aimed at reducing highway fatalities and preventing injuries, including research on crash statistics, vehicle performance, occupant damage, and developing countermeasures for impaired driving. Testing of vehicles for compliance with safety standards and maintaining a database to track defects were also included in the funding request. The House, Senate, and conference agreement recommended funding amounts for NHTSA in FY2004. The Administration requested $1.09 billion for the FRA, with most funding going to Amtrak. In FY2004, the FRA received $1.455 billion in funding, with a majority allocated to Amtrak. The Administration requested $900 million for Amtrak, the House agreed to this amount, the Senate agreed to $1.346 billion, and the final funding provided was $1.225 billion. Additionally, $131 million was allocated for railroad safety and operations, and $35 million for railroad research and development. In FY2004, the FRA received $1.455 billion in funding, with a majority allocated to Amtrak. The President requested $35 million for railroad research and development, the House agreed to $28 million, the Senate agreed to $34 million, and the final funding provided was $34 million. For next generation high-speed rail, the President requested $23 million, the House agreed to $28 million, the Senate agreed to $29 million, and conferees agreed on $37 million. The debate on the FRA budget focuses on Amtrak, agency safety activities, Next Generation High-Speed Rail, and state funding for high-speed rail initiatives. The FRA received $131.2 million in FY2004 for railroad safety programs, a 13% increase from the previous year. The House and Senate approved slightly lower amounts, with the final funding settled at $130.8 million. The FRA received $131.2 million in FY2004 for railroad safety programs, with the final funding settled at $130.8 million. The funds are used for salaries, travel, training, and information systems monitoring safety performance in the rail industry. The goal is to reduce rail accidents, grade-crossing accidents, and hazardous materials incidents. Funding authority for the program expired in FY1998, but FRA's safety program continues using existing authorities. The FRA's safety program continues using existing authorities and funds provided by annual appropriations. Deliberations on funding and regulatory activities have not resulted in agreement since 1994. A reauthorization statute may affect budgets after FY2004. FRA conducts R&D on topics like employee fatigue and train movement control to improve railroad safety. The FRA conducts research on various safety topics, including railroad employee fatigue, train movement control, and track dynamics. The FY2003 DOT appropriation provided $29.1 million for the R&D program, with the Administration requesting $35 million for FY2004. The House Committee approved $28.2 million, the Senate approved $34.2 million, and the conferees recommended $34 million for R&D activities. This includes the Next Generation High-Speed Rail R&D program. The Next Generation High-Speed Rail R&D program received $34 million in funding. The House approved $28.3 million, while the Senate approved $29.3 million. The difference in funding amounts was largely due to support for establishing compliance of diesel multiple units with safety regulations. The Senate approved $29.3 million for passenger safety regulations, high-speed corridor planning, and maglev projects. The total funding provided in P.L. 108-199 was $37.4 million, combining various projects from the House and Senate bills. The President requested $900 million for Amtrak for FY2004, which was $150 million less than the previous year's appropriation and $900 million less than Amtrak's request. Amtrak expressed concerns about surviving FY2004 on $900 million. The House and Senate disagreed on funding for Amtrak in FY2004. The House agreed to $900 million, while the Senate approved $1.346 billion. Ultimately, P.L. 108-199 provided $1.225 billion for Amtrak and postponed repayment of a $100 million loan from DOT. P.L. 108-199 provides $1.225 billion for Amtrak in FY2004, postponing repayment of a $100 million loan from DOT. It also extends the funding structure and requires all Amtrak routes to be funded through grant requests. Additionally, the Secretary of Transportation is directed to establish a competitive bidding procedure for non-Amtrak operators on state-supported routes. If a state wishes to contract with a non-Amtrak operator, they may use Amtrak's equipment and services. If terms cannot be agreed upon, the Secretary of Transportation has the power to compel Amtrak. Beginning with Amtrak's FY2003 appropriation, Congress began stipulating in P.L 108-7 that funding would go to the Secretary of Transportation instead of directly to Amtrak. The Secretary then provides funding to Amtrak quarterly through grants, reducing Amtrak's discretion with federal funding. Congress also required Amtrak to submit a 5-year business plan in 2003. Amtrak submitted a 5-year business plan to Congress on April 25, 2003, requesting $1.6 billion annually for maintenance and addressing $6 billion in backlogged maintenance needs. The plan did not include network expansion. Two bills have been proposed to reauthorize Amtrak with funding of $2 billion annually for three years. The Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee approved a surface transportation safety bill, S. 1978, authorizing $2 billion annually for Amtrak for six years. Various bills have been introduced to change federal passenger rail policy, including a plan to shift planning and financial responsibility to states (S. 1501) and another plan giving more federal responsibility for passenger rail service (S. 1505). The government is considering plans to provide funding for Amtrak operations and capital improvements to the nation's passenger rail system. Senator Hollings and others have proposed authorizing $2 billion annually for 6 years for Amtrak and issuing $30 billion in bonds for rail network improvements. President Bush's FY2004 budget request for the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) remained at $7.226 billion, the same as the previous year. The FY2004 budget request for the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) remained at $7.226 billion, with proposed changes to FTA's program structure. The House agreed to $7.231 billion, the Senate to $7.305 billion, and P.L. 108-199 provides $7.309 billion. The proposed program changes are not reflected in the FTA appropriations due to the Administration's reauthorization proposal not being approved. The FTA Appropriation for FY2003-FY2004 was $677 million, with $70 million transferred from other FTA programs. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 included an across-the-board rescission of 0.59%. Source: http://www.marad.dot.gov. MARAD's mission is to promote the development of a U.S. merchant marine and administer programs benefiting U.S. vessel owners, shipyards, and crews. The President requested $219 million for MARAD in FY2004, with a total of $226.4 million provided by the Consolidated Appropriations Act. The MARAD budget for FY2004 is $226.4 million, slightly higher than the House passed bill and lower than the Senate passed bill. The focus is on the Maritime Guaranteed Loan Program, which provides loans for purchasing ships and modernizing shipyards to promote growth. The Administration has requested no funds for additional loans but $4.5 million for loan administration. The Administration has requested $4.5 million for the administration of existing loans in FY2004. Congress provided $25 million for the Maritime Guaranteed Loan Program in the Wartime Supplemental Appropriations bill. The DOT Inspector General called on MARAD to review loan applications more effectively and exercise rigorous financial oversight of borrowers. The DOT Inspector General recommended MARAD to review loan applications more effectively and exercise rigorous financial oversight of borrowers. An investigation was conducted due to the bankruptcy of American Classic Voyages, resulting in $367 million in bad loans for the construction of two cruise ships. The General Accounting Office also identified weaknesses in the Title XI program and made recommendations for improvement. MARAD cooperated with the IG's office in implementing management reforms in the program. The Administration requested $104.4 million for operations and training in the Title XI program, with specific allocations for the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, state maritime academies, and MARAD. The Consolidated Appropriations Act provided $107 million for operations and training. For the Maritime Security Program (MSP), the Administration requested $98.7 million, which was approved by Congress. MSP is a fleet of 47 privately-owned U.S. flag commercial ships. The Administration requested $11.4 million for the disposal of obsolete vessels in the National Defense Reserve Fleet (NDRF), which are raising environmental concerns due to hazardous substances. MARAD has until 2006 to dispose of over 130 surplus ships located in Virginia and California. The Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $16.2 million for ship disposal, with ships located on the James River in Virginia and in Suisan Bay, California. The Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) manages various operating entities and conducts a multimodal research program. The Administration requested a budget of $118 million for RSPA in FY2004, with most funding allocated for transportation safety activities. $67 million was proposed for the pipeline transportation safety program, and $25 million for the hazardous materials transportation safety program, aiming to enhance RSPA's ability in ensuring federal hazardous materials transportation pipeline safety. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended funding for RSPA in FY2004, with allocations for hazardous materials transportation safety and pipeline safety. The House approved $111.3 million, while the Senate approved $110.3 million for RSPA. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 provides $112.9 million for RSPA, including $23.7 million for hazardous materials transportation safety and $66.3 million for pipeline safety. The Treasury Department has historically performed four basic functions. The Treasury Department has historically performed four basic functions, including formulating economic policies, serving as the financial agent for the government, enforcing financial laws, and producing currency. The creation of the Department of Homeland Security in 2002 has significantly changed its functional profile. The Treasury Department, while still serving as a key economic policymaker and financial manager for the government, has a more limited role in law enforcement. It consists of departmental offices and operating bureaus, with the bureaus primarily responsible for specific duties and financial responsibilities. The Treasury Department's bureaus can be categorized into those with financial responsibilities and those involved in law enforcement. The Comptroller of the Currency, U.S. Mint, Bureau of Engraving and Printing, and others handle financial tasks, while law enforcement is carried out by agencies like the BATF, U.S. Secret Service, and IRS. The Treasury Department's bureaus are divided into financial and law enforcement responsibilities. The IRS is unique as it handles both financial duties and law enforcement through federal tax laws. The establishment of DHS has reduced the Department's law enforcement involvement, transferring agencies like the Secret Service and Customs Service to DHS. Additionally, the Treasury Forfeiture Fund and BATF functions were moved to the DOJ. A new bureau was created in January 2003 to oversee alcohol and tobacco laws. The Treasury Department oversees laws on alcohol and tobacco, previously handled by BATF. Its main duties include collecting excise taxes and enforcing tax laws. The Bush Administration requested $11.408 billion in funding for FY2004 to strengthen IRS efforts for tax compliance. The FY2004 budget aimed to enhance IRS compliance, streamline operations, and combat money laundering and terrorism financing. IRS accounted for 91.5% of the Treasury budget, with additional funding for FinCen and international assistance programs. The FY2004 budget included an additional $4 million for the Department's International Technical Assistance program to help countries improve economic governance. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration was proposed to merge with the Office of Inspector General. The House Committee on Appropriations approved $11.273 billion in funding for Treasury operations in FY2004, $423.5 million more than FY2003. The House Committee on Appropriations approved $11.273 billion in funding for Treasury operations in FY2004, which was $423.5 million more than FY2003. The funding provided by H.R. 2989 was $70 million less than the Bush Administration's request, with significant differences in funding allocations for IRS operations. The House Committee on Appropriations approved $8.9 million more in funding for Treasury's departmental offices than the Administration had requested. Most of the increase was allocated to administrative costs related to the transfer of functions to the DHS, as well as funding for the Office of International Affairs and the new Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes. H.R. 2989 also rejected the Administration's proposal to combine OIG and TIGTA, adding $1.7 million to OIG's budget for FY2003. The House approved additional funding for Treasury's departmental offices, rejecting the proposal to combine OIG and TIGTA. The bill added $1.7 million to OIG's budget for FY2003 and $3.8 million to TIGTA's budget for FY2003. It matched the Administration's requested funding for FinCen in FY2004. The full House approved the measure by a vote of 381 to 39 on September 9, 2003, after considering various amendments. The House rejected an amendment to divert $75 million in savings to improve compliance among business taxpayers and another amendment to prevent the Treasury Department from assisting in overturning a judicial ruling in the Cooper v. IBM case. The amendments failed by votes of 219 to 192 and were introduced by Representative Bernie Sanders. The IRS proposed regulations on age-discrimination in pension plans, with concerns that IBM could benefit from them. The House passed an amendment on funding levels for Treasury offices. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a bill providing $11.196 billion in funding for the Treasury Department in FY2004, which was less than the amount requested by the Bush Administration and approved by the House. The difference was mainly due to a smaller recommended budget for IRS operations. S. 1589 provided less funding for IRS operations compared to the Administration's request, including $26 million less for tax processing and $79 million less for IRS information systems. It also proposed merging IRS accounts, resulting in a $55 million drop in recommended funding for tax law enforcement and EITC compliance. Additionally, S. 1589 allocated nearly $8 million more for Treasury's departmental offices, with a significant portion going to the Office of International Affairs. The Senate Appropriations Committee opposed the merger of the OIG and TIGTA into a new office due to their different duties and responsibilities. Instead, they recommended increased funding for OIG by $1.6 million and for TIGTA by $3.8 million in FY2004. The bill matched the Administration's recommended increase in funding for FinCen of $6.1 million to manage new responsibilities under the USA Patriot Act of 2001. FinCen gains status as a Treasury Department bureau with primary responsibility for enforcing regulations against money laundering and collecting information for anti-terrorism investigations. The Senate passed the bill by a vote of 93 to. The Senate passed an amendment requiring the IRS to study a pilot program for EITC pre-certification, along with another amendment to prevent something. The Senate passed an amendment by Sen. Tom Harkin to prevent the Treasury Department from implementing a new regulation allowing companies to convert pension plans. Differences in appropriations for the Treasury Department between the Senate and House versions of H.R. 2989 were related to IRS funding. A conference was agreed upon to resolve the discrepancies, leading to an agreement submitted for approval on November 12, 2003. The agreement for Treasury Department funding in FY2004 totaled $11.166 billion, $317 million more than FY2003. The funding was less than the Bush Administration's request, House and Senate approvals, with most differences related to IRS funding. Treasury departmental offices would receive $176.1 million, capital investment programs $36.4 million, and the Office of Inspector General $13 million. The Treasury Department funding for FY2004 totaled $11.166 billion, with allocations for various programs including capital investment, Office of Inspector General, TIGTA, Air Transportation Stabilization Program, Treasury Building Repair Fund, FinCen, Financial Management Service, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Bureau, Bureau of Public Debt, and IRS. The House and Senate agreed to include the funding in an appropriations bill (H.R. 2673) covering seven separate bills. The report on H.R. 2673 included the conference agreement on H.R. 2989 and imposed a 0.59% cut on discretionary spending. The House and Senate approved the conference report, and President Bush signed it into law as P.L. 108-199. The IRS levies various taxes and fees.

This appropriation is $2 million less than the amounts provided in FY2002 and FY2003 and considerably less than the $45 requested by the President for FY2004. The e-gov fund for FY2004 was allocated $3 million, a compromise between the Senate and House initial approvals. This amount is considerably less than the $45 requested by the President and $2 million less than previous years. The fund is administered by the Administrator of General Services as a GSA account. The Electronic Government Fund is administered by the Administrator of General Services as a GSA account to support approved projects. Transfers of funds to federal agencies require a spending plan and justification submitted to the Committees on Appropriations. Funding for the fund was a contentious issue between the President and Congress in FY2003 and FY2002. The Blueprint proposed a 10-year budget plan with an electronic government account seeded with $10 million in 2002, growing to $100 million over three years to support interagency e-gov initiatives. The fund, managed by OMB, would facilitate projects across agency boundaries and implement digital signatures for secure online communications.

The e-gov fund was increased to $20 million by the Bush Administration to support interagency projects for electronic information and services implementation. Congress appropriated $5 million for the fund for FY2002, with transfers to federal agencies requiring a proposed spending plan and project justification. The administration was recommended to work with the House Committee on Government Reform and the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs to clarify the fund's authorization status. The President's budget for FY2003 recognized GSA as the operator of the official federal portal for providing citizens with one-stop access to federal services via the Internet or telephone. The Administration sought $45 million for the e-gov fund, a significant increase over the previous year's request. The budget acknowledged the support of specific project plans developed by the Quicksilver Task Force for 23 high priority Internet services. The Administration requested $45 million for the e-gov fund to support projects under the Government Paperwork Elimination Act. House appropriators recommended $5 million for the fund and required a spending plan and justification for each project before transferring funds to federal agencies. The House Committee declined to recommend an appropriation for the e-gov fund as a GSA account but funded it under the Office of Management and Budget. Senate appropriators recommended the full $45 million, but final funding was only $5 million as provided by P.L. 108-7. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) is responsible for preserving historically valuable records of the federal government since 1934. NARA also administers presidential libraries, publishes laws and documents, and assists with federal security classification and declassification policy.

The budget includes funds for employee and managerial development opportunities and compliance with the Accountability of Tax Dollars Act of 2002. The MSPB is no longer requesting funds from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Trust Fund for adjudication of Civil Service Retirement appeals, as recommended by OMB to simplify financial record keeping. The budget submission for fiscal year 2004 includes a total appropriation of $35,503,000. The MSPB is no longer requesting funds from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Trust Fund for adjudication of Civil Service Retirement appeals. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations recommended an appropriation of $32.9 million, $2.6 million less than the President's request. Up to $2.6 million for administrative expenses could be transferred from the Trust Fund. The conferees agreed to the trust fund transfer instead of a direct appropriation as requested by the President. The House committee report accompanying H.R. 2989 recommended a decrease in funds for the MSPB from the President's request. The budget authority for current appropriations for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is discussed, with a focus on administering personnel functions and developing merit-based systems. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is responsible for administering personnel functions and developing merit-based human resources management systems to support agency missions. It consists of divisions that design and implement human resources policies, assist agencies with human capital strategies, and provide various human resources services to federal agencies. The Office of Inspector General (OIG) conducts audits, investigations, evaluations, and inspections throughout the agency and may issue administrative sanctions related to the operation of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. The President's FY2004 budget proposed an appropriation of $18.0 billion for OPM, including discretionary funding for salaries and expenses, OIG salaries and expenses, and mandatory funding for government payments for annuitants of the employees health benefits program and employee life insurance program. The President's FY2004 budget proposed an appropriation of $18.0 billion for OPM, including government payments for annuitants of the employee life insurance program and civil service retirement and disability fund. Trust fund transfers were also included for salaries, expenses, and OIG salaries. The requested $118.7 million for salaries and expenses includes funds for information technology support and e-Government initiatives. The FY2004 budget for OPM includes $4.5 million for e-Government projects and $2.5 million for program evaluation. The budget also allocates funds for more audit staff and special agents to reduce the audit cycle and increase annual recoveries. The budget request is 8.8% higher than the previous year's appropriation. The FY2004 budget for OPM includes appropriations for salaries and expenses, OIG salaries and expenses, government payments for annuitants, and payments to the civil service retirement and disability fund. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended an appropriation of $119.498 million for salaries and expenses. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended an appropriation of $119.498 million for salaries and expenses, including funding for the enterprise human resources integration project, modernizing federal payroll systems, program evaluation, and performance measurement. The Committee also recommended the same amounts as the President's request for OIG salaries and expenses, government payments for annuitants, and payments to the civil service retirement and disability fund. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended an appropriation of $126.9 million for salaries and expenses, including funding for the enterprise human resources integration project and modernizing federal payroll systems. Additionally, $14.4 million was recommended for OIG salaries and expenses. The Committee also directed OPM to provide additional funding for the 'retirement readiness' project in collaboration with InFRE. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended funding for OPM projects, including the enterprise human resources integration project and modernizing federal payroll systems. Additionally, OPM was directed to provide funding for the 'retirement readiness' project in collaboration with InFRE. OPM was also urged to certify that transferring DSS functions will not impact its current caseload and to report on project progress within 60 days. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended funding for OPM projects, including the enterprise human resources integration project and modernizing federal payroll systems. OPM was directed to conduct an outside audit to determine the true cost of mandated services under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) and promptly submit a report to the Committee. Additionally, OPM was directed to consider including Hampshire and Hampden counties in Massachusetts into the Hartford Locality Pay Area. The Committee also directed OPM to conduct a study to determine the number of Federal employees and retirees eligible for FEHBP but not covered by any health insurance program, the reasons for not obtaining health insurance, and the agencies where these individuals are employed. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended and passed the same appropriations as the President requested, with salaries and expenses allocated as recommended by the House Committee. $36.7 million would be available for automating retirement recordkeeping systems. The Committee addressed OPM's program in its report accompanying S. 1589. The Committee addressed OPM's ongoing program to modernize its retirement system, recommending OPM to seek guidance from GAO. Quarterly meetings with GAO on IT modernization progress were not held as directed, leading to ongoing issues with the project. The Committee directs GAO to conduct a comprehensive audit on the ongoing problems and mismanagement of the modernization project. The law provides an appropriation of $119.498 million for salaries and expenses. OPM is directed to consider including Franklin, Hampshire, and Hampden Counties in Massachusetts in the Hartford, CT pay area. Senator Grassley's amendment (No. 1949) in the Hartford, CT pay area prohibits funds from being used to implement OPM regulations reducing detailee time in Congress to 6 months. The President's FY2004 budget proposed a $500 million Human Capital Performance Fund to create performance-driven pay systems for employees. This fund aims to reinforce the value of employee performance management systems. The regulation limiting activities of executive branch employees under Congressional supervision is deemed unacceptable. The President's FY2004 budget proposed a $500 million Human Capital Performance Fund to create performance-driven pay systems for employees. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended an appropriation of $2.5 million, $497.5 million less than the President's request. Funding is contingent upon legislation authorizing the creation of the fund within OPM. The creation of the fund within OPM is contingent upon legislation approval. The OPM Director must notify relevant subcommittees of jurisdiction of the approval of a performance pay plan for an agency before funds are available. The Committee directs OPM to report annually on approved performance pay plans and funds obligated or transferred. The Senate did not recommend or pass an appropriation for the fund. The Committee recommends budgeting and administering the initiative within individual agencies. An appropriation of $1 million is provided, but funds cannot be used until legislation establishes the fund within OPM. The OPM Director must approve an agency's performance pay plan before funds can be transferred. The Director may transfer funds to federal agencies for fund purposes. The Office of Special Counsel (OSC) investigates federal employee allegations of prohibited personnel practices, enforces the Hatch Act, and provides a channel for whistleblowing. The President's FY2004 budget proposed a $13.5 million appropriation for the OSC, a 9.2% increase from FY2003. The budget for the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) in FY2004 was $13.5 million, a 9.2% increase from FY2003. The funding aimed to reduce case processing backlogs and included additional staff for the Hatch Act and Disclosure Units. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations recommended and passed the same appropriation as requested by the President. The report also briefly discussed general provisions related to government-wide policies like the Buy America Act and drug-free federal initiatives. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004, includes provisions related to the Buy America Act, drug-free federal workplaces, and authorizing agencies to pay GSA bills for space renovation and other services. These provisions may relate to specific agencies or programs and are new or contain modified policies. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 includes provisions related to the Buy America Act, drug-free federal workplaces, and authorizing agencies to pay GSA bills for space renovation and other services. The bill also contains general provisions specific to agencies and accounts, with the Administration proposing language for government-wide general provisions in the Appendix. Congress has chosen to reiterate existing language rather than placing provisions in permanent law, with the Administration recommending dropping several provisions. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 includes a 4.1% pay increase for federal white collar employees retroactive to January 1, 2004, which includes a 2% adjustment. This increase is based on the Federal Pay Comparability Act of 1990. The pay adjustment for federal civilian personnel in January 2003 was 4.1%, with a base pay adjustment of 3.1% and an additional 1% increase for the General Schedule. The adjustment is based on changes in private sector salaries reflected in the Employment Cost Index. In January 2003, federal civilian personnel received a 4.1% pay adjustment, with a 3.1% base pay increase and an additional 1% increase for the General Schedule. In January 2004, the President proposed a 2.0% pay increase, with an alternative plan for a 1.5% increase in basic pay and a 0.5% increase in locality pay. Congress had not finalized legislation on pay rates, so the President's plan went into effect. The FY2004 budget resolution included a provision for civilian and military pay parity, with a proposed 4.1% pay increase for civilian employees in January 2004. The increase would be split between basic and locality pay at the President's discretion, as outlined in the pending Consolidated Appropriations, 2004. The 4.1% pay increase for civilian employees in FY2004 will be split with 2.7% for basic pay and 1.4% for locality-based payments. The Federal Wage System (FWS) compensates federal blue-collar workers at local prevailing rates. The Federal Wage System adjusts wages in 130 areas based on labor costs and compensation in the private sector. Congress limits adjustments to prevent FWS wages from exceeding General Schedule salaries in high-cost areas. Lower cost area wages increase based on surveys, while high-cost area wages are capped. Monroney Amendment extended to Department of Defense personnel by P.L. 107-117. The Monroney Amendment extended the survey application to Department of Defense personnel. Changes to Senior Executive Service salaries were enacted under the National Defense Authorization Act for 2004, setting their rates at a minimum of $103,700 and capping them at Level II of the Executive Schedule. The Administration's FY2004 pay proposal includes a 2% across-the-board increase and a $500 million fund for rewarding top-performing individuals with permanent base pay increases. The minimum rate of pay is $103,700 and the maximum is $145,600, with a maximum of $158,100 for those in agencies with certified performance appraisal systems. The pay adjustment for Members of Congress, Judges, and other federal officials is scheduled to be 2.2% effective January 2004, but was limited to 1.5% until the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 was passed. The full adjustment of 2.2% will be retroactive. The Senate voted to table an amendment denying a pay increase for Members of Congress, which would not affect other officials. Pay adjustments for federal officials are based on ECI calculations, with a 2.2% adjustment scheduled for January 2004. However, the adjustment is limited to 1.5% until final action on the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004. The annual pay increase for federal officials, including judges, is adjusted based on ECI calculations. The adjustment rate was temporarily set at 1.5% pending final action on the Consolidated Appropriations bill. Unlike Members of Congress and executive branch officials, judges require specific authorization for their pay increase. P.L. 108-167 was enacted for the January 2004 adjustment. The judges have never received lower adjustments than other officials. The President's salary was increased to $400,000 per year in 2001, up from $200,000 since 1969. Former Presidents receive a pension equal to Cabinet Secretaries' pay rate. The Federal Employees Compensation Act provides workers' compensation benefits for Federal employees injured on the job. The Federal Employees Compensation Act provides workers' compensation benefits for Federal employees injured on the job. The Administration proposed changes to charge administrative costs to each employing agency, aiming to make agencies bear the full cost of their employees' claims. The Administration proposed changes to charge administrative costs to each employing agency under the Federal Employees Compensation Act, aiming to make agencies bear the full cost of their employees' claims. The surcharge would be around 3.5% of benefit costs, with the majority paid by the U.S. Postal Service and the Defense Department. The Administration supported competitive sourcing in H.R. 2989, but objected to an amendment that could hinder it. The President's advisers threatened a veto if the bill included a prohibition on funding for public-private competitions. The Office of Management and Budget successfully altered or removed some competitive sourcing provisions in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004. The OMB altered competitive sourcing provisions in H.R. 2673, Section 647(a), which is part of the President's Management Agenda. The OMB changed competitive sourcing provisions in H.R. 2673, Section 647(a) of P.L. 108-199. It requires agencies to develop a plan for a most efficient organization (MEO) for competitions involving more than 10 federal employees. The OMB changed competitive sourcing provisions in H.R. 2673, Section 647(a) of P.L. 108-199, requiring agencies to develop a plan for a most efficient organization (MEO) for competitions involving more than 10 federal employees. However, the time needed to complete an MEO may hinder agencies from meeting the circular's 90-day deadline for streamlined competitions. Additionally, Section 647(a) would also necessitate consideration of the conversion differential in streamlined competitions, which is not typically used under Circular A-76. The OMB changed competitive sourcing provisions in H.R. 2673, Section 647(a) of P.L. 108-199, requiring agencies to develop a plan for a most efficient organization (MEO) for competitions involving more than 10 federal employees. However, the time needed to complete an MEO may hinder agencies from meeting the circular's 90-day deadline for streamlined competitions. Additionally, a new provision concerning the application of the conversion differential in streamlined competitions would take precedence, directing the competitive sourcing official to consider the cost of contractor performance compared to the agency's costs. The criteria for this comparison are not specified. The cost of contractor performance is being evaluated to determine if it is more cost-effective for the agency. There is uncertainty about how a performance decision, involving a streamlined competition form, could consider the conversion differential. The circular and Section 647(a) apply to standard competitions, with the more stringent requirement for standard competitions found in the circular. Agencies are required to add the conversion differential to the cost of the non-incumbent's performance on the standard competition form. The non-incumbent's performance cost on the standard competition form is required by Circular A-76. Section 647(b) mandates executive agencies to submit annual reports to Congress on competitive sourcing activities, including completed competitions, costs, savings, and projected FTEs for the next fiscal year. The agency is required to report on competitive sourcing activities, including costs, savings, projected FTEs, and decision-making process. However, the absence of a defined methodology for collecting this information may reduce its usefulness and increase costs. Agency reports could inform OMB policy and agency decisions under Section 647(c). The provision under Section 647(c) allows agency heads to issue letters of obligation to MEOs without limiting the performance period to five years. This could lead to less frequent recompetitions as per Circular A-76, potentially impacting government agencies and private sector sources differently. Contractors winning public-private competitions are subject to recompetition under FAR, while agencies have more flexibility in writing letters of obligation. Allowing agencies to write letters of obligation with performance periods longer than five years could help address recruitment and retention concerns among federal government employees. Section 647(d) permits agency heads to use funds for monitoring activities after public-private competitions, potentially enhancing oversight efforts. Section 647(e) prohibits moving work converted to contractor performance outside the United States if previously done by federal government employees within the country. This provision may impact contractors' ability to submit competitive bids, especially in industries with high labor costs. The provision in the FY2004 Transportation-Treasury appropriations bill aims to prevent funds from enforcing restrictions on travel or travel-related transactions. This could impact competitive bids and job retention in the United States. The FY2004 Transportation-Treasury appropriations bill dropped provisions related to Cuba from the House version of the bill, including restrictions on remittances and educational exchanges. The White House threatened to veto any legislation that weakened economic sanctions against Cuba. The FY2004 Transportation-Treasury appropriations bill removed provisions related to Cuba, including sanctions, from the House version. The White House warned of a potential veto if the bill weakened economic sanctions against Cuba, which have been in place since the 1960s to isolate the Communist government of Fidel Castro. Sanctions on financial transactions with Cuba, including those related to travel, are set forth in the Cuban Assets Control Regulations (CACR), administered by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). Cuba sanctions have been controversial in recent years, with initiatives in the 108th Congress to lift or ease restrictions. The overall objective of U.S. policy toward Cuba is to bring democracy and respect for human rights to the island, with differing opinions on how to achieve this. Some advocate maximum pressure on the Cuban government until reforms are enacted, others argue for lifting some U.S. sanctions believed to hurt the Cuban people, and still others call for swift normalization of U.S.-Cuban relations by lifting the embargo. House-approved H.R. 2929 had provisions to prevent funds from enforcing travel and remittance restrictions, and eliminating the people-to-people educational exchanges category. Restrictions on travel to Cuba have been a contentious issue in U.S. efforts to isolate the country. While the embargo regulations do not ban travel, restrictions on financial transactions have effectively resulted in a travel ban. Certain categories of travelers, such as U.S. government officials, journalists, and those with close relatives in Cuba, can travel under a general license without needing special permission from OFAC. H.Amdt. 375, approved by a vote of 227-188, aimed to prevent funds from enforcing travel restrictions. Certain categories of travelers, including U.S. government officials, journalists, and individuals with close relatives in Cuba, can travel to Cuba under a general license. Supporters of the Flake amendment argue that U.S. policy towards Cuba restricts the rights of ordinary Americans to travel freely, which could help promote the idea of freedom in Cuba. Opponents of the amendment argued that not enforcing travel restrictions to Cuba would provide the Cuban government with tourist receipts while cracking down on democracy activists. H.Amdt. 377 (Delahunt) aimed to prevent funds from enforcing restrictions on remittances, becoming section 746 of the House bill. In March 2003, OFAC announced amendments to Cuba travel regulations allowing travelers to visit. OFAC announced amendments to Cuba travel regulations, allowing travelers to carry up to $3,000 in remittances. Supporters argued for no limit on financial support to Cuban families, while opponents feared more money going to the Cuban regime through inflated prices at government-owned stores. H.Amdt. 382 (Davis) aimed to preserve people-to-people educational exchanges. In March 2003, OFAC tightened Cuba travel regulations, eliminating people-to-people educational exchanges unrelated to academic coursework. Some groups supported the restriction, seeing it as a way to prevent unrestricted travel, while others criticized the decision, arguing that it limited ordinary people from traveling and exchanging with counterparts on the island. On October 23, 2003, the Senate approved S.Amdt. 1900 (Dorgan) to prevent funds from enforcing restrictions on Cuba travel. The provision was similar to the Flake amendment in the House version, with a minor difference in the effective date. The provision to ease U.S. sanctions policy toward Cuba would take effect one day after enactment of the bill. Momentum behind legislative proposals was impacted by Cuba's human rights crackdown in 2003. The House-approved Cuba amendments to H.R. 2989 had less support compared to similar amendments in 2002. The Flake amendment to H.R. 2989 was approved by a vote of 227-188, while a similar Flake amendment to the FY2003 Treasury Department appropriations bill had been approved by a vote of 262-167.

Transportation is function 400 in the annual unified congressional budget. The Department of Transportation (DOT) budget is funded mainly by transportation trust funds and federal Treasury general funds. Trust funds, such as the highway trust fund and airport trust fund, are funded by specific taxes. In FY2002, trust funds accounted for over two-thirds of federal transportation spending. Highway and transit funding make up the majority of DOT appropriations, with contract authority from the highway trust fund. This allows for funds to be automatically available at the start of each fiscal year for project obligations. During the 105th and 106th Congresses, legislation changed the relationships between transportation trust funds and the federal budget, linking annual highway program spending directly to revenue collections. Highway and transit funding, primarily from the highway trust fund, provide contract authority for project obligations at the start of each fiscal year. The legislation (P.L. 105-178) established a \"firewall\" around highway and transit funding by linking annual spending to revenue collections. Additional funds can be provided through Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA) based on increased trust fund revenues. TEA-21 changed the role of appropriations committees in determining annual spending levels for highway and transit programs by establishing obligations adjusted by an annual RABA computation. This adjustment prevented a significant drop in highway obligational funding for FY2003. TEA-21 limits the authority of House and Senate appropriations committees to change spending levels for specific programs. FY2000 and FY2001 appropriations acts attempted to regain some discretion over highway spending by redistributing funds and adding earmarked projects. The FY2001 Act redirected funding between programs and provided additional funding for some TEA-21 programs. The FY2002 Act saw major redistributions of RABA funds and transfers to agencies not eligible for RABA funding under TEA-21. The FAIR21 guarantees FAA program spending, but differs significantly from TEA-21 in budget categories. The FAIR21 guarantee relies on two point-of-order rules for the House and Senate, leading to increased spending on aviation programs for FY2001 and FY2002. However, FAIR21 guarantees are considered weaker than TEA-21. Congress can waive points-of-order, giving transportation appropriators control over spending for TSA, Coast Guard, and Federal Railroad Administration. Transportation budgeting for TSA, Coast Guard, Federal Railroad Administration, and smaller DOT agencies is a concern in constrained budgetary environments. The process involves budget authority and contract authority, with the latter providing obligational authority for trust fund-financed programs like the federal-aid highway program. Changes in spending were previously achieved through the appropriations process before TEA-21. The annual transportation budget component was achieved by combining changes in budget/contract authority and placing limitations on obligations to control outlays in line with congressional budget agreements. Contract authority allows funds to be automatically available to states at the beginning of each fiscal year without the need for appropriations legislation. Appropriations are required for outlays at a future date. TEA-21 limited the role of appropriations in highway and transit programs by setting obligations levels for FY1999 through FY2003. States pay for projects upfront and receive federal payments only after completion, leading to obligated funds in the trust fund. Trust fund balances remain high due to funds set aside for current and future commitments in the highway and transit accounts. These commitments include payments for completed projects and outstanding obligations for future projects. Additionally, there are unobligated amounts dedicated to projects that have not been assigned yet. The distribution of contract authority funds to states and programs involves apportionments for formula-driven programs and allocations for programs under direct federal control. Apportionments are for state distribution, while allocations are for federal agency, state, tribe, or other governmental entity distribution. These terms provide a frame of reference but do not relate to the federal budget process. The terms apportionments and allocations are used in the distribution of contract authority funds for highway programs. Recipients may mistakenly think state apportionments are part of the federal budget process."
