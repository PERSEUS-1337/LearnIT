    "content": "Following the September 11th terrorist attacks, the number of non-U.S. citizens enrolling in U.S. colleges and universities slowed due to tightened visa policies and global competition. However, a 2009 report showed an 8.0% increase in foreign-born students for the academic year 2008-2009, with significant growth from students in China. The new foreign student enrollment for the academic year 2008-2009 increased by approximately 16.0% from the previous year, attributed to recruitment efforts and improved visa processing. There are differences in enrollment by institution type, study level, and disciplines, with notable variations in the origin of students. India, China, and South Korea were among the top countries of origin for foreign students in the United States. In 2006, foreign students from China, South Korea, Canada, Japan, Taiwan, Mexico, Turkey, Vietnam, and Saudi Arabia accounted for the top ten percentages. The top fields of study for foreign students were business, engineering, physical and life sciences, social sciences, mathematics, computer sciences, health professions, fine and applied arts, English language, humanities, education, and agriculture. Foreign students earned a significant percentage of doctorate degrees in the sciences and humanities. In 2006, foreign students earned a significant percentage of doctorate degrees in the sciences and engineering, with temporary resident status students consistently earning the majority of these degrees. In 2006, foreign students earned a significant percentage of doctorate degrees in the sciences and engineering, with temporary resident status students consistently earning the majority of these degrees. Foreign students were awarded a high percentage of doctorates in physical sciences, mathematics, and computer sciences, with increases in each field compared to 2005. In 2006, foreign students earned a significant percentage of doctorate degrees in various fields, with increases in physical sciences, mathematics, and computer sciences compared to 2005. The earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences, as well as agricultural and biological sciences, awarded a high percentage of degrees to foreign-born students. The NSF provides data on the country of origin of foreign-born science and engineering doctorate awardees, with China, India, and Taiwan being the top countries.

The NSF provides data on the country of origin of foreign-born science and engineering doctorate awardees, with China, India, and Taiwan being the top countries. Additionally, certain restrictions have been placed on foreign students with temporary resident student status in U.S. graduate programs, including limitations on employment and financial aid opportunities. Foreign and U.S. science and engineering graduate students receive financial support from various sources, including personal, university, foreign government, employer, and others. While temporary resident foreign students are ineligible for direct federal aid, they can work as research or teaching assistants on federally funded projects. Many foreign students receive support from their home country for the first year of study, with universities providing support through assistantships for the following years. The 2007 report, Doctorate Recipients from United States Universities: Summary Report 2006, shows that institutions of higher education provide significant support to foreign students through teaching assistantships, research assistantships, and fellowships. A higher percentage of non-U.S. citizen doctoral recipients receive financial assistance from universities compared to U.S. doctoral recipients. Data disaggregated by race/ethnicity shows varying levels of self-financing among different groups. In the physical sciences, universities primarily support temporary resident students, followed by permanent residents and U.S. citizens. In engineering, temporary residents receive the highest level of support. In engineering, a higher percentage of temporary resident students receive primary financial support from universities compared to permanent resident and U.S. citizen doctoral students. In education, a significant portion of temporary resident doctoral students also receive financial assistance from universities. In the social sciences, universities provide financial support to a significant percentage of temporary resident doctoral students, permanent residents, and U.S. citizens. There are differing opinions in the academic community about the impact of foreign student enrollment in science and engineering programs. Some believe that foreign students benefit U.S. universities and the economy. Foreign students in the United States contribute to the economy by increasing the number of skilled workers, assisting in teaching and research at universities, and providing tuition revenue for educational institutions. The participation of foreign students in graduate programs has sparked criticism from minority communities who argue that there is a disparity in the university science community. U.S. minorities feel they lack equal access to graduate education, scholarships, research funds, and opportunities for scientific publications. Frank L. Morris, former professor at the University of Texas, criticized colleges and universities for prioritizing resources for departments admitting foreign students over supporting minority graduate students. He highlighted the disparity in funding and support for foreign doctoral students compared to American minority and African American doctoral students. The disparity in funding and support for foreign doctoral students compared to American minority and African American doctoral students has jeopardized the economic well-being of the African American community. Criticisms include language barriers with foreign teaching assistants affecting the learning process. Several states have set English-language standards for foreign teaching assistants, impacting the learning process. Scientific migration is seen as beneficial by some, contributing to the U.S. economy's advancement in science and technology. International graduate students and scholars play a crucial role in the research enterprise, as highlighted in a 2005 report by the National Academies. International graduate students and postdoctoral scholars are vital to the research enterprise in the United States, making up a significant portion of the population in some fields. Their presence is crucial for research and teaching activities in academia, industry, and federal laboratories. The number of immigrant scientists and engineers entering the US remained stable in the 1980s but saw a marked increase in 1992. In 1992, admissions of scientists and engineers increased due to changes in the Immigration Act of 1990, allowing more H-1B visas. The number of scientists and engineers on permanent visas rose to 23,534 by 1993, further increasing due to the Chinese Students Protection Act of 1992. The proportion of foreign-born scientists and engineers in the U.S. labor force peaked in 2000, reflecting high levels of entry by visa holders during the 1990s. Administrative changes at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration impacted the issuance of permanent visas in recent years. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has been affected by administrative changes, immigration legislation, and the aftermath of September 11th. Recent legislation increased the annual quota for the H-1B program, allowing foreign workers to obtain visas for up to six years. The program is mainly for technology workers but is also used for hiring other skilled workers. Some argue that the influx of immigrant scientists and engineers on H-1B visas has led to decreased job opportunities and wages for U.S. scientific personnel. Despite downsizing in many businesses, the federal government continues to issue thousands of H-1B visas to foreign workers, causing concerns in the scientific and technical community. Some in the scientific and technical community believe that an over-reliance on H-1B visa workers has weakened job opportunities for U.S. workers. Critics argue that foreign labor is being hired at lower salaries, displacing American workers. Advocates for restrictions on hiring foreign skilled employees and enforcing existing laws to protect workers. Supporters of the H-1B program argue that foreign workers are necessary to fill needed positions. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) report highlights limitations in Labor's review of H-1B visa applications and enforcement of program requirements. Labor's Wage and Hour Division (WHD) investigates complaints against H-1B employers and conducts random investigations of program violators. From fiscal year 2000 to 2005, complaints and violations in the H-1B visa program increased. Changes in the program, like temporary visa cap increases, may have played a role. USCIS lacks a formal mechanism to report information to Labor, and current law prevents WHD from using it for investigations. Justice handles charges from U.S. workers alleging discrimination in hiring practices, but most cases do not show discriminatory conduct. The computer industry's growth has led to challenges in employing foreign scientists and engineers. The employment of foreign scientists and engineers in the United States has raised concerns about lower salaries compared to U.S. counterparts. The hiring of H-1B workers is seen as undermining the status of American workers. The Department of Labor enforces policies on temporary employment of nonimmigrant foreign workers under H-1B visas. Many in the scientific community believe the U.S. needs to compete with rapidly expanding countries. The United States needs to bring in foreign talent to compete in the global economy, but some believe the entry of foreign students and workers should be monitored more closely. Concerns exist about the lack of native-born students entering science and engineering programs. The United States relies on foreign talent in STEM fields, but there is a need to increase native-born students in science and engineering programs. The National Science Board emphasizes the importance of developing domestic talent alongside foreign talent to meet the growing demand for STEM professionals. The debate on the presence of foreign students in STEM programs intensified after 9/11. Concerns have been raised about the US losing its status as the top destination for international students. Concerns have been raised about foreign students in sensitive areas, particularly in research related to chemical and biological weapons. There is discussion about increased scrutiny of students from terrorism-sponsoring countries, which may impact enrollments in colleges. Some argue that restricting foreign scientists could harm U.S. industry competitiveness. The issue of tracking foreign students attending U.S. institutions has sparked debate in the academic and scientific community post-9/11. Legislation was in place to track foreign students and researchers electronically, replacing the paper-based system. The legislation required colleges and universities to monitor and compile data on foreign students attending their institutions, but the system was never fully implemented due to cost concerns and opposition from institutions. The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act mandated the development of the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) to track foreign students and exchange visitors in the U.S. The system was required to be operational by January 30, 2003. The deadline for implementing SEVIS was extended to February 15, 2003, but the system faced delays due to rigorous screening of visa applicants. Current issues with SEVIS are technical and related to personnel costs. There is a proposal for SEVIS II to address these problems and enhance the tracking system. The House Subcommittee on National Security held a hearing to address gaps in the visa process, focusing on strengthening antiterrorism measures while facilitating legitimate travel. Witnesses highlighted increased consular workloads, lack of strategic direction, resources, and training in visa-processing offices. Reliable data was also found to be lacking. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has released reports on efforts to improve visa processing, including addressing security and visa fraud issues, increasing visa wait times, and ensuring consistent visa adjudication worldwide. Clear procedures for visa issuance and monitoring operations are necessary due to ongoing policy changes. The GAO reports assessed agencies' progress in implementing changes in visa operations, highlighting the need for clarifying visa policies and procedures to address delays. Comprehensive immigration reform legislation was debated during the 110th Congress but ultimately failed. Comprehensive federal immigration reform legislation, including H.R. 4321, has been reintroduced in the 111th Congress. The bill aims to exempt certain U.S.-educated immigrants from employment-based immigration limits and make changes to H-1B visa employer application requirements. Bills introduced in the 111th Congress aim to attract foreign students in scientific and technical fields while protecting American scientists. H.R. 1736 addresses issues impacting collaboration between U.S. and foreign scientists. S. 887 seeks to reform H-1B and L-1 visa requirements by limiting the number of employees that can be hired and mandating annual audits of businesses. The bill H.R. 1791, known as the STAPLE Act, aims to limit the number of immigrants with a doctorate degree in scientific disciplines from a U.S. institution who can work in the U.S. It also includes provisions for annual audits of businesses with large numbers of H-1B workers."
