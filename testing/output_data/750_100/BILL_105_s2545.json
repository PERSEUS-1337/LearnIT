    "content": "The Act titled \"Medicare HMO Protection Act of 1998\" authorizes the evaluation and alteration of termination decisions. Section 1851(g)(3) of the Social Security Act is amended to allow the Secretary to delay the termination of a Medicare+Choice organization's plan if it poses a serious risk to enrolled individuals' health. The termination of a Medicare+Choice organization's plan can be delayed if it would significantly reduce available plans in the affected area or if the organization offers plans in nearby contract areas. The Secretary may audit and inspect organization's books or records to determine if termination can be delayed without causing financial losses. The Secretary may delay termination if an adequate provider network is established to provide equal insurance coverage. The Secretary and the Medicare+Choice organization may renegotiate a new contract during a delay in termination to ensure beneficiaries are not negatively impacted. SEC. 3.
