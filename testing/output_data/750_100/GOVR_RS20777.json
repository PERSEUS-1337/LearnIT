    "content": "Bankruptcy filings since 1980 peaked in 1987 for business filings, while consumer filings continued to grow until 2005 when they surpassed 2 million. The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 caused a rush of filings before its implementation in October. Filings dropped sharply in 2006, suggesting that the new law accelerated many filings. The long-term impact of BAPCPA on reducing filings is still uncertain. From 2006 to 2010, filings rose steadily, exceeding 1.5 million in 2010. Bankruptcy filings rose steadily from 2006 to 2010, exceeding 1.5 million in 2010. Household debt is mainly comprised of mortgage debt and consumer credit, with consumer credit including revolving credit (credit card debt) and non-revolving debt (auto and college loans). Mortgage debt is borrowing secured by real estate, with home equity lending as a subcategory. Table 2 shows Federal Reserve estimates of the debt service burden, which fluctuates within a narrow range. The debt burden has risen since the 1980s, increasing steadily until the recession and financial crisis in 2007. The debt burden has gradually increased since the 1980s, but it does not fully explain the significant rise in personal bankruptcy filings over the past two decades. Despite a decline in the debt service ratio since 2007, bankruptcy rates have not significantly decreased. Interest rates, especially mortgage rates, have been at historically low levels, yet the ratio of debt to income has been rising. The debt burden has been gradually increasing since the 1980s, but it does not fully explain the rise in personal bankruptcy filings. Despite a decline in the debt service ratio since 2007, bankruptcy rates have not significantly decreased. The ratio of debt to income has been rising, suggesting potential future problems for lenders if interest rates rise suddenly. The data from the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances shows that lower-income families are most likely to file for bankruptcy due to high levels of debt. Despite a gradual increase in debt burden since the 1980s, there is no clear trend explaining the rise in personal bankruptcy filings. The 2007 data shows a notable increase in personal bankruptcy filings among families in the upper income percentiles, possibly due to increased mortgage debt from the housing boom. The question remains why families at or below the national median income also end up in bankruptcy court, with some explanations focusing on vulnerable populations like the sick, uninsured, divorced, or residents in states without mandatory uninsured motorist coverage. Supporters of the 2005 bankruptcy reform argued that the code was too debtor-friendly, leading to excessive borrowing. Opponents blamed credit card issuers for marketing strategies that contributed to financial distress. The lack of a consensus on the rise in consumer bankruptcy filings indicates ongoing controversy. The U.S. economy entered a recession in December 2007 amidst global financial panic, causing household debt levels to decline. Household debt levels began to fall in three of the four categories shown in Table 2, continuing for 11 quarters until a slight rise in the second quarter of 2011. Home equity and credit card debt led the decline on a percentage basis, while mortgage debt accounted for most of the drop in dollar terms. Factors contributing to the decrease include households paying down debt, borrowing less, and lenders writing off uncollectible debt. The amount of debt written off by lenders has increased, leading to tighter credit standards for new loans. Mortgage balances have decreased due to modifications, negotiations, and foreclosures selling for less than the old mortgage amount. The causes and implications of deleveraging are discussed in CRS Report R41623, U.S. Household Debt Reduction."
