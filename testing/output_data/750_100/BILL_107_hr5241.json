This section includes findings and purposes related to respite care services. Congress finds that an estimated 26,000,000 individuals in the United States care for adult family members or friends who are chronically ill, disabled, or terminally ill, 18,000,000 children have chronic conditions requiring caregiver supervision, and 6,000,000 children live with relatives due to parental inability or unwillingness to care for them. Approximately 165,000 children with disabilities live with foster care parents in the United States, while nearly 4,000,000 individuals of all ages with mental retardation or developmental disabilities reside with their families. Additionally, around 25 percent of the nation's elders have multiple chronic disabling conditions, requiring assistance with daily needs.

Approximately 600,000 Americans die at home each year, with many relying on extensive family caregiving before their deaths. 42 percent of individuals in the United States needing daily living assistance are under age 65, and there are insufficient resources to replace family caregivers with paid workers. Replacing family caregivers with paid services would cost approximately $200 billion annually, and the caregiver role can result in substantial emotional, physical, and financial hardship. Approximately 75 percent of family caregivers are women and often struggle to find information on available respite care programs.

The purposes of this title are to encourage States to establish respite care programs, improve information dissemination to family caregivers, provide respite care services, and promote innovative approaches to respite care delivery and worker recruitment. The purposes of this title include supporting respite care worker and volunteer recruitment and training programs, training programs for family caregivers, evaluative research on effective respite care services, and promoting dissemination of results and findings related to respite care delivery and caregiver strain.
