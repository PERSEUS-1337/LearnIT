    "content": "Under the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, the President can propose rescinding funding from an appropriations act by sending a special message to Congress. If Congress does not approve within 45 days, the funding must be made available for executive agencies. President George W. Bush advocated for similar authority as Governor of Texas. The Governor of Texas, George W. Bush, advocated for the President to have line-item veto authority. An Administration draft bill, the Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006 (LLIVA), was sent to Congress in March 2006. The bill proposed \"expedited rescission\" where one house must vote on presidential rescission proposals. If one house disapproves, the other house does not need to act, requiring approval from both houses to make the rescission permanent. Under the Line Item Veto Act of 1996, \"enhanced rescission\" altered the framework to favor the President, allowing spending reductions to remain permanently cancelled unless Congress enacts a disapproval bill. Expedited rescission bills focus on procedural changes in Congress, requiring approval from both houses to make the rescission permanent. Expedited rescission bills aim to streamline the process of approving the President's funding cuts by implementing fast-track procedures in Congress. This approach has garnered support for maintaining a balance of power between Congress and the President. In 1992, 1993, and 1994, the House passed expedited rescission bills each year. The bills aimed to allow the President to propose funding cuts quickly, with limitations on reductions for programs. The process included expedited procedures for a prompt floor vote without amendments. In 1993, the House passed H.R. 1578, allowing the President to request rescission of 100% of a program's funding with expedited judicial review. In 1994, H.R. 4600 passed with strengthened expedited rescission measures. H.R. 4600, approved by the House, allowed submission of a special rescission message at any time and authorized the President to propose repealing targeted tax benefits within 20 days of enactment. The White House introduced a draft expedited rescission bill titled the Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006, allowing the President to propose rescission of discretionary budget authority in appropriations acts. The Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006 (LLIVA) grants the President flexibility to propose rescissions of budget authority or direct spending without time constraints. Rescinded amounts must be used for deficit reduction. The Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006 allows the President to propose rescissions of budget authority or direct spending for deficit reduction. Rescission requests from the President would be considered under fast-track procedures, with adjustments made to committee allocations and spending caps within five days of enactment. The Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006 allows the President to propose rescissions of budget authority or direct spending for deficit reduction under fast-track procedures. The committee to which the bill is referred would have five days to report the bill without substantive revision, and a vote on final passage would have to occur by the 10th day of session following introduction. Debate would be limited to four hours in the House and 10 hours in the Senate, with no amendments allowed to the approval bill. The LLIVA introduced expedited procedural rules for the approval of budget authority rescissions. It allows the President to withhold funds proposed for rescission or suspend the execution of direct spending for 180 days, with the option to release the funds before the expiration of the 180 days. These provisions are unique to expedited rescission bills. Supporters of the provisions in expedited rescission bills argue for temporary withholding or suspension of direct spending for 180 days to allow Congress time to consider the President's request. Critics view these provisions as unnecessary, as the expedited procedures in LLIVA typically result in a final vote within a month. They believe a shorter period than 180 days would be sufficient for Congress to act on the President's proposal. Critics argue that a period shorter than 180 days would be enough for Congress to act on a special message, and they are concerned that the 180-day withholding mechanism could lead to policy deferrals. Supporters emphasize that the 180-day provision is the maximum period for funding withholding. Supporters of the 180-day provision stress that it is the maximum period for funding deferral, with the option for the President to release funds earlier if deemed necessary. The LLIVA language allows for severability in case of judicial review, ensuring that unconstitutional portions do not affect the rest of the provisions. The act would take effect upon signing and apply only to spending or tax provisions. The LLIVA, H.R. 4890 / S. 2381, along with other measures in the 109th Congress, propose expedited rescission provisions for wasteful budget authority identified by the President. The President could propose to reduce discretionary spending limits for new budget authority and outlays in a wasteful appropriations act. H.R. 2290 limits the President to one special message per appropriations act, unless it involves multiple appropriations subcommittees. Representative Mark Udall introduced H.R. 4699, the \"Stimulating Leadership in Cutting Expenditures Act (or SLICE Act) of 2006,\" to enable the President to propose spending reductions for Congress to debate and vote on. The bill includes provisions for special messages and expedited procedures for budget authority provided in appropriations acts or P.L. 109-59. Senator John Kerry introduced S. 2372, the Expedited Budget Item Veto Review Act of 2006, on March 6, 2006. This bill is similar to the Line Item Veto Act of 1996 and would allow the President to propose spending reductions for specific projects in appropriations acts or P.L. 109-59. S. 2372, the Expedited Budget Item Veto Review Act of 2006, introduced by Senator John Kerry, allows the President to propose canceling discretionary budget authority, new direct spending items, and limited tax benefits. The President must submit a special message with proposed cancellations within three days of the law's enactment. The bill aims for an expedited process to ensure a vote on approval within 10 legislative days. Representative John Spratt introduced H.R. 5667 on June 21, 2006, which includes a legislative line item veto allowing the President to propose canceling discretionary spending and limited tax benefit provisions. The bill does not cover direct (mandatory) spending. H.R. 5667 introduced by Representative John Spratt on June 21, 2006, includes a line item veto for the President to cancel discretionary spending and limited tax benefits. The bill does not cover direct (mandatory) spending. On June 22, the House approved H.R. 4890, as amended, by a vote of 247-172. Meanwhile, on June 14, 2006, Senator Judd Gregg and others unveiled the Stop Over Spending Act, which includes a modified version of the Legislative Line Item Veto Act. Senator Gregg introduced the bill as S. 3521 on June 15, and on June 20, the Senate Budget Committee voted 12-10 to report the bill, as amended. The Senate Budget Committee voted 12-10 to report S. 3521 favorably, which includes a modified version of the Legislative Line Item Veto Act. Noteworthy differences exist among various versions of expedited rescission bills. The House-approved and Senate Budget Committee bills modified features in H.R. 4890 / S. 2381 to limit the President's flexibility on special rescission messages. The House version requires submission within 45 days, while the Senate version allows up to one year and limits the President to four special messages per calendar. The Senate Budget Committee version limits the President to four special messages per calendar year, while the House-passed version allows five special messages per act or 10 for omnibus measures. The House version is more permissive in total special messages, while the Senate bill is more lenient in timing. The House bill allows withholding of funds for up to 180 days, while S. 3521 limits it to 45 days. The House-passed version of the bill allows the President a 45-day extension for withholding funds, while S. 3521 stipulates termination after four years. Both versions narrow the range of targeted tax benefits. The House-passed version of H.R. 4890 and S. 2381, along with provisions in P.L. 104-130, narrow the range of targeted tax benefits to affect fewer beneficiaries. The Senate Budget Committee version falls between the Administration's proposal and the House-passed version in defining targeted tax benefits. The House-passed version of H.R. 4890 and S. 2381, along with provisions in P.L. 104-130, would require identification of targeted tax benefits by the Joint Committee on Taxation. The House version also proposes repealing the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, except for deferral authority under Section 1013. The House-approved bill would repeal most of the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, retaining only deferral authority for the President. The current bills aim to amend Title X by removing the Line Item Veto Act of 1996. The key issue is whether the proposed expedited rescission process would enhance or replace the President's existing rescission authority. No significant changes were made to the bill during floor consideration. The House-approved bill, H.R. 4890, saw no substantive changes during floor consideration. A manager's amendment by Representative Paul Ryan clarified that any cancelled funds from a trust or special fund would be returned to the original fund. Most changes to the bill occurred during committee markups, with only minor adjustments made during the House approval process. The manager's amendment to S. 3521 made changes to Title I regarding the legislative line item veto. The bill would prohibit the President from resubmitting rejected items of direct spending or targeted tax benefits, but allow resubmission of proposed cancellations if Congress fails to act. The amendment also proposes to reduce the period for the President to suspend new spending or tax benefits. The proposal submitted after the effective date of the provisions includes features from Table 1 under S.3521. The provisions for expedited consideration of special messages from the President proposing rescissions of funds have remained similar over the years. Various versions of expedited rescission bills in the 109th Congress aim for a vote on final passage of the approval bill within 10 days. In the early 1990s, there were bills with provisions for consideration of a substitute package of rescissions as an alternative to the President's package. In the 109th Congress, expedited rescission bills have varied in scope, with some focusing on discretionary budget authority while others have included entitlements and targeted tax benefits. H.R. 4699 proposes adding certain transportation projects to the list of possible cancellations. The LLIVA in all three versions considered here would grant the President expansive powers to cancel discretionary budget authority or new direct spending items. The Line Item Veto Act of 1996 had constitutional concerns, while expedited rescission is seen as more favorable for discretionary spending. The Line Item Veto Act of 1996 raised constitutional concerns, while expedited rescission is viewed more favorably for discretionary spending. The LLIVA includes a severability provision, ensuring that if one provision is found unconstitutional, the rest of the act remains unaffected. This allows the President to submit special rescission messages for expedited consideration, covering discretionary budget authority or direct spending items. The potential for further action on expedited rescission bills should consider the ongoing involvement of the Bush administration. The Bush Administration is pushing for the enactment of the Line Item Veto Act in the 109th Congress to target pork in large spending bills and enhance fiscal discipline. The President urged the Senate to quickly pass the line item veto after meeting with Senators at the White House. Table 1 compares provisions in different versions of the Legislative Line Item Veto Act from 2006 and 1996."
