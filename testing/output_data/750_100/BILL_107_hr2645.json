    "content": "The Motor Donor Act, also known as the National Organ Donor Registry, amends the Public Health Service Act to establish a national organ donor registry. The purposes of this subpart are to increase the number of individuals registering as organ donors, enhance information on donation, ensure accurate information on donation wishes is available. The subpart aims to increase organ donor registrations, improve donation information, and establish organ and tissue donor registries through State motor vehicle driver's license application processes. Definitions for motor vehicle driver's license and State are provided, and the Secretary is tasked with establishing the registry. The Secretary will establish a national organ and tissue donor registry (the `Registry') consisting of information on individuals who wish to be donors, including their personal details and a unique identification number. Coordination with States and Organ Procurement Organizations is required. During the initial 2-year and 4-year periods after the Motor Donor Act's enactment, the Secretary will coordinate with States having donor registries to share data and provide ongoing links between the Registry and State agencies. During the 4-year period after the Motor Donor Act's enactment, the Secretary will work with States to establish organ and tissue donor registries through the driver's license process. Organ procurement organizations will be provided with 24-hour access to the Registry using a password. The Motor Donor Act allows organ procurement organizations to access the Registry 24/7 with a designated password. The Secretary will distribute a pamphlet to US citizens who filed taxes in the prior year within 3 years of the Act's enactment. The Motor Donor Act allows organ procurement organizations access to the Registry with a password. A pamphlet is distributed to US citizens who filed taxes in the prior year, containing information on organ and tissue donations and a website address for Registry participation. Within 4 months of online registration, the Secretary notifies individuals of their participation. Participation in the Registry does not impact organ or tissue allocation. The Motor Donor Act allows organ procurement organizations access to the Registry for individuals' intent to serve as organ or tissue donors. Participation in the Registry is not legally binding consent for donation, except as allowed by State law. Individuals can request to cancel their participation. Individuals can cancel their participation in the Registry at any time. The Secretary will notify individuals of this right and the cancellation procedure. Information on individuals who cancel participation will be promptly removed from the Registry. The Secretary can award grants to States with approved applications. States with approved applications can receive grants to establish State registries linked to the motor vehicle driver's license application process. States must submit applications to the Secretary to be considered for these grants. Each state applying for grants must demonstrate procedures for individuals to make legally binding organ and tissue donation gifts when applying for a driver's license. The procedures must comply with specific requirements. State procedures must include a process for driver's license applicants to designate their intent to be an organ and tissue donor. State procedures must include a question for driver's license applicants to indicate their desire to be an organ donor in the State registry or on their driver's license. State procedures require individuals to answer affirmatively to have their organ donor preference noted in the State registry or on their driver's license. Names of those who agree are forwarded to the Registry. State procedures mandate that individuals must affirmatively choose to have their organ donor preference included in the State registry or on their driver's license. Names of those who opt in are sent to the Registry within 100 days of designation, with any changes in designation or address also required to be forwarded. Additionally, individuals who choose not to have their organ donor designation included must be noted in the State registry. State procedures require individuals to actively choose to include their organ donor preference in the State registry or on their driver's license. Information of those who opt in is sent to the Registry within 100 days, with any updates also forwarded. Individuals who opt out must be noted in the State registry. Additionally, the State procedures ensure that information of individuals who affirmatively answer a specific question is recorded in their computer record with the State agency, providing 24-hour access. The agency must provide 24-hour access to donor information to organ procurement organizations without charging a fee. The Secretary will prioritize grant awards to states collaborating with organ procurement organizations, with a limit of $300,000 per state. Additionally, an Advisory Task Force will be established. The Task Force on organ and tissue donation consists of 5 members appointed by the Secretary. The Task Force members are appointed based on their experience with organ or tissue donations, procurement, or transplants. At least one member must be a physician with transplant experience, and another member must have organ procurement experience.
