Section 13000 of the Education Code is amended to establish the California Civil Liberties Public Education Act, aiming to educate the public about the historical events of Japanese American exclusion, forced removal, and internment. The federal Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians (CWRIC) was created by Congress in 1980 to review Executive Order 9066's impact on American citizens and recommend remedies. The CWRIC issued reports in 1983 based on hearings with over 750 witnesses, including evacuees and government officials. The federal Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians (CWRIC) conducted hearings with over 750 witnesses, including evacuees, government officials, public figures, interested citizens, and historians. The CWRIC concluded that the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II was not justified by military necessity, but rather driven by race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership. This policy was a result of ignorance and executed in an atmosphere of fear and anger towards Japan, leading to a grave personal injustice. The internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II was driven by race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership. It was executed in an atmosphere of fear and anger at Japan, resulting in a grave personal injustice to American citizens and resident aliens of Japanese ancestry. President Ronald Reagan signed the federal Civil Liberties Act of 1988, declaring it a great day for America. The Congress acknowledges the grave injustice done to citizens and residents of Japanese ancestry during WWII, motivated by racial prejudice and wartime hysteria. This led to significant damages and losses in education and job training. The Congress apologizes on behalf of the Nation for the fundamental violations of civil liberties and constitutional rights of individuals of Japanese ancestry during WWII, resulting in significant human suffering and lack of appropriate compensation. The Education Code is amended to require eligible aliens seeking permanent residency in California under the federal Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 to demonstrate English proficiency and knowledge of U.S. history and government.

If the Superintendent certifies it, Section 2 of the act will become inoperative."
