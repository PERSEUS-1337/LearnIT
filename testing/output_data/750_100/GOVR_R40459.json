    "content": "The Department of Defense (DOD) fuel consumption fluctuates annually based on mission changes. DOD may use up to 1% of US refined petroleum products, with foreign purchases potentially doubling consumption. The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) buys fuel for all DOD services and agencies, both in the US and overseas, dating back to World War II. The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) was originally known as the Joint Army-Navy Purchasing Agency before becoming part of the Defense Logistics Agency in 1962. It was re-designated as the Defense Fuel Supply Center (DFSC) in 1964 to manage DOD's petroleum products and coal. In 1998, it became the Defense Energy Support Center with an expanded mission to manage energy products procurement based on lowest cost to delivery point. The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) manages DOD's fuel procurement, including bulk petroleum products like JP-8, JP-5, and diesel fuel. This report summarizes DOD's fuel purchases from FY2000 to FY2008, comparing spending to overall DOD spending, prices to commercial equivalents, and quantities purchased to U.S. production. The report discusses DOD's fuel requirements in relation to U.S. refined petroleum production, refining, and procurement practices. Recent legislation directs DOD to consider using alternative fuels to meet its needs and stimulate commercial interest in supplying them. Recent high fuel prices have led to interest in producing alternative fuels from coal and oil shale, but no projects have reached commercial operation yet. Legislation now prevents federal agencies from spending taxpayer dollars on new fuel sources that worsen global warming. Proposed rules for greenhouse gas emission reporting may have minimal impact on refineries. New legislation to cap greenhouse gas emissions could affect refinery operations and the industry's response to DOD's fuel requirements. The Department of Defense's fuel consumption varies annually based on mission changes and operational tempo. DESC primarily purchases JP-8 jet fuel for the Air Force and Army, while the Navy consumes JP-5 jet fuel. Total fuel purchases peaked in FY2003 at 145.1 million barrels during the Iraq invasion, with JP-8 purchases peaking in FY2004 and declining since then. DESC's fuel expenditures grew significantly from FY2000 to FY2008, with JP-8 purchases declining. Actual volumes purchased only increased by 30% during this time. DESC's purchases may not align with DOD's actual consumption as fuel may be drawn from storage or war reserves. The Department of Defense (DOD) maintains a fuel \"war reserve\" for contingencies, with fuel costs increasing due to rising crude oil prices and refining margins. The average cost of petroleum products purchased rose significantly from FY2000 to FY2008. After the setbacks in commercial aviation post-9/11 and the Iraq invasion, military jet fuel price advantages reversed. Fuel prices increased, widening the margin between crude oil cost and refined product prices. DOD responded by purchasing alternate jet fuels when offered at lower prices than military specification fuel. From FY2000 through FY2007, total defense outlays increased 200% in current dollars, with a rise in purchases of alternate jet fuels and diesel fuel. Outlays represent cash payments made to liquidate the government's obligations in a fiscal year, reflecting DOD's actual spending. Total defense outlays increased by 200% from FY2000 to FY2007, with Operation and Maintenance spending rising by 231%. Fuel costs surged by 497% during this period, mainly due to escalating crude oil prices. Fuel costs went from 1.2% of DOD's spending in FY2000 to 3% in FY2008. The U.S. produces one-third of its crude oil, with the rest coming from countries like Canada, Saudi Arabia, and Mexico. Refineries have shifted to heavier sour crudes due to the diminishing supply of light sweet crude oil. Crude oil contains components for gasoline, kerosene, and diesel fuel, which are separated in a refinery's distillation tower. Straight-run refers to the initial refining process. The initial refining process separates crude oil components into gasoline, kerosene, and diesel fuel. Refineries use heat, pressure, hydrogen, and catalysts for this process. Specifications for jet fuel are more rigorous than for kerosene. Light sweet crude is preferred for gasoline refining. Light sweet crude is preferred for gasoline refining due to its lighter-weight hydrocarbons, making it easier to refine. Refineries can be set up as topping refineries, hydroskimming refineries, or cracking refineries, each with varying levels of complexity in processing crude oil. Refineries can be categorized as topping, hydroskimming, cracking, or coking refineries based on the type of crude oil they process and the products they produce. The atmospheric distillation capacity of a refinery determines its crude oil processing limit, with secondary processing units like catalytic cracking and coking increasing output volume and complexity. Refinery size can be measured by its processing capacity in barrels per day. The Nelson Complexity Index rates refinery complexity based on secondary processes. U.S. refineries have an average index of 10, with only 59 having coking capacity. Gulf Coast refineries with complexity of 12 to 13 can yield up to 8% jet fuel and over 30% diesel fuel. Changes in crude oil supplies have led some refineries to upgrade their processes to handle heavier sour crude oils. The EPA regulations require measuring the sulfur content of diesel fuel at the retail outlet, not the refinery. By the end of 2010, all highway-use diesel fuel in the United States will be limited to 15 parts-per-million sulfur content, known as \"ultra-low sulfur diesel\" (ULSD). Petroleum product pipelines transport a variety of fuels. In the late 1980s, DOD adopted the \"single battlefield fuel\" concept, using JP-8 for both aircraft and ground equipment. Refiners face challenges with sulfur contamination in pipelines, requiring lower sulfur diesel production or reprocessing transmix. The U.S. Army has transitioned to using JP-8 instead of diesel fuel for land-based equipment to minimize the fuel supply chain length. They adhere to ASTM standard MIL-DTL-83133E, limiting sulfur content to 3,000 ppm, with typical levels around 140 ppm. The EPA has not indicated plans to reduce the sulfur content of jet fuel, despite recognizing the need for tactical vehicles to operate on JP-8 or JP-5 fuel. In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled that the EPA has the authority to regulate CO2 emissions from automobiles. After a thorough scientific review, the EPA proposed in April 2009 that greenhouse gases contribute to air pollution that may endanger public health or welfare. This finding has wide-ranging implications, leading to a proposed Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases rule that would require petroleum refineries to report emissions. Petroleum refineries emit approximately 205 million metric tons of CO2 annually, representing about 3% of U.S. GHG emissions. Compliance with the rule would be costly. The EPA's proposed rule would require petroleum refineries to report emissions, which account for about 3% of U.S. GHG emissions. Compliance costs could be minimal, but the rule sets the stage for future regulations that may cap emissions. Legislation like H.R. 2454 aims to establish a cap-and-trade system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions from refineries. H.R. 2454 would reduce emissions cap to 83%, requiring industries to cut emissions or buy allowances/offsets. 142 US refineries operate, with top suppliers including Shell, Valero, ExxonMobil, and BP. The top domestic suppliers in the United States include Shell, Valero Marketing and Supply Company, ExxonMobil, and BP Corporation. These companies operate 31 refineries in the US with a combined crude capacity of nearly 6 million barrels per day. The refineries have an average Nelson Complexity Index rating of 10 and two-thirds have coking capacity for medium sour crude. Despite a decline in the number of refineries from 155 to 141 between 2000 and 2009, the atmospheric crude oil distillation capacity increased from 17.8 million to 18.6 million barrels per stream day. The increase in downstream charge capacity for kerosene/jet fuel has led to a rise in overall U.S. refining capacity. The median capacity of operating refineries is around 80,000 bpd, with the majority of refineries above this mark making up 85% of the total capacity. Gulf Coast refineries can yield up to 8% jet fuel and over 30% diesel fuel. U.S. refineries produce significantly more commercial jet fuel than military fuel. U.S. refineries produce ten times more commercial jet fuel than military jet fuel, with military jet fuel production ranging from 9% to 11% of U.S. net production. DESC's worldwide jet fuel purchases have exceeded U.S. refining industry's output, with U.S. refineries sometimes supplying less than 50% of DESC's jet fuel purchases. DESC has increased its purchase of commercial jet fuels to meet DOD's demand for military specification jet fuel due to the lack of U.S. refining capacity. This strategy has reduced DESC's spending on fuel as commercial jet fuel is priced lower. Logistics demand that closer refineries supply the fuel to avoid a lengthy supply chain to forward operating areas. Logistics demand closer refineries supply fuel. DESC balances purchases through contracts with foreign suppliers for U.S. forces outside the continental U.S. DOD's authority to procure fuel stems from Navy power under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 7229. DESC now relies on the general procurement authority under 10 U.S.C. 2304 to purchase fuel for DOD customers in a one-step process under the Defense Working Capital Fund. This allows for price breaks on large quantity purchases and stabilizes costs for DOD customers. The term \"acquisition\" under Title 41 U.S.C. Section 403 refers to the process of acquiring property or services with appropriated funds. Title 10 U.S.C. Chapter 137 governs the Armed Forces acquisition process. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) governs the acquisition process for federal agencies, while the Defense Acquisition Regulation System (DFARS) is used by the Department of Defense. DESC typically awards one-year bulk-fuel contracts and multi-year direct delivery fuel contracts using fixed-price contracts with economic price adjustments. DESC uses economic price adjustment provisions in contracts for refined petroleum products to account for unpredictable future costs. They also adopt multi-year contracting provisions for bulk petroleum, ships' bunker, and into-plane services. The Department of Defense (DOD) and military departments are authorized to enter multiyear contracts for bulk petroleum, ships' bunker, into-plane, and post-camp-and-station services for a period from October 1, 2008, through September 30, 2009. These contracts can have initial five-year terms with options for up to three five-year renewals, not exceeding a total of twenty years. The difference between multiyear and multiple year contracts lies in the funding contingency and term length. Multiyear contracts do not require annual options for each program year after the first, while multiple year contracts have a term of more than one year regardless of fiscal year funding. The Department of Defense (DOD) can enter into multiyear contracts for supplies under specific regulations to promote national security and achieve cost savings. If Congress fails to appropriate funds for succeeding years, the contract must be canceled. Multiyear contracting is encouraged for its potential advantages. The agency can cancel the contract if Congress fails to appropriate funds for succeeding years. Multiyear contracting is encouraged for cost savings and national security objectives. A multiyear contract for supplies can be entered into if it promotes national security, with a maximum limit of $500 million. DOD is authorized to procure fuel derived from coal, oil shale, and tar. The Secretary of Defense has broad waiver authority over acquisition of alternative fuels, allowing for multi-year contracts for procurement of fuels derived from coal, oil shale, and tar sands. The Secretary may waive provisions of law if market conditions will adversely affect DOD's acquisition for a defined fuel source. The term \"defined fuel source\" includes petroleum, natural gas, coal, and coke. The five-year limit on multi-year contracts can be waived by the Secretary. DESC has not decided whether to waive statutory limits on multiyear contracts. DESC bases contract delivery price on the \"lowest laid down cost\" to the government, including a surcharge for operating costs. Delivery points like Defense Fuel Supply Points redistribute fuel to bases. Additional costs may be incurred for tactical fuel delivery methods. The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for FY2009 requires analyses and force planning processes to consider the hidden costs of fuel logistics in military acquisitions, including fully burdened costs of fuel. It also appoints a director responsible for overseeing energy requirements for military operations. The Department of Defense (DOD) has seen a 500% increase in fuel costs over the past decade due to rising crude oil prices. Fuel costs have accounted for up to 3% of DOD's spending and over 7% of the Operation and Maintenance budget. The Air Force had to reduce funding for flying hours in 2006 due to increasing fuel costs and military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Department of Defense (DOD) has faced a 500% increase in fuel costs over the past decade, accounting for up to 3% of spending and over 7% of the Operation and Maintenance budget. Unlike the airline industry, DOD's only recourse for increased costs has been to request supplemental appropriations. For example, in FY2007, DOD requested $0.5 billion for baseline fuel cost increases. DOD is exploring options to limit its vulnerability to fuel price fluctuations. DOD has explored options to reduce vulnerability to fuel price swings and shortages, including fuel hedging, multi-year contracting, and using alternate fuels like commercial Jet A fuel. DESC's business model allows flexibility to meet changing operational needs with fixed-price contracts that include price adjustment clauses. This contract provision helps take advantage of fuel price fluctuations. DESC has a contract provision that adjusts prices based on fuel price swings, reflecting crude oil prices. This helps limit DESC's risk but does not control costs during rapid price increases. The airline industry uses hedging strategies like buying futures contracts to minimize future jet fuel price risks. Southwest Airlines managed to hedge fuel prices at $51/barrel when crude oil prices peaked in 2008. The Defense Business Board explored fuel hedging options to reduce DOD's exposure to price volatility. They considered hedging in commercial markets or through the Department of the Interior's Mineral Management Service. Interior Department oil could use lease revenues to offset price spikes. The Defense Business Board explored options to reduce DOD's fuel costs by using Interior Department oil lease revenues to offset price spikes. DOD could request OMB to transfer funds between Interior and Defense based on price changes, but statutory allocations and royalties-in-kind to the SPR complicate this. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was created by Congress in response to the 1970s Arab oil embargo to prevent supply disruptions. It can hold up to 727 million barrels of oil, representing roughly 70 days of imported supply. The SPR can be drawn down through sales to the highest bidder or exchanges. President George H.W. Bush's drawdown during the 1991 Persian Gulf War led to a rapid decline in crude oil prices. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that in 2006, 40% of the crude oil refined in U.S. refineries was heavier than that stored in the SPR. Refineries processing heavy oil face capacity issues with lighter oils. GAO highlighted that 36 vulnerable refineries would see a 5% decrease in refining throughput if they had to use SPR oil, impacting the SPR's effectiveness during an oil disruption, especially with heavy oil involved. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) may not play a significant role in mitigating a Department of Defense (DOD) fuel supply disruption, especially if heavy oil is involved. Refineries have operational limitations in producing jet fuel, which limits the SPR's effectiveness in supporting DOD's requirements. As a last resort, DOD may consider alternative or replacement options for crude oil as per the 2005 Energy Policy Act. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 prohibits federal agencies from procuring alternative fuels unless their greenhouse gas emissions are equivalent to conventional petroleum sources. This provision aims to prevent taxpayer dollars from funding new fuel sources that worsen global warming. The Air Force abandoned plans for a coal-to-liquid fuel plant due to these regulations. DESC is interested in pursuing a pilot program for synthetic fuels to support DOD JP-8 fuel requirements in Alaska, despite the challenges of crude oil supply shortages and price spikes. DOD is shifting towards efficiency and may report on the fully burdened cost of fuel for military operations to inform Congress. The refining sector's lack of responsiveness to DOD's procurement announcements during high petroleum prices may be a concern for Congress. Refinery operators may question the value of emission credits versus operating marginally profitable refineries. Congress may worry about potential refinery shutdowns reducing defense fuel suppliers in the long term. For more on alternative fuel sources, refer to CRS Report RL34133, Fischer-Tropsch Fuels from Coal, Natural Gas. Avgas is a high octane fuel used in light aircraft, while Crude Oil Classification DFM has been used in shipboard propulsion plants since 1975. DF2 is another type of diesel fuel. FSII stands for Fuel Systems Icing Inhibitor. FOB is a trade term where the seller delivers goods on board a vessel designated by the buyer. The word \"free\" in trade terms means the seller must deliver goods to a named place for transfer to a carrier. International transportation contracts often use abbreviated trade terms to describe delivery, payment, and risk of loss. Jet A-1 (JA1) is a civilian-aviation kerosene-based turbine fuel with ASTM specification D16555 (Jet A-1) and NATO designation as F-35. Jet A, similar to JA-1 but with a higher freeze point, is a type of jet fuel produced to ASTM specification D1655, mainly available in the United States. Jet B is a distillate fuel similar to Jet A-1 but with a higher freeze point, mainly used in very cold climates due to its better cold weather performance. It is supplied under Canadian Specification CAN/CGSB 3.23. JP-4 is the military equivalent of Jet B with additional additives, meeting U.S. Military Specification MIL-DTL-5624U Grade JP-4. JP-5 is a kerosene-based fuel with a higher flash-point developed for military aircraft on aircraft carriers. It meets MIL-DTL-5624 U and NATO Code F-44 specifications. It is also suitable for use as ship turbine fuel. JP-8 is the military equivalent of Jet A-1 with corrosion and icing inhibitors. The Air Force switched to JP-8 in 1996 for safety and combat survivability. It is less flammable and hazardous than JP-4, containing less benzene and n-hexane. JP-8 has a stronger smell and is oily to the touch, while JP-4 is more solvent-like. Its ASTM specification is MIL-DTL-83133, identified as F-34 by NATO. JP-8+100 includes an additive for increased thermal stability. Middle Distillate range fuels like kerosene, jet fuel, and diesel are used in military vehicles. Mogas is the primary fuel for non-tactical ground vehicles. Multiyear contracting is a method to acquire known requirements in quantities. Military installations are bases or activities under military department jurisdiction. Multiyear contracting is a special method to acquire known requirements in quantities and total cost not exceeding planned requirements for up to five years. It can be used in sealed bidding or contracting by negotiation and must conform to OMB Circulars A-11 and A-34. Naphtha is a petroleum distillate used as a feedstock in gasoline production. Benzene is a feedstock in gasoline production, catalytically reformed for higher octane reformate."
