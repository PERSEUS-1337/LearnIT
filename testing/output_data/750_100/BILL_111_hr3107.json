    "content": "The Act titled \"Stop Nuclear Assistance to State Sponsors of Terrorism Act of 2009\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 contains findings related to the Act. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was established in 1957 with the objectives of promoting atomic energy for peaceful purposes and preventing its use for military purposes. The United States is the largest financial contributor to the IAEA. The IAEA established the Technical Cooperation Program in 1959, funded by member states to provide nuclear technical cooperation for peaceful purposes worldwide. The United States is the largest contributor to the IAEA's Technical Cooperation Fund. A 2009 report by the Government Accountability Office found that assistance is not limited to countries designated as state sponsors of terrorism. The United States has designated Cuba, Iran, Sudan, and Syria as state sponsors of terrorism, subject to sanctions. A GAO report found that these countries received over $55 million in technical cooperation assistance from 1997 to 2007, with over $4.4 million in 2008. Proliferation concerns persist due to the assistance provided by the Technical Cooperation Program in nuclear equipment, technology, and expertise. The GAO report highlighted concerns about the Technical Cooperation Program providing nuclear assistance to state sponsors of terrorism like Cuba, Iran, Sudan, and Syria. The report noted that the assistance could have dual-use capabilities, serving peaceful purposes but also contributing to nuclear weapons development. Specifically, projects in Iran were directly related to the nuclear power plant at Bushehr. The report also pointed out the difficulty for the United States to fully identify, assess, and resolve proliferation concerns associated with the program due to the lack of a formal mechanism. The GAO report highlighted concerns about the Technical Cooperation Program providing nuclear assistance to state sponsors of terrorism like Cuba, Iran, Sudan, and Syria. The report noted that there is no formal mechanism for obtaining TC project information during the proposal development phase and limited State documentation on how proliferation concerns of TC proposals were resolved. Additionally, there are shortcomings in U.S. policies and IAEA procedures related to TC program fellowships. The IAEA officials mentioned that the program does not exclude countries based on their status as U.S.-designated state sponsors of terrorism. The GAO report raised concerns about the Technical Cooperation Program providing nuclear assistance to state sponsors of terrorism like Cuba, Iran, Sudan, and Syria. The report highlighted limited information on TC projects and the potential for advancement of weapons of mass destruction. The Deputy Director General emphasized that all countries are treated equally in receiving technical cooperation from the IAEA. The GAO report raised concerns about the Technical Cooperation Program providing nuclear assistance to state sponsors of terrorism like Cuba, Iran, Sudan, and Syria. It found that assistance has not advanced weapons of mass destruction programs in U.S.-designated state sponsors of terrorism. The report also questioned the State Department's confidence in IAEA's safeguards to prevent TC projects from contributing to weapons development. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 prohibited funds for programs in Libya, Iran, Cuba, or the Palestine Liberation. The Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1998 and the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 restricted funding to the IAEA for projects in Cuba related to nuclear facilities. The GAO report recommends withholding a share of future contributions to the Technical Cooperation Fund for countries of concern, including U.S.-designated state sponsors of terrorism. The IAEA has reported Iran's ongoing work on heavy water-related projects. Iran continues its work on heavy water-related projects and uranium enrichment, in violation of multiple United Nations Security Council Resolutions. Resolution 1737 (2006) prohibits technical cooperation with Iran related to proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities. The IAEA Director General reported in June 2009 that Iran has 7,000 centrifuges for uranium enrichment, with 5,000 in operation and a stockpile of over 1,300 kilograms of low-enriched uranium, enough for further enrichment towards a nuclear bomb. The IAEA Director General has raised concerns about possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear program and highlighted Iran's failure to implement the Additional Protocol for credible assurance about undeclared nuclear activities. The IAEA has requested Iran to provide access to additional locations related to centrifuge manufacturing, uranium enrichment research, and mining as a transparency measure. The IAEA Director General has reported a lack of cooperation from Iran regarding concerns about possible military dimensions of its nuclear program. Iran has repeatedly refused to comply with IAEA resolutions and continues to block inspections of its nuclear facilities, violating its NPT Safeguards Agreement. Multiple news reports indicate Iran's non-compliance with transparency measures related to its nuclear program. Iran recently denied access to its enrichment site at Natanz to IAEA inspectors and refused a request to place additional surveillance cameras. In April 2008, US officials revealed Syria's secret nuclear reactor, built with North Korea's help, capable of producing plutonium for nuclear weapons. The Syrian reactor at Dair Alzour could have produced enough plutonium for 1 or 2 bombs within a year of becoming operational, as reported by General Michael Hayden in April 2008. The IAEA Director General noted in November 2008 that the facility bore features of an undeclared nuclear reactor. The IAEA has not received requested documentation from Syria regarding the destroyed nuclear reactor, hindering their ability to determine its nature. Uranium particles were found at a second site, raising concerns about undeclared nuclear activities. Particles of a type not declared in Syria's inventory were found at the Miniature Neutron Source Reactor facility in Damascus. SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON THE USE OF FUNDS. No US funds to IAEA can support assistance to countries like North Korea that are state sponsors of terrorism or in breach of nuclear agreements or UN resolutions. The Secretary of State will withhold US voluntary contributions to the IAEA proportional to the amount spent by the IAEA on assistance to countries under investigation for breaching nuclear agreements or UN resolutions. If the IAEA does not suspend assistance to countries under investigation within 30 days, the US will withhold an amount equal to the specified contribution. SEC. 4. WAIVER. The provisions in subsections (b) and (c) of section 3 may be waived if the IAEA suspends assistance to countries in section 3(a) or if the President certifies that these countries no longer pose a threat to US national security. The President will direct the US Representative to the IAEA to block funds for assistance to countries listed in section 3(a). A report on the Act's implementation must be submitted within six months. Definitions are provided. The term \"appropriate congressional committees\" refers to specific committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate. The term \"state sponsor of terrorism\" is defined as a country determined by the Secretary of State for specific purposes. The government identified as supporting international terrorism under various laws."
