    "content": "The Internet is a \"network of networks\" with interconnected computers worldwide identified by unique IP numbers. Domain names simplify access to websites, with Top Level Domains indicating country codes or generic categories. The Domain Name System (DNS) consists of country codes or generic designations (gTLDs) like .com, .org, .net, .edu, or .gov. Root servers coordinate to ensure Internet connectivity, originating from military research funding and evolving into a civilian network with support from science agencies. The Internet and the DNS were managed without formal statutory authorities or international agreements. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) played a key role in making technical decisions and managing the IP address space. In 1993, NSF signed an agreement with InterNic for domain name registration, giving NSI sole control over .com, .net, and .org gTLDs. Criticism grew after registration fees were imposed in 1995. Criticism of NSI's control over gTLD registration grew in 1995 due to registration fees. Concerns about trademark disputes in the .com domain and the legal foundation of IANA's role led to international actions. The IAHC proposed creating seven new gTLDs on February 4, 1997. The IAHC proposed creating seven new gTLDs on February 4, 1997, leading to the U.S. government forming an interagency group to address the domain name issue. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) of the Department of Commerce (DOC) was assigned lead responsibility, and on June 5, 1998, DOC issued a final statement of policy called the White Paper. The White Paper endorsed a process for a new not-for-profit corporation to administer policy for the Internet name and address system, ensuring stability, competition, private coordination, and fair representation of the Internet community. During the summer of 1998, Internet constituencies worldwide met to discuss the formation of a new corporation to manage names and addresses. IANA and NSI proposed bylaws and articles of incorporation for the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). The final version of ICANN's bylaws was submitted to the Department of Commerce on October 2, 1998, and an official Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed between DOC and ICANN on November 25, 1998. The Department of Commerce and ICANN agreed to jointly design, develop, and test mechanisms for transitioning DNS management to a private-sector entity. The MOU was extended until September 30, 2006, with specified transition tasks for ICANN. NTIA stated the U.S. government's principles on the domain name system. The U.S. government aims to maintain DNS security and stability, authorizing changes to the root zone. ICANN is recognized as the technical manager of the DNS, and discussions on Internet governance should continue. DOC announced a new JPA with ICANN to transition DNS management to the private sector. The U.S. government authorized ICANN to manage the DNS, leading to the JPA extension until September 30, 2009. An Affirmation of Commitments (AoC) was agreed upon to ensure transparency, accountability, and global technical coordination of the DNS by a private-sector-led organization. ICANN, a not-for-profit corporation, is headquartered in Los Angeles. ICANN is a not-for-profit public benefit corporation headquartered in Los Angeles, CA, organized under California Nonprofit Public Benefit Law. It has tax-exempt status and a Board of Directors advised by supporting organizations and advisory committees representing various Internet constituencies. The Board of Directors of ICANN, consisting of 16 members, is advised by subgroups representing different Internet constituencies. They make final policy and operational decisions. The growth of the Internet and domain name registration has led to a significant increase in the ICANN budget, from $6 million in 2000 to $159 million in 2015. ICANN is primarily funded through fees paid by registrars and registry operators. Registrars are companies like GoDaddy and Google, while registry operators manage the master database of domain names. Companies like VeriSign, Inc., Public Interest Registry, and Neustar, Inc. operate the master database of domain names in various top-level domains. Congressional committees oversee the Department of Commerce's management of ICANN's activities, with other committees monitoring issues like intellectual property and privacy. Congressional committee hearings are listed in the Appendix. The Department of Commerce has no statutory authority over ICANN or the DNS. The U.S. government originally owned and operated key components of network architecture that enable the domain name system to function. The 1998 Memorandum of Understanding between ICANN and the Department of Commerce initiated a process intended to. The Department of Commerce initiated a process to transition DNS functions to a private-sector entity. The U.S. government retains a role through contractual agreements with ICANN, including the Affirmation of Commitments and technical functions contract. The Department of Commerce transitioned DNS functions to a private-sector entity through agreements with ICANN. The cooperative agreement between DOC and VeriSign manages the official DNS root zone file. The Affirmation of Commitments institutionalizes global DNS coordination by a private-sector-led organization, succeeding the Joint Project Agreement. The AoC has no expiration date and would only conclude if one party decides to terminate the agreement. Various Internet stakeholders disagreed on whether DOC should maintain control. Many U.S. industry and public interest groups argued that continued DOC oversight of ICANN was necessary to prevent international control of the DNS, while international entities believed ICANN had met conditions for privatization. The United States argued that ICANN had met conditions for privatization and that U.S. government control over an international organization was not appropriate. In the 110th Congress, Senator Snowe introduced S.Res. 564, stating that more progress was needed in achieving accountability and transparency goals. NTIA issued a Notice of Inquiry seeking public comment on the expiration of the JPA between DOC and ICANN, noting the need for further work to increase institutional confidence. Further work was required to increase institutional confidence in ICANN, focusing on areas such as long-term stability, accountability, responsiveness, private-sector leadership, stakeholder participation, contract compliance, and competition. NTIA sought public comments on the transition of DNS management to the private sector and the model of private-sector leadership represented by ICANN. The House addressed the progress of the transition on June 4, 2009. On June 4, 2009, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce discussed the expiration of the JPA and the need for a permanent agreement between DOC and ICANN to ensure perpetual public accountability. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce discussed the need for a \"permanent instrument\" to ensure ICANN's perpetual accountability to the public and global stakeholders. This instrument should maintain the DOC-ICANN relationship, include periodic reviews of ICANN performance, outline steps for accountability improvement, implement new gTLDs and internationalized domain names, ensure timely access to WHOIS information, and commit ICANN to remain a not-for-profit corporation based in the United States. ICANN will remain a not-for-profit corporation headquartered in the United States, with offices worldwide to serve the global community. The Affirmation of Commitments (AoC) emphasizes ICANN's private nature and establishes review panels to ensure accountability, transparency, and the interests of global Internet users. The panel, including key stakeholders and experts, will assess ICANN's governance for transparency, accountability, and responsiveness to the global Internet community. It will review ICANN's plan to enhance operational stability, security, and resiliency. The panel, consisting of key stakeholders and experts, will review ICANN's plan to enhance the operational stability, reliability, resiliency, security, and global interoperability of the DNS. It will also assess the impact of new gTLDs on competition, consumer trust, and choice. The panel, including key stakeholders and experts, will review the existing WHOIS policy to evaluate its effectiveness in meeting the needs of law enforcement and promoting consumer trust. It will be composed of the chair of the GAC, the CEO of ICANN, representatives of relevant Advisory Committees and Supporting Organizations, independent experts, global law enforcement representatives, and privacy experts. The Accountability and Transparency Review Team (ATRT) released recommendations to improve ICANN's transparency and accountability. The Board adopted all 27 ATRT recommendations in June 2011. The focus now shifts to ICANN management and staff. The ATRT released recommendations for ICANN's transparency and accountability. The focus is now on ICANN management and staff implementing these recommendations promptly for meaningful reform. A follow-up report, ATRT2, presented 12 new recommendations to the Board, mostly addressing issues from the first report. The \"IANA functions contract\" between DOC and ICANN allows ICANN to manage critical technical functions of the DNS. The DOC has authority over the root zone file, allowing the U.S. government to approve or deny changes made to the DNS, such as adding new top-level domains. The U.S. government has authority over the DNS root zone file, allowing approval or denial of changes, such as adding new top-level domains. The expiration of the JPA and establishment of the AoC did not directly affect this authority. The U.S. government's authority over the DNS root zone file was not directly affected by the expiration of the JPA and establishment of the AoC. NTIA awarded the IANA functions contract to ICANN, with a separation between policy development and implementation. The IANA contract specifies requirements for a U.S. owned contractor, operations in the U.S., and government inspection rights. NTIA maintains oversight over ICANN and the domain name system. NTIA announced its intention to transition its stewardship role over key domain name functions to the global Internet multistakeholder community. If successful, NTIA will let its IANA functions contract with ICANN expire by September 30, 2015. NTIA is asking ICANN to work with global Internet stakeholders to develop a transition proposal. Specifically, NTIA expects ICANN to collaborate with parties affected by the IANA contract, including the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). In October 2013, Internet technical organizations called for accelerating the globalization of ICANN and IANA functions, involving all stakeholders, including governments, on an equal footing. NTIA will not accept a transition proposal replacing its role with a government-led one. NTIA will not accept any transition proposal replacing its role with a government-led solution. The transition proposal must have broad community support and address four principles to support the multistakeholder model, maintain Internet DNS security, meet global customer needs, and preserve Internet openness. Transferring authority over ICANN and DNS to the global Internet community will strengthen U.S. support for the multistakeholder model. The U.S. government supports the multistakeholder model of Internet governance to prevent intergovernmental control. The transition of ICANN and DNS to the global Internet community is seen as feasible due to ICANN's improved accountability and transparency. Critics of the transition argue that NTIA's oversight has provided confidence in the integrity of the DNS, especially after the Snowden NSA revelations. They fear that without NTIA's authority, foreign governments may push for more intergovernmental control over the Internet, which could harm U.S. interests. Critics are concerned about the risks of foreign governments gaining influence over the DNS through a new Internet governance mechanism that no longer has U.S. government oversight. Representative Shimkus introduced H.R. 4342, the DOTCOM Act, to prohibit NTIA from relinquishing authority over ICANN and the DNS. H.R. 4342, the DOTCOM Act, aims to prevent the NTIA from giving up control of the Internet domain name system until a GAO report is submitted to Congress. The report will assess the advantages and disadvantages of the change, address national security concerns, and define the \"multistakeholder model\" in Internet governance. The bill was referred to the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and a hearing was held on April 2, 2014. On April 2, 2014, the Subcommittee on Communications and Technology held a hearing on the DOTCOM Act, which aims to prevent the NTIA from relinquishing control of the Internet domain name system. H.R. 4342 was approved by the House Energy and Commerce Committee on May 8, 2014. The GAO was requested to examine the Administration's proposal to transition NTIA's authority over IANA to the multistakeholder Internet community on June 5, 2014. Representative Shimkus offered the text of the DOTCOM Act as an amendment to H.R. 4435 on May 22, 2014, which was passed by the House on the same day. The House passed H.R. 4435 on May 22, 2014, with a focus on protecting the .mil domain and maintaining separation in Internet governance. The Senate reported S. 2410 on June 2, 2014, addressing the future of the Internet and the .mil top-level domain. The Sense of Congress on the Future of the Internet and the .mil Top-Level Domain (S. 2410) advises transferring the remaining role of the United States Government in Internet functions to a global multi-stakeholder community, ensuring the '.MIL' domain and Internet Protocol addresses used by the Department of Defense remain exclusive for national security. Section 1646 directs the Department of Defense to sustain stewardship of Internet root zone servers. The committee urged the Department of Defense to ensure that the .mil domain maintains its current status as a generic top-level domain after the transition of Internet functions to a global multi-stakeholder community. The Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (P.L. 113-235) was signed into law on December 16, 2014. Section 1639 of the act emphasizes the need for assurances to protect legacy top-level domain names and Internet Protocol address numbers, especially those used for national security purposes by the Department of Defense and other U.S. government components. The United States Government institutionalizes mechanisms to protect consensus-based decision making in the multi-stakeholder approach for national security purposes. Stress-testing scenarios of the accountability process of the multi-stakeholder model work transparently to maintain a free, open, and resilient Internet. Congress urges the Secretary of Defense to sustain stewardship of Internet root zone servers managed by the Department of Defense. The House Appropriations Committee approved H.R. 4660, the FY2015 Commerce, Justice, Science (CJS) Appropriations Act, which includes funds for the Department of Commerce (DOC) and National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). The committee recommended that NTIA maintain its contract with ICANN throughout FY2015 and did not allocate funds for the transition. An amendment by Representative Duffy was adopted during House consideration of the bill. On May 30, 2014, an amendment by Representative Duffy was adopted during House consideration of H.R. 4660, stating that funds cannot be used to relinquish NTIA's responsibility for Internet domain name system functions. The bill was passed by the House on the same day. The committee directed NTIA to review the proposed transition of the IANA contract to ensure ICANN has an approved oversight plan insulated from foreign government control. NTIA must report quarterly on the privatization process and notify the committee in advance of any decisions regarding a successor. The committee directed NTIA to review the proposed transition of the IANA contract to ensure ICANN has an approved oversight plan insulated from foreign government control. NTIA must report quarterly on the privatization process and notify the committee in advance of any decisions regarding a successor contract. The committee expressed concern about NTIA's lack of advocacy for U.S. businesses and consumers in ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee and awaits a report on NTIA's plans for greater involvement in the GAC. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 prohibits NTIA from using funds to relinquish its responsibility during FY2015. During FY2015, NTIA is prohibited from using funds to relinquish its responsibility for Internet domain name system functions, including the authoritative root zone file and IANA functions. The prohibition on funding for NTIA's IANA transition activities ends on September 30, 2015. NTIA is directed to inform Congressional committees 45 days in advance of any proposed successor contract or decision related to changing its role with ICANN or IANA. The Explanatory Statement directs NTIA to report to Congress within 45 days of any proposed successor contract or decision related to changing its role with ICANN or IANA. Legislation like H.R. 4367 also addresses the proposed transition. Representative Mike Kelly introduced H.R. 4367, H.R. 4398, and H.R. 5737 in 2014 to prevent NTIA from relinquishing its DNS and domain name responsibilities without meeting specified criteria. These bills were referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce. The DOTCOM Act of 2015, reintroduced by Representative Shimkus as H.R. 805 in the 114th Congress, aims to prevent NTIA from giving up control of the Internet domain name system until a report by GAO is submitted to Congress. The DOTCOM Act of 2015, reintroduced as H.R. 805, aims to delay NTIA's transfer of control of the Internet domain name system until a GAO report is submitted to Congress. The report will analyze transfer proposals, principles, evaluation processes, national security concerns, and the multistakeholder model used by NTIA for Internet policymaking. The DOTCOM Act of 2015, now H.R. 805, aims to delay NTIA's transfer of Internet domain name system control. S.Res. 71 designates \"Internet Governance Awareness Week\" to increase public awareness about the transition process and accountability in Internet governance. At the ICANN meeting in Singapore, participants emphasized the need for accountability and governance reforms for ICANN in preparation for potential stewardship transition of IANA functions. S.Res. 71 was passed by the Senate on February 5, 2015, followed by a hearing on Internet governance preservation on February 25, 2015. ICANN is facilitating a multistakeholder process to reach consensus on a transition proposal. ICANN is facilitating a multistakeholder process to reach consensus on a transition proposal for the IANA stewardship. A draft proposal includes forming a steering group composed of representatives from various ICANN constituencies and parties affected by the transition. The IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination Group (ICG) was formed by ICANN to prepare a transition proposal. It consists of 30 individuals representing 13 communities, selected by their respective communities. The group released its charter on August 27, 2014, with a mission to coordinate the development of a proposal among affected communities. The ICG was formed by ICANN to coordinate the development of a proposal among communities affected by the IANA functions. The group requested proposals for the three primary IANA functions to be developed by operational communities associated with each function. The current status of the proposals is as follows: Domain Names proposal by CWG-Stewardship is still in progress. The CWG-Stewardship is still working on the Domain Names proposal. The CRISP Team submitted the Number Resources proposal to the ICG on January 15, 2015. The IANAPLAN WG finalized and submitted the Protocol Parameters proposal to the ICG on January 6, 2015. The CWG-Stewardship group is facing challenges in reaching a consensus on the domain name function proposal, which has led to an extension of the deadline to June 2015. Transitioning away from the NTIA contract with respect to the domain naming function is complex and controversial due to the involvement of external groups performing numbering and protocols under contract with ICANN. The debate within the multistakeholder community is whether a new organization should oversee the IANA function contract or if ICANN should be given authority with enhanced accountability measures. ICANN has initiated a process to enhance its accountability in parallel with the IANA stewardship transition. ICANN's accountability mechanisms are being strengthened due to the end of its contract with the U.S. government. A Cross Community Working Group (CCWG) has been formed to develop proposals for enhancing accountability towards all stakeholders. The Cross Community Working Group (CCWG) consists of organizations and 141 participants making decisions by consensus. Any interested person can participate but not in the decision-making process. Seven advisors will provide independent advice and research. Other members include an ICANN staff member, a past participant in Accountability and Transparency Review Team(s), and a liaison with the IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination Group (ICG). The Cross Community Working Group (CCWG) consists of organizations and 141 participants making decisions by consensus. Seven advisors will provide independent advice and research. The CCWG is pursuing two interrelated Work Streams focusing on enhancing ICANN accountability within the IANA Stewardship Transition timeline. If approved, an accountability proposal will be implemented. If approved by the CCWG chartering organizations, an accountability proposal will be submitted to the ICANN Board for approval or revision. The Workstream 1 proposal is due in June 2015, while Workstream 2 will follow after the ICANN 54 meeting in October 2015. NTIA must approve the multistakeholder community proposal for the transition to proceed. NTIA will not use appropriated funds to terminate the IANA functions contract with ICANN before September 30, 2015, or to amend the cooperative agreement with Verisign before that date. NTIA will actively monitor discussions and activities within the multistakeholder community to develop the transition plan for the authoritative root zone file. They will participate in meetings with ICANN, Verisign, other governments, and stakeholders to represent the United States. The NTIA will continue to represent the United States at ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee meetings and provide informal feedback. They support an open and participatory multistakeholder process for the transition plan of the authoritative root zone file. The community should proceed carefully as they have only one chance to get it right, and everyone has the responsibility to participate. If necessary, they will ask questions to ensure a well-thought-out plan that addresses all concerns. Administrator Strickling urged the CWG-Stewardship group to consider all transition proposal models and ensure new organizational structures are accountable. NTIA emphasized the need for stress testing solutions to prevent future attempts to influence or take over ICANN. ICANN is urged to address questions on board member removal, accountability tools, and transition timing by NTIA. Both transition processes should remain in sync, with a coordinated plan expected by summer 2015. ICANN is working on a transition plan to be delivered by summer. The target date is September 2015, but the contract can be extended if needed. ICANN is an international organization with members from around the world influencing policy decisions. The Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC) is also involved in ICANN's operations. ICANN, an international organization with members worldwide, receives advice from the Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC) composed of government representatives. The ICANN Board is not obligated to follow GAC recommendations, leading to debates on whether the U.S. government should maintain authority over ICANN and the DNS. Some suggest DNS management should be overseen by a higher intergovernmental body, with discussions at the United Nations World Summit in December 2003. The United Nations debated international involvement in Internet governance at the 2003 World Summit on the Information Society. The UN's Working Group on Internet Governance released a report in 2005 proposing further internationalization and the creation of a new global forum for Internet stakeholders. Four possible models for Internet governance were proposed, including creating new bodies linked to the U.N. ICANN could be replaced or made accountable to a higher intergovernmental body. The report's conclusions were to be discussed at the WSIS in Tunis in 2005. The U.S. opposed transferring control of the domain name system from ICANN to an international body, with Congress supporting U.S. control. The EU initially backed the U.S. position. During the WSIS Tunis Summit in 2005, conflict over control of the domain name system was resolved with an Internet governance agreement announced on November 15, 2005. The agreement involved the United States, the EU, and over 100 other nations, maintaining ICANN and the U.S. roles in the domain name system. The formation of the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) under the U.N. was established to provide ongoing international oversight. The Internet Governance Forum (IGF) was formed under the U.N. to provide a forum for stakeholders to discuss Internet policy issues. It does not have binding authority and was renewed by the U.N. General Assembly in 2010 for another five years. A Working Group on Improvements to the IGF was formed to develop recommendations for its enhancement. Controversies arose in 2010 and 2011 over new gTLDs and the .xxx TLD, leading some governments to push for more influence on ICANN policy. The United States, Canada, and the European Union support the current multistakeholder model but want a stronger role for the Governmental Advisory Committee. Brazil, South Africa, and India prefer a U.N.-based Internet policy entity. A proposal for the creation of a U.N.-based Internet policy development entity to oversee existing bodies like ICANN, while another group suggested an International Code of Conduct for Information Security promoting multilateral management of the Internet. The revised International Code of Conduct for Information Security emphasizes equal responsibility for all states in governing the Internet. The World Conference on International Telecommunications (WCIT) took place in Dubai in December 2012, organized by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). The WCIT in 2012, organized by the ITU, aimed to revise the ITRs governing international telecommunications. Key focus was on addressing Internet traffic and governance in the updated ITRs. The Administration and Congress advocated for traditional international issues to be prioritized. The 112th Congress expressed concerns about the WCIT potentially increasing intergovernmental control over the Internet. In response, a hearing was held on \"International Proposals to Regulate the Internet\" and H.Con.Res. 127 was introduced. H.Con.Res. 127 was introduced by Representative Bono Mack to preserve the multistakeholder governance model on the Internet. It passed unanimously in the House on August 2, 2012, expressing the US policy to promote a global Internet free from government control. S.Con.Res. 50, introduced in the Senate by Senator Rubio, expresses Congress's support for a global Internet free from government control and the multistakeholder model. It was passed unanimously on June 27, 2012. S.Con.Res. 50, supporting a global Internet free from government control and the multistakeholder model, was passed unanimously by the Senate and House in 2012. During the WCIT, a proposal supported by certain countries aimed to extend ITR jurisdiction over Internet governance. The proposal at the WCIT aimed to extend ITR jurisdiction over Internet governance, including the right of Member States to manage Internet resources. A nonbinding resolution was adopted as a compromise, emphasizing equal government roles in international Internet governance. The United States declined to sign the treaty at the WCIT in Dubai due to the inclusion of Resolution 3 and new ITR articles related to spam and cybersecurity. The international debate over Internet governance is expected to continue, with the 113th Congress likely monitoring and overseeing U.S. government efforts to oppose intergovernmental control over the Internet and domain name system. On April 16, 2013, H.R. 1580, a bill affirming the US policy on Internet governance, was introduced by Representative Walden. It aims to preserve the multistakeholder model governing the Internet. The bill was passed unanimously by the House of Representatives on May 14, 2013. During a meeting in Montevideo, Uruguay, ICANN and other major organizations called for strengthening global multistakeholder Internet cooperation to prevent fragmentation and address governance challenges. They expressed concern over trust erosion due to surveillance revelations. During a meeting in Montevideo, organizations emphasized the need for ongoing efforts to address Internet Governance challenges and accelerate the globalization of ICANN and IANA functions. The President of Brazil announced plans for an international Internet governance summit in April 2014, called NETmundial, to include representatives from government, industry, civil society, and academia. NETmundial was a global multistakeholder meeting on Internet governance held in Sao Paulo, Brazil on April 23-24, 2014. It aimed to craft Internet governance principles and propose a roadmap for its evolution. The outcome was a nonbinding statement setting forth general principles and identifying issues for future discussions. The meeting reaffirmed the multistakeholder model. The U.S. government delegation at NETmundial reaffirmed the multistakeholder model of Internet governance and endorsed the transition of IANA functions to the global community. They also emphasized strengthening the Internet Governance Forum and highlighted the importance of human rights in a free and open Internet. ICANN announced the formation of a Panel on the Future of Global Internet Cooperation with stakeholders from various sectors. The Panel on the Future of Global Internet Cooperation, representing a multistakeholder approach, released a report in May 2014 outlining principles for global Internet cooperation and a roadmap for future governance challenges. The creation of a NETmundial Initiative for Internet Governance Cooperation and Development was announced in August 2014 by the World Economic Forum in partnership with ICANN and other stakeholders. The NETmundial Initiative, not directly related to the April 2014 summit in Brazil, aims to apply principles for Internet cooperation and governance. The ITU's Plenipotentiary Conference in Korea, held every four years, sets general policies, strategic plans, and elects officials. The U.S. delegation had concerns about potential expansion of ITU's role. The State Department had concerns about ITU members expanding their role in Internet governance, but the conference concluded successfully with no expansion. Top Level Domains (TLDs) are suffixes at the end of web addresses, either country codes or generic TLDs like .com. Before ICANN, there were eight gTLDs. In 2000 and 2004, ICANN held application rounds for new gTLDs, with 22 currently in operation. Some are restricted to specific organizations, while others are open for registration by anyone. Applicants seek to become ICANN-recognized registries to operate name servers and implement domain name registration processes. Debate surrounds the growth of the Internet and demand for domain names. ICANN initiated a process to introduce new gTLDs in response to the increasing demand for domain names. The new gTLD program, approved in 2011, allows for the potential introduction of hundreds of new gTLDs into the domain name system. The new gTLD program, approved by ICANN in 2011, allows for the introduction of potentially hundreds of new gTLDs into the DNS. Applications were accepted from January 12 to April 12, 2012, with a required fee of $185,000. The program has sparked controversy among trademark holders, governments, and law enforcement entities due to concerns over higher costs, trademark protection, intellectual property rights, and combating cybercrimes. The Governmental Advisory Committee advocated for additional intellectual property protections and more stringent rules in the new gTLD process to combat cybercrimes. Despite some changes, opposition from trademark holders and parts of the U.S. government, including Senate and House committees, arose in late 2011. ICANN defended its gTLD program at House and Senate hearings in December 2011, stating that the new gTLDs will offer more protections for consumers and trademark holders. The organization argued that new gTLDs will bring competition, choice, and innovation to the domain name system. Despite opposition, ICANN proceeded with the gTLD expansion as planned. ICANN opened the application window for new gTLDs on January 12, 2012, receiving 1,930 applications by June 13, 2012. The evaluation phase will determine acceptance of the applications, involving multiple criteria such as extended evaluation, objections, and string contention. The approval and delegation of a new gTLD can take 9 to 20 months after the application window closes. ICANN's gTLD Applicant Guidebook outlines the evaluation process. Currently, 521 gTLDs are added to the Internet, with 894 in progress. The new gTLD program faces challenges moving forward. ICANN plans for future rounds of the gTLD program with changes to the application process. Concerns arise about potential domain name abuse in new gTLD spaces, prompting questions about ICANN's approach to intellectual property protection and preventing unlawful behavior. The Dot Kids Implementation and Efficiency Act of 2002 was enacted in the 107th Congress to create a \"kids-friendly top level domain name\" for age-appropriate content on the Internet. This legislation authorized NTIA to require the .us registry operator to establish a restricted second level domain (kids.us) within the .us TLD. The legislation authorized NTIA to establish a kids-friendly top-level domain (kids.us) within the .us TLD for age-appropriate content. Bills in past Congresses proposed a mandatory top-level domain (such as .xxx) for material harmful to minors, but did not advance. ICANN considered adding a new \".xxx\" domain for adult content, which would be voluntary for adult websites to register in addition to their existing sites. The announcement sparked controversy, with final approval pending from the ICANN Board. The ICANN Board was set to approve the .xxx domain for adult content, but the Department of Commerce and ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee requested more time to address concerns about the impact of pornography on families and children. Negotiations with ICM Registry were authorized to address these concerns. ICM Registry proposed a .xxx domain, but the ICANN Board voted against it. A revised agreement was later published for public comment, but the Board ultimately denied the domain, citing concerns about managing Internet content. ICM Registry challenged this decision before an Independent Review Panel. ICANN rejected ICM's application for a .xxx gTLD, but an Independent Review Panel ruled in favor of ICM, stating that ICANN's decision was not consistent with its policies. The ICANN Board had the final decision on whether to approve ICM's application. The ICANN Board voted to allow ICM's .xxx TLD application to move forward after postponing the decision in a previous meeting. Next steps included due diligence, negotiations on a draft registry agreement, and consultation with ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee. The ICANN Board passed a resolution to enter into a registry agreement with ICM Registry for the .xxx TLD, but will consult with the Governmental Advisory Committee on conflicting areas. Despite objections from the GAC, the Board and GAC could not reach a mutually acceptable solution. On March 18, 2011, the ICANN Board approved the registry agreement with ICM for the .xxx TLD, despite objections from the GAC. The .xxx domain became available in December 2011. Concerns about DNS security and stability persist due to vulnerabilities allowing for the distribution of false information by malicious parties. DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) have been developed to prevent malicious parties from distributing false DNS information, redirecting users to fraudulent websites. \"Signing the root\" with DNSSEC is a critical step in protecting against these attacks. NTIA issued a Notice of Inquiry seeking public comment on deploying DNSSEC into the Internet's DNS. The NTIA issued a Notice of Inquiry seeking public comment on deploying DNSSEC into the Internet's DNS infrastructure, including the authoritative root zone. Collaboration with ICANN and VeriSign led to the development of an interim approach for deploying DNSSEC in the root zone. Following testing and evaluation, ICANN published the root zone trust anchor, and root operators began serving the signed root zone. The root zone trust anchor and operators started serving the signed root zone with actual keys, making it available. DNSSEC must be adopted voluntarily by registries, registrars, and DNS server operators worldwide to enhance protection against fraudulent DNS redirection. Domain registrants are required to provide contact information for the WHOIS database, which has raised privacy concerns. Privacy concerns have arisen regarding the access to WHOIS information, with advocates pushing for limited access while businesses and government entities argue for continued public availability. ICANN's GNSO is developing policy recommendations on the data to be publicly accessible in the WHOIS database, with a narrow technical definition favored by privacy advocates being approved in 2006. The GNSO supported a narrow technical definition for WHOIS information, favored by privacy advocates, registries, registrars, and non-commercial user constituencies. Opponents urged ICANN to reconsider the working definition in June 2006. In October 2007, the GNSO deferred a decision on WHOIS database privacy and recommended more studies. The GNSO rejected a proposal for third party contact information in WHOIS. ICANN initiated four studies of WHOIS in 2011, examining misuse, registrant identification, proxy abuse, and privacy reveal feasibility. A WHOIS policy review team began its first review in 2010. The WHOIS policy review team started its review in 2010 and issued 16 recommendations in 2012 to strengthen WHOIS. ICANN approved a resolution in 2012 to redefine the purpose of collecting gTLD registration data. An Expert Working Group released recommendations in 2014 for a new Registration Directory Service to replace WHOIS. ICANN is developing steps to implement a new Registration Directory Service to replace WHOIS. Concerns over domain name ownership and intellectual property have led to the adoption of a dispute resolution policy by ICANN in 1999. ICANN implemented a uniform policy for all registrars in 1999, requiring them to wait for instructions from domain-name holders or a court order before taking action on complaints. An exception is made for \"abusive registrations\" like cybersquatting, which are resolved through a special online procedure costing around $1,000. The Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy started on December 9, 1999, and the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act was passed by the 106th Congress. The Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, part of the FY2000 Consolidated Appropriations Act, allows courts to order forfeiture, cancellation, or transfer of domain names registered in bad faith. It also provides for civil damages of $1,000 to $100,000 per domain name. The debate over ICANN's addition of new generic top-level domain names is driven by concerns about intellectual property rights and trademark protection. In the 112th Congress, bills were introduced to address online piracy by prohibiting Internet service providers from directing traffic to domain names with infringing content. Decisions regarding the DNS can impact policy issues such as intellectual property, privacy, Internet freedom, e-commerce, and cybersecurity. ICANN's decisions on Internet governance impact stakeholders globally, with a focus on Internet stability, security, competition, and fair representation. Controversies like new gTLDs and .xxx have raised concerns about ICANN's policymaking process. Some governments criticize ICANN's policymaking process, suggesting increased governmental influence. They argue for a greater role in developing Internet policies, while defenders of the multistakeholder model advocate for a bottom-up, consensus approach to protect decisions from political control. The 114th Congress will closely examine NTIA's proposed transition of authority over ICANN and the DNS to a multistakeholder-driven entity. Congress will assess if the transition is in the best interest of the United States and the Internet, monitor the development of a transition plan, and seek assurances for a stable, secure, resilient, and open DNS free of U.S. government stewardship. The 114th Congress will closely examine NTIA's proposed transition of authority over ICANN and the DNS to a multistakeholder-driven entity. Congress will assess the extent of intergovernmental control over the Internet at telecommunications conferences and the effectiveness of government agencies in countering this threat. The outcome of these issues could impact the evolution of ICANN, the DNS, and the Internet."
