    "content": "Rising procurement costs for Navy ships are a concern for Navy officials and Members of Congress. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that funding for a 30-year Navy shipbuilding plan may need to be 33% higher than Navy's plans. This has led to reduced ship procurement rates and concerns about the future size of the Navy and shipyards. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that funding for a 30-year Navy shipbuilding plan may need to be 33% higher than Navy's plans, leading to reduced ship procurement rates. Congress must decide how to address rising Navy ship procurement costs, which could impact future Navy capabilities, funding requirements, and the shipbuilding industrial base. Options include increasing funding, changing budget allocation, utilizing multiyear procurement, altering acquisition strategies, and reducing costs. The acquisition strategy for building Navy ships includes reducing shipyard fixed overhead costs, improving operating efficiency, building ships without some planned equipment, and potentially using foreign shipyards for lower construction costs. If these options are insufficient, another option could be to shift from planned designs to reduce Navy ship procurement costs. The report focuses on reducing Navy ship procurement costs by shifting to lower-cost designs for attack submarines, aircraft carriers, and surface combatants. It discusses potential advantages and disadvantages of this option and reviews recent legislative activity related to rising Navy ship procurement costs. Lower-cost designs for Navy ships, including attack submarines, aircraft carriers, and surface combatants, have been proposed by various organizations. These designs aim to reduce procurement costs by making changes such as reducing ship size. This approach is discussed in recent reports on the future of the Navy. The Navy can reduce procurement costs by shifting from nuclear to conventional propulsion for submarines and aircraft carriers, saving hundreds of millions of dollars. This strategy of reducing ship size to lower costs can be applied more widely beyond the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS). The Navy is considering reducing ship procurement costs by shifting to commercial-like hulls for its Maritime Prepositioning Force (Future) squadron, which could be applied more widely to multiple ship classes to avoid the expense of designing new hulls for each class. The Navy is exploring the use of common hull designs for multiple ship classes to reduce costs and benefit from improved production economies of scale. This strategy could be applied to various ships, such as destroyers, cruisers, aircraft carriers, missile ships, and amphibious assault ships. The idea is to use a merchant-like hull for building different types of vessels, like the LPD-17 class amphibious ship. The Navy is considering using a common hull design for various ship classes to reduce costs and improve production economies of scale. Lower-cost ship options for the LPD-17 class amphibious ship are discussed, with potential designs being individually less capable than the current planned designs. The estimated procurement costs of these lower-cost designs are also mentioned. The Navy is currently considering lower-cost options for ship designs, including the Virginia (SSN-774) class nuclear-powered submarine. The Navy plans to maintain a fleet of 313 ships, including 48 submarines, with each Virginia-class submarine costing about $2.6 billion to procure. The Navy plans to maintain a fleet of 313 ships, including 48 SSNs. To support this force, they may need to procure 35 boats over 16 years. One option is a lower-cost attack submarine with AIP system. Another option is a reduced-cost SSN. The Navy is considering a reduced-cost SSN using new \"Tango Bravo\" technologies developed by DARPA as a successor to the Virginia-class design. Non-nuclear-powered submarines are cheaper due to smaller size and different propulsion systems, with the OFT report proposing AIP-equipped non-nuclear-powered submarines for the future Navy. The Navy is considering acquiring AIP submarines to complement Virginia-class boats, potentially substituting four AIP submarines for one Virginia-class submarine in carrier strike groups. This could provide cost savings, with the possibility of procuring one Virginia-class boat plus one or more AIP submarines each year. The Navy is considering acquiring AIP submarines to complement Virginia-class boats, potentially substituting four AIP submarines for one Virginia-class submarine in carrier strike groups. This could provide cost savings, with the possibility of procuring one Virginia-class boat plus one or more AIP submarines each year. The average unit procurement cost for an AIP submarine is estimated to be roughly $600 million to $750 million, which may be higher for a U.S. Navy AIP submarine built to higher capability standards. This could result in an equal-cost ratio of substitution of three to one or possibly closer to two to one. The Navy is exploring the possibility of developing a new SSN with technologies that could reduce costs compared to the Virginia class design. The Navy and DARPA are working on a program called Tango Bravo to demonstrate these new technologies for a smaller submarine with similar capabilities as the Virginia class. The Navy and DARPA are collaborating on a program called Tango Bravo to develop a new submarine with capabilities similar to the VIRGINIA Class design. The focus is on reducing platform infrastructure and production costs, while increasing payload volume. The program aims to overcome technology barriers in shaftless propulsion, external weapons, conformal array alternatives, and other technologies. Some Navy and industry officials believed in 2004 that developing new technologies could lead to designing a new submarine equivalent to the Virginia class but with a lower procurement cost. This new submarine, referred to as \"Tango Bravo\" SSN, could be procured at a rate of two per year, offering a more cost-effective alternative to AIP submarines. Design work is proposed to start on a new \"Tango Bravo\" SSN submarine with capabilities similar to the Virginia-class but at a lower procurement cost. If pursued promptly, the first Tango Bravo submarine could be ready for procurement in a few years. The Navy is considering lower-cost options for future aircraft carriers, including medium-sized conventionally powered carriers based on different hull designs. The current design consists of large nuclear-powered carriers like the George H.W. Bush (CVN-77). These carriers have a full load displacement of about 100,000 tons and can carry an air wing of 75 CTOL airplanes and helicopters. The George H. W. Bush (CVN-77) is the last Nimitz class carrier, with a construction cost of about $6.1 billion. The next aircraft carrier, CVN-78, part of the new CVN-21 class, is estimated to cost $10.5 billion, with procurement planned for FY2008. The CVN-78 aircraft carrier is estimated to cost $10.5 billion, with procurement planned for FY2008. The next carrier, CVN-79, is planned for procurement in FY2012 and would enter service around 2019. CVN-80 is planned for procurement in FY2016. Lower-cost options include a medium-sized, conventionally powered carrier based on the LHA-6 design. The Navy is considering different options for aircraft carriers, including a medium-sized carrier based on the LHA(R) design and a small, high-speed carrier on a surface effect ship/catamaran hull design. The CSBA report recommends maintaining a force of 10 large carriers and procuring additional medium-sized carriers based on the LHA(R) design. The Navy is considering a medium-sized carrier with a displacement of 57,000 tons, carrying 30 Joint Strike Fighters, 6 MV-22 Osprey aircraft, and 15 UAVs. The unit procurement cost is estimated to be around $3 billion. The Navy is considering a medium-sized carrier with a displacement of 57,000 tons, carrying 30 Joint Strike Fighters, 6 Osprey aircraft, and 15 UAVs. The OFT report recommended substituting two of these carriers for each current large carrier to maintain the same number of manned aircraft at sea. Additionally, an alternative small, high-speed carrier displacing 13,500 tons was proposed in the report. The proposed small, high-speed carrier would displace 13,500 tons and be based on a design for an unmanned aerial vehicle carrier. It would carry 10 manned aircraft, 8 JSFs, 2 MV-22s, and 8 UAVs, with a maximum speed of 50 to 60 knots. This carrier would be slightly larger than Thailand's 11,500-ton aircraft carrier and smaller than Spain's 17,000-ton carrier or the UK's 20,600-ton carriers. The OFT report recommended a new, faster 13,500-ton carrier to replace existing UK carriers. It suggested substituting eight of these carriers for each large carrier to maintain aircraft capacity at sea. Other potential designs discussed include a large, conventionally powered carrier displacing about 100,000 tons. A medium-sized nuclear-powered carrier, based on the LHA(R) hull design, might displace about 40,000 tons and have a procurement cost lower than CVN-78. It could use a half-sized version of the CVN-78 nuclear propulsion plant and embark about two dozen VSTOL aircraft. A medium-sized nuclear-powered carrier, based on the LHA(R) hull design, might displace about 40,000 tons and embark about two dozen VSTOL JSFs. The cost for a conventionally powered carrier would be around $3 billion, while a nuclear-powered version would exceed $3 billion. This ship could be similar to France's Charles de Gaulle, which displaces 42,000 tons and carries an air wing of 34 CTOL airplanes and two helicopters. Additionally, a conceptual design for a very small, high-speed VSTOL carrier with a displacement of 4,000 tons and a maximum speed of 60 knots was developed by the Naval War College in 2000. A VSTOL carrier with a displacement of 4,000 tons, a maximum speed of 60 knots, and an air wing of seven VSTOL JSFs and two helicopters. Ship size, propulsion type, and hull type determine aircraft carrier options. Medium-sized carriers of 40,000 to 70,000 tons could operate VSTOL or CTOL aircraft, with larger ships favoring CTOL. Small carriers would likely be limited to VSTOL aircraft. The table does not provide examples of large or small conventionally powered carriers using commercial-like hulls or small nuclear-powered carriers, but such ships are possible. The Navy procured nine nuclear-powered cruisers between FY1957 and FY1975. Although a small number of nuclear-powered commercial cargo ships were built in the past, a combat ship like an aircraft carrier combining nuclear propulsion with a commercial-like hull is not provided in the table. The Navy plans to procure lower-cost options such as an 11,000-ton cruiser-destroyer (SCD), a 6,000-ton frigate (FFG(X)), and a low-cost gunfire support ship. They also plan to acquire DDG-1000 destroyers and CG(X) cruisers based on the DDG-1000 design. The CG(X) could be larger and more expensive than the DDG-1000, with procurement funding requested in the Navy's FY2007 budget. The Navy's FY2007 budget requests procurement funding for the first two DDG-1000 destroyers, which are to be larger and more expensive than the current Aegis cruisers and destroyers. The estimated cost for the first two DDG-1000s is $3.3 billion each, with subsequent ships costing around $2.5 billion each. The Navy's FY2007 budget requests procurement funding for the first two DDG-1000 destroyers, costing $3.3 billion each. The Congressional Budget Office and CAIG believe DDG-1000 procurement costs may be higher than Navy estimates. The Navy plans to procure a total of 7 DDG-1000s as part of its proposed 313-ship fleet, with a reduced procurement rate of one per year through FY2009. The FY2007-FY2011 FYDP maintains an average procurement rate of one DDG-1000 per year for the period FY2007-FY2011. Options for a reduced-cost surface combatant include an 11,000-ton cruiser-destroyer, a 6,000-ton frigate, and a lower-cost gunfire support ship based on the LPD-17 amphibious ship hull design. Another option is a new-design ship of about 11,000 tons, roughly 25% smaller than the current DDG-1000 design and larger than today's Arleigh Burke (DDG-51) class Aegis destroyers. A smaller cruiser-destroyer (SCD) could replace the CG(X) program or both the DDG-1000 and CG(X) programs. It would incorporate similar technologies, cost less to procure, have a reduced crew size, and carry a smaller payload compared to current designs. A smaller cruiser-destroyer (SCD) could replace the CG(X) program or both the DDG-1000 and CG(X) programs. It would incorporate similar technologies, cost less to procure, have a reduced crew size, and carry a smaller payload compared to current designs, including weapons, computers, displays, aircraft, and fuel. The SCD could be land-attack oriented with two Advanced Gun Systems (AGSs) or air- and missile-defense oriented with CG(X) radar capabilities. Another option suggested by CBO is a smaller, less expensive frigate to replace the DDG-1000/CG(X) effort and the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) program. The CBO estimated that a 6,000-ton FFG(X) ship could cost around $800 million and may not be equipped with the AGS like the DDG-1000. However, it could still perform non-gunfire missions similar to the DDG-1000 and LCS, serving as a replacement in the Navy's surface combatant force structure. A 6,000-ton FFG(X) could serve as a replacement for the Navy's FFG-7 class frigates and DD-963 class destroyers, carrying modern mission equipment. Another option is a lower-cost gunfire support ship based on the LPD-17 amphibious ship, with one or two AGSs on the hull design. The LPD-17 hull design for Marine operations may have a different displacement with AGSs. Initial AGS-armed LPD-17 estimated cost is $1.9 billion, subsequent ships $1.5 billion each. Navy plans to procure a 2,500- to 3,000-ton LCS and lower-cost options like a 1,000-ton surface combatant and 100-ton surface combatant as part of its proposed 313-ship fleet. The Navy plans to procure 55 Littoral Combat Ships (LCSs) as part of its 313-ship fleet. Each LCS sea frame is aimed to cost no more than $220 million, with an average ship procurement cost of about $387 million when mission modules are included. The OFT report recommended procuring a 1,000-ton surface combatant as an alternative to the LCS program, with a total acquisition cost of about $22.1 billion. The ship would have a maximum speed of 40 to 50 knots, standard interfaces for mission packages, and self-deployment capabilities. It would be supported in theater by larger ships also recommended by OFT. The OFT report recommended procuring a 100-ton surface combatant with a maximum speed of 60 knots and standard interfaces for accepting modular mission packages. These ships would be transported by a \"mother ship\" based on a 57,000-ton hull used for OFT's proposed medium-sized aircraft carrier. The 100-ton surface combatants would be supported in theater by the mother ship and possibly another larger ship recommended by OFT. The lower-cost ship designs can be assessed in terms of cost, capability, technical risk, homeporting arrangements, and impact on the shipbuilding industrial base. The potential ship designs discussed in the previous section could have lower unit procurement costs, but a complete assessment would need to consider development, design, procurement, operation, support, and disposal costs. Developing a large Navy ship can cost billions, so switching from a planned design to a new, lower-cost option could result in significant additional expenses. Switching to a new, lower-cost ship design may save money in the long run only if the design is procured in large numbers to offset the upfront development costs. Stopping an existing ship acquisition program early could expedite reaching the break-even point with a cheaper alternative design. Switching to a lower-cost ship design can reduce development costs if technologies from other ships are utilized. Building more ships to the same design decreases labor hours needed, lowering costs. The difference in cost between the current design and a cheaper alternative may be less if multiple ships have already been built to the current design. Switching to a lower-cost ship design can reduce development costs by utilizing technologies from other ships. Building more ships to the same design decreases labor hours and lowers costs. The break-even point for the lower-cost design will be further into production if the currently planned design has already entered production. If the lower-cost design can be procured at a greater annual rate, it could benefit from greater spreading of fixed overhead costs and move down the learning curve more quickly to achieve cost-reducing benefits. Navy ships have high operating and support costs over many years. Reducing life-cycle costs can involve design changes to lower procurement costs and increase efficiency. Reducing life-cycle O&S costs for Navy ships may involve design changes to lower procurement costs and increase efficiency. This can include reducing crew size by automating functions previously performed by people, such as damage control, which traditionally required larger crews. However, adding technology to automate functions may increase the ship's procurement cost if the cost of the technology is greater than the avoided expense of building extra crew-related spaces. Maintenance costs are also a significant component of ship O&S costs, and reducing these costs may require building certain parts of the ship differently. Reducing maintenance costs for Navy ships may involve building certain ship parts with more durable materials or increasing space for easier maintenance access. An alternative ship design with lower procurement costs may have higher life-cycle O&S costs, impacting total Navy expenditures in the long run. Life-cycle O&S costs of conventionally powered ships include maintenance costs. The life-cycle O&S cost of a nuclear-powered ship includes the cost of the nuclear fuel core, which is loaded into the ship's reactor at the time of construction. This core can power the ship for its expected lifespan, with costs varying for different types of nuclear-powered vessels. The cost difference between a nuclear-powered submarine and a conventionally powered submarine is smaller when considering procurement and life-cycle O&S costs due to the absence of fuel-related O&S costs for the nuclear-powered submarine. This cost advantage also applies to comparing a nuclear-powered carrier. The cost advantage of a nuclear-powered carrier over a conventionally powered carrier is evident in the comparison of procurement and life-cycle O&S costs, especially if the cost of oil is expected to be high in the future. The ownership cost of a nuclear-powered ship could be lower than a conventionally powered ship if the cost of oil is high. However, nuclear-powered ships have higher end-of-life disposal costs due to the need to defuel and transport the reactor compartment to a storage area. The ownership cost of a nuclear-powered ship could be lower than a conventionally powered ship if the cost of oil is high. A nuclear-powered carrier might cost roughly $570 million, while a lower-cost ship design like the Tango Bravo SSN could be equal in capability to the Virginia-class design. Factors affecting ship capability include ship payload, detectability, survivability, mobility, and the value of ship numbers in naval operations. As Navy combat ship size decreases, total payload also decreases due to factors like ship design and propulsion. Smaller ships become proportionately less capable than larger ones. As ship size decreases, the total weight of the aircraft that can be carried also decreases. For example, a medium-sized carrier with a potential air wing of two dozen aircraft may have a total weight equivalent to less than 40% of the aircraft on a larger carrier. When a medium-sized carrier's air wing is transferred to a larger carrier, the larger carrier can generate more sorties per day due to its larger flight deck and greater capacities. A carrier smaller than a certain size may not be able to operate certain aircraft or systems. The total cost of putting combat-related equipment to sea can increase as ship size decreases, leading to a higher total procurement cost for a fleet design with smaller ships. If crew size and fuel consumption do not decrease proportionately with ship size, this cost increase can be further exacerbated. The OFT report argues that new technologies can increase payload fraction for recommended 1,000- and 100-ton surface combatants. Precision-guidance technology allows for smaller weapons with the same impact as larger ones. Larger ships can maintain capability with reduced weapon payload through precision-guidance technology. Technology advancements could also decrease sensor weight and volume, supporting the argument for larger ships' effectiveness and survivability against enemy sensors. Supporters of larger ships and those built to military survivability standards argue that they are better equipped to withstand hits from weapons compared to smaller ships or those with commercial-like hulls. They suggest that larger ships could potentially continue operations after being hit, while smaller ships are more likely to be sunk. On the other hand, proponents of smaller ships argue that making larger ships less detectable increases costs, and a fleet composed of smaller ships may be more cost-effective. Supporters of smaller ships argue that a fleet composed of a large number of small ships could overwhelm the enemy's target-tracking capabilities and enhance overall fleet survivability. They believe that even large ships built to military standards can be sunk, concentrating too much capability in each individual platform. Supporters of smaller ships argue that a fleet with more smaller ships can have superior survivability. They suggest that using expensive, highly capable Navy ships in high-threat situations may reduce their effectiveness. Equipping a submarine with a nuclear propulsion plant changes its mobility and operational capabilities. Supporters of nuclear-powered submarines argue that nuclear power is essential to create a true submarine, as it allows for extended submerged endurance. A conventional diesel-electric submarine has limited submerged endurance, while an AIP system like a fuel-cell or closed-cycle diesel engine can improve this capability. An AIP-equipped submarine can have a submerged endurance of up to two or three weeks, while a non-nuclear-powered submarine has a high-speed submerged endurance of 1 to 3 hours due to battery limitations. A nuclear-powered submarine's submerged endurance is limited by the amount of food it can carry, allowing it to stay submerged for weeks or months at high speeds. Non-nuclear-powered submarines, even with AIP systems, are not suitable for long stealthy missions or extended submerged periods. The OFT report suggests transporting AIP submarines on a transport ship for extended periods in the theater of operations. This allows for the presence of U.S. AIP submarines to be known. A potential advantage of having an SSN in a carrier strike group is the ability to redirect it to a different theater without alerting others. The advantage of having an SSN in a carrier strike group is the ability to redirect it to a different theater without alerting others, allowing the submarine to achieve military effects in multiple theaters simultaneously. The effectiveness of an AIP submarine would depend on its day-to-day operations and performance in conflict situations while part of a forward-deployed carrier strike group. Nuclear-powered carriers in a carrier strike group can respond quickly to crises without refueling, allowing immediate combat operations upon arrival. They have more space for aircraft fuel and ammunition due to not needing large fuel tanks for propulsion. Advocates of higher-speed ships like the LCS argue that their increased speed allows for rapid location shifts and makes them harder to track. Skeptics question the benefits of speeds exceeding 30 knots. Advocates of a larger fleet argue that more ships would allow for better presence in multiple locations and quicker response to crises. They suggest that a fleet with a variety of less-capable ships could offer more flexibility in deploying appropriate naval capability. Advocates of a larger fleet argue that increasing the number of ships can enhance the force's capability through network-centric warfare and advanced technologies, promoting a shift towards more distributed force designs. Advocates of a larger fleet argue that increasing the number of ships can enhance the force's capability through network-centric warfare and advanced technologies, promoting a shift towards more distributed force designs. On the other hand, defenders of a smaller fleet of more expensive ships argue that having ships capable of performing required missions is more important than quantity. They also highlight the Navy's efforts to increase the fraction of the fleet deployed at any given time, providing flexibility in creating naval formations. Advocates of a smaller fleet argue that current ship designs offer flexibility for naval formations and network-centric warfare. They suggest that a fleet with fewer, more expensive ships could still effectively engage in warfare with the use of aircraft, unmanned vehicles, and sensors. Some lower-cost options, like AIP-equipped non-nuclear-powered submarines, may pose technical risks for the Navy. The U.S. Navy has designed and built various ships since the 1950s, including the Tango Bravo nuclear-powered submarine, a 13,500-ton high-speed carrier, and smaller surface combatants with new technologies. Smaller ships offer more homeporting options due to size restrictions in some ports, and homeporting nuclear-powered ships is more complex than conventionally powered ones. Homeporting a nuclear-powered ship is more complex than a conventionally powered one due to unique requirements, such as access to a nuclear-certified maintenance shop. Forward-homeporting a Navy ship in a foreign country can be politically challenging if the ship is nuclear-powered and there are anti-nuclear sentiments. Lower-cost ship designs could impact the shipbuilding industrial base by changing the volume or distribution of Navy shipbuilding work. Total Navy shipbuilding work is largely dependent on funding. The volume of Navy shipbuilding work is influenced by the funding available for Navy ship procurement. Shifting to lower-cost designs may or may not affect the total volume of shipbuilding work, depending on how it impacts funding. Three scenarios are possible: no significant impact on funding, resulting in no substantial change in shipbuilding work volume; using lower-cost designs to reduce total costs. The shift to lower-cost ship designs could impact Navy shipbuilding work volume by either reducing total costs or increasing funding for procurement, potentially affecting the distribution of work among shipyards. The construction of nuclear-powered submarines could involve shipyards like General Dynamics' Electric Boat and Northrop Grumman Newport News, with the division of work potentially different from current arrangements. AIP-equipped non-nuclear submarines could also be built by these shipyards or non-nuclear ones like Ingalls. NG/EB or NGNN, or non-nuclear shipyards like Ingalls at Pascagoula, MS, part of Northrop Grumman Ship Systems. Ingalls has been linked to proposals for non-nuclear submarines. Procuring AIP submarines instead of nuclear ones could impact U.S. naval nuclear propulsion component manufacturers. NGNN is the sole U.S. yard capable of constructing large nuclear-powered carriers. The NGNN is the only U.S. yard capable of constructing large nuclear-powered carriers. Other shipyards like Ingalls could build medium-sized conventionally powered carriers based on different designs. Additionally, smaller carriers with high-speed capabilities could be built using SES/catamaran hull designs by various shipyards with relevant experience. A small, high-speed carrier using an SES/catamaran hull design could be built at various shipyards with relevant experience. Procuring conventionally powered carriers instead of nuclear-powered ones may reduce work for U.S. naval nuclear propulsion component manufacturers. The construction of various naval vessels, including nuclear-powered submarines, larger surface combatants, and smaller surface combatants, is planned at different shipyards across the United States. DDG-1000 destroyers will be built at NGSS and General Dynamics' Bath Iron Works, while a 11,000-ton SCD, a 6,000-ton FFG(X), or a low-cost gunfire support ship could also be constructed at these yards or others like Avondale or NGNN. The LCS will be built at Marinette Marine, Bollinger Shipyards, and Austal USA shipyard. The House Armed Services Committee's report on H.R. 5122 discusses the procurement costs of various naval vessels, including aircraft carriers, ships, and combatants. It also mentions a shipbuilding industrial base improvement program. The House Armed Services Committee's report on H.R. 5122 highlights concerns about rising costs and delays in defense acquisition programs, leading to fewer platforms being fielded. There is a worry about an over-reliance on expensive \"mega\" systems, resulting in a \"high demand, low density\" situation. The House Armed Services Committee's report on H.R. 5122 raises concerns about rising costs and delays in defense acquisition programs, leading to a \"high demand, low density\" situation for needed platforms. The report also applauds the Navy's shipbuilding plan for providing a long-term view for the industry. The House Armed Services Committee's report on H.R. 5122 raises concerns about the Navy's shipbuilding plan, citing unrealistic assumptions and affordability issues. The plan requires a significant increase in shipbuilding funds, which may be challenging to obtain during anticipated federal spending reductions. The House Armed Services Committee's report on H.R. 5122 raises concerns about the Navy's shipbuilding plan, citing unrealistic assumptions and affordability issues. The committee is worried about the long-term affordability of the plan and the excess capacity in the U.S. shipbuilding/ship repair industrial base. The Secretary of the Navy is directed to report to the congressional defense committees on these issues. The committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to report on managing shipbuilding capacity to make Navy shipbuilding more affordable. Concerns were raised about the accuracy of the Navy's ship cost estimates. The committee recommends revising the process for deriving ship cost estimates to ensure all major known elements are included, as current estimates have been inaccurate and unrealistic. The committee recommends revising the process for deriving ship cost estimates to ensure all major known elements are included. Sections 122, 123, and 124 of the bill would impose cost limitations on three current ship classes based on the Navy's latest cost estimates. The Secretary of the Navy is directed to revalidate the cost estimates for CVN-21, ships in the LHA Replacement program, and the San Antonio class amphibious ships. The committee directs the revalidation of cost estimates for ship classes and requires a report by the Secretary of the Navy by July 1, 2006. The committee does not find the DD(X) program to be affordable. The committee finds the DD(X) program to be unaffordable due to budget constraints. Originally planned for 32 destroyers, the number was reduced to 7 to make the program feasible. However, with such a small quantity, meeting the original requirements, like naval surface fire support, is challenging. The committee suggests reducing the DD(X) requirements to procure a smaller, more cost-effective destroyer in larger quantities. It is doubtful that the DD(X) will be acquired in sufficient numbers to meet operational needs. The committee does not believe that DD(X) will be procured in sufficient numbers to meet operational needs. They support the construction of up to two DD(X)s to demonstrate technologies for future surface combatants. The budget request had no funds for the maritime technology program aimed at reducing naval ship construction costs. The committee supports enhancing efficiency in U.S. shipbuilding and repair industries by implementing cost-saving measures in ship procurement contracts. Incentive clauses have successfully lowered construction costs in specific programs, and the committee encourages expanding these efforts to all ship procurements. The committee supports cost-saving measures in ship procurement contracts, including creating a shipbuilding industrial base improvement program to lower Navy ship procurement costs. The committee recommends funding for the shipbuilding industrial base improvement program and the U.S. shipbuilding and ship repair industrial base to achieve savings in Navy ship construction. Additionally, $120.0 million is recommended for the maritime technology program, with a focus on the national shipbuilding research program (NSRP). The committee recommends $20.0 million in PE 78730N for the national shipbuilding research program (NSRP), which operates on a 50-50 cost share between government and industry. The committee also recommends funding for shipbuilding industrial base improvement grants. The committee recommends $50.0 million in PE 78730N for shipbuilding industrial base improvement grants to support U.S. shipyards in developing innovative technologies and infrastructure for naval vessel construction. The committee recommends $50.0 million in PE 78730N for shipbuilding industrial base improvement loan guarantees to support U.S. shipyards in acquiring technologies and enhancing competitiveness. Section 121 of S. 2766 authorizes funding for long-lead components for CVN-21 class aircraft carriers, while Section 123 increases the cost limit for CVN-77 to $6,057 million. The Senate Armed Services Committee noted that low shipbuilding rates were driving up costs, creating a downward spiral. The committee is concerned about cost growth on the CVN-77 program and urges the Navy and shipbuilder to find ways to improve affordability for future aircraft carriers. Procurement delays, inflation, and material escalation are contributing to the cost growth. The shipbuilder aims to achieve savings for the CVN-21 class program through stable procurement. The committee recommends increasing funding for CVN-21 class advance procurement by $50.0 million to achieve significant program savings. The Secretary of the Navy is directed to review economic order quantity and long lead time material procurement for CVN-21 class to optimize savings and submit a report to congressional defense committees with the fiscal year 2008 budget request. The report addresses procurement requirements for the CVN-21 class vessels, including economic order quantity savings and cost escalation factors. Funds for advance procurement of CVN-79 and CVN-80 cannot be obligated until 30 days after the Secretary's report. The cost limit for CVN-77 has increased to $6.057 billion due to escalation impacts, labor hour increases, overhead rates, and schedule delays. The Navy's management actions to contain cost on CVN-77 include deferral of non-essential upgrades, minimizing contract change orders, implementing Lean Six-Sigma program, and revising the schedule for more efficient completion. Despite these efforts, the Navy projects cost growth for CVN-77. The Navy's management actions to control cost on CVN-77 have not been successful, with projected costs exceeding the baseline cap by over 30%. Improved visibility into completion costs is needed to assess the effectiveness of these actions and determine further steps to enhance affordability in future naval construction projects. The Secretary of the Navy is directed to submit quarterly reports to congressional defense committees starting December 1, 2006, providing information on the CVN-77 ship construction contract, including contract target cost, Program Manager's Estimate at Completion, contractor's Estimate at Completion, contract ceiling price, end of period actual costs, and percent progress. (Page 69) The report also addresses the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) program. The report highlights cost risks in the construction of lead LCS vessels at two shipyards until completion in 2007 and 2008. Emphasizing cost control, the Navy should pursue competition, commonality, and learning curves in procuring this 55-ship class. The committee supports the Navy's approach to rapidly field LCS as part of the global war on terror strategy, but stresses the need for heightened program risk management to ensure affordability. The committee is concerned about apparent cost growth and lack of clear acquisition strategy for the LCS program, which may compromise affordability. Unclear assessment of added costs for training, maintenance, and supply support for the two flight 0 ship classes is also highlighted. The committee is concerned about cost growth and lack of clear acquisition strategy for the LCS program. They direct the Secretary of the Navy to submit a report outlining the acquisition strategy, competition plan, flight strategy, and cost containment strategy for the program by December 1, 2006. The report should include all R&D and procurement costs, as well as assess the added life cycle costs for two flight 0 ship classes. The report highlights the collaboration between the Navy and industry through the National Shipbuilding Research Program-Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise (NSRP-ASE) to reduce shipbuilding costs. Annual Navy funding, matched by industry investment, has led to cost savings, a positive return on investment, and a high research-to-implementation transition rate. The committee recommends increasing funding by $10.0 million in PE 78730N to support NSRP-ASE efforts, including developing a skilled shipbuilding workforce and establishing a national supply chain to reduce costs. The committee recommends increasing funding to support NSRP-ASE efforts, including developing a skilled shipbuilding workforce and establishing a national supply chain to reduce costs. Additionally, H.R. 5122 authorizes incremental funding for CVN-21 class aircraft carriers and establishes unit procurement cost caps. Section 123 increases procurement cost cap for CVN-77 aircraft carrier, Section 125 establishes unit cost cap for LHA(R) amphibious assault ships, Section 126 sets unit cost caps for LPD-17 class amphibious ships, and Section 215 authorizes $4 million for Navy shipbuilding technology. Section 1016 directs Navy to assess vessel construction efficiencies and contractor incentives. Caps can be adjusted for inflation. The report states that cost caps can be adjusted for inflation and other factors. The Secretary is directed to include an assessment of any negative impact of congressional actions on program costs in the annual written notice to the defense committees. The CVN-21 class budget represents the Navy's shipbuilding program. The conferees recognize uncertainties in completing CVN-21 design and construction, allowing cost adjustments for non-recurring design and engineering to reduce risk. The Navy is expected to manage program execution within budget. The conferees expect the Navy to manage program execution within budget estimates, requiring procurement cost trade-offs that may impact design and construction of the CVN-21 class. The Secretary must notify Congress 30 days before implementing any changes. The Secretary must notify Congress 30 days before implementing any cost-driven reduction that could impact safety, crew quality of life, or the program's requirements. The report clarifies that the amendment does not give the Secretary authority to adjust limitation amounts for cost increases due to congressional actions affecting the shipbuilding program. The conferees direct the Secretary to assess any negative impact of congressional action on program costs for the LHA-6 budget, which represents the Navy's risk-balanced assessment for completing the future LHA Replacement ship. Many uncertainties remain regarding the completion of design and construction, including events that will impact costs. The amendment allows adjustment to cost limitation for design and engineering to reduce risk in program execution. Navy expected to manage program within budget estimate, may require trade-offs in procurement costs affecting system performance, safety, crew quality of life, and other factors in design and construction. The conferees believe that trade-offs in the design and construction of the LHA Replacement ship will be managed by the program office. The Secretary must notify Congress before implementing any cost-driven reduction that would impact safety, crew quality of life, or program requirements. The House Appropriations Committee emphasized the importance of cost control in the Navy's long-range shipbuilding plan. Despite acknowledging the necessity of cost control, the Navy has not provided a plan or initiatives to meet the cost targets. Ongoing shipbuilding programs have shown a trend of cost growth, raising concerns about the viability of the Navy's shipbuilding plan. The House Appropriations Committee urges the Navy to set firm cost targets, develop cost control initiatives, and sign contracts to prevent cost growth in shipbuilding programs. A report recommended reducing funding by $141.4 million for FY2007 procurement to cover cost growth on previous ship procurements. The Committee remains concerned about the lack of cost control in Navy shipbuilding programs. The Navy was required to submit a plan on resolving ship construction contract issues, which was submitted late and mainly focused on cost overruns. The Committee is concerned about the gap between the Navy's statements on cost controls and the actual actions taken. Programs like the CVN-77 aircraft carrier and Virginia class attack submarines are struggling to control costs, with an estimated overrun of $867.9 million in the next 3 years alone. The Navy faces cost overruns in ship construction contracts, with an estimated $867.9 million overrun in the next 3 years for the CVN-77 production effort. Congressional legislation is needed to raise the cost cap on the program. The U.S.S. Texas and U.S.S. North Carolina projects also face cost growth issues, jeopardizing the Navy's ability to meet performance goals and increase submarine production rates. The Committee recommends $436,449,000 for Completion of Prior Year Shipbuilding Programs, with reductions allocated to various programs including CVN-77, SSN-777, SSN-776, SSN-775, and the LPD-17 class. Options to address cost overruns include reducing ship procurement rates or shifting to lower-cost ship designs. Increasing annual ship-procurement funding to an average of $14.4 billion per year in constant FY2007 dollars is one option to address rising Navy ship procurement costs. However, this may be challenging due to finite defense funding, potentially requiring cuts to other Navy or DOD priorities. The Navy has been working on improving operational efficiency in recent years. The Navy has been working on improving operational efficiency in recent years to save money for procurement programs. One option to address rising Navy ship procurement costs is to modify the funding for new Navy ships, potentially increasing the number of ships that could be procured for a given total amount of money. This option is examined in CRS Report RL32776. One option to address rising Navy ship procurement costs is to make greater use of multiyear procurement (MYP) in Navy ship-procurement programs. This could potentially increase the number of ships that could be procured for a given total amount of money, but not all programs may meet the legal requirements for MYP. However, using MYP could limit DOD's and Congress's flexibility to adjust ship-procurement plans. Using multiyear procurement (MYP) in Navy ship-procurement programs could reduce costs, but it may limit flexibility for adjusting ship-procurement plans in response to changing circumstances. Changing the acquisition strategy for building certain Navy ships, such as having all DDG-1000s built by a single yard, could save $3 billion for building 10 ships, but may cause the second yard to exit the business of building that type of ship. The Navy may be left with a single source for building certain ships, limiting competition and innovation. Using more competition in Navy ship acquisition could help spur design innovation, control costs, and ensure timely delivery. Using competition in Navy ship acquisition could involve awarding contracts for building follow-on ships in each class, similar to practices in the 1980s. This requires a high annual procurement rate or a willingness for losing yards to permanently withdraw from building that class of ship. The losing yard may permanently withdraw from building Navy ships, leaving the Navy with a single source. Steps could be taken to reduce shipyard fixed overhead costs by eliminating excess capacity or increasing other types of work. The Navy could reduce shipyard fixed overhead costs by increasing other types of work, such as construction for other government agencies or commercial ships, and improving operating efficiency through advanced design and production processes. The National Shipbuilding Research Program (NSRP) Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise (ASE) aims to achieve this goal. The Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise (ASE) aims to improve operating efficiency of U.S. shipyards compared to foreign counterparts. One option suggested is building Navy ships without some planned equipment to reduce costs, although this may impact capabilities. Installing equipment on a ship after it has entered service could increase procurement costs in the long run compared to building it during the original construction process. This strategy may end up costing more than if the ship had been built with all planned equipment from the beginning. The option to build Navy ships in foreign shipyards may be considered, but 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 7309 prohibits construction of vessels or major components in foreign shipyards unless authorized by the President for national security reasons. The provision in the annual DOD appropriations act exempts inflatable boats and rigid inflatable boats from restrictions on Navy shipbuilding funds for constructing vessels in foreign facilities. The RAND Corporation report discusses the increased cost of Navy ships today compared to decades ago and suggests ways to reduce these costs."
