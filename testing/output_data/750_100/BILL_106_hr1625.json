Congress finds that the national and international protection of human rights is a fundamental value, as enshrined in the Bill of Rights. Federal agencies possess documents on human rights violations abroad that are crucial for foreign authorities to investigate and prosecute. The United States will prosecute gross human rights violations, including those against its citizens. Foreign authorities request legal assistance for human rights violations, such as declassifying documents. Requests have been made by Guatemala, Honduras, and a Spanish court magistrate for information on General Augusto Pinochet. The US follows procedures outlined in Presidential directives for declassification requests. The United States prioritizes protecting and promoting human rights nationally and internationally through strengthened declassification procedures outlined in the Freedom of Information Act. Expedient declassification of human rights documents in compliance with US security interests will enhance the rule of law and protect global human rights. The United States prioritizes protecting and promoting human rights nationally and internationally through strengthened declassification procedures outlined in the Freedom of Information Act. This commitment will result in significant savings of Government resources and enhance the rule of law globally. The United States promotes human rights and democracy in foreign countries, but these efforts are hindered if there is impunity for human rights violations. It is crucial for newly established democratic societies to investigate and prosecute such violations to prevent the need for renewed US engagements in those areas. The United States supports efforts to end impunity for human rights violations through various steps such as truth commissions, human rights officers, and national investigations led by civil society. The US has a history of leadership in establishing war crimes tribunals like Nuremberg and Tokyo. The United States actively participates in International War Crimes Tribunals on the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. It has ratified the Convention against Torture, obligating parties to provide assistance in criminal proceedings related to torture. Additionally, as a member State of the Organization of American States, the US supports efforts to end impunity for human rights violations. The United States, as a member State of the Organization of American States, should adopt measures to ensure free access to information in cases of investigations for international crimes and human rights violations. The Guatemalan peace accords, supported by the US government, are crucial. The United States strongly supports the investigation and report by the Clarification Commission on human rights violations in Guatemala. Many questions remain unanswered, including the identity of perpetrators and the location of the disappeared. The Commission recommended legal action be taken. The Clarification Commission recommended that the Guatemalan Government use all resources to find the disappeared and return their remains to their families. Two days later, Bishop Juan Jose Gerardi, director of the Historical Memory Recovery Project, was assassinated. President Clinton expressed support for the investigation in Guatemala. In 1999, the United States acknowledged support for military forces involved in human rights violations in Guatemala was wrong and vowed to support peace efforts instead. The National Commissioner for Human Rights in Honduras requested U.S. documentation on human rights abuses. The National Commissioner for Human Rights in Honduras requested U.S. documentation on human rights violations in Honduras since November 15, 1993, which has been partly fulfilled but some aspects are still pending. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"human rights record\" refers to information on gross violations of human rights post-1944 held by the US Government. \"Agency\" includes entities like the Department of State, Agency for International Development, Department of Defense, Central Intelligence Agency, and National. The term \"gross violations of internationally recognized human rights\" is defined in section 502B(d)(1) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and includes various government agencies like the CIA, Department of Justice, National Security Council, and Executive Office of the President. SEC. 4. IDENTIFICATION, REVIEW, AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF HUMAN RIGHTS RECORDS REGARDING GUATEMALA AND HONDURAS. The Act governs the declassification and public disclosure of human rights records by agencies. Each agency must identify, review, and organize human rights records related to Guatemala and Honduras after 1944 for declassification and public disclosure within 30 days after review completion. The President must report to Congress within 150 days of the Act's enactment on each agency's compliance with declassifying and disclosing human rights records related to Guatemala and Honduras after 1944. SEC. 5. GROUNDS FOR POSTPONEMENT OF PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF RECORDS. An agency may delay public disclosure of a human rights record if there is clear evidence that the threat to national security outweighs the public interest, such as revealing protected intelligence agents or sources. The disclosure of intelligence sources or methods that are being utilized by the United States Government and have not been officially disclosed can interfere with intelligence activities. This includes matters related to military defense and intelligence operations. The public disclosure of human rights records could impair national security, reveal confidential sources, or invade privacy. The disclosure of human rights records may be postponed if it would invade personal privacy or compromise confidentiality agreements. Grounds for postponement of disclosure of a human rights record include the individual being an intelligence asset of the United States Government, with the term \"intelligence asset\" defined as a covert agent. When an agency of the United States receives a request for human rights records from certain international entities or countries investigating human rights violations, they must review and disclose the records in accordance with the standards set forth in the Act. SEC. 7. REVIEW OF DECISIONS TO WITHHOLD RECORDS. The Appeals Panel reviews agency decisions to postpone public disclosure of human rights records and directs disclosure unless there is clear evidence otherwise. The Appeals Panel reviews agency decisions to postpone public disclosure of human rights records. If the Panel agrees with the decision, they will determine alternative forms of disclosure in consultation with the agency. The agency shall make alternative forms of disclosure as described in paragraph (3), including disclosing a segregable portion of the human rights record, a substitute record, or a summary of the information. Notification of determination is required. Upon completion of its review, the Appeals Panel notifies the agency head and publishes its determination in the Federal Register within 14 days. The President is also informed with a written justification. The Appeals Panel must provide a written justification for its determination, including an explanation of the standards applied. The President has the authority to review any decision made by the Appeals Panel and the review must adhere to specific standards. The President must provide an unclassified written certification to the Appeals Panel within 30 days of their determination, stating the decision and reasons, including the standards for postponing disclosure. The Appeals Panel will then publish the President's determination. Upon receipt of the President's determination, the Federal Register will publish any unclassified written certification, statement, and materials regarding the postponement of disclosure of a human rights record. SEC. 8. The Information Security Policy Advisory Council will report to Congress on the declassification of human rights records for other countries after reviewing Guatemala and Honduras records. The report will be made public. SEC. 9. Rules of Construction. SEC. 9. RULES OF CONSTRUCTION. This Act does not limit the right to file a request with any executive agency or seek judicial review under section 552 of title 5, United States Code. Judicial review under chapter 7 of title 5, United States Code, is not precluded by this Act. SEC. 10. CREATION OF POSITIONS. Two additional positions in the Appeals Panel will be created under this Act. The President will appoint individuals with substantial human rights expertise who are not US employees and can meet security requirements. Recommendations for these positions will be sought from nongovernmental human rights organizations."
