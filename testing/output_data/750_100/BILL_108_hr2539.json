    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Violence Against Children Act of 2003\". Congress finds that people under 18 account for 12% of crime victims, with high percentages in sex crimes and kidnappings. Those aged 12-17 are over 2 times more likely to be victims of violent crime than adults. Only 28% of crimes against children are reported, with 1,200 child abuse deaths annually and 879,000 abuse victims. Child abuse has long-lasting negative effects on children and families, including delayed development, depression, substance abuse, and increased likelihood of experiencing or perpetrating domestic violence as an adult. Most local agencies lack resources to protect children and families adequately. Failure to pay child support is a form of neglect, leading to children living in poverty and facing inadequate education and health. Children living in poverty often suffer from inadequate education, lack of quality health care, and affordable housing. TITLE I--ENHANCED FEDERAL ROLE IN CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN\n\nSEC. 101.
