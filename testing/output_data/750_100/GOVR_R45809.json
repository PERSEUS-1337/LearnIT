    "content": "Critical infrastructure (CI) encompasses machinery, facilities, and information crucial for governance, public health, and the economy. Adverse events can result from loss or disruption of CI systems, whether due to natural disasters or deliberate attacks. This report outlines four key areas of policy concern for Congress: defining and identifying CI, understanding and assessing CI risk, federal organization for CI, and the role of the private sector. Presidential Decision Directive 63 (PDD-63) on critical infrastructure protection, issued in 1998, was the first significant policy in this area. Presidential Decision Directive 63 (PDD-63) in 1998 was the first policy guidance for critical infrastructure protection, framing the issue as national vulnerability to asymmetric attacks. It defined critical infrastructure as essential systems for the economy and government operations, setting ambitious national goals for their elimination. Presidential Decision Directive 63 (PDD-63) in 1998 aimed to eliminate national vulnerability to asymmetric cyber or physical attacks on critical infrastructure. Establishing consistent criteria for assessing critical assets has proven challenging due to the complexity and interconnectedness of the U.S. and global economies. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 defines critical infrastructure as vital systems and assets, physical or virtual, essential to national security and resilience. This includes nearly 7,000 operational power plants in the United States alone, supported by interconnected infrastructure and supply chains. Critical infrastructure is essential to the United States, with its incapacity or destruction having a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, public health, or safety. Policy has evolved to focus on providing essential services and conveniences to the public. The range of threats to critical infrastructure has expanded, with the intelligence community addressing asymmetric threats from state and non-state actors. The focus on asymmetric threats to critical infrastructure continues, involving state and non-state adversaries using physical or cyber means to cause damage. Natural disasters and other non-terrorism related events have also become significant concerns in critical infrastructure policy since 9/11. The USA PATRIOT Act's definition of critical infrastructure remains relevant. The definition of critical infrastructure in the PATRIOT Act remains relevant, with policymakers now including events with disruptive effects at all levels of society. Policy emphasizes infrastructure as vital for prosperity, public safety, and civic life, as seen in the National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) published by DHS in 2013. The definition of critical infrastructure has evolved to include assets, systems, and networks essential for American society, considering impacts of various hazard events. This shift towards society-centric resilience over asset protection reflects a global trend. In 2017, the Department of Homeland Security designated U.S. election systems as a sub-sector of critical infrastructure. In 2017, the Department of Homeland Security designated U.S. election systems as critical infrastructure, including physical locations and technology infrastructure essential for managing elections and validating results. These facilities play a crucial role in supporting the nation's civic life. The federal government uses critical infrastructure sectors as an organizing framework for public-private partnerships with self-identified owner-operators. DHS coordinates partnership programs, with other federal agencies as Sector-Specific Agencies (SSAs). The final section of the report discusses the roles and responsibilities of the public and private sectors, focusing on the diverse array of national economic activity and social life. The expanding definitions of critical infrastructure have policy implications for Congress, with each sector having formal coordination bodies involving private sector stakeholders and SLTT government representatives. Industry and non-profit groups may also participate. The diverse array of national economic activity and social life involves public and private sector communities of interest within the critical infrastructure enterprise. There is no single, consistently applied definition of critical infrastructure, as different perspectives on criticality continue to evolve. The evolving definitions of critical infrastructure reflect diverse interests and perspectives, shaping government programs and public-private sector relationships. Critical infrastructure policy has two distinct orientations, focusing on protection and organizational perspectives. Critical infrastructure protection (CIP) prioritizes and safeguards infrastructure assets based on their criticality, defined by the impact of their loss or disruption on essential functions of society, the economy, or government. Critical infrastructure resilience (CIR) involves investing in hazard mitigation, preparedness, and adaptation to ensure the availability of critical infrastructure functions during emergencies. National CI policy in the United States and other developed countries has shifted towards focusing on system resilience over asset protection, reflecting a hybrid approach that combines elements of both Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) and Critical Infrastructure Resilience (CIR). This evolution stems from concerns following the 9/11 attacks, with an emphasis on ensuring the availability of critical infrastructure functions during emergencies. The challenge lies in defining criticality and identifying what is truly critical in varying contexts. The report discusses \"critical infrastructure security\" without favoring CIP or CIR, focusing on identifying systems and assets that require higher levels of protection. Legislation post-2001 emphasizes creating asset lists to determine what is most important and needs protection. The report emphasizes the importance of identifying critical infrastructure systems and assets that require protection. National-level issues persist in asset identification and prioritization, with inventory requirements being the first step in risk management strategies. Defining criticality criteria remains a topic of debate, but list/no-list decisions help determine specific critical assets. The National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets, released in February 2003, directed the Department of Homeland Security to develop a uniform methodology for identifying critical facilities and build a comprehensive database. This was followed by Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 in December 2003. The 2003 release of Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD-7) directed federal departments to identify, prioritize, and protect critical infrastructure to prevent deliberate attacks. HSPD-7 laid the foundation for CI policy development until it was replaced by PPD-21 in 2013. The 2006 DHS Inspector General report found shortcomings in the Department's National Asset Database, which had grown rapidly from 160 key assets in 2003 to 77,069 assets in 2006. The database included a wide range of assets, from nuclear power plants to petting zoos and water parks, with many entries lacking clear criticality. The 2006 DHS Inspector General report identified issues with the National Asset Database, which had expanded rapidly to include 77,069 assets by 2006. The database lacked standardized data collection procedures, leading to discrepancies in asset categorization between cities. Congress later mandated the creation of a National Asset Database and a classified list of \"prioritized critical infrastructure\" through the 9-11 Commission Act of 2007. The 2006 DHS Inspector General report highlighted issues with the National Asset Database, which had grown to include 77,069 assets. Congress mandated the creation of a classified list of \"prioritized critical infrastructure\" through the 9-11 Commission Act of 2007, to be updated annually and submitted to Congress. The list includes assets that could cause national or regional catastrophic effects if disrupted or destroyed, with the Secretary implementing quality control procedures to ensure asset nominations meet criticality thresholds. The report highlighted issues with the National Asset Database and the National Critical Infrastructure Prioritization Program (NCIPP) processes for critical asset identification. Significant questions regarding reporting criteria and methodology persisted, with frequent changes in nomination and adjudication criteria. NCIPP assessed criticality based on potential adverse consequences like fatalities, economic loss, mass evacuation length, and national security impacts. Methodological adjustments were made to account for unique critical infrastructure characteristics. The report highlighted issues with the National Asset Database and the National Critical Infrastructure Prioritization Program (NCIPP) processes for critical asset identification. Methodological adjustments were made to account for unique critical infrastructure characteristics. Recommendations were made to Congress for an independent peer review of asset nomination vetting methods to ensure the NCIPP list identifies the nation's highest priority infrastructure. The NCIPP prioritizes critical assets, elevating them to national significance. This impacts risk assessments, regulatory administration, grant programs, criminal prosecutions, and emergency response coordination. The number of nominated assets is classified but in the thousands. Despite its importance, some states choose not to participate in DHS data calls. The 2013 GAO report highlighted that some states were not participating in DHS data calls due to various reasons like compliance burdens, technical limitations, and cost-benefit calculations. States mentioned a lack of expertise in developing scenarios and modeling complex infrastructure systems. This led to the NCIPP list not being a complete national inventory of critical systems and assets. Additionally, DHS was found to be non-compliant with the statutory annual reporting requirement. The complexities of CI inventory and categorization suggest persistent difficulties in ensuring completeness, quality, and currency of centralized inventories of CI assets. CIR prioritizes adaptive use of critical capabilities for continuity of service during stress on infrastructure systems, expanding data collection to include all assets within a sector useful for emergency planning. The Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) is a major CI interagency database that compiles data from public and private sector partners. It is used to identify alternative means of maintaining critical functions and providing essential services during compromised systems. HIFLD is accessible to eligible law enforcement, emergency management, and other organizations at all levels of government. HIFLD is a CI interagency database with data from public and private partners. It includes critical assets for homeland security functions curated by partner agencies. These assets support lifeline CI functions like energy, communications, transportation, and water systems. Additionally, HIFLD contains asset categories that may become critical in specific emergencies or CI policy decisions. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) used the HIFLD database during the 2017 hurricane season to locate day care centers in impacted areas. These centers, while not traditionally considered critical infrastructure, were essential for HHS to provide critical public health services. The HIFLD partnership model enables relevant agencies to leverage infrastructure data for real-world use cases, informing preparedness and incident management activities for federal and SLTT agencies. The HIFLD partnership model facilitates the use of infrastructure data for preparedness and incident management activities by federal and SLTT agencies. Despite declining state participation in NCIPP, CIP-based approaches to inventory of critical infrastructure assets remain relevant, as seen in provisions of the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act related to national preparedness against electromagnetic threats. Chemical manufacturing facilities posing high risks are still subject to DHS inspection and enforcement. The DHS continues to enforce regulations under CFATS to protect facilities from cyber and physical threats. Policy shifts towards system-level resilience may impact legacy programs like NCIPP. Stakeholder participation in NCIPP has costs, and Congress may need to consider data call frequency. Congress may need to consider updates to National Asset Database requirements in the 9/11 Commission Act to align with emerging CISA programs and priorities, and ensure relevance to other authorized programs like the Homeland Security Grant Program. This is part of a larger effort to understand and assess homeland security risks. The national effort to systematically understand and assess homeland security risks includes authoritative assessments of national level risk to critical infrastructure. Risk assessments inform planning, resource allocation decisions, congressional appropriations, emergency preparedness, regulatory oversight, federal grant funding, and voluntary security measures. DHS defines risk as the potential for unwanted outcomes resulting from incidents, events, or occurrences. DHS defines risk as the potential for unwanted outcomes resulting from incidents or occurrences, determined by likelihood and consequences. Risk factors include threat, vulnerability, and consequence. Threat is defined as potential harm from natural or man-made occurrences, individuals, entities, or actions. Threat assessments consider human adversaries or natural hazards, with estimates based on available information about threat actors, motivations, capabilities, and observed targets. Vulnerability assessments provide information about characteristics of assets or systems that may leave them open to exploitation or damage from a threat or hazard, incorporating likely timing, methods, and frequency of attacks. Likelihood and severity of natural hazards are estimated using past event databases and predictive modeling. Vulnerability assessments identify characteristics of assets or systems that may be exploited or damaged by threats or hazards, leading to recommendations for resilience measures. DHS defines consequence as the impact of an event, with criticality assessments focusing on potential disruptions to infrastructure systems. Various technical and non-technical methods are used to assess consequences and develop modeling methodologies. Industry groups and experts use various modeling methodologies to inform security investments. Consequence-based criticality assessments, combined with threat and vulnerability assessments, help in risk evaluations. Since 2007, DHS has incorporated these elements into its planning and budget activities, defining risk as a function of threat, vulnerability, and consequence. Critics have questioned the effectiveness of this approach. Critics challenge the DHS formula for risk assessment, questioning its ability to assign probabilities to rare events like terrorist attacks accurately. The formula's terms are not always independent, leading to complexities in applying it to grant applications and resource allocation decisions. In 2018, DHS acknowledged the need for a more comprehensive risk assessment approach for critical infrastructure. In 2018-2019, significant legislative and executive branch initiatives were implemented to enhance CI risk assessment. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Act of 2018 created CISA as a dedicated agency for infrastructure security, elevating CI risk management as a policy focus. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has established the National Risk Management Center (NRMC) to focus on managing national critical infrastructure (CI) risk. The NRMC will use an evolved approach that emphasizes cross-sector analysis and capabilities-oriented approaches to identify and prioritize CI risks. Congress may request information from CISA on its efforts to institutionalize new risk management methods and ensure validation by external reviewers. The Homeland Security Act allows the Secretary of Homeland Security to utilize expertise from various organizations for infrastructure risk assessment. Congress can set funding priorities and program guidance to support national critical infrastructure security goals. Federal organization addressing critical infrastructure issues has evolved in response to emerging threats and homeland security maturation. Federal attention to critical infrastructure (CI) policy increased in the 1990s due to concerns about potential malicious exploitation of technology and physical infrastructure. Three key periods of development are highlighted: initial policy coordination in the late 1990s, post-9/11 reorganization to counter terrorist threats, and the ongoing transition to an all-hazards resilience framework for infrastructure security. The Clinton Administration established the Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection in 1996 to address emerging cyber threats. PDD-63, issued two years later, mandated the government to eliminate vulnerabilities in critical infrastructures within five years. The focus was on increasing interagency coordination to enhance security measures. The National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection and Counter-Terrorism, created by PDD-63, did not report directly to the President. Their duties included leading an interagency coordination group and serving as executive director of a stakeholder advisory group. The Gilmore Commission, chartered by Congress in 1999, found that implementation of PDD-63 was incomplete in their report \"Toward a National Strategy for Combating Terrorism\" submitted in 2000. The report highlighted incomplete implementation of PDD-63 in the nascent CIP enterprise, with ISACs still in early stages and lacking a national CIP strategy. The National Coordinator lacked sufficient time and authority for CIP responsibilities. The National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC) under FBI auspices had taken few concrete actions to establish its basic functions. The 9/11 attacks had a galvanizing effect on homeland security policy and critical infrastructure protection, leading to urgent national concerns and legislative actions. The options for restructuring homeland security included enhancing the Office of Homeland Security's coordination role or consolidating functions under a new National Homeland Security Agency. These options aimed to improve interagency coordination and protection against terrorist attacks. The National Homeland Security Agency was established following recommendations from the Hart-Rudman Commission to consolidate security functions for better coordination and executive authority. This was in response to concerns about vulnerability to terrorist attacks due to dispersed responsibilities across federal departments. The Homeland Security Act of 2002, influenced by the Hart-Rudman Commission, transferred infrastructure security functions to DHS from various sectors. GAO flagged the creation of DHS as high risk in 2003 due to the challenges of merging numerous agencies. DHS integrated nearly three dozen federal agencies into four major directorates. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred infrastructure security functions to DHS from various sectors, integrating nearly three dozen federal agencies into four major directorates prioritizing homeland security missions, especially counterterrorism. This represented a change in infrastructure policy, previously seen as only tangentially related to counterterrorism functions before 9/11. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) distinguished Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) as a separate mission from counterterrorism before 9/11. They highlighted that infrastructure risks included various hazards beyond terrorism, such as equipment failure, human error, weather, natural disasters, and criminal activity. CIP funding that overlapped with counterterrorism was minimal according to the 2001 report. After 9/11, the budget for Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) significantly increased, with the White House requesting $12.1 billion for FY2004, reflecting the newfound importance of counterterrorism priorities. This marked a shift from the previous minimal overlap between CIP funding and counterterrorism efforts. The White House requested $12.1 billion for FY2004 for Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP), a 450% increase from pre-9/11 levels. CIP was redefined as a counterterrorism mission, leading to the creation of a new department to prioritize homeland security missions under unified leadership. The consolidation of functions post-9/11 transferred homeland security funding to a single agency, but independent agencies within DHS retained significant independence. Despite changes, Critical Infrastructure Protection remains a distributed enterprise competing for limited resources across the federal government. Terrorism threat continues to be a top national priority. By 2005, public concern about terrorism had significantly decreased since 9/11, with only 6%-8% of Americans considering it a top issue. This trend has continued, with occasional spikes due to high-profile incidents. After Katrina, the failure of New Orleans' levy system highlighted vulnerabilities to diverse hazards beyond terrorism, such as equipment failure, human error, weather, and criminal activity. In 2006, the Critical Infrastructure Task Force of the Homeland Security Advisory Council began addressing these national-level policy concerns. The Critical Infrastructure Task Force of the Homeland Security Advisory Council argued that government policies focused too much on protecting assets from terrorist attacks, rather than improving resilience against various threats. This defensive approach was deemed \"brittle\" as not all targets could be protected, leaving the nation vulnerable to consequences. In 2008, the House Committee on Homeland Security held hearings on resilience, where DHS officials discussed the importance of enhancing resilience measures. The 2010 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review highlighted the importance of resilience in addressing a range of challenges faced since 9/11, emphasizing the diversity of missions and stakeholders in homeland security. The 2010 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review emphasized the range of challenges faced since 9/11, including natural disasters, cyberattacks, criminal activities, and contagious diseases. It highlighted DHS's leadership in managing risks to critical infrastructure and other homeland security missions. The report presented homeland security as a decentralized enterprise involving diverse stakeholders in the public and private sector. PPD-21 replaced HSPD-7 in 2013, shifting focus from physical infrastructure protection to all-hazards resilience. It emphasized the need for critical infrastructure to be secure and able to recover rapidly from any hazard, integrating with the national preparedness system. The 2014 QHSR expanded critical infrastructure security to include aging and neglect of systems, making investment and maintenance homeland security concerns. DHS did not submit a QHSR to Congress in 2017, leaving no current strategic direction for infrastructure security or other homeland security goals. The boundaries of responsibility for critical infrastructure security are still being negotiated among various stakeholders, including Congress, executive branch departments, and private-sector entities. Congress has directed transfers of facilities like the Plum Island Animal Disease Center to DHS under the Homeland Security Act due to concerns about potential terrorist threats to the nation's food and agriculture sector. After a brief period of consolidation in the early 2000s, critical infrastructure security in the federal government has evolved into a distributed enterprise structured by partnerships and policy frameworks emphasizing an all-hazards approach. Congress authorized the transfer of a replacement facility back to USDA from DHS in 2018 under the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018. The evolution of critical infrastructure security in the federal government has led to a distributed enterprise model based on an all-hazards approach. Congress may need to determine the division of responsibilities between homeland security and other areas like commerce and public utilities regulation. The definition of homeland security is expanding beyond counterterrorism roots, with DHS yet to submit a top-level strategy to Congress since 2014. The 2014 QHSR highlighted the need for a more current strategy to define Departmental goals related to critical infrastructure security. Congressional interest in homeland security strategy was shown by the Quadrennial Homeland Security Review Technical Corrections Act of 2019 (H.R. 1892), which passed the House of Representatives unanimously. The Quadrennial Homeland Security Review Technical Corrections Act of 2019 (H.R. 1892) passed the House of Representatives unanimously and aims to require DHS to consult with advisory committees when developing its strategy, linking it with budgeting and program management. Congress has periodically defined organizational relationships within DHS, transitioning from a centralized to a more federated structure. The National Protection and Programs Directorate became an agency within DHS through the 2018 CISA Act, shifting towards a more federated structure. Congress may evaluate the intra-Departmental organization within DHS to determine the best approach for supporting critical infrastructure security. Privately owned critical systems failing could put the public at risk. Privately owned critical systems failing could put the public at risk. Management of CI risk in a complex ownership and regulatory environment poses policy challenges. The federated partnership model, outlined in PDD-63, emphasizes voluntary collaboration between public and private sectors for critical infrastructure security. CI owner-operators, not the government, are responsible for assessing and mitigating risk. Congress has tasked executive branch agencies with managing risk at the enterprise level. The current framework for infrastructure risk management involves collaboration between public and private sectors, focusing on incentives, information sharing, and voluntary investments in security. While private individuals or entities primarily invest in critical infrastructure security, the most serious risks are shared collectively by the public and larger business community. Government and private-sector representatives work together to determine security and resilience investments at the enterprise level. At the enterprise level, stakeholders collaborate to determine necessary security and resilience investments for managing critical infrastructure risks at the societal level. The responsibility for upfront costs and regulatory measures can be challenging to allocate, with the federal government relying on the private sector to develop risk management strategies voluntarily. The 2013 NIPP emphasizes government-industry partnerships for infrastructure resilience, with varying effectiveness in encouraging voluntary investments. Industry participation incentives include access to government risk information on security threats. The benefits of improved access to risk information from government sources on security threats and hazards, national-level risk analyses, and engagement with government to influence critical infrastructure policy were highlighted. The Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002 aimed to facilitate information sharing between the public and private sectors while ensuring confidentiality through the Protected Critical Infrastructure Information (PCII) program. Public-private coordination councils were also established under presidential authority. Public-private coordination councils established under presidential authority provide a forum for policy discussions and deliberation. A 2019 OECD report found that voluntary information sharing partnerships may not guarantee sufficient investments in resilience. Regulatory mandates are favored for critical infrastructure sectors to spur investments in resilience. Regulatory mandates are favored for critical infrastructure sectors where incident impacts are potentially catastrophic, such as nuclear meltdowns, gas pipeline explosions, airliner crashes, or terrorist theft of chemicals. Collaborative approaches in public-private partnerships for CI security are more common as risks become more privatized. Policymakers aim to limit government regulatory reach within the CI security enterprise. The Homeland Security Act established DHS with broad responsibilities but limited regulatory mandates. The Transportation Security Administration oversees oil and gas pipeline security without regulatory authority. The Coast Guard regulates port security independently of DHS. CISA directly regulates certain chemical facilities to prevent terrorism. The Chemical Facilities Anti-Terrorism Standards program aims to prevent terrorist exploitation of the chemical industry. Other agencies like the Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulate civilian nuclear facilities for safety and reporting requirements. These regulations stem from incidents like the Three Mile Island meltdown in 1979. The NRC oversees facility protection against deliberate attacks, not DHS. Lessons from early experiences with NIPC led to separating regulation and partnership roles. DHS infrastructure security programs focus on enhancing collaboration with partners through information sharing. The current collaboration with infrastructure security partners includes information sharing, analysis, training, and coordination capabilities. It is organized under the authority of PPD-21 and implemented through sector and cross-sector partnership structures outlined in the 2013 NIPP, which emphasizes distributed responsibility among stakeholders committed to common national resilience goals. The NIPP partnerships at the federal level are administered by CISA in collaboration with other DHS components and federal departments. Each of the 16 CI sectors has its own Government Coordinating Council (GCC) and Sector Coordinating Council (SCC) to enable coordination on infrastructure issues. DHS leads or co-leads 10 of the 16 GCCs as the Sector-Specific Agency (SSA). The Sector-Specific Agencies (SSAs) including DHS, EPA, GSA, and various departments lead or co-lead 10 of the 16 Government Coordinating Councils (GCCs) in partnership with the Critical Infrastructure (CI) sectors. SSAs utilize NIPP partnership structures to develop sector-specific infrastructure protection plans tailored to unique sector characteristics and risks. These plans analyze sector risks, interdependencies, and stakeholders to support the overall goals of the NIPP. The Sector-Specific Councils (SCCs) are comprised of private-sector trade associations and CI owner-operators, recognized by the Government Coordinating Councils (GCCs) as representative of the sector. They have advisory, coordination, and information-sharing functions with the federal government and support Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) specific to their sector. The National Council of ISACs lists 24 member organizations that facilitate information sharing among stakeholders. ISACs maintain operations centers, deploy representatives to NCCIC and NICC, conduct preparedness exercises, and provide informational products for members. Private-sector participation in SCC activities varies across sectors. The State, Local, Territorial, and Tribal Government Coordinating Council (SLTTGCC) enhances infrastructure resilience partnerships between jurisdictions. The Critical Infrastructure Cross-Sector Council coordinates issues among private-sector stakeholders. The Regional Consortium Coordinating Council promotes sharing of best practices among regional coalitions. The Federal Senior Leadership Council (FSLC) leads CI resilience coalitions, fosters policy consensus among federal agencies on risk management strategies, coordinates with other cross-sector councils, and collaborates with international partners. The Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council (CIPAC) facilitates discussions between CI stakeholders on sensitive topics related to infrastructure security. It provides legal exemptions for NIPP coordinating councils and member organizations to engage in these discussions. The NIPP partnership structure engages government and private-sector stakeholders to provide policy advice to DHS. The HSAC advises the Secretary of Homeland Security on homeland security matters, with members from various sectors appointed by the Secretary. Subcommittees, including those focused on cybersecurity and emerging technologies, may be established as needed. The National Infrastructure Advisory Council, established in 2001, advises the President and SSAs on critical infrastructure policy, serving as an intermediary between coordination councils, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the President. It monitors sector coordinating councils and promotes information sharing mechanisms. The partnership structure of sector coordinating councils involves various activities such as symposia, research collaborations, working groups, policy deliberations, and emergency preparedness. Participation in these activities includes governmental and non-governmental stakeholders, with a focus on improving risk management practices and addressing interdependencies in critical infrastructure systems. The National Infrastructure Coordinating Center (NICC) within the distributed partnership structure maintained by DHS collects, analyzes, and shares real-time threat information throughout the critical infrastructure network. It also provides training, exercises, and decision support to private sector partners as part of the DHS National Operations Center. The DHS National Operations Center and the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) are key components of the Department of Homeland Security's operations. CISA administers both centers to enhance information sharing and trust between the public and private sectors for system-level resilience. The private sector's collaboration with federal departments for system-level resilience is being questioned. Private-sector participation in initiatives needs to incentivize effective investments in risk reduction programs. Legislative remedies may be needed for broader investments in risk reduction. The critical infrastructure enterprise's diversity leads to varying answers across sectors. A 2013 study found that less than half of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors had strong \"communities of interest\" engaging in CIP issues through NIPP partnerships. Strongest in sectors with trade associations facing specific threats. A 2011 study highlighted private-sector risk mitigation investment driven by cost-benefit analysis. Private-sector risk mitigation investment is driven by cost-benefit analysis. GAO testimony to Congress in 2014 highlighted challenges in DHS partnership efforts, including barriers to sharing information and evaluating performance. GAO found that DHS lacks systematic data collection on industry participation in security surveys and vulnerability surveys, hindering the evaluation of program effectiveness. Despite DHS agreeing to corrective measures, GAO has not verified their progress. Limited measures exist to assess the effectiveness of partnership activities in meeting critical infrastructure resilience goals. Congress may need to further investigate DHS progress. CISA and its predecessor organizations have not provided reliable data on the effectiveness of public-partnership programs in incentivizing information sharing and investments in national resilience. Congress may need to explore DHS progress in implementing data gathering initiatives to assess partnership effectiveness. Congress may address gaps in the effectiveness of public-partnership programs by introducing reporting requirements and enhancing regulatory authorities of federal departments and agencies to meet national critical infrastructure resilience goals. An example is the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018. The Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 (FIRRMA) expands CFIUS jurisdiction to prevent foreign adversaries from gaining control of critical infrastructure assets. Congress may consider adjusting partnership structures for better information sharing and policy coordination. The partnership structures may need adjustment to align with the federal risk management approach, focusing on inter-sectoral analysis and resilience. National Critical Functions and Key Terms are included in the document."
