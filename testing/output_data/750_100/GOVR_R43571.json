    "content": "Federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs have been in existence since the National Defense Education Act of 1958. These programs offer borrowers the opportunity to have their student loan debt forgiven or repaid in exchange for service in certain professions or occupations. Federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs have been established since 1958, offering borrowers the chance to have their student loan debt forgiven or repaid in exchange for work in specific fields or meeting certain conditions. Currently, there are over 50 authorized programs, with around 30 operational as of October 1, 2017. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs involve the federal government forgiving or canceling a portion of a borrower's student loan debt or making payments on their behalf. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs offer borrowers the chance to have their student loan debt forgiven or repaid in exchange for work in specific fields or meeting certain conditions, such as completing a period of employment in public service or certain occupations. These programs provide a financial incentive to encourage individuals to enter public service or a particular profession. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs provide financial incentives for individuals to work in high-need professions or occupations, offering debt relief to borrowers of federal student loans who choose public service or specific specialties. Debt relief options for federal student loan borrowers include income-driven repayment plans and various forms of loan discharge for specific circumstances such as disability, death, school closure, false certification, unauthorized loans, unpaid refunds, successful defense to repayment assertion. The NDSL program, established in response to the Soviet Union's Sputnik satellite launch in 1957, offered loan forgiveness to borrowers. Congress targeted education funding to address national security concerns. The NDSL program was established by Congress to improve education programs for national security reasons. It provided low-interest loans to college students and included a student loan forgiveness component to encourage more teachers in U.S. schools. The NDSL loan forgiveness provisions were amended over the years to target teachers in schools with low-income students or students with disabilities. Benefits were also extended to those in Head Start programs or serving in the Armed Forces. Borrowers could have a portion of their loans canceled based on years of public service completed. The NDSL program was incorporated into the Higher Education Act of 1965 and later renamed the Federal Perkins Loan Program. Other federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs were established for borrowers in different professions and high-need areas. Loan forgiveness components were also incorporated into programs like the Health Professions Student Loan Program. The report identifies and describes federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs authorized by federal law. Over 50 programs currently exist, offering borrowers up to 50% loan forgiveness for practicing in health manpower shortage areas. The descriptions aim to inform policymakers about program purposes and designs. The report outlines over 50 federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs authorized by federal law, each designed to provide debt relief to borrowers who fulfill specific service requirements. Additional resources such as federal statutes, regulations, and agency guidance are recommended for comprehensive program details. Debt relief programs for borrowers involve specific service requirements, employment in certain professions, serving in designated locations, or adhering to income-driven repayment plans. Each program varies in eligibility criteria, benefit amounts, funding sources, and delivery methods. Various parameters are used to characterize the authorized programs, with unique features distinguishing them. Terms like loan forgiveness are commonly associated with these programs. This report uses consistent parameters to describe different debt relief programs, including employment-focused loan forgiveness and repayment plans. Borrowers must meet specific criteria such as working in certain professions or locations for a set period to qualify for benefits. Forgiveness in student loan repayment plans requires borrowers to repay based on income for a specified period to qualify for debt relief. At the end of the term, a portion of the qualifying debt is forgiven or repaid. The availability of benefits may be entitlement-based or discretionary. Loan forgiveness and loan repayment programs are available to qualified borrowers based on the discretion of the program administrator and fund availability. Loan forgiveness benefits are broadly accessible to borrowers of qualified loans, outlined in loan documents. Eligible borrowers meeting program criteria are entitled to loan forgiveness benefits. Loan forgiveness benefits for qualified borrowers are funded through mandatory appropriations and categorized as federal student loan subsidy costs. There are two main types of loan forgiveness: for public service employment and following income-driven repayment. Loan repayment programs offer debt relief for specific service, profession, or location. Loan repayment programs typically repay some or all of a borrower's student loan debt or provide funding for this purpose. These programs are separate from federal student loan programs and are designed to address employment needs or shortages in specific areas or professions. Loan repayment benefits are available to help federal agencies recruit and retain qualified employees. These benefits are discretionary and subject to fund availability. Some programs may result in federal income tax liability for the recipient. Debt forgiven under an employment-focused loan forgiveness program is usually excluded from a borrower's gross income for federal income tax purposes. However, debt forgiven following income-driven repayment or repaid for public service employment is often included in a borrower's gross income, leading to income tax liability. The three categories of debt relief programs examined in this report include loan forgiveness for public service employment, loan forgiveness following income-driven repayment, and loan repayment for public service employment. Federal student loans made through programs authorized by Title IV of the Higher Education Act may be eligible for inclusion in these programs. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs cover federal student loans authorized by Title IV of the Higher Education Act, as well as loans from Title VII and Title VIII of the Public Health Service Act. Private education loans may also be eligible for some programs. Federal student loans eligible for loan forgiveness or repayment include loans from the Direct Loan program authorized under Part D of Title IV. Previously, loans were also made through the Federal Family Education Loan program until June 30, 2010. The Direct Loan program, authorized under Part E of Title IV, involves federal student loans made by the government with federal capital. Loan origination, servicing, and collection are managed by federal contractors. Nonprofit guaranty agencies handle federal loan insurance and loan forgiveness benefits. During the period when the FFEL and Direct Loan programs both operated, loans were made through each program with similar borrower terms and conditions. Differences in availability of loan forgiveness benefits are noted. Perkins Loans were made by institutions of higher education with a mix of federal and institutional capital. The Perkins Loan program involved institutions serving as lenders, responsible for originating and servicing loans. The primary loan types in HEA, Title IV federal student loan programs include Direct Subsidized Loans for undergraduates with financial need, subsidized by the government during enrollment. Direct Subsidized Loans are available to undergraduate students with financial need, enrolled at least half-time during grace periods and deferment. Borrowing limits apply, with $21.5 billion in loans issued in FY2017. Direct Unsubsidized Loans are non-need-based and open to all students. Direct Unsubsidized Loans are non-need-based loans that can be used to cover parts of a student's cost of attendance. Borrowers are responsible for paying all accrued interest, with borrowing limits in place. In FY2017, 8.1 million Direct Unsubsidized Loans totaling $49.8 billion were issued. Direct PLUS Loans, totaling $49.8 billion, are available to parents of undergraduate students and graduate/professional students. These non-need-based loans can cover postsecondary education expenses exceeding the student's estimated financial assistance. Borrowing limits are based on the cost of attendance minus other financial aid received. In FY2017, Direct PLUS Loans totaling $12.5 billion were made to parents of undergraduate students and $9.9 billion to graduate and professional students. Direct Consolidation Loans allow borrowers to combine federal student loans into a single loan and extend repayment period. Consolidation Loans allow borrowers to combine different types of federal student loans, including those authorized under Title IV of the HEA and Title VII and Title VIII of the PHSA. This feature enables borrowers to access loan forgiveness and repayment benefits that may not have been available with their original loans. In FY2017, 0.9 million Direct Consolidation Loans totaling $48.8 billion were made, with interest rates based on the weighted average of the loans being consolidated. Perkins Loans, available to undergraduate and graduate students, had a fixed interest rate of 5% and were prioritized for students with exceptional financial need. In FY2017, approximately 253,000 Perkins Loans totaling $782,230 million were made, with a fixed interest rate of 5% per year. Borrowers engaged in public service may have a portion of their loans cancelled. HRSA, within HHS, offers student loans to health professions students through five loan programs, making 20,849 loans totaling $162.8 million in academic year 2016-2017. The HRSA offers student loans through five programs in academic year 2016-2017, totaling $162.8 million. One program provides low interest rate loans to students in dentistry, optometry, pharmacy, podiatric medicine, or veterinary medicine. Another program offers fixed interest rate loans to students in allopathic or osteopathic medicine. The Primary Care Loan Program in allopathic or osteopathic medicine is administered by individual medical schools for financially needy US citizens, nationals, or lawful permanent residents. Participants must complete a residency in a primary care field and practice in that field for 10 years in exchange for receiving a loan. Loan recipients who do not meet the service requirements must repay their loans at a higher interest rate. HRSA estimated making 252 loans totaling $17.8 million in the 2016-2017 academic year. The HRSA Primary Care Loan Program provides need-based, low-interest loans to students from disadvantaged backgrounds pursuing degrees in various healthcare fields. Administered by individual schools, the program made 252 loans totaling $17.8 million in the 2016-2017 academic year. The HRSA Primary Care Loan Program in the United States provided 1,619 loans totaling $21.7 million for the academic year 2016-2017. It offers low-interest rate loans to students pursuing nursing degrees. Additionally, 10,138 loans totaling $31.8 million were given to registered nurses completing graduate studies to become nursing school faculty. The Nursing Faculty Loan Repayment Program is administered by nursing schools offering advanced nursing programs. In 2016-2017, HRSA provided 1,998 loans totaling $27.3 million. The HEAL program, no longer issuing new loans, continues to manage outstanding loans. The HEAL program loans were phased out between 1995 and 1999 but remain the responsibility of borrowers. In addition to federal student loans, private financial entities also offer student loans. Private education loans, also known as alternative loans, are offered by private financial institutions, state-supported loan programs, and IHEs. The terms and conditions of these loans are determined by the lender. While not part of federal loan programs, some federal loan repayment programs offer benefits to borrowers of certain private education loans. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs provide debt relief to eligible borrowers. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs offer debt relief to eligible borrowers based on specific criteria and program features. These programs are categorized into three broad categories with unique characteristics and qualifying criteria. Various program components are used to classify and compare the different programs. The section examines different debt relief programs, focusing on qualifying service, borrower economic circumstances, debt relief amounts and timing, and exclusions or limitations. Program-specific details can be found in Appendix A. The primary categories of debt relief programs are presented in order of potential availability to borrowers, starting with loan forgiveness entitlement programs, which are the largest in scale and include programs for public service loan forgiveness. The largest debt relief programs are presented in order of availability to borrowers, starting with loan forgiveness for public service, followed by income-driven repayment plans. Programs for broad public service or employment needs are then discussed, followed by programs for government employment, which are more targeted and smaller in scale. Loan forgiveness for public service employment provides debt relief to qualified borrowers in certain occupations or employers. These benefits are entitlements for federal student loans and are available to an open-ended number of borrowers. Table 1 summarizes the various forgiveness programs offered. The text discusses service employment programs for loan forgiveness, detailing eligibility criteria based on employer, occupation, and economic circumstances during repayment. It also includes information on the operational status of the programs. Table 1 shows the size and operational status of loan forgiveness programs. To qualify for benefits, borrowers must meet specific eligibility criteria related to service type or occupation. These programs are accessible to teachers, with Federal Perkins Loan Cancellation also open to those in other public service roles. Perkins Loan Cancellation and Direct Loan Public Service Loan Forgiveness are available to individuals in public service occupations, including law enforcement, public defenders, and full-time employment in public service. Service commitments for loan forgiveness programs range from 1 to 10 years. Loan forgiveness following income-driven repayment provides debt relief to borrowers. Loan forgiveness programs provide debt relief to borrowers who repay federal student loans based on their income for an extended period. These benefits are entitlements written into the terms of federal student loans. The programs are available to a large number of qualified borrowers and are separate from public service employment programs. Loan forgiveness programs offer debt relief to individuals through income-driven repayment plans. A table categorizes these programs by the date borrowers became eligible. Unlike Table 1, these programs are not grouped by availability or financial resources, as various factors affect participation. The loan forgiveness programs following income-driven repayment do not have specific employer, occupational, or service requirements. Borrowers must make monthly payments towards their federal student loans for 20 to 25 years. Monthly payments are based on various factors. The amount of monthly payments for income-driven repayment programs is determined by factors like student loan debt, family size, and income. Payments are capped at a percentage of discretionary income. At the end of the repayment period, the remaining loan balance is forgiven. Public service employment can also provide debt relief benefits for specific occupations or employers. Loan repayment programs for public service employment are used to meet employment needs or help government agencies recruit and retain qualified employees. These programs are not entitlements and are available to a limited number of qualified borrowers. Loan repayment programs for public service employment aim to meet employment needs or assist government agencies in recruiting and retaining qualified employees. These programs are not entitlements and are available to a limited number of qualified borrowers, subject to program funds. They are smaller in scale compared to loan forgiveness programs. Table 3 summarizes various loan repayment programs for addressing broad employment needs or shortages, indicating eligibility based on employer and occupation. Loan repayment programs for public service employment are available to borrowers based on specific occupations or economic circumstances. The table organizes programs by operational status and administering department. Unlike loan forgiveness programs, these programs are not grouped by availability or financial resources. Loan repayment programs target various employment needs, with 19 programs identified, 15 of which focus on health-related occupations. These programs aim to address healthcare provider shortages and faculty needs, as well as other occupations like legal professions and large animal veterinarians. Loan repayment programs allow borrowers to fulfill service obligations with multiple employers in various geographic locations, typically underserved rural or disadvantaged areas. Service commitments generally last between one and five years. Loan repayment programs for federal government employees are targeted to meet agency-specific needs and typically last between one and five years. Information on the scale of these programs is not always readily available, but the Office of Personnel Management reports annually on the Government Employee Student Loan Repayment Program. Table 4 summarizes various federal government loan repayment programs for recruiting and retaining qualified employees. It outlines eligibility criteria such as agency-specific employment, occupation requirements, and economic circumstances. Table 4 summarizes federal government loan repayment programs for recruiting and retaining qualified employees based on agency-specific employment and occupation requirements, without grouping by availability or financial resources. Several federal agencies offer 25 programs to recruit and retain qualified employees, with 8 programs specifically targeting members of the Armed Forces. These programs vary in benefits availability, with some open to all agency employees and others targeting specific hard-to-fill occupations. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs are available to agency employees in certain fields. Participants must serve for a minimum period of one to five years. Economic circumstances can affect eligibility for benefits, with some programs using this as a criterion. Individuals may qualify for benefits based on their economic circumstances. Some loan forgiveness programs consider economic circumstances as a factor for eligibility. Individuals may qualify based on their economic background or if their monthly loan payment exceeds a certain percentage. Loan forgiveness programs can be categorized based on eligibility criteria such as economic circumstances and monthly loan payment percentage. Benefits can include forgiving the entire loan balance, repaying a specified dollar amount, or a percentage of the outstanding loan. Some programs offer complete forgiveness of outstanding student loans. Loan forgiveness programs can award benefits by forgiving the entire amount of an individual's outstanding student loans or by employers paying repayment benefits in the form of a flat dollar amount. Some programs offer varying flat rates based on the type of service performed, while others pay a percentage of the individual's outstanding loans. Some loan forgiveness and repayment programs offer benefits based on the type of service performed, paying a percentage of outstanding loans or a flat dollar amount. Restrictions may apply, and defaulting on loans makes borrowers ineligible for benefits. Some federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs have restrictions on receiving benefits for the same qualifying service under multiple programs. Borrowers may face financial penalties for not completing their service term. The program does not provide benefits for the same service used to qualify for other loan forgiveness programs. Some programs require participants to be U.S. citizens or legal residents. The availability of loan forgiveness or repayment programs may be restricted based on the borrower's citizenship or residency status. For example, federal student loans under the Higher Education Act are only available to U.S. citizens, nationals, legal permanent residents, and eligible noncitizens. Loan forgiveness programs like the PSLF program may only be available for specific types of loans based on the borrower's citizenship. Loan forgiveness and repayment benefits may be restricted for borrowers based on their citizenship and immigration status at the time the loans were obtained. Availability of benefits for borrowers in default status depends on certain characteristics of the defaulted loans. For example, in the Direct Loan Stafford Loan Forgiveness for Teachers program, teacher loan forgiveness may not be granted on defaulted loans, but forgiveness may be possible with satisfactory repayment arrangements. Forgiveness may be granted to borrowers who have made satisfactory repayment arrangements for their loans, including those in default. Borrowers in the Perkins Loan Cancellation program may qualify for loan forgiveness under certain conditions. Clawback provisions may require recipients to repay benefits if they fail to complete service obligations. Clawback provisions in federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs may require participants to repay unearned benefits, sometimes with interest and punitive fees. Exceptions may apply for borrowers who become disabled or pass away. Student loan forgiveness and repayment benefits may be excluded from gross income for tax purposes in certain instances, as specified by program statutes like the Higher Education Act (HEA). The Higher Education Act (HEA) specifies that forgiven Federal Perkins Loans are excluded from gross income. Loans must be borrowed for education, have terms for cancellation based on work in specific professions, and be made by certain types of lenders to qualify for exclusion from gross income. The Higher Education Act excludes forgiven Federal Perkins Loans from gross income if certain criteria are met, including borrowing for education and terms for cancellation based on work in specific professions. IRC Section 108(f)(4) provides exclusions for certain loan repayment programs, but individuals are responsible for paying income tax on forgiven loans if requirements are not met. Several loan forgiveness and repayment programs offer funds to offset tax liability from discharged loans, excluding benefits from gross income. However, around $200 million in revenue was lost in FY2017 due to this exclusion. Researchers debate the effectiveness of these benefits in encouraging borrowers to enter specific professions. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs incentivize borrowers to enter specific fields or government service by relieving student loan debt. Three main issues are considered: whether individuals would enter these fields without debt relief, if student loan debt is the main barrier, and if debt relief encourages students to finance more of their education expenses. The effectiveness of loan forgiveness and repayment programs in incentivizing borrowers to enter specific fields or government service is discussed, along with the cost to the federal government. In assessing the impact of loan forgiveness or repayment programs on employment choices, it is important to consider if recipients would have chosen the qualifying service without the program. Comparing career paths of individuals with access to these benefits to those without can provide valuable insights. Evaluations for federal programs are lacking, but data from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) program may offer some guidance. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) examined the career trajectories of loan repayment recipients in its Intramural Research Program (IRP) and found that individuals receiving loan repayment benefits were more likely to continue conducting medical research at the NIH than those who did not. The NIH study found that individuals who received loan repayment benefits were more likely to continue a career in medical research at the NIH. This suggests that the program may be meeting its goals, although other factors may also influence individuals' decisions to stay in targeted positions. The loan repayment program may not always be necessary or effective, especially when job opportunities are limited. For instance, recent law school graduates facing fewer job options may opt for public interest or government jobs regardless of loan repayment benefits. Additionally, individuals may have taken the same job even without loan repayment incentives. Some healthcare providers in rural areas would have taken their positions even without loan repayment benefits. The NIH found that recipients of loan repayment awards were attracted to their positions due to the unique benefit of loan repayment. Physicians at the NIH who received loan repayment benefits were more likely to stay in research, showing the importance of such benefits for recruitment and retention. However, there are concerns that funding cuts or program design flaws may undermine the effectiveness of loan repayment programs in federal agencies. The effectiveness of loan repayment programs as recruitment incentives may be uncertain, as applicants only find out about the benefits after accepting a job. Award amounts may not be enough to attract individuals to certain professions. To be successful, financial benefits should offset a significant portion of education costs. Some loan repayment programs may not be attractive to participants due to tax liabilities associated with receiving benefits. Under the Government Employee Student Loan Repayment Program, participants are responsible for paying federal income taxes on the loan repayment amount, making the program less appealing. Some loan repayment programs may not be attractive to participants due to tax liabilities. Short-term nature of programs may lead to turnover and less stable workforce for employers. Individuals with service obligations have shorter tenures in a position. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs are based on the assumption that student loan debt influences career choices, but research shows that debt may not always be a significant factor. Other deterrents, such as geographic location or lack of interest in a field, can also impact employment decisions. The National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program (NHSCLRP) offers loan repayment benefits to physicians in primary care in specific areas. Factors like lower compensation, preference for specialty focus, and debt levels can deter physicians from entering primary care. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs may be available to individuals regardless of their racial or ethnic background. Critics argue that these programs do not fully address the financial disparities between lower-paying fields like primary care medicine and specialty fields. Primary care physicians earn $3.5 million less than specialty physicians, leading to lower lifetime earnings. Student loan debt may not be fully offset by loan repayments. Research shows that high levels of debt influence job choice, with graduates often opting for higher-paying positions to manage debt. Undergraduate students with higher debt levels tend to choose higher salary jobs and are less likely to enter education-related fields, work for a government agency, or work at a nonprofit organization. Law school debt levels may play a secondary role in job choice, with demographic characteristics being a more dominant factor. The impact of student loan forgiveness and repayment programs on career choices of law school graduates is uncertain. There are concerns that these programs may lead students to take on more debt than they would otherwise. Repayment plans like IDR and PSLF offer student loan debt relief by capping payments at a percentage of income for a set period, leading to potential forgiveness of the remaining balance. Monthly payments are based on income, not the amount owed, with some arguing that this approach may reduce the overall debt burden. Some argue that tying monthly payments to income and not debt may make the size of the debt irrelevant to borrowers, potentially encouraging over-borrowing. The lack of student incentive to limit borrowing could make some students less sensitive to the cost of education. Loan forgiveness and repayment benefits for borrowers result in costs to the federal government, with the nature of these costs depending on the program. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs incur costs to the federal government, which depend on the program structure. These costs include loan subsidy costs, appropriated program costs, and administrative costs. Federal credit programs, such as federal direct loans and loan guarantees, are typically used for federal student loan programs. The federal credit programs consist of federal direct loans and federal loan guarantees. The William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan program is a direct loan program, while the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program is a guaranteed loan program. Loan subsidy costs for these programs are funded through mandatory indefinite appropriations, measured based on their estimated long-term costs to the government on a net present value basis. The federal budget reflects the costs of making or guaranteeing loans, including the subsidy cost and administrative expenses. The loan subsidy cost is the estimated present value of cash flows from the government, less the cash flows to the government, discounted to the time of loan disbursement. A positive loan subsidy cost indicates a cost to the government. The loan subsidy cost reflects the cost or return to the government for providing loan subsidies. Loan forgiveness benefits increase subsidy costs by altering cash flows. For example, Stafford Loan Forgiveness for Teachers in the Direct Loan program benefits qualified borrowers. Loan forgiveness under the program discharges a portion of borrowers' loan balance, reducing their repayment responsibility and government cash flows. This increases loan subsidy costs for the program, accounted for in the fiscal year the loan was made. Loan forgiveness programs like Public Service Loan Forgiveness and income-based repayment plans do not factor in borrower benefits costs into subsidy rates. Instead, these costs are funded through appropriations for the fiscal year when the benefits are provided. Repayment benefits for loan programs are funded through discretionary or mandatory appropriations, with availability limited to years with appropriations and based on fund availability. Funding constraints may prevent benefits from reaching all eligible borrowers. Examples of programs funded through discretionary appropriations include GESLR and JRJ Loan Repayment. The Perkins Loan Cancellation benefits are unique as they are specified in the loan terms and conditions, with forgiveness granted by the institution. Unlike most federal loan forgiveness programs, Perkins Loans are not part of a federal credit program. The Perkins Loan program is not a federal credit program, and funding for loan cancellation benefits is authorized through discretionary appropriations. Despite no funding being appropriated since FY2009, qualified borrowers have had their loans canceled, with institutions absorbing the costs without reimbursement from the federal government. The costs of administering loan forgiveness and repayment programs are generally funded separately from programmatic costs. Administrative costs for federal credit programs' loan forgiveness benefits are accounted for in accordance with the FCRA. Administrative costs for federal credit programs' loan forgiveness benefits are funded separately through annual appropriations. Various agencies administer loan repayment programs with different funding mechanisms. Limited information is available on the actual costs of loan forgiveness and repayment programs. Cost estimates for loan forgiveness programs are based on projected future loan forgiveness amounts or the number of loans expected to be forgiven. Information on other programs, such as loan repayment programs, includes data on total benefits provided and the number of borrowers receiving benefits. Limited data is available on the amount of debt relief and number of recipients for programs where benefits have been awarded. In Appendix A, data on debt relief and recipients is provided program-by-program. For the Direct Loan Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, estimated cost to the government was $1.5 billion over FY2008-FY2012, with $1.2 billion for loans prior to FY2008. ED did not estimate the number of borrowers expected to receive benefits. In the 2015 Final Regulation, ED estimated that approximately 6 million borrowers will be eligible for the REPAYE plan, with 2 million expected to enroll, costing $15.4 billion. For the PAYE plan, ED estimated a government cost of $2.1 billion over FY2012-FY2021. The Department of Education estimated that approximately 1.67 million borrowers would choose to repay their loans through the PAYE plan, with around 400,000 borrowers qualifying for loan forgiveness. The average original loan balance for borrowers receiving forgiveness was $39,500, with an average of $41,000 in loans forgiven due to interest-only payments. In the 2012 NPRM, the Department of Education estimated that 1 million borrowers from the 2014-2021 cohorts would choose the IBR plan, with 44,000 borrowers potentially having some student loan debt forgiven after 25 years under the pre-July 1, 2014 IBR plan. For the FY2012 cohort, 146,000 borrowers were estimated to repay under the IBR plan. The Department of Education estimated that 146,000 borrowers from the FY2012 cohort would repay under the IBR plan, with 52,000 of them potentially having some debt forgiven after 25 years. It is challenging to accurately predict loan forgiveness benefits due to the newness of the programs and the reliance on borrower repayment behavior and labor market experiences. Congress may need to review the current federal student loan forgiveness and repayment policies for potential changes. Several issues related to loan forgiveness and repayment policy may be examined, such as the availability of multiple programs for borrowers engaging in similar activities, the potential financial windfall for borrowers, and the effectiveness of existing programs in achieving their intended purposes. Consideration may be given to overlapping programs with similar structures. Programs may overlap if they have similar goals and activities. Student loan forgiveness and repayment programs can overlap when the same borrower benefits from multiple programs or when multiple programs serve the same group of individuals. This duplication can lead to unnecessary administrative costs. Individuals may qualify for benefits under multiple programs. Some programs allow recipients to receive benefits from multiple sources for the same service performed, while others have restrictions. For example, an individual working in a federal agency may qualify for loan repayment benefits under the GESLRP and forgiveness of their student loan debt after 10 years of service. The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program (PSLF) allows for forgiveness of student loan debt after 10 years of service with a federal agency and 120 monthly loan payments. Overlapping benefits may occur if individuals use benefits from multiple programs for the same service, potentially leading to the federal government funding administrative costs for two separate programs serving the same purpose or group of people. The Nursing Education Loan Repayment Program (NELRP) and Nursing Faculty Loan Repayment Program (NFLRP) both aim to increase qualified nursing faculty by providing repayment benefits to nurse faculty at accredited nursing schools. Both programs are administered by the Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). Under the NFLRP, HRSA grants money to nursing schools that establish their own loan repayment programs. The HRSA grants money to nursing schools for loan repayment programs, potentially causing administrative burden. Congress may need to consider combining or abolishing programs to avoid double benefits. Loan forgiveness programs aim to encourage individuals to enter nursing. Many loan forgiveness and repayment programs incentivize individuals to enter specific fields or public service. Some programs may provide windfalls to individuals who would have entered the field regardless of benefits. Certain plans have no limits on forgiveness amounts. The Direct Loan Public Service Loan Forgiveness program operates with income-driven repayment plans. Concerns raised about individuals borrowing large amounts, especially under non-need-based PLUS Loans, leading to potential loan forgiveness abuse. Congress may consider setting limits on forgiveness amounts. Some research suggests that loan forgiveness programs may not influence individuals' career choices if they are already seeking employment in certain fields. However, these programs could be effective in creating career pipelines or retaining skilled employees. Loan repayment programs may be somewhat effective in influencing individuals' choice to stay in a specific job or career. Congress could consider implementing more specific funding controls to tailor these programs to individual needs. This could include narrowly defining eligibility criteria or directing fund usage through appropriations measures. Federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs lack sufficient data to assess their effectiveness in achieving program objectives. Limited programmatic data is available for many programs, with data becoming available only when borrowers apply for benefits. For example, in the PSLF program, borrowers must work in public service for 10 years and make 120 monthly payments on their loans before qualifying for benefits. Loan forgiveness under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program requires borrowers to work in public service for 10 years and make 120 monthly payments on their loans. Limited data is available on the forgiveness benefits received under the program, making it difficult to project future participation. Borrowers may not be required to document their employment in public service jobs, leading to a lack of comprehensive information on the program's effectiveness. Loan forgiveness is available for borrowers who repay according to income-driven repayment plans for extended periods. However, longitudinal data on participants are limited, making it difficult to verify eligibility for forgiveness benefits. Improved data collection and reporting are necessary for assessing program effects and determining if program design changes could enhance effectiveness. There is variation in the types and amounts of student loan debt that qualify for debt relief, with some programs limiting relief to specific loan types or amounts. Some student loan debt relief programs have limitations on the types and amounts of loans eligible for forgiveness. Consideration is needed for imposing additional restrictions on qualifying loan types and amounts. The availability of student loan repayment or forgiveness programs may incentivize over-borrowing. Should individuals be allowed to borrow non-need-based federal student loans for expenses covered by their expected family contribution, only to have a significant portion forgiven later? Considerations for imposing restrictions on qualifying loan types and amounts are necessary. Selection criteria for federal student loan repayment programs can vary among agencies, with 34 agencies providing loan repayment benefits in CY 2016 under the GESLRP. Under the GESLRP, 34 agencies offer loan repayment benefits to employees who sign a service agreement to work for at least three years. Participants must reimburse the agency if they do not complete their service. Certain limitations apply, such as not being in the excepted service. Agencies like the Department of Defense use the program to recruit employees in specific fields like nursing, engineering, and contracting. The GESLRP offers loan repayment benefits to employees in various agencies, with specific fields like nursing, engineering, and contracting being targeted for recruitment. The U.S. Department of State provides benefits to individuals with a loan balance of at least $5,000. Tailored programs within agencies can make eligibility requirements confusing for participants. Appendix A provides program-specific details for each program analyzed in the report. Information includes statutory and regulatory citations, administering agency, program purpose, eligible loans, qualifying service, maximum benefits, and restrictions. The curr_chunk provides details on program participants, maximum benefits, eligibility restrictions, post-benefit requirements, tax treatment, budget classification, appropriations, loan amounts, beneficiaries, and relevant citations. Information is sourced from statutes, regulations, and authoritative sources for analysis in the report. The curr_chunk provides program descriptions with relevant information for analysis. It includes details on loan forgiveness programs for public service and references legal citations and federal administering agencies. Abbreviations like FFEL and PHSA are used throughout the appendix. Loan forgiveness programs for public service are presented in this section, providing debt relief to qualified borrowers employed in certain occupations or in public service. These benefits are considered entitlements and are written into the terms and conditions of widely available programs. The Direct Loan Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program offers student loan forgiveness for qualified borrowers in public service occupations.
