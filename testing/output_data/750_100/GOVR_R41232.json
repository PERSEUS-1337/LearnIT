    "content": "On July 29, 2010, the President signed H.R. 4899, P.L. 111-212, which allocated $59.2 billion for war costs, disaster assistance, Haiti relief, and benefits for Vietnam veterans. The bill was passed by the House and Senate in May and July, respectively, after the House receded from an amended version with higher spending. P.L. 111-212 allocated $58.8 billion in new budget authority, with $380 million in rescissions. The House version included $22.1 billion more in domestic spending but had offsetting rescissions and mandatory savings to reduce the amount of new budget authority required. Rescissions cancel unobligated budget authority, which can then be used for new spending. The House debated H.R. 4899 and House Concurrent Resolution 301, which proposed withdrawing U.S. troops from Pakistan. The resolution was defeated, and the House passed H.Res. 1566 to set up a debate under the War Powers Act. The House passed H.Con.Res. 301 under the War Powers Act by a vote of 222 to 196, after the Senate disagreed with the House amended version of the bill. The House dropped its support for the amended version and adopted the Senate version. The House dropped its support for the amended version of H.Con.Res. 301 and adopted the Senate version on May 27, 2010, due to concerns raised by Defense Department officials about running out of funding for the Army in August. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 includes $59.2 billion for war funding, Haiti relief, foreign aid, and new benefits for Vietnam veterans. The House and Senate debated on H.R. 4899, focusing on additional domestic spending proposals and the new war policy in Afghanistan. Representative David Obey introduced the Senate version of the bill, which included funds for FEMA disaster relief. The House added funds to the FEMA disaster funding in the FY2010 Supplemental bill, including war funding and addressing other emergencies like teacher job losses and Pell fund shortfalls. Representative Obey opposed the bill due to concerns about Afghanistan and Pakistan not fulfilling their obligations. The House added funds to the FY2010 Supplemental bill for FEMA disaster funding, war funding, and other emergencies. Representative Obey opposed the bill due to concerns about Afghanistan and Pakistan not fulfilling their obligations. Representative Lewis praised the Senate for rejecting nonemergency spending on troops and urged support for the bill to assist military personnel and disaster relief efforts. The House supported a bill to assist military personnel and disaster relief efforts, with specific mentions of DOD's war funding and disability benefits for Vietnam veterans. Representative Skelton backed the bill, while Representative McGovern raised concerns about corruption in the Afghan government and Pakistani intelligence services. Representative Dicks also supported the bill. Representative Norm Dicks and Representative Chris Van Hollen expressed concerns about war funding running out in August. The House debated a resolution invoking the War Powers Act to withdraw troops from Pakistan within 30 days or by December 31, 2010. The House debated a resolution invoking the War Powers Act to withdraw troops from Pakistan within 30 days or by December 31, 2010. Despite concerns about war funding running out in August, the resolution was defeated by 38 to 372. The Senate failed to adopt cloture on the House version of H.R. 4899, indicating they would be unable to pass the bill. The final version of H.R. 4899 appropriates $59.2 billion in spending, with funding matching or close to the Administration's request for various purposes including FEMA's Disaster Assistance Fund, Vietnam veterans affected by Agent Orange, Department of Defense war-related funding, and Haiti relief. In the final version of H.R. 4899, Congress appropriated $59.2 billion in spending, with key differences in funding compared to the Administration's request. Notable changes included a decrease in war-related foreign aid funding, no funding for settling court cases, border security, reducing backlogs in the U.S. Trademark and Patent Office, but added funding for foreign aid and humanitarian assistance for various countries, as well as flood and drought relief. In the final version of H.R. 4899, Congress did not include additional domestic funding for various purposes such as preventing teacher layoffs, providing more Pell grants, funding summer jobs, or agricultural and energy grants. The bill also did not include $600 million for border security and $129 million to reduce patent backlogs in the Commerce Department. The FY2010 Supplemental, P.L. 111-212 includes $34.2 billion for the Defense Department and State Department for Afghan and Iraq wars. $31.5 billion is for the Afghan war, with $29.8 billion for DOD and $1.7 billion for State/USAID programs; $2.7 billion is for the Iraq war, with $1.0 billion for DOD and $1.7 billion for State/USAID programs. The FY2010 Supplemental, P.L. 111-212 provides $34.2 billion for the Defense Department and State Department for Afghan and Iraq wars. This includes $31.5 billion for the Afghan war and $2.7 billion for the Iraq war. Total FY2010 funding for the Afghan and Iraq war as of the enactment of the FY2010 supplemental is $169.9 billion, with $104.4 billion for the Afghan war and $65.5 billion for the Iraq war. The FY2010 Supplemental, P.L. 111-212 provides $34.2 billion for the Defense Department and State Department for Afghan and Iraq wars. This includes $31.5 billion for the Afghan war and $2.7 billion for the Iraq war. Congress addressed the Administration's $64.3 billion request for supplemental spending for FY2010 between March 24, 2010, and July 27, 2010, passing H.R. 4899 with $5.1 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund and $600 million for the Department of Labor's summer jobs program. The Senate passed H.R. 4899 on May 27, 2010, with $59.2 billion in spending for various purposes including disaster relief, war funding, foreign assistance, and benefits for Vietnam veterans. The House adopted the Senate's version and added funds for education, Pell Grants, summer employment, and court cases. The Jobs Fund, Pell Grants, summer youth employment, and funding for court cases were included in the $81.8 billion spending bill passed on July 29, 2010. The Senate and House had disagreements on the bill before reaching a final version. The President signed the bill P.L. 111-212 on July 29, 2010, requesting $64.4 billion in supplemental funding for various purposes including deploying more troops to Afghanistan, replenishing Disaster Assistance Funds, supporting Haiti earthquake recovery, enhancing border security, and settling court cases for American Indians and black farmers. Specifically, the requests included $5.1 billion for the U.S. Disaster Relief Fund, $33.0 billion for the Defense Department to deploy more troops, and $4.5 billion for other purposes. The bill P.L. 111-212, signed by the President on July 29, 2010, allocated $64.4 billion in supplemental funding for various purposes. This included deploying 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan, foreign assistance for Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan, Haiti reconstruction aid, compensation for veterans exposed to Agent Orange, responses to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, additional border security personnel, and settlements for American Indians and black farmers. The Senate and House considered H.R. 4899, focusing on the effect of supplemental spending on the federal deficit. The House version included $600 million in offsets for $5.7 billion in spending, while the Senate version had $380 million in offsets for $59.3 billion recommended. The House version of H.R. 4899 included $12.2 billion in rescissions and $4.5 billion in mandatory savings to offset $81.8 billion in proposed spending. Congressional rules require spending to fit within totals set for discretionary and mandatory spending in the annual budget resolution, unless designated as emergencies. In the final version of H.R. 4899, almost all $45.8 billion in discretionary spending was designated as emergency, not counting against budget caps. Federal budget rules distinguish between discretionary and direct spending. $46.3 billion of the President's $64.4 billion supplemental request is discretionary. The President's supplemental request includes $46.3 billion in discretionary spending and $18.1 billion in mandatory spending. Emergency supplemental appropriations are seen as bypassing budgetary discipline. In the current fiscal environment, some Members are concerned about the impact of additional spending on the deficit. Congress may debate whether to increase spending above the level already appropriated for that year and in some cases, levels for subsequent fiscal years. Congress must decide if additional spending is necessary and whether to increase the budget deficit or offset it by cutting federal spending or increasing revenues. All spending and revenue legislation, including supplemental appropriations bills, are considered within rules and procedures to address these policy options. The FY2010 supplemental appropriations request was considered within the constraints set by the FY2010 budget resolution and other budget rules. Under budget rules like PAYGO Act of 2010, Congress could exempt spending by labeling it as an emergency or for overseas activities. Waiving points of order or not raising them during consideration of appropriations could also bypass constraints. However, an emergency designation could still be subject to a point of order. During consideration of appropriations, the emergency designation could be subject to a point of order, which can be waived in both houses by specific procedures. Throughout the process of H.R. 4899 in 2010, various agencies and plaintiffs highlighted deadlines for supplemental funding. In June 2010, Admiral Thad Allen and Secretary Janet Napolitano urged Congress to raise the cap on funds from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund for Deepwater Horizon response activities due to insufficient funding within two weeks. The Coast Guard warned that the current funds from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund would run out within two weeks. Congress passed a bill to raise the annual cap on funds that can be drawn from the trust fund to $1 billion for oil spill activities. The Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund can now provide up to $1 billion for Deepwater Horizon Spill activities. The Department of Defense received $129.6 billion in bridge funds for war funding, with an additional $33 billion needed for troops deploying to Afghanistan. The Department of Defense received $129.6 billion in bridge funds for war funding, with an additional $33 billion needed for troops deploying to Afghanistan by Memorial Day. The Army, Navy, and USMC could cover both regular base activities and war operations through August 2010, with the possibility of extending further by transferring funds from other appropriation accounts. In June 16, 2010, Secretary of Defense Gates expressed concern about the lack of progress on the supplemental funding, urging passage by July 4 to avoid running out of money in the overseas contingency fund for the Navy and Marine Corps. This could lead to disruptions in other programs, with the Army facing similar challenges in August. The Army and Marine Corps could run out of funding in August, leading to possible furloughs for civilians and unpaid active duty military. The Army has funds through mid-August and could last through the recess with approved reprogramming requests. Each service still has funds available in their War Bridge according to the DOD Cost of War report. The Army and Marine Corps have funds available in their War Bridge Operation and Maintenance accounts, with the Army having funds through mid-August. Monthly spending is expected to increase by 20% as additional troops arrive in theater. Services have tapped funding from their base budget since 2004 to fund war spending while awaiting passage of H.R. 4899. The services have used base budget funding to temporarily finance war funding until supplementals are passed. The Disaster Relief Fund has been managed to last longer by limiting fund releases and delaying reimbursements. In May 2010, FEMA estimated that the Disaster Relief Fund would become insolvent by the end of June with a balance of $600 million. However, as of June 7, 2010, FEMA had a balance of $952 million in the fund, partly due to a policy of paying only for immediate and life-threatening needs. FEMA had a backlog of $1.4 billion in projects awaiting payment for infrastructure and mitigation projects, which did not meet immediate needs criteria. State Department reported that disaster assistance funding needed replenishing by June 1, 2010 to respond to future crises. Failure to replenish could curtail U.S. capacity to respond to emergencies. Congress did not approve the $1.15 billion appropriation by the mid-April 2010 deadline to settle the Pigford II court case for black farmers. The final deadline for Congress to approve the settlement of the Cobell suit for government mismanagement of funds and lands held in trust for American Indians is August 6, 2010. The final deadline for the settlement of the Cobell suit for government mismanagement of funds and lands held in trust for individual American Indians is August 6, 2010. Issues raised by Members of Congress include setting a timeline for evaluating spending on the Afghan War, preventing corruption in foreign aid for Afghanistan and Iraq, monitoring Haiti relief funds, and determining if additional domestic spending is emergency or needs to be offset. The Administration requested $5.1 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) to prevent deficit increase. FEMA anticipated the fund running out of money for disaster needs and unanticipated claims for recovery projects. The current DRF balance is $600 million. FEMA projected the Disaster Relief Fund would run out of money in May or June 2010, prompting measures to reduce expenditures and delay payments for certain projects. Representative James Oberstar highlighted FEMA's actions to stretch available funds by limiting claims payments and recovering funds from previous years. Congress questioned why FEMA had not requested additional disaster relief. Congress raised questions about FEMA's delayed request for disaster relief funds, which could indicate concerns about the emergency nature of the situation. Delays in congressional action also raised doubts about FEMA's claims of low funds in the Disaster Relief Fund. Additionally, higher spending levels in recent years have led to inquiries about FEMA's budgeting practices. Members did not express concerns about the limited information provided by FEMA regarding the Fund's status or potential compensation payments from arbitration rulings. The Obama Administration criticized previous administrations for unrealistic budgeting practices in its first budget blueprint. In FY2010, $2.0 billion was requested for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), but Congress provided $1.6 billion. For FY2011, $1.9 billion is requested for the DRF due to numerous disasters in 2009 and 2010. The requests do not show significant increases compared to previous years. The current supplemental request for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) is mainly for additional arbitration rulings related to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Higher funding levels may be necessary to address the devastation from Gulf Coast hurricanes in 2005 and 2008, as recovery could take five years or longer. Some argue for increased DRF funding to avoid the need for supplemental funding, while others disagree. The current supplemental request for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) is mainly for additional arbitration rulings related to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. FEMA provided little information for Congress to evaluate its request, citing only an arbitration ruling awarding $475 million to the Charity Hospital in New Orleans. Congress may choose to maintain the status quo if Members prefer waiting for large-scale disasters to occur before providing disaster funding for recovery. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 provides $5.1 billion for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), including $396 million for recent floods in Tennessee and Rhode Island. $5 million of the funding is transferred to the Department of Homeland Security Office of the Inspector General. The Senate Appropriations Committee allocated $396 million for disaster relief funding for floods in Tennessee and Rhode Island, fishery disasters in Alaska, tornado damages in the Midwest, and recovery projects related to Gulf Coast hurricanes in 2005 and 2008. The committee expressed dissatisfaction with the delayed information from OMB regarding funding requirements. The FY2011 request is expected to fall short by $1-2 billion for previous disasters like Hurricane Katrina. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 allocated $5.1 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) and additional funding for disaster-relief activities in various agencies, including $100 million for Housing and Urban Development, $227 million for Army Corps of Engineers, $49 million for Commerce Department, and $10 million for Agriculture for drought relief. The final version of H.R. 4899 allocated $49 million for the Commerce Department's economic development assistance program and $18 million for the Agriculture Department's emergency forest restoration program. It also included provisions for federal cost share in flood recovery efforts and directed FEMA to create an interagency taskforce to address community concerns related to flood maps updates. Funding requests for additional troops deployment were also included in the DOD and State Department/USAID FY2010 supplemental requests. The FY2010 supplemental requests include funding for deploying 30,000 troops to Afghanistan and economic assistance to support military operations. The Obama Administration requested $33 billion for this purpose in the FY2011 budget. In 2009, the President announced the deployment of additional troops to reverse the security situation in Afghanistan and target the insurgency. By June 1, almost 94,000 troops were in Afghanistan out of the 30,000 scheduled increase. The remaining troops were expected to arrive by September 2010, with a total of 98,000 troops deployed by fall. In response to requests from the U.S. Commander in Afghanistan, troop levels in Afghanistan increased to 98,000 by fall 2009, with deployments approved by both President Bush and President Obama. The U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan are set to increase to 98,000 by fall 2009, with an additional 4,000 support troops in the FY2011 budget. NATO allies have also increased their troop levels to 48,000 by March 2010. The total number of foreign troops in Afghanistan is expected to reach about 148,000 by fall, with plans for Afghan security forces to total 243,000, bringing the total number of foreign and Afghan forces to 389,000. The Defense Department has requested $33 billion to support the additional troops deploying to Afghanistan. In FY2010, DOD war spending increased to $160 billion, with $99 billion for Afghanistan and $61 billion for Iraq. Total appropriations for the Afghan War reached $314.1 billion with the FY2010 Supplemental. The FY2011 request for war funding is $427.7 billion, compared to the enacted total of $752 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan. The timeline for evaluating the effectiveness of President Obama's new strategy was a key issue during the FY2010 supplemental debate. President Obama's new strategy for Afghanistan includes a timeline for beginning the transfer of forces out of the country in July 2011, but the drawdown could be minor. Secretary of Defense Gates and Admiral Mullen have emphasized that the transition in July 2011 is not a complete withdrawal, and Secretary Gates mentioned that the process could take several years. Secretary Gates and General Petraeus discussed the timeline for the U.S. military campaign in Afghanistan, with Petraeus calling it an 18-month initiative. Congress raised concerns about the evaluation timing and the long-term military involvement. Amendments to increase congressional participation in decision-making were debated but rejected during House consideration of H.R. 4899 in July 2010. Amendments to increase congressional participation in decision-making regarding U.S. military commitment in Afghanistan were debated but ultimately defeated during House consideration of H.R. 4899 in July 2010. Concerns about Afghanistan have risen since the operation to re-take Marjah, a town in Helmand Province, was launched. The next key test was the campaign for Kandahar, a Taliban stronghold. Of the $33 billion in DOD's supplemental request, $30 billion was for military operations. The $33 billion DOD supplemental request included $30 billion for Afghanistan, $1 billion for Iraqi Security Forces training, and $2 billion for higher fuel prices. The $30 billion for Afghanistan covered various costs such as military personnel, force protection, Afghan security forces training, fuel costs, equipment reconstitution, military and national intelligence. The $33 billion DOD supplemental request included funding for war-worn equipment, military and national intelligence, military construction, and defeating Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). Some policymakers estimated the cost of deploying 30,000 more troops at $1 million per troop. The request for Afghanistan included various costs such as military personnel, force protection, Afghan security forces training, fuel costs, and equipment reconstitution. The DOD developed functional categories for funding military activities, including Operations and Coalition Support Funds. Funding for the Afghan war between FY2009 and FY2011 varied across categories, with Operations expected to increase with troop levels. DOD's estimates differ from CBO's, and reported obligations suggest potential overspending. DOD estimates for deploying 30,000 troops to Afghanistan in FY2010 reflect a per troop cost of $875,000, higher than CBO's estimate of $467,000. Both DOD and CBO assume the same monthly troop strength, with DOD arguing that operations costs in the FY2010 supplemental request are significant. The FY2010 supplemental request for deploying troops to southern Afghanistan has high operations costs due to setting up new facilities. $5 billion of DOD's Operation and Maintenance funding was transferred to the Overseas Contingency Operations Transfer Fund in 2009. DOD's FY2010 request for funds from the Overseas Contingency Operations Transfer Fund may be high, as obligations reported in the first five months are only 22% of the total amount requested. Monthly spending would need to double in the next seven months to use all the funds, indicating that DOD's estimates may be somewhat inflated. The DOD requested an additional $2.6 billion to accelerate training and expand the Afghan Security Forces Fund in FY2010. Concerns were raised about the need for all the funds and the achievability of DOD's plan. The DOD's plan aims to increase Afghan Security forces to 243,000 by October 2010 and 305,600 by FY2011. The Afghan Army would grow to 171,000 by October 2011, and the Afghan Police to 134,000 by the same time. NATO partners endorsed these increases in January 2010. The DOD's FY2010 supplemental request of $2.6 billion aims to sustain the growth of the Afghan Army to exceed 134,000 troops, increase pay for soldiers, and provide infrastructure and equipment. Congress has appropriated $25.5 billion for Afghan Security Forces, with pending requests for FY2010 and FY2011 totaling $14.2 billion, bringing the total through FY2011 to $39.8 billion. DOD has not provided an estimate of the ultimate cost or number of years needed to support Afghan Security forces. General McChrystal proposed doubling the Afghan Army and Police to 400,000, but this goal has not been endorsed by the Obama Administration. DOD is responsible for training the Afghan Army, while DOD and the State Department jointly manage training for the Afghan police. Training of Afghan Security forces is managed by the U.S. military, NATO coalition teams, and private contractors. Both the DOD and State Department have faced numerous challenges in this training, including high attrition rates, leadership deficiencies, absenteeism, logistical limitations, and questionable behavior. Afghan police training has been hindered by illiteracy, corruption, and attacks by insurgents. Hearings in 2010 highlighted these issues. The training of Afghan security forces has faced challenges such as high attrition rates, leadership deficiencies, and logistical limitations. Problems in coordinating training efforts between DOD, State Department, and NATO have been identified, along with issues related to private contractors' performance and behavior. Despite additional trainers being sent by DOD, there are still shortages in personnel to manage contracts and oversee performance effectively. Despite additional trainers sent by DOD, shortages remain, potentially increasing reliance on contractors. Senator Levin raised concerns about a shortfall in trainers for Afghan security forces, as noted in DOD's April 1, 2010 report. Members may want to know the number of trainers needed to meet higher targets funded in the FY2010 supplemental request. The FY2010 supplemental request for Afghanistan includes questions about meeting training targets for U.S. military personnel, coalition partners, and contractors. Shortfalls in personnel could hinder the ramp-up, potentially affecting the plan to accelerate Afghan police training. Congress allowed the Secretary of State to address delays in contract awards. The FY2010 supplemental request for Afghanistan raised concerns about meeting training targets for U.S. military personnel and contractors. Congress allowed the Secretary of State to rely on a previously awarded contract, but DOD still had almost $3.6 billion in funding available from FY2009 and FY2010. DOD's plan for Afghan police training was uncertain, with potential delays and reduced funding in FY2010. In FY2009 and FY2010, DOD obligated funds at a rate of $540 million a month in the first eight months of FY2010. Some Members question the need for emergency war supplementals, suggesting war spending should be part of regular appropriations. DOD's original FY2010 request was included in the FY2010 DOD Appropriations Act. The Administration's decision to deploy 30,000 more troops in December 2009 raised questions about the emergency designation for the FY2010 war funding. Some argue that certain DOD requests, such as $1 billion for training in the Iraqi Security Forces Fund and $2 billion for fuel increases, may not be directly related to the new deployments. The $1 billion for the Iraqi Security Forces Fund and $2 billion for fuel increases may not be directly related to the new troop deployments. Congress is becoming less willing to fund Iraqi security forces due to the turnover of security responsibility to the Iraqi government and the rise in oil prices in 2008. The emergency designation of these funds could be challenged. Some argue that providing $2 billion for higher fuel costs in DOD's base budget could be covered internally. DOD typically handles fuel price increases through Working Capital Funds or fund transfers. The $1.7 billion for equipment reset may not be directly tied to the additional troops. The effect of additional combat operations in Afghanistan on equipment is gradual and difficult to predict. Some argue that replacement needs can be estimated based on past experience. The DOD has a substantial backlog of war-related procurement that needs to be spent. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 provided DOD with $32.9 billion, $148 million less than the DOD request. This includes adjustments in particular accounts for funding in excess of requirements. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 provided DOD with $32.9 billion, including adjustments for funding in excess of requirements, fuel pricing changes, and combat losses. This includes a $108 million decrease in military personnel funding, a $436 million decrease in operation and maintenance, a $400 million cut rejecting a DOD proposal, and a $512 million increase in procurement accounts. The Senate version of H.R. 4899 included adjustments for combat losses and an increase in procurement accounts. Both the House and Senate approved funding for training Afghan and Iraq security forces. The final version also required intelligence committees to receive threat assessments from Guantanamo detainees. The Administration requested $300 million for base closure transportation improvements and $529 million for military construction in its supplemental request. This includes $521 million for military construction in Afghanistan and $8 million for Air Force family housing utilities. Questions arise about DOD's construction in Afghanistan, with FY2010 war-related construction doubling FY2009 levels. The Administration requested $521 million for military construction in Afghanistan to create infrastructure for 30,000 additional U.S. troops. Congress allowed spending for a \"long-term presence\" but not for \"permanent stationing\" of troops. It is unclear how urgently the funds are needed given current spending rates. The Administration requested $521 million for military construction in Afghanistan to accommodate 30,000 additional U.S. troops. The justification for the request mentioned expanding airfield capacity, logistics capacity, and providing necessary infrastructure. The supplemental request was split between Army and Air Force construction, with Army projects focused in southern provinces and Air Force construction planned for provinces in the south and north. Military construction projects in Afghanistan are planned for Nimruz province in the south, Balkh province in the north, and Herand province in the west to support airlift and special operations forces. Army construction includes waste management systems, fuel storage facilities, utilities infrastructure, gravel roads, and a command headquarters at Forward Operating Base (FOB) Tombstone near Lashkar Gah in Helmand. Air Force projects include a runway and apron at FOB Delaram in the west. FOB Delaram, located in the west between Kandahar and the Iranian border, has a Special Operations helicopter apron. FOB Dwyer in southern Helmand province has helicopter and airlift aprons. Mazar e Sharif in the north and Shindad Airfield in the west have aircraft aprons, fuel, and munitions storage. Congress is concerned about construction spending signaling a long-term U.S. troop commitment to Afghanistan. Congress has adopted language to prevent the establishment of permanent military bases in Afghanistan, as seen in the FY2010 National Defense Authorization Act. This ban applies to any defense funds being used for the purpose of providing for the permanent stationing of US Armed Forces in Afghanistan. The FY2009 Supplemental Appropriation reiterated the ban on establishing permanent military bases in Afghanistan, prohibiting the use of funds for this purpose. However, an exception was made in P.L. 111-84 allowing the use of Operation & Maintenance funds for military construction supporting a \"long-term presence\" in Afghanistan. Congress has allowed funding for military construction to support a \"long-term presence\" in Afghanistan, distinguishing it from establishing permanent military bases. The distinction between the two remains unclear, as some projects could serve both purposes. Congress has previously denied funds for projects perceived as signaling a permanent presence, such as a fuel facility and power plant at Bagram in FY2005. The FY2010 Supplemental appropriations request included projects for troop stationing without comprehensive justification. DOD had flexibility to use O&M funds for urgent military operational requirements from FY2004 to FY2009, capped between $100 million and $200 million. In 2009, Congress allowed DOD to use $200 million in O&M funds for projects in U.S. Central Command and an additional $300 million for construction in Afghanistan for urgent military requirements. The FY2010 NDAA extended the authority to use O&M funding for military construction, with a $500 million total limit on projects in Central Command. In FY2009, DOD added $409 million from O&M accounts for construction in Afghanistan, raising the total to $1.4 billion. In FY2009, DOD added $409 million from O&M accounts for construction in Afghanistan, bringing the total to $1.4 billion. If DOD dedicated the full $500 million in O&M available for military construction in Afghanistan in FY2010, the total would reach $2.4 billion, nearly doubling the prior seven-year investment. DOD has proposed using O&M monies for minor construction in support of contingency operations until October 1, 2012, which could further increase funding for military construction in Afghanistan. If the proposal is approved by Congress, total funding for military construction in Afghanistan could increase. Key bases receiving significant investments include Bagram Air Base with $1.3 billion invested, Kandahar Air Base with $767 million appropriated, and Forward Operating Base Tombstone/Bastion with $595 million allocated. DOD's commitment in Afghanistan is evident through these investments. The DOD has requested $894 million for military construction projects, with a new proposal allowing the use of O&M funds for unspecified projects up to $3 million each in support of contingency operations until September 30, 2012. This would increase the per project cap from $750,000 to $3 million. The DOD proposed increasing the cap for minor construction projects to $3 million due to rising costs in Afghanistan. This would allow unlimited O&M funds for military construction in support of contingency operations worldwide. Quarterly reporting to congressional defense committees would be required within 60 days. The DOD requested $521 million for military construction projects in Afghanistan, but questions arose about the urgency of the request as DOD had $2.1 billion in unobligated funds from previous appropriations. In FY2009, DOD spent an average of $50 million per month on construction projects in Afghanistan, but this dropped to $26 million per month in the first five months of FY2010 for reasons not specified in DOD's report. DOD had $2.1 billion in unobligated funds from previous appropriations. To meet the deadline, DOD would need to increase its monthly obligations six-fold to $300 million. $700 million must be obligated by September 30, 2010, and $1.4 billion by September 30, 2011. The DOD needs to increase monthly obligations to $116 million to spend $1.4 billion for FY2010 projects. With additional funds, obligations would need to triple to $150 million a month and increase six-fold from the current rate. Some suggest considering the FY2010 supplemental request as part of DOD's FY2011 war request for better spending assessment. Total funding is needed for military construction/family housing. Total funding of $657 million was allocated for military construction/family housing in H.R. 4899, including $649 million for war-related construction in Afghanistan and $8 million for non war-related Air Force expenses. The Senate added $127.5 million above the request to accelerate Air Force projects for FY2011. The report recommended including contingency construction requirements in the Military Construction budget request if known at the time, with funds available until September 30, 2011. The final bill did not include $16.5 million for a new Soldier Readiness Processing Center at Fort Hood, TX. The Administration's FY2010 Supplemental request under the international affairs budget function addressed foreign economic assistance for Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan. The request aimed to support the drawdown of U.S. military forces in Iraq and increase responsibilities in Afghanistan. The Pakistan request demonstrated U.S. support. The Pakistan request in the Administration's FY2010 Supplemental addressed U.S. support and strengthening the government's presence in insurgent areas. The total international affairs budget request for war-related programs was $4.46 billion, with $1.8 billion for State Department personnel and infrastructure, and $2.6 billion for foreign aid to support U.S. security, economic growth, social services, and democratization objectives. Funding was requested for each country in discrete amounts. The FY2010 Supplemental request focused on U.S. support in insurgent areas and strengthening government presence in Pakistan. The Administration requested funding for specific needs in each country, excluding P.L.480 food aid and Global Health/Child Survival accounts. The enacted version increased total funding for war-related foreign aid and diplomatic operations to $9.2 billion, a 55% increase from FY2009. The Administration's international affairs State, Foreign Operations request for Afghanistan was $714 million less than the Administration request, totaling $3.7 billion. The strategy focuses on civilian programs in governance, economic growth, and social services, in conjunction with U.S. military efforts. Strengthening the U.S. civilian presence and increasing aid to local government have been ongoing for over a year. The December 2009 \"surge\" strategy accelerated the need for civilian assistance delivery in insurgent areas contested by the U.S. military. The new strategy aims to increase stability and reduce insurgency strength by creating jobs and providing social services through the Afghan government. Key concerns include the Afghan government's readiness to provide leadership and staff. The Afghan government's ability to provide leadership, staff, and support to local communities in conflict areas is a key concern. High levels of corruption may hinder effective service delivery. Monitoring and ensuring accountability of increasing aid levels is also a concern. The increase in U.S. aid personnel and request for inspector general offices reflects concerns about corruption in aid programs. The Afghanistan supplemental request aimed to boost international affairs funding for the country, with P.L. 111-212 also increasing aid and State support. The FY2010 State Department diplomatic operations account would rise by nearly 90% under the request. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 increases total FY2010 aid levels by 55% over the previous year, with a significant boost in diplomatic operations and foreign aid for Afghanistan. The Administration sought additional funds for Economic Support, International Narcotics, and Diplomatic Programs. The FY2010 aid levels were increased by 55% with a focus on boosting diplomatic operations and foreign aid for Afghanistan. The Economic Support Fund (ESF) request includes funds for alternative development, conflict mitigation, rule of law, and good governance in Afghanistan. The US allocated $760 million to strengthen Afghan government agencies, including $450 million for the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund and $115 million for the Ministry of Finance. Additionally, $50 million each was allocated for Health and Education, $7 million for Macroeconomic growth, $19.5 million for Trade and investment, and $4.5 million for the Financial sector. The US allocated $215 million for Agriculture to build capacity countrywide and support various programs. Additionally, $60.4 million was allocated for Private sector development and $8.6 million for Economic opportunity, including expanding credit union services. Three quarters of the $200 million request aimed at supporting the justice sector, with the remainder targeting counter-narcotics programs. The FY2010 State Department Diplomatic and Consular request included funding for various justice sector programs, such as expanding corrections programs, model prisons, increasing judicial personnel, and supporting counter-narcotics efforts. Additional funds were allocated for women's justice activities, counternarcotics police, drug treatment facilities, and legal aid. The FY2010 State Department Diplomatic and Consular Programs request of $211 million aimed to increase civilian personnel, including 457 new positions for work in Kabul ministries and Provincial Reconstruction Teams. This \"whole of government\" approach involved federal employees from the Department of State and USAID on a reimbursable basis. The Department of State proposed hiring federal employees from various agencies and locally employed staff to support American personnel in Kabul. A 2010 Inspector General's report praised the embassy's management but expressed concerns about staff being overworked due to a tripling in size. The proposed expansion under the supplemental budget would further increase personnel. The supplemental budget proposes a further expansion of staff in Kabul, which would strain resources and have implications for staff management and housing. Additional funding is requested for oversight programs, including $14 million for SIGAR and $3 million for the State Department Inspector General. The final version of H.R. 4899 includes $1.7 billion for Afghanistan assistance, lower than the $2.0 billion request. The enacted version cuts the ESF request by $267 million compared to the Administration's proposal. The Senate report on H.R. 4899 expresses concerns about funding levels for ESF program sectors in Afghanistan, cutting good governance activities by $160 million and alternative development by $35 million. It limits direct government budget support to $100 million and reduces the INCLE account by $31 million due to doubts about the Government of Afghanistan's commitment to reform. The enacted legislation addresses oversight issues and rejects the request for SIGAR funding, stating that sufficient funding is available from previous appropriations. It rescinds $7.2 million in FY2009 supplemental SIGAR appropriations and re-appropriates it in the FY10 supplemental. The legislation also includes conditions on Afghanistan aid, requiring the Secretary of State to report on Afghan government accountability before aid can be obligated. The Secretary of State must report on Afghan government accountability before aid can be obligated. Aid will only be provided if Afghan representatives and civil society are consulted, specific benchmarks are set, and the Government of Afghanistan cooperates in reform efforts and respects human rights. Funding for the Electoral Commission is contingent on no involvement in fraud in 2009. The Commission overseeing the 2009 elections had no members involved in fraud. Aid for reconciliation with Taliban members is tied to Afghan women's participation in government and protection of their rights. H.R. 4899 allows up to $300 million for DC&P and Embassy Construction in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan. The FY2010 supplemental request for Iraq included an increase in U.S. assistance and State Department operations in response to the drawdown of U.S. military forces. The total U.S. assistance program to Iraq would have risen by 64% from the FY2009 level under the request. The FY2010 supplemental request for Iraq included a significant increase in U.S. assistance and State Department operations in response to the drawdown of U.S. military forces. Total Iraq economic aid programs would have been boosted by 89% over the previous year with the enacted version of H.R. 4899. The State operations account would have risen by 79%, but under the enacted legislation, total FY2010 State operations only rise by 43% over the FY2009 level. The most significant element in the international affairs component of the supplemental for Iraq was the request for $517.4 million in INCLE funds for the transition of responsibility for police training from the Department of Defense to the Department of State. The State Department ceded police training in Iraq to DOD before the invasion. Now, it will advise the Ministry of Interior, police, and border forces. A smooth transition from DOD to State Department is needed by the end of FY2010. The INCLE request includes deploying 350 advisors to work with Iraqi police and funding infrastructure and security staff. Training of the Iraqi military remains with DOD. The FY2010 supplemental request for INCLE's program in Iraq includes funding for infrastructure, security staff, and operational costs amounting to $1.57 billion. The program is expected to employ up to 2,000 U.S. government and contractor personnel to maintain civilian outreach following the U.S. military drawdown. Over 1,200 direct-hire American employees from 14 civilian agencies are stationed in Iraq, conducting various diplomatic missions to further U.S. economic and commercial interests. They are based at the Embassy in Baghdad, Regional Embassy Office in Basrah, and 16 Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs), some of which are embedded with military units for logistical and security support. During the 2007 surge, embedded PRTs (ePRTs) were established to expand civilian presence in additional locations protected by combat battalions. The U.S. civilian employees in Iraq conduct diplomatic missions to further economic interests, provide political analysis, public diplomacy outreach, and oversee government assistance programs. They support reconstruction, economic assistance, rule of law programs, and training with Iraqi ministry and local government personnel. Embedded PRTs are being phased out as combat battalions withdraw from cities, with regular PRTs expected to end by 2011. The State Department plans to establish a continued civilian presence outside of Baghdad. The State Department plans to establish two consulates and three temporary Provincial Diplomatic Teams outside of Baghdad, with two U.S. Forces-Iraq managed PRTs remaining through 2011. The funding request includes realigning infrastructure for the presence of an Embassy, consulates, PDTs, and Defense Department PRTs, with costs previously covered by the military now assumed by the State Department. The State Department will have to assume costs for infrastructure, equipment, building leases, dining, and support ($307.8 million), develop planned consulate facilities to meet security standards ($526.8 million), and implement security requirements for new field facilities ($735.3 million) as it takes over responsibilities from the Department of Defense. The State Department will need to increase contract employees to provide various services like security, operations planning, maintenance, cleaning, and food preparation. There have been criticisms in the past about the Department's lack of personnel to oversee contracts. It is unclear if the Department has expanded its capabilities in contract management to meet its growing responsibilities in Iraq. The final enacted version of H.R. 4899 provides $1.7 billion for Iraq, cutting the request for diplomatic operations by $540 million. Senate appropriators suggested prioritizing site development and construction of consulates in Basrah and northern Iraq. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 increases the amount requested for INCLE by $133 million, reconfiguring the use of funds for police training in Iraq. This funding is subject to approval by the Secretary of State and the Iraqi Government's cooperation. The Pakistan supplemental request for funding showed a modest shift in U.S. policy, with a focus on specific infrastructure needs to support the government and counter insurgency in vulnerable areas. The U.S. government requested $244 million in ESF for Pakistan, including funds for cash payments, water and sanitation, agriculture irrigation, and energy solutions. Additionally, $40 million in INCLE funds were requested for police training and related infrastructure. The U.S. government requested $32 million for police training and infrastructure, $4 million for corrections administration support, and $4 million for program administration and police advisor positions. Additionally, $60 million in Foreign Military Financing was requested for five Bell-412 helicopters for counterinsurgency operations. The FY2010 supplemental also included $26 million for State Department operations to increase staffing at U.S. diplomatic facilities in Pakistan. The FY2010 regular appropriations funded increased staffing for U.S. diplomatic facilities in Pakistan, including U.S. direct-hire personnel and Locally Employed Staff (LES) to manage military and economic assistance. This increase aimed to provide more contracting and management officers, embassy staff for logistical support, and additional staffing at U.S. consulates in Lahore, Karachi, and Peshawar. The Administration is increasing staffing in Pakistan to strengthen U.S. outreach and programs at provincial and local levels. H.R. 4899 provides $375 million for Pakistan aid and diplomatic operations, $5 million more than the request. This includes adjustments in funding levels for FMF and ESF. The enacted legislation includes $15 million more than the request for ESF, with $5 million for human rights and $10 million for families affected by military operations. It also includes $1.5 million for leasing aircraft to monitor programs in Pakistan. The Obama Administration requested $2.8 billion for Haiti relief and reconstruction in FY2010. The Obama Administration requested $2.8 billion for Haiti relief and reconstruction in FY2010, primarily for Port-au-Prince following the 2010 earthquake. The funds were considered emergency requirements for urgent needs in Haiti, covering reimbursement of past obligations and new activities by U.S. agencies. About 55% of the total request was for relief activities related to the earthquake disaster, while 40% was for new recovery efforts. The Haiti earthquake, considered one of the most devastating catastrophes, has affected approximately 3 million people, with 230,000 deaths and 300,600 injured. The relief effort is expected to last for months. Before the earthquake, Haiti was already designated as one of the 50 least developed countries, facing a high risk of remaining in poverty and requiring significant attention from the international community. The protection of the displaced population is a critical issue, with an estimated 1.69 million displaced in Port-au-Prince and 597,000 in areas outside the capital. Some Haitians have also left the country as refugees. In Haiti, aid workers are providing basic necessities to Internally Displaced Populations (IDPs), but there is a shortage of emergency shelter. With the rainy season starting soon, the focus is on providing waterproof shelter, improving sanitation, and meeting the basic needs of the displaced and vulnerable Haitians. The Haiti Post Disaster Needs Assessment found that $11.5 billion is needed for recovery and reconstruction. At a donors conference, $10 billion was pledged by various countries and organizations, with the U.S. pledging $1.2 billion. Improved accountability of donor assistance is emphasized to enhance aid effectiveness and reduce corruption. The government of Haiti has made progress in reducing corruption and increasing transparency. The U.S. Agency for International Development helped establish an online monitoring system for aid. H.R. 4899 includes $2.93 billion for Haiti, $129 million more than requested. The House adopted the Senate version of H.R. 4899 on July 27, 2010, which included $1.642 billion for relief activities, $1.140 billion for recovery and reconstruction, and $147 million for diplomatic operations. The total funding for Haiti was $2.93 billion, $129 million more than requested. The $1.5 billion humanitarian relief funding request included allocations for various assistance programs such as USAID International Disaster Assistance, Agriculture Department emergency food assistance, State Department peacekeeping activities, Department of Defense and U.S. Coast Guard relief activities, Department of Health and Human Services grants for Haitian evacuees, and Department of Homeland Security immigration fees. President Obama also announced an additional $100 million in humanitarian assistance on January 14, 2010. President Obama announced $100 million in humanitarian assistance on January 14, 2010, in addition to pre-existing funding for Haiti. As of June 11, 2010, the United States has provided over $1.1 billion in humanitarian funding for Haiti. The FY2010 supplemental request included $350.7 million for International Disaster Assistance, with $126.6 million allocated for USAID to reimburse other U.S. government agencies for earthquake relief efforts in Haiti. Additional funding of $35.6 million was designated for Search and Rescue services. The United States provided $35.6 million for Search and Rescue agreements, USAID/Disaster Assistance Response Team Program Support, and USAID/Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance Relief Commodities. The remaining $188.5 million covered ongoing humanitarian assistance activities in Haiti, coordinated with various agencies and organizations through the U.N. cluster system. The United States provided funding for various humanitarian programs in Haiti, including coordination, logistics, shelter, health, nutrition, water, sanitation, hygiene, and child protection. Additionally, emergency food assistance grants were allocated for the World Food Program and Private Voluntary Organizations. The United States provided funding for humanitarian programs in Haiti, including emergency food assistance grants for Private Voluntary Organizations. Up to two million people may need food assistance due to the earthquake, with relief operations expected to continue through 2010. Recovery and reconstruction efforts will target the most vulnerable and focus on food-for-work programs. The international community, including the United Nations and the United States, has been actively involved in providing humanitarian assistance in response to natural disasters in Haiti, particularly hurricanes. Disaster risks in Haiti are significant, and efforts are being made to develop a disaster response capacity. Finding ways to overcome the cycle of disaster and develop a disaster response capacity are critical to minimize humanitarian consequences and sustain reconstruction efforts. The United States is a leader in providing humanitarian assistance during disasters, with strong bipartisan congressional support. The Administration may deplete its disaster accounts to fund immediate emergency relief efforts, such as in Haiti. The State Department reported that resources for responding to humanitarian crises in Haiti needed replenishing by June 1, 2010, or U.S. capacity for other emergencies could be impacted. Relief funding in the request would reimburse previous expenses. The United Nations issued a $1.44 billion Revised Humanitarian Appeal for Haiti, with $874 million (58%) committed by June 4, 2010. The United Nations issued a $1.44 billion Revised Humanitarian Appeal for Haiti, with $874 million (58%) committed by June 4, 2010. It is unclear if donor amounts represent pledges or actual contributions, and funds committed may not be new contributions. The actual costs of the Haiti disaster and how they will be shared among international donors will become clearer over time. Sustaining donor interest and honoring existing pledges could be challenging as the situation stabilizes in Haiti. The international community faced challenges in delivering humanitarian assistance to Haiti after the earthquake due to slow response, criticism, weakened capacity of the Haitian government, damaged infrastructure, and logistical challenges. Some experts are concerned about bureaucratic red tape, Haitian government capacity, US role, and coordination issues in the relief response in Haiti. Challenges on the ground are significant, leading to delays and difficulties. Evaluations and debates on the humanitarian efforts are ongoing as recovery moves forward. The DOD and U.S. Coast Guard requested $700 million for humanitarian relief efforts in Haiti under Operation Unified Response. The funds covered expenses incurred through June 15, 2010, including soldier subsistence and personal expenses. The DOD's response to the Haitian earthquake was rapid and extensive, with over 20,000 U.S. military personnel involved in various relief efforts. The mission ended on June 1, 2010, after providing soldier subsistence, transportation support, humanitarian relief supplies, and conducting several projects. The DOD's earthquake response mission in Haiti ended on June 1, 2010, with the redeployment of the last 300 U.S. military personnel. Further assistance will be provided through the \"New Horizons\" annual humanitarian exercise involving National Guard and Reserve soldiers in engineering projects like building schools and clinics. The U.S. military ended its earthquake response mission in Haiti on June 1, 2010. \"New Horizons\" will continue with projects like constructing schools and clinics. The U.S.S. Iwo Jima was set to provide medical assistance in Port de Paix. Concerns were raised about the premature withdrawal of U.S. forces and the capabilities of Haitian security forces and U.N. security personnel. The Administration requested $96.5 million for the State Department's Contributions to International Peacekeeping Activities (CIPA) account to fund U.S. assessed contributions to the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), a peacekeeping operation. MINUSTAH levels increased by 3,500 after the earthquake, with military personnel growing from 6,940 to 8,940 and the police component growing from 2,211 to 3,711. On June 4, 2010, the Security Council in its resolution 1927, increased the police component by another 680. The Security Council increased the police component in MINUSTAH by 680 to provide temporary surge capacity, raising the ceiling to 4,391 police. The Administration requested funds to aid Haitian evacuees and migrants to the United States, including benefits programs and waiving fees for immigration requests. $256.2 million would be provided for activities of the Department of Health and Human Services. The Administration requested $256.2 million to aid Haitian evacuees and migrants to the United States. $220.0 million would go directly to HHS for various activities, with an additional $36.2 million for USAID to reimburse HHS. The funding would cover Medicaid and CHIP costs, medical evacuations, assistance for evacuees, and public health activities in Haiti. Funding allocation details were not specified. The request for $256.2 million to aid Haitian evacuees and migrants to the United States did not specify funding allocation details for various activities. Supplemental funds cover Medicaid and CHIP costs for eligible medical and non-medical evacuees, including Haitians with humanitarian parole status. Medicaid eligibility for Cuban-Haitian Entrants lasts for seven years in the United States. The request for funds would be used to reimburse the HHS National Disaster Medical System for costs associated with medical evacuation of seriously injured earthquake victims to the United States and their subsequent care in U.S. hospitals. NDMS will reimburse hospitals for the costs of care for 30 days for any individual medically evacuated from Haiti, regardless of citizenship or nationality. Costs beyond 30 days are not covered. The requested funds would be used to provide cash and medical assistance to Haitian humanitarian parolees, eligible for federal resettlement assistance. Repatriation costs would also be covered. The ORR provides funding to states for transitional cash and medical assistance through the Transition and Medical Services program for Haitian parolees who meet certain eligibility requirements. Additionally, requested funds would support public health activities in Haiti such as disease surveillance and environmental health initiatives. The $36.2 million requested for USAID reimbursements to HHS would cover medical, surgical, and mortuary assistance teams deployed to Haiti, including personnel and supplies for a 250-bed hospital. U.S. disaster assistance to other nations does not typically involve accepting large numbers of disaster victims into the United States. Some forms of assistance to Haitian earthquake victims may be unprecedented, such as the use of NDMS for mass medical evacuation. The NDMS system, typically used for evacuating injured U.S. combat forces, was utilized for airlifting victims of foreign disasters into the U.S. for medical care after the Haiti earthquake. This required rapid development of policies for patient selection, hospital assignment, and reimbursement. The President's supplemental request included $15 million for USCIS to cover immigration-related costs for Haitian migrants. USCIS funds processing of immigrant, nonimmigrant, refugee, asylum, and citizenship benefits through fees collected. For FY2010, USCIS has a budget authority of $2.727 billion, with $2.503 billion coming from collected fees. The Homeland Security Appropriations Act 2010 provided $224 million in direct appropriations to USCIS, including $50 million for processing refugee applications and asylum claims. The supplemental appropriations included $15 million to reimburse USCIS for waived fees for eligible Haitians granted TPS and humanitarian parole, as well as for processing adoption of Haitian orphans. The final version of the appropriations bill provides an additional $110 million for Haiti IDA relief activities, matching the earlier House and Senate versions. It also includes $150 million for P.L. 480-Title II assistance for food needs in Haiti and approves the overall $655 million request for the Department of Defense, with a transfer of $255 million from the OHDACA account. Additionally, $5 million is added to the Coast Guard's request. The final version of the appropriations bill approves additional funding for Haiti IDA relief activities and P.L. 480-Title II assistance for food needs in Haiti. It also endorses funding for Contributions to International Peacekeeping Activities in Haiti, Department of Health and Human Services services for Haitian evacuees and migrants, and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services costs for Haitian migrants. The supplemental proposal for Recovery and Reconstruction funding in Haiti requested $1.1 billion for new activities. The 111th Congress showed bipartisan support for providing substantial assistance to Haiti after the earthquake crisis. Members emphasized the need for a coordinated international effort for immediate humanitarian needs and long-term development, aiming for a more sustainable Haiti. The supplemental proposal for Recovery and Reconstruction funding in Haiti requested $1.1 billion for new activities to create a more sustainable Haiti and increase Haitian capacity to utilize foreign aid effectively. Donors have agreed to focus on urgent infrastructure repairs, critical health care, governance, and security. Some observers are concerned that U.S. assistance is neglecting areas crucial to Haitian recovery, such as improving the educational system. The revised Haitian development strategy, supported by the supplemental request, aims to catalyze economic growth and provide services outside of Port-au-Prince to address the urban-rural imbalance in the country. The Inter-American Development Bank, Canada, and France are involved in this approach, which critics question for its limited aid priorities. The supplemental request funds short- and long-term initiatives to create a more sustainable Haiti. The supplemental request funds initiatives to decentralize development in Haiti, focusing on meeting immediate needs of displaced populations and strengthening local governance and infrastructure outside of Port-au-Prince. Scientists assist in selecting less vulnerable areas for development, but officials warn of high costs and caution against forcibly relocating populations. Experts caution against forcibly relocating populations in Haiti and emphasize the need for targeted programs to reduce poverty. Aid organizations face challenges in balancing effectiveness and efficiency with the time and resources required for capacity building. The supplemental proposal requested $749 million in Economic Support Funds for International Assistance programs in Haiti, focusing on infrastructure rehabilitation, technical assistance, and reconstruction projects for essential services. This may require more time, funding, and personnel, with measurable results taking longer to achieve. The Administration requested up to $120 million of Economic Support Funds to be transferred to a multi-donor trust fund for Haiti, to leverage resources from other donors. Additionally, ESF monies could be transferred to USAID's Operating Expenses account for staffing needs and related expenses, without displacing other projects. Some experts suggest developing small-scale, alternative energy sources locally in Haiti to improve quality of life and economic growth. Concerns have been raised about insufficient funding for children's needs and psychological support for the traumatized population. No additional funding was allocated for Global Health and Child Survival. The State Department would receive about $144 million for International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement activities in Haiti to strengthen law enforcement and support the Haiti National Police. This funding aims to address the renewed need for security in broader areas of Haiti. The requested funds aim to strengthen the Haiti National Police by providing training, equipment, and infrastructure, as well as rebuilding prisons. Other programs focus on enhancing criminal justice support, counter-narcotics operations, and combating human trafficking. Additionally, funds are allocated for oversight and accountability measures to reduce corruption in relief and reconstruction efforts in Haiti. The Administration requested $690,000 for a Treasury Department attach\u00e9 to work with senior Haitian officials and oversee technical advisors. An additional $7.1 million was requested for advisors to restore basic treasury processes, reduce corruption, and enhance economic management skills. Up to $120 million was also requested due to setbacks caused by the earthquake in financial management progress. The Administration requested up to $120 million in Economic Support Funds for a Multi-Donor Trust Fund to aid Haiti's recovery from the earthquake. Despite criticism, Haitian officials acknowledge limited capacities and are setting up a development authority for long-term guidance. The Administration proposed $252 million in U.S. contributions to cancel Haiti's debts to international organizations. This includes reallocating $40 million from the Treasury Department's Debt Restructuring Account and seeking new contributions of $212 million for multilateral debt relief. Congressional authorization is required for the reallocation. The final version of H.R. 4899, P.L. 111-212 approves $1.140 billion for all FY2010 recovery and reconstruction activities for Haiti, $26 million more than the Administration requested. Direct budget support to the Haitian government requires written agreements with clear goals and mechanisms to prevent fund misuse. Funding to the Haitian government should be suspended if conditions are not met. The final version imposes restrictions and reporting. The final version of H.R. 4899, P.L. 111-212 approves $1.140 billion for all FY2010 recovery and reconstruction activities for Haiti, with restrictions and reporting requirements on Economic Support Funds (ESF) and International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE) funds. These funds cannot be disbursed until the Secretary of State confirms Haitian government involvement in program design and execution. The final version of H.R. 4899, P.L. 111-212 approves $1.140 billion for all FY2010 recovery and reconstruction activities for Haiti, with restrictions on ESF and INCLE funds. ESF and INCLE may only be provided if the Haitian government carries out reform, including removing corrupt officials. Funding for \"justice programs\" is prohibited until a credible investigation into alleged extrajudicial killings by Haitian police in January 2010 is completed. The Haitian judiciary's ability to conduct such investigations is weak. $770 million is approved for ESF, $21 million more than requested, with the mentioned restrictions. The final version of H.R. 4899, P.L. 111-212 approves $1.140 billion for all FY2010 recovery and reconstruction activities for Haiti, with restrictions on ESF and INCLE funds. The Administration's request did not include funding for education programs. The final act provides up to $10 million for children's education and directs U.S. agencies to collaborate with Haiti on renewable energy programs. The enacted version also includes directives on development and governance programs, family-based care for orphans, access to reconstruction grants for small NGOs, and reforestation. $148 million is approved for INCLE funding, $4 million more than requested, with $2 million for construction and improvement projects. The final version of H.R. 4899, P.L. 111-212 approves $3 million for oversight of increased funding for Haiti and the requested funding for a Treasury Department attach\u00e9 and advisors. It also authorizes $120 million for a multi-donor trust fund, using appropriated funds from the Economic Support Fund. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 authorizes up to $252 million in U.S. contributions for multilateral debt relief for Haiti, with additional funds transferred from existing sources. The Secretary of State is required to submit progress reports every 90 days until September 30, 2012, assessing U.S. contributions towards Haitian development goals and donor coordination. The Administration requested $155 million for diplomatic and broadcasting operations in Haiti, with $149.5 million for the State Department. $65 million is allotted for logistical support and assistance for additional U.S. government personnel, and $84.5 million for repairing or replacing staff housing and other buildings associated with the Embassy. Some funds could be used for evacuating Embassy family members and non-essential personnel, and providing repatriation loans to American citizens needing assistance to return to the United States. The State Department requested $155 million for diplomatic and broadcasting operations in Haiti. This includes funds for logistical support, repairing staff housing, and providing assistance for U.S. government personnel. Additionally, $5 million is allocated for the Broadcasting Board of Governors' Creole Language Service to support broadcasting stations and hire staff. The State Department requested $155 million for diplomatic and broadcasting operations in Haiti, including funds for logistical support, repairing staff housing, and hiring additional staff. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 added $147 million for State Department operations and broadcasting in diplomatic operations in Haiti, $8 million less than requested. Additionally, $592 million was added for foreign economic and humanitarian assistance programs for other countries. Under H.R. 4899, Mexico receives $5 million for emergency security support for U.S. diplomats and $175 million for activities related to the Merida Initiative. Jordan gets $100 million for Iraqi refugee issues and $50 million for security needs. El Salvador receives $25 million for relief and reconstruction efforts. El Salvador receives $25 million in ESF for Hurricane Ida relief. Congo gets $15 million for civilian assistance in the eastern region. USAID's GHCS receives $45 million for pandemic influenza. State Department's MRA account receives $165 million for refugee assistance. Vietnam recommended to receive $12 million. In a recent Appropriations Committee report, Vietnam is recommended to receive $12 million in ESF funds for the remediation of dioxin contamination at Da Nang Airport. The Administration also requested $600 million for border security due to security concerns. Additional funding was requested for Capitol Police, but no extra funding was sought for preventing teacher, law enforcement, and firefighter layoffs, providing financing for farmers, energy loans, Pell Grants, or mine safety. The House's amended version of the bill H.R. 4899, P.L. 111-212 enacted on July 29, 2010, did not include substantial funding for preventing teacher, law enforcement, and firefighter layoffs, and providing additional Pell Grants. However, funding for these proposals may be included in other bills. For example, the Senate passed an amendment to H.R. 1586 on August 6. The House passed an amendment to H.R. 1586, providing $10 billion for the Education Jobs Fund and increasing federal Medicaid reimbursements. These funds are expected to help states retain law enforcement and firefighters. The bill is offset over ten years and the Administration did not request additional funds in FY2010 to prevent layoffs of teachers, law enforcement officers, or firefighters. President Obama and Congress are working on this issue. The final version of H.R. 4899 did not include funds to prevent teacher layoffs as President Obama and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan had requested. The House passed an amended version with $10 billion for the Education Jobs Fund, but later withdrew support and adopted the Senate version. The final version of H.R. 4899, passed on July 27, 2010, adopted the Senate version. The House's earlier amended bill included $10 billion for the Education Jobs Fund but was offset by cuts to various education programs, triggering a veto threat from the Administration. An estimate from the American Association of School Administrators indicated that about 275,000 teachers and school staff could be affected by the proposed cuts. In 49 states, around 275,000 teachers and school staff could face layoffs in the 2010-2011 school year without additional funding like the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act. The AASA estimates pupil-to-teacher ratios may increase from 15:1 to 17:1. The Education Jobs Fund proposed to distribute funds to state governors based on a population-based formula used for the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund. The ARRA did not target preventing teacher layoffs, but funds were used for this purpose. The HAC majority draft bill would require the U.S. Department of Education to distribute funds to states within 45 days of enactment. States would need to provide assurances to receive funds and meet maintenance of effort requirements. Additional requirements would apply specifically to Texas. The final version of H.R. 4899 did not include supplemental funding for hiring programs under the Community. The final version of H.R. 4899 did not include supplemental funding for hiring programs under the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Office, which was proposed in a draft House Appropriations Committee (HAC) bill but later dropped. This funding would have helped law enforcement agencies facing budget shortfalls to hire or retain officers, but it was not included in the approved version of the bill. The proposed $1.179 billion for hiring additional or retaining current officers may only be a temporary solution if tax revenues do not rebound. States may need to lay off officers again if funds are insufficient. The demand for hiring funds is high, as seen with over 7,200 applications requesting $8.3 billion for 40,000 positions in response to previous funding. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 did not include funds for firefighter hiring and retention. The House did not provide funds for the SAFER program, which supports local fire departments in hiring and maintaining firefighters. Proponents argue for an additional $500 million to prevent staffing reductions due to budget shortfalls. Opponents argue that SAFER already received the highest funding in FY2010. The House did not provide additional funds for the SAFER program, which supports local fire departments in hiring and maintaining firefighters. Opponents argue that current funding is sufficient, citing the highest appropriation in FY2010. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 includes $32 million for the Department of Agriculture in response to concerns about credit shortages for agricultural enterprises. Administration interest in accelerating nuclear and energy efficiency projects was not fully funded in P.L. 111-212. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 includes $32 million to address credit shortages in the farm loan and rural housing loan guarantee programs due to high demand for government loans since 2008. These funds offset a $50 million shortfall within agriculture by limiting outlays from a mandatory bioenergy program. Without these supplemental appropriations, qualified loan applications from farmers and rural homebuyers may go unfunded for the rest of FY2010. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 includes $32 million to address credit shortages in farm and rural housing loan guarantee programs. It limits $50 million from a bioenergy program within agriculture. Additionally, it raises fees for Section 502 rural housing loans and adds $697 million in loan guarantee authority. The Agriculture Department is requesting $75 million for direct loans under Section 502 in FY2011. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 includes $32 million to address credit shortages in farm and rural housing loan guarantee programs. It provides $12 billion in loan guarantees at no cost to the government. The Agriculture Department is requesting $151 million for FY2011 to support $4.7 billion of farm loans. The final version dropped $50 million for The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) and $979 million of other rescissions from Agriculture Department accounts. The FY2010 supplemental funding included $487 million for the WIC program, $422 million for rural development (including $300 million for rural broadband), and $70 million for the Natural Resources Conservation Service. The FY2011 funding request for the Department of Energy's Loan Guarantee Program is pending, with hopes to accelerate clean energy projects and nuclear power plant LGP. The DOE's FY2011 Loan Guarantee Program request for $500 million for credit subsidy costs may be reduced by $180 million, allowing nuclear power plant projects to move forward. The House included $180 million in the supplemental for innovative energy technology projects, with $90 million for advanced nuclear power facilities and $90 million for renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. The DOE requested $36.0 billion in loan guarantee authority for nuclear power projects and $500 million for credit subsidy costs for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects in FY 2011. Established in 2005, the program received its first real funding in FY2009 through the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act, with $6 billion allocated for commercial renewable projects. The Recovery Act allocated $6 billion for commercial renewable energy projects. In July 2009, $2 billion was redirected to the Cash-for-Clunkers program. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 does not include $4.95 billion for the Federal Pell Grant Program. The House Appropriations Committee FY2011 subcommittee allocations include an additional $5.7 billion for the Federal Pell Grant Program to maintain the $4,860 discretionary maximum award level in AY2011-12, authorized by Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965. The Federal Pell Grant program, authorized by Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, is the largest federal source of grant aid for postsecondary education. It provides need-based grant aid to approximately 8.3 million undergraduate students. The program is funded through discretionary and mandatory appropriations. In FY2010, an additional $600 million was requested for border security, partially offset by rescinding $100 million in Department of Homeland Security funds. The Administration is rescinding $100 million in Department of Homeland Security funds for SBInet, also known as the \"virtual border fence.\" The remaining funds will be designated as emergency requirements, with $399 million for DHS and $201 million for the Department of Justice. Within the DHS allocation, $297 million will be used to hire 1,000 new Border Patrol agents, $37 million for two new unmanned aerial detection systems, $53 million for 160 new ICE agents, $6.5 million for 30 new CBP officers, and $6 million for 20. The $201 million of DOJ funding would increase the presence of Federal law enforcement in the Southwest border districts by adding ATF Gunrunner Teams, FBI Hybrid Task Forces, DEA agents, equipment, operational support, attorneys, immigration judges, and additional detention and incarceration costs for criminal aliens in coordination with DHS enforcement activities. The amendments would provide funding to support Mexican law enforcement operations with ballistic analysis, DNA analysis, information sharing, technical capabilities, and technical assistance. The House passed H.R. 5875 with $701 million for border security, including $201 million to DOJ for more law enforcement personnel. The Administration requested $201 million for border security efforts, including funding for more law enforcement personnel. Additionally, $118 million was requested for activities related to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The Administration requested $29 million for the Department of the Interior to conduct additional inspections, enforcement, studies, and other activities related to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. $13 million for NOAA to mitigate economic impact on fishermen and fishery-related businesses affected by the oil spill; $10 million for the Department of Justice for enforcement actions under the Oil Pollution Act and Clean Water Act; $7 million for NOAA for research in support of the oil spill. The final version of H.R. 4899 approves a total of $94 million for oil-spill related programs, including research, economic assistance, environmental impact studies, and seafood inspection technology. The final version of H.R. 4899 approves $94 million for oil-spill related programs, including funding for NOAA for fisheries disaster relief, stock assessment, and a study on the ecosystem in the Gulf. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 approves $94 million for oil-spill related programs, including funding for NOAA for fisheries disaster relief and a study on the Gulf ecosystem. Additionally, it authorizes the Army Corps of Engineers to use a portion of discretionary funds for dredging to mitigate oil spill impacts. The Administration requested $17.9 billion in additional mandatory spending for various purposes. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 approves funding for oil-spill related programs, including relief for fisheries and a study on the Gulf ecosystem. It also authorizes funds for dredging to mitigate oil spill impacts. Additionally, there is funding allocated for government responsibility in handling Indian land trusts, settling discrimination claims of black farmers, increasing Coast Guard funding for response activities, and a proposed new unemployment benefit program for those affected by the spill. The Secretary of the Department of Veterans' Affairs has authority to determine service-connected health problems for veterans. The Administration proposed that spending for VA benefits and Deepwater Horizon oil spill response be exempt from budget constraints, while court settlements would require new legislative authority and funds, potentially subject to budget rules. The Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs has the authority to establish presumptions of service connection for conditions related to Agent Orange exposure, including Parkinson's disease, ischemic heart disease, and hairy cell/B cell leukemia for Vietnam veterans. The VA issued proposed regulations on March 25, 2010, estimating $13.4 billion in costs for new presumptions of service connection for conditions related to Agent Orange exposure. Approximately 86,000 veterans may receive retroactive benefits for these conditions, with some eligible for increased disability ratings or new disability compensation. The VA issued proposed regulations estimating $13.4 billion in costs for new presumptions of service connection for conditions related to Agent Orange exposure. The impact of the presumptions on disability compensation and pensions is in the baseline for FY2011. CBO estimated that $5 billion would be needed in FY2010, with uncertainty about when final regulations will be issued. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 includes $13.4 billion for additional veterans benefits related to Agent Orange. Section 902 prohibits the VA from paying these claims until Congressional review period has expired. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 includes $13.4 billion for additional veterans benefits related to Agent Orange. Section 902 prohibits the VA from paying these claims until Congressional review period has expired. Unless Congress enacts a joint resolution changing the regulations, there will be no impact on the amount of veterans disability compensation for claims related to Agent Orange. The Administration requested $4.6 billion to settle two longstanding cases against the government: $1.15 billion for the Pigford Black Farmers Discrimination Case; and $3.4 billion for the Cobell Indian Trust Litigation Settlement. The claimants argue that settlements could be voided if funds are not appropriated by a certain date, but it's unclear if these are strict deadlines. The most recent deadline for the Cobell case is August 6, 2010, which has been extended multiple times. The FY2010 budget supplemental requested $1.15 billion to settle the Pigford II discrimination case brought by 70,000 black farmers. A settlement in the Pigford II case was announced on February 18, 2010, by Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack and Attorney General Eric H. Holder, Jr. The Pigford II settlement, requested $1.15 billion in FY2010 Budget, is final and non-appealable. If Congress fails to appropriate funds by March 31, 2010, claimants could void the settlement. No funds were appropriated by the deadline. The Administration sought $3.4 billion in FY2010 supplemental appropriations for settling litigation over mismanagement of individual Indian. In FY2010, $3.4 billion in supplemental appropriations was sought to settle litigation over mismanagement of individual Indian trust fund accounts in the Cobell v. Salazar case. $1.4 billion would be distributed to plaintiffs, $2 billion for purchasing trust land interests, and $60 million for education scholarships. The settlement requires legislative authorization by August 6, 2010, with a deadline extension granted for a fifth time. Further extensions are uncertain. The Cobell lawsuit arose from Interior's inability to accurately account for payments into and from Individual Indian Monies (IIM) trust accounts set up in the 19th century. Interior managed these accounts with difficulty due to the age of allotments and the splitting of interests in each tract. There are an estimated 384,000 IIM accounts with a total asset value over $460 million. Both plaintiffs and defendants may have reasons to support the Cobell lawsuit. The Cobell lawsuit involves the mismanagement of Individual Indian Monies trust accounts with a total asset value of over $460 million. Both plaintiffs and defendants may support the settlement to end years of costly litigation. Some Indian organizations and plaintiffs have differing opinions on the congressional approval of the settlement. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 does not include the requested $4.6 billion appropriation for the settlements. The $4.5 billion savings from reducing government drug costs in mandatory programs must be offset by increasing revenues or reducing other direct spending to comply with House and Senate rules. Language allowing use of the Judgment Fund for Cobell and Pigford II settlements was removed from the final version of H.R. 4213. Senator Reid's office may propose passing these provisions in a separate bill by unanimous consent. The final version of H.R. 4899 did not include provisions from the earlier House July amended version that identified $4.68 billion in mandatory savings over ten years. One provision aimed to increase rebates states receive from drug manufacturers by including more forms of drugs in the calculation of Average Manufacturer Price (AMP). The final version of H.R. 4899 did not include provisions from the earlier House July amended version that aimed to increase rebates states receive from drug manufacturers by including more forms of drugs in the calculation of Average Manufacturer Price (AMP). Another provision in the dropped House version would have reduced drug expenditures for federal programs by giving the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) more authority to limit deals between brand name and generic drug makers. The proposal aims to include injected, infused, and inhaled forms of outpatient drugs in the calculation of Average Manufacturer Price (AMP) for Medicaid rebates, increasing the amount owed by manufacturers. The House proposed a change to Medicaid drug rebates by including injected, infused, and inhaled drugs in the AMP calculation, which would increase manufacturer payments. The amendment was estimated to reduce federal Medicaid expenditures by $2.1 billion over 10 years, but the Senate did not accept this provision. The House proposed changes to Medicaid drug rebates by including additional drug forms in the AMP calculation to increase manufacturer payments. This is part of the Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act, which aims to prevent pay-to-delay arrangements between pharmaceutical patent holders and generic manufacturers. Since the Hatch-Waxman Act in 1984, the FDA can approve generic drugs after the patent period ends, preventing pay-to-delay agreements between brand-name and generic drug companies. This provision was not included in the enacted health reform bills. Generic drug prices are lower than brand-name products due to not having to repeat expensive clinical testing. Delays in generic availability increase costs for consumers and the government. Proposed provisions aim to make agreements involving compensation for delaying research, development, and marketing unlawful. The provision aims to make agreements involving compensation for delaying generic drug research, development, marketing, manufacturing, or sales unlawful. It would give FTC rulemaking authority, allow for judicial review, and impose civil penalties. CBO estimated that implementing this provision would reduce spending by $2.42 billion and increase federal revenues by $0.26 billion over the 2010-2020 period, ultimately reducing federal budget deficits by $2.68 billion. The Senate did not accept these provisions. The enacted version of the bill did not include $538 million for waste, fraud, and abuse initiatives in federal programs. These funds were intended for various government agencies to reduce improper payments and investigate illegal activities. Federal agencies conduct WFA activities to ensure appropriate federal expenditures and beneficiary entitlements. The $538 million in WFA funding was allocated for enhanced tax enforcement by the IRS and health care fraud control by HHS. Funds would be used for Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP programs. The $125 million program includes funds for the HHS Office of the Inspector General, Department of Justice for fraud investigations, SSA for disability reviews, and DOL for reemployment reviews. Funding is available until September 2011. The funding for the DOL, SSA, and IRS would be available until September 2011, while the HHS funds would be available until September 30, 2012. CBO estimated that the additional PI funding would increase the federal deficit by $538 million in 2010. The federal budget deficits would be increased by the same amount over the period 2010-2020. Additionally, the Administration proposed to expand the funds that the Coast Guard can draw from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund to finance its response activities and set up a new unemployment assistance program for individuals. The Administration proposed expanding the funds available for the Coast Guard from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund to finance response activities and establish a new unemployment assistance program for those not eligible for other benefits. This includes a $150 million annual withdrawal limit supported by an excise tax on petroleum. The Administration's proposal would appropriate funds for a new unemployment benefit program, with costs to be reimbursed by responsible parties under the Oil Pollution Act. Mandatory appropriations would be authorized as advances from the trust fund, with later withdrawals not requiring appropriations. CBO estimated $125 million in mandatory funds. The Administration's proposal includes $125 million in mandatory appropriations for the Coast Guard to respond to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, with advances from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund limited to $100 million each. Total expenditure for an incident is capped at $1 billion under current law. The Administration proposed increasing the cap on funds available for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill from $1 billion to $1.5 billion. The Office of Management and Budget estimated $1.575 billion would be available by the end of FY2010. The Coast Guard would need to notify Congress of any advances from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. The final version of H.R. 4899 included provisions for the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund that were the same as those in legislation, P.L. 111-191 ( S. 3473 ) that Congress passed separately on June 15, 2010, in response to concerns raised by Admiral Thad Allen, National Incident Commander for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano. The Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund cap was raised to $1 billion for the Deepwater Horizon spill through legislation enacted on June 15th, 2010. The Coast Guard can make $100 million withdrawals with 7-day notifications to Congress. CBO estimated $50 million in FY2010 offset by reimbursements in FY2012, not violating PAYGO rules. Actual funds available depend on $100 million advances drawn, up to the $1 billion cap, with reimbursements tied to liability enforcement under the Oil Pollution Act. The final version of H.R. 4899 did not include the Administration's proposed new mandatory unemployment compensation program. Congress addressed the Administration's $64.3 billion request for supplemental spending for FY2010 multiple times between March 24, 2010, and July 27, 2010. The House passed H.R. 4899 with $5.7 billion in spending for the Disaster Relief Fund. The House passed H.R. 4899 on March 24, 2010 with $5.7 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund in FEMA and $600 million for the Department of Labor's summer jobs program. The Senate passed H.R. 4899 on May 27, 2010 with $59.3 billion for disaster relief, war funding, Haiti relief, Vietnam veterans benefits, and oil spill recovery funding. The House and Senate passed H.R. 4899 with funding for disaster relief, war, Haiti relief, Vietnam veterans benefits, and oil spill recovery. The total spending was $81.8 billion with $65.1 billion in new budget authority. The House and Senate passed H.R. 4899 with funding for disaster relief, war, Haiti relief, Vietnam veterans benefits, and oil spill recovery. The bill was signed into law on July 29, 2010, as P.L. 111-212. The House version totaled $5.7 billion in spending, while the Senate version addressed most of the Administration's requests. The Senate version of H.R. 4899 included funding for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund, war-related activities, Haiti relief, Deepwater Horizon oil spill response, and benefits for Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange. Additional funding was also allocated for other U.S. disaster relief programs. The Senate version of H.R. 4899 added funding for U.S. disaster relief programs and foreign aid, totaling $59.3 billion. This amount was $4.1 billion below the Administration's request, with $300 million in rescissions. The Senate debated H.R. 4899 from May 25-May 27, 2010. The Senate debated H.R. 4899 from May 25-May 27, 2010, focusing on amendments addressing border security, Gulf oil spill response, supplemental spending, national disasters funding, and Afghanistan withdrawal timeline. Majority Leader Senator Reid proposed considering and voting on six amendments with strict time limits, followed by a cloture motion vote. The Senate rejected the six amendments. The Senate rejected six proposed amendments, including additional funding for National Guard personnel to address border security. Senators also proposed measures to respond to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, such as providing relief to small businesses affected by the disaster. Senator Menendez suggested an amendment requiring oil polluters to cover the full cost of cleanup. Senator Menendez proposed an amendment for oil polluters to pay full oil spill costs. Senators McCain and Coburn suggested cutting $59 billion in federal funding to offset additional spending. Senator Inouye questioned the feasibility of proposals to rescind unobligated balances and cap federal salaries. Six rejected amendments included McCain's proposal for $250 million to secure the southern border. The United States offset funds by rescinding unobligated funds in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Amendments by Senators Kyl and Cornyn to appropriate funds for border security were withdrawn after failing to receive enough votes. Guards on the border (S.Amdt. 4202) failed to receive enough votes to waive the budget point of order. Feingold's amendment for a troop redeployment timetable (S.Amdt. 4204) was rejected. Coburn's amendment to cut $59 billion in the supplemental bill over 10 years (S.Amdt. 4231) was tabled. The Senate passed H.R. 4899 by offsetting $59 billion through budget reductions and disposing of unneeded federal property and equipment. Cloture was invoked by a vote of 69 to 20 on May 27, 2010, and 16 amendments were adopted in a Managers' amendment. The bill was passed by a vote of 67 to 28 and sent to the House for further action. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported H.R. 4899, the Disaster Relief and Summer Jobs Act of FY2010 with $58.9 billion in funding. The House passed an amended version on July 1, 2010, adding $22.5 billion for domestic programs and $16.3 billion in rescissions and savings. Members voted on the rule and four separate amendments before passing the entire bill. On July 1, 2010, the House adopted a rule by a vote of 215 to 210, which included passing amendments and enrolling the entire bill with changes to funding levels, court case settlement costs, and program allocations. After adopting the rule on July 1, 2010, the House passed House Amendment No. 2 by 239 to 182, which included additional funding for domestic programs not in the Senate bill. Republican members argued for confining spending to FEMA disaster assistance, war funding, new VA benefits, and court cases settlement, citing high deficits. Democratic members justified the additional domestic spending. Democratic members argued for additional domestic spending to prevent layoffs, provide credit for farmers, energy projects, and students. Debate on war-related amendments focused on Afghanistan policy and troop withdrawal. The House amended the bill on July 1, 2010, to include extra spending. The House amended the bill on July 1, 2010, to include additional spending of $10.0 billion for Education Job Funds, $5.0 billion for Pell Grants, $701 million for border security, $538 million for Program Integrity initiatives, $180 million for energy loans, $159 million for oil spill recovery, $82 million for agricultural loans, and $67 million for other activities. The House July-amended version of the bill included $2.5 billion for non-defense DOD spending, $300 million for base closure transportation improvements, and $16.5 million for a Soldier Readiness Center at Fort Hood. It also had larger offsets from rescissions and savings in mandatory programs compared to the Senate version. The Senate version of the bill included $381 million in savings from mandatory programs, with unobligated authority used to offset new spending. Budget authority must be obligated within a certain timeframe, and unobligated funds expire, reducing the deficit. Some rescissions are controversial, but others are necessary when funds are unlikely to be spent. The House July-amended version of H.R. 4899 included $12.2 billion in rescissions, with funds from DOD, highway contract authority, pandemic flu, American Recovery Act, Education Department, and teacher incentive awards. Some rescissions are controversial, but others are necessary when funds are unlikely to be spent. The House considered a bill with incentive awards triggering a veto threat, unused disaster assistance funding, State Department funding, and funding from other programs. The Administration stated they would veto any version of the bill that undermined the President's abilities as Commander-in-Chief or included rescissions to the Administration's education initiative. Additionally, the House rejected three amendments related to war funding. Three amendments related to war funding in Afghanistan were considered on July 1, 2010. The first aimed to delete all DOD war funding but failed by a vote of 25 to 376. The second sought to restrict war funding to protection and withdrawal efforts, failing by a vote of 100 to 321. The third would have required funds to align with the President's policy for troop withdrawal by July 1, 2011, unless Congress voted otherwise. The President's policy to withdraw troops by July 1, 2011, unless Congress approves otherwise, was part of an amendment that also required a withdrawal plan by April 4, 2011. The amendment failed by a vote of 162 to 260. Additional funding proposals for COPS and Firefighter Assistance grants were removed before floor action."
