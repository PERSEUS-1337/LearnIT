    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nanotechnology in the Schools Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings. The rapidly growing field of nanotechnology is generating breakthroughs that will benefit society by improving design and production. Nanotechnology is expected to have a positive impact on security, economy, and health in the United States. Maintaining world leadership in nanotechnology is crucial to maximize its benefits for individuals in the country. To maintain world leadership in nanotechnology, foreign students on temporary visas earned a significant percentage of science and engineering doctorates in the United States in 2003. Many of these students planned to return to their home countries after completing their studies. To maintain world leadership in nanotechnology, the United States must invest in educating students in secondary schools and higher education to conduct research and develop nanotechnology applications. This includes providing access to scientific tools like scanning electron microscopes and training for teachers and professors. The Act aims to strengthen US schools and higher education institutions by providing grants for tools needed to prepare students for careers in nanotechnology. The Act aims to strengthen US schools and higher education institutions by providing grants for tools needed to prepare students for careers in nanotechnology. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines an \"eligible institution\" as a school offering advanced placement or international baccalaureate science courses, a community college, or a 4-year higher education institution. The Education Act of 1965 defines terms like \"institution of higher education\" and \"qualified nanotechnology equipment\" for teaching nanotechnology in the classroom. Qualified nanotechnology equipment for teaching in the classroom must be manufactured in the United States with at least 50 percent of materials sourced domestically. SEC. 4. PROGRAM AUTHORIZED. The Director of the National Science Foundation will establish a nanotechnology in schools program to enhance eligible institutions' capacity to teach nanotechnology. Grants of up to $150,000 will be awarded for acquiring nanotechnology equipment and software for classroom instruction. The National Science Foundation will establish a nanotechnology in schools program to enhance teaching capacity. Grants up to $150,000 will be awarded for acquiring equipment and software for classroom instruction, faculty development, and teacher education in nanotechnology. The National Science Foundation will establish a nanotechnology in schools program to enhance teaching capacity. Grants up to $150,000 will be awarded for acquiring equipment and software for classroom instruction, faculty development, and teacher education in nanotechnology. Not more than 1/4 of the grant funds can be used for software, educational services, or teacher education and certification. Grants awarded to community colleges or higher education institutions can only be used in undergraduate programs. Applications and selection process will be implemented. To be eligible for a grant under the Act, institutions must submit an application to the Director with required information. The Director will establish a procedure for accepting applications within 180 days of the Act's enactment and publish it in the Federal Register. Eligible institutions will be selected for grants. The Director will select eligible institutions for grants under the Act, prioritizing geographically diverse locations and encouraging historically Black colleges, minority institutions to apply. The Director will select eligible institutions for grants under the Act, prioritizing geographically diverse locations and encouraging historically Black colleges and minority institutions to apply. Eligible institutions must agree to a matching requirement and limitation for grant awards. The institution receiving the grant must provide non-Federal contributions equal to 1/4 of the grant amount, with a waiver available for institutions with low endowment. If a branch or institution receives a grant over $100,000 under this Act, they are not eligible for another grant until 2 years later. If a branch or institution receives a grant over $100,000 under this Act, they are not eligible for another grant until 2 years later. Eligibility for another grant under this Act is restricted until 2 years after the date of receipt of the grant. SEC. 5. ANNUAL REPORT AND EVALUATION. Each institution receiving a grant must submit a report on the use of funds within a year. The Director will review these reports annually and evaluate the program every third year based on the activities and outcomes. The Director will assess the impact of grants on students, faculty, and staff, and submit a report to Congress with recommendations on the need for continued Federal support. Authorization of appropriations for the Director to carry out the Act includes $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2008 and necessary sums for fiscal years 2009 through 2011."
