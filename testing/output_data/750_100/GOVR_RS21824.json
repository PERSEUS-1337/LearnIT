    "content": "During the debates over the 1998 HEA amendments, campus crimes, particularly drug-related incidents, were a major concern. Studies showed a decrease in overall campus crime rates but an increase in drug-related incidents. Congress expressed worry about the rising number of drug and alcohol-related incidents on college campuses. Representative Souder highlighted the epidemic of drug abuse and proposed student eligibility provisions as a crucial first step in addressing the issue. The provision to eliminate student eligibility for financial assistance for those convicted of drug-related crimes was added to P.L. 105-244 by Congress. This legislation specifies that students convicted of drug offenses are not eligible for federal student assistance under Title IV of the HEA, with the period of ineligibility determined by the type and recency of the conviction. A student becomes indefinitely ineligible for federal student assistance if they have more than two convictions for possession or more than one conviction for selling a controlled substance. The period of ineligibility begins on the date of the charge and ends after a specified interval for each offense. The ineligibility period for drug-related offenses varies based on the number of convictions: First offense - one year, Second offense - two years, Third offense - indefinite. Sale of a controlled substance results in a two-year ineligibility for the first offense and indefinite for the second offense. Convictions prior to turning 18 or overturned convictions are not considered for eligibility. A student who is indefinitely ineligible for federal financial assistance must complete a drug rehabilitation program to regain eligibility. The program must meet specific requirements outlined in the regulations. A student who is indefinitely ineligible for federal financial assistance must complete a drug rehabilitation program that is administered by a licensed entity and includes at least two unannounced drug tests. Participation in the program can reduce the ineligibility period based on the number of convictions. Upon completion of a rehabilitation program, a student can self-certify completion for any conviction, not just those resulting in indefinite ineligibility. Future convictions will reinstate ineligibility. Over 180,000 students have been affected by this provision, representing less than .25% of federal financial aid applicants. California and Texas are two states with significant impact. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 amended a provision regarding federal student aid eligibility for students with drug convictions. Only convictions occurring while enrolled in postsecondary education and receiving Title IV aid disqualify students. California and Texas have had a high number of ineligible students due to this provision. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 amended federal student aid eligibility for students with drug convictions. The period of ineligibility depends on the type and recency of the conviction, as well as the number of prior convictions. Legislative proposals are being considered to modify the existing drug conviction provision under Title IV of the HEA. Issues have arisen regarding implementation and penalties for drug convictions. During discussions on reauthorization, policymakers expressed concerns about the increasing drug-related crimes on college campuses and the need to consider penalties for students with drug convictions. Critics argue that singling out drug convictions for loss of financial aid eligibility is unfair compared to other crimes like rape, arson, or armed robbery. Supporters justify this focus on drug-related crimes by pointing out their higher likelihood on college campuses. The loss of financial aid eligibility for students convicted of drug-related crimes may be reconsidered during reauthorization. The existing provision does not differentiate between misdemeanor or felony convictions, leading to a loss of eligibility regardless of jail time served. The separate ineligibility periods for selling versus possession of controlled substances are also a point of consideration. The difference between selling and possession of controlled substances in relation to eligibility for student aid may be debated by Congress."
