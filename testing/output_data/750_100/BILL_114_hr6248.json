    "content": "The \"Spending Safeguard Act\" may be cited as the short title of this legislation. It includes a spending limitation on direct spending programs. The Spending Safeguard Act establishes a spending limitation for direct spending programs, to be determined by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget within 90 days of enactment or reauthorization. The Spending Safeguard Act establishes spending limitations for direct spending programs based on the estimated six-year cost of the program, with different percentages for programs in specific budget functions. The Director determines the six-year cost of the program using scorecards or estimates under the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010. A spending safeguard limitation scorecard is maintained for direct spending programs, displaying their spending levels. The Secretary of the Treasury must report monthly spending for direct spending programs to the Director. The Director then submits a biannual report to the House and Senate Budget Committees on the total spending and its relation to the program's level. The President's budget submissions must include a report on the total level of spending for direct spending programs subject to a spending safeguard limitation. This report should detail the relationship between the spending level and the applicable safeguard limitation. (d) Procedures in Case of Breach.-- If the Director determines a direct spending program will reach the spending safeguard limitation within six months, a report must be transmitted within 15 days. The Director shall report to the Committees on the Budget if a direct spending program reaches the spending safeguard limitation, leading to a halt in fund obligation for the program. The Director must report to the Budget Committees if a direct spending program reaches the spending safeguard limit, resulting in a pause in fund obligation. Federal agencies must inform program participants that the program is subject to a spending safeguard. The Director must report to Budget Committees if a direct spending program reaches the spending safeguard limit, pausing fund obligation. Federal agencies must inform program participants of the spending safeguard limitation that may affect future fund availability for benefits. Definitions in the Act include the Director as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, direct spending as defined in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, and direct spending program as any Federal program funded by direct spending enacted or reauthorized after the Act's enactment date. (g) No additional funds authorized for this Act."
