    "content": "The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) provides federal funding for children with disabilities, mandating a free appropriate public education (FAPE) and due process provisions. It was enacted in 1975 in response to the need to educate children with disabilities, with attorneys' fees provisions added in 1986. The Handicapped Children's Protection Act, P.L. 99-372, added attorneys' fees provisions in 1986 for children with disabilities. Amendments in 1997 (P.L. 105-17) allowed fee reduction if timely information was not provided to the LEA. The 2004 law had different approaches to attorneys' fees, with the House bill (H.R. 1350) proposing changes in fee determination. The 2004 IDEA reauthorization made changes to attorneys' fees provisions, including allowing fees for the state or local educational agency in certain situations. The new law kept general provisions on filing complaints and appeals unchanged. The 2004 IDEA reauthorization made changes to attorneys' fees provisions, allowing fees for the state or local educational agency in certain situations. Parents or LEAs can file complaints regarding various aspects of a child's education, leading to a due process hearing and the right to appeal. Reasonable attorneys' fees may be awarded to the prevailing party, and fees can also be awarded against a parent's attorney to a prevailing SEA. The 2004 IDEA reauthorization allows for attorneys' fees to be awarded against a parent's attorney to a prevailing SEA or LEA in specific situations, such as filing frivolous complaints or litigating without merit. Additionally, fees can be awarded against a parent's attorney if the complaint was made for improper purposes. Senator Grassley and Senator Gregg emphasized the need for the attorneys' fee amendment to prevent abuses of due process rights in IDEA and ensure taxpayer dollars go towards educating children, not lining the pockets of unscrupulous trial lawyers. Senator Gregg highlighted the high standard for prevailing defendants to recover attorneys' fees in cases where a plaintiff's actions are deemed frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation, as established in the Supreme Court case Christiansburg Garment Co. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. This standard aims to protect defendants from baseless litigation and prevent burdensome legal battles without legal or factual basis. The attorneys' fee provision allows defendants to recover fees if lawsuits are brought for an improper purpose, based on an objective standard of reasonableness. Attorneys' fees are determined by prevailing community rates without bonuses or multipliers. Attorneys' fees are subject to specific prohibitions in the community, with no bonuses or multipliers allowed. Fees may not be awarded for services performed after a written settlement offer to a parent under certain circumstances, such as if the offer is made within a specified time frame or not accepted within ten days. Additionally, attorneys' fees are not awarded for IEP team meetings. The 2004 reauthorization added a requirement for a \"resolution session\" prior to a due process hearing, involving parents, IEP team members, and an LEA representative. Attorneys' fees are not allowable for the resolution session, but may be awarded to a prevailing parent after a meeting unless it's due to an administrative proceeding, judicial action, or mediation. Attorneys' fees and related costs may be awarded to a prevailing parent if they were justified in rejecting a settlement offer. Fees may be reduced if the parent unreasonably prolonged the resolution, exceeded prevailing hourly rates, provided excessive legal services, or did not inform the school district appropriately. The attorney representing the parent must provide specific information in the due process complaint, including the child's details, description of the problem, and proposed resolution. Attorneys' fees under P.L. 108-446 may be reduced if the SEA or LEA unreasonably delays resolution or violates the law. The final regulations for P.L. 108-446 were issued on August 14, 2006 by the Department of Education (ED), which declined to provide further guidance on the interpretation of the statutory language. One unresolved issue was whether non-attorney advocates could be awarded fees for assisting parents at a due process hearing. The Department of Education (ED) declined to award fees to non-attorney advocates who assisted parents at a due process hearing, citing the Supreme Court's decision in Arlington Central School District Board of Education v. Murphy. The Court ruled that explicit language authorizing recovery of experts' fees by prevailing parents must be included in legislation, which was not done in the 2004 reauthorization of IDEA. As a result, non-attorney advocates are not entitled to compensation as if they were attorneys. The Department of Education declined to add a regulatory provision for fees of non-attorney experts."
