    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Police Gun Buyback Assistance Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings. Congress finds that a white supremacist used a decommissioned Glock pistol from a law enforcement agency in Washington to shoot children at a Jewish community center in Los Angeles. Additionally, twelve firearms stolen from the Miami-Dade Police Department have been linked to crimes in Chicago, including a shooting near a playground. Over the past 9 years, decommissioned firearms from law enforcement agencies have been involved in multiple incidents. Law enforcement agencies have been involved in over 3,000 crimes, including 293 homicides, 301 assaults, and 279 drug-related crimes. Many departments also resell firearms used in crimes, including assault weapons circulated before the 1994 restrictions. Notable cases include departments in New York, Georgia, Chicago, and other localities. The purpose of this Act is to reduce the number of firearms on the streets by assisting State and local law enforcement agencies in eliminating the practice of transferring decommissioned firearms to any person. The Act aims to reduce firearms on the streets by preventing the transfer of decommissioned firearms to individuals. The Attorney General may provide grants to States or local governments to purchase new firearms and destroy decommissioned firearms, as long as they have a policy against transferring decommissioned firearms to individuals.
