    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Military Readiness and Southern Sea Otter Conservation Act\" and pertains to the Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness and Conservation. The Congress acknowledges the development and administration of a relocation and management plan for southern sea otters by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service since August 1987. National defense activities at San Nicolas Island have not negatively impacted the otters. The expansion of the southern sea otter population into the designated management zone may have national security impacts due to evolving military training programs. Military installations in California have Sikes Act Compliant Integrated Natural Resources Management Plans to address special management needs. Public Law 99-625 allows for the designation of San Nicolas Island otters as a nonessential experimental population, ensuring flexibility for military readiness requirements. The purpose of this section is to enhance conservation of the southern sea otter while allowing for military readiness activities. Chapter 136 of title 10, United States Code, is amended to establish the Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas. The Secretary of Defense shall establish Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas for national defense purposes, including Naval Base Ventura County San Nicolas Island and Begg Rock, and surrounding waters within specific coordinates. The Secretary of Defense has established Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas for national defense purposes, including Naval Base Ventura County San Nicolas Island and Begg Rock, as well as areas around Naval Base Coronado San Clemente Island and Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton. The coordinates for the Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas are provided, and incidental takings of southern sea otters are exempt from the Endangered Species Act within these areas. The Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas exempt incidental takings of southern sea otters from the Marine Mammal Protection Act during military readiness activities. For military readiness activities in the Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas, southern sea otters are treated as a species proposed for listing under the Endangered Species Act. No requirement exists to remove otters from these areas under this section or any other federal law. The Secretary of the Interior may revise or terminate exceptions if military activities impede sea otter conservation. The Secretary of the Navy is responsible for monitoring the Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas. The Secretary of the Navy monitors the Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas every three years to track the otter population growth or decline. Reports are submitted to Congress and the public on the monitoring efforts. This section does not override any other federal laws, except for specific provisions. Ecosystem management is also addressed. The Director of the US Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service, with the Marine Mammal Commission, will develop an ecosystem management plan for California waters to ensure the recovery of the southern sea otter, black abalone, and white abalone. The Director of the US Fish and Wildlife Service will assess the carrying capacity of the habitat for southern sea otters and evaluate the impacts of water quality on that capacity. The Director of the US Fish and Wildlife Service will continue implementing the relocation and management plan for southern sea otters until the completion of the required management plan and assessment. Definitions for incidental taking and optimum sustainable population are provided in this section. The term 'optimum sustainable population' refers to the maximum number of animals that will ensure the productivity of a population while considering habitat capacity and ecosystem health. 'Southern sea otter' is defined as a member of the Enhydra lutris nereis subspecies. 'Take' is defined in relation to activities subject to regulations. The term 'military readiness activity' is defined in the Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act, and 'take' is defined in relation to activities regulated by the Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act. The Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act defines 'military readiness activity' as all training and operations related to combat, including testing of military equipment for combat use. Establishment of the Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas."
