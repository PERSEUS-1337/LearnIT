    "content": "The Urban Jobs Act of 2011 may be cited as the ``Urban Jobs Act of 2011''. Congress finds that one-third of minority youth are unemployed, the labor force participation rate is lower for individuals without a high school diploma, African-American and Hispanic students have a lower graduation rate, and high school dropouts from the class of 2004 will cost the nation over $325 billion in lost wages, taxes, and productivity. Only 52 percent of students in the 50 largest cities in the United States graduate from high school, below the national average of 70 percent. High school dropouts earn significantly less over their lifetime compared to graduates, with prison populations showing a high percentage of individuals without a high school diploma. Increasing the high school completion rate by 1 percent for men ages 20 to 60 could save the US $1.4 billion annually in reduced crime costs. A 10-percent increase in male high school graduation rate could lead to significant reductions in arrest rates for various crimes. The purpose of this Act is to provide resources to prevent disproportionate youth incarceration. The Act aims to reduce disproportionate youth incarceration, especially among minority youth, by providing job training, education, and support services to prepare them for economic self-sufficiency and advancement.
