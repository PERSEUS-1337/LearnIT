It also includes provisions for a loan program to ensure all qualified applicants are granted loans. Congressional Finding and Declaration of Policy are also outlined in the Act. The \"Small Business Meat Producer and Marketer Protection Act of 1993\" amends the Small Business Act by adding conditions for credit and reasonable rates, including a loan program for qualified applicants. Congressional Finding and Declaration of Policy state the need for a competitive environment in industries related to livestock and meat food products. The Act aims to regulate commerce related to livestock and meat food products to prevent unfair competition, obstruction of commerce, and interference with marketing. Congress seeks to eliminate these conditions without significantly impacting production or distribution. The Act defines key terms such as \"Commerce,\" \"Livestock,\" \"Meat food products,\" and \"Meatpacker\" for the regulation of trade and transportation among states and the slaughtering industry. The curr_chunk defines terms related to the manufacturing and sale of meats, including \"meat marketer\" and \"person.\" It also specifies that a \"meatpacker or meat marketer engaged in commerce\" refers to those involved in buying, selling, or dealing with meats. A meatpacker or meat marketer engaged in commerce is defined as someone involved in the production, processing, manufacturing, or distribution of meat food products with annual sales of at least $250,000. It is unlawful for any meatpacker engaged in such activities. It is unlawful for a meatpacker engaged in commerce to slaughter more than a specified number of cattle, swine, or sheep in a week if they were owned for over twenty days by the meatpacker or related entities owning more than 5% of the stock. It is prohibited for a person owning or controlling more than 5% of stock to own livestock directly or indirectly. Meatpackers are also prohibited from buying or selling more than a specified number of cattle, swine, or sheep in a week if they were owned prior to the transaction. The prohibition applies to livestock owned by meatpackers or meat marketers, or persons owning or controlling more than 5% of voting power or control. Livestock cannot be owned directly or indirectly through contracts, purchase orders, or other arrangements. It is unlawful for meatpackers or meat marketers to contract for the forward delivery of livestock if the contract allows them to choose the delivery date, unless it is within a 20-day period on a designated contract market. Any person violating section 4 of this Act will be fined up to $50,000 or more per head of livestock exceeding the permitted number. Corporate violations will also be attributed to individual directors, officers, or agents involved in the violation. Sec. 6 states that this Act will be considered an antitrust law for the purposes of existing laws. Sec. 7 addresses the invalidity of any provision of the Act or its application to any person or circumstance. If any provision of this Act is deemed invalid, it will not affect the validity of the rest of the Act or its application to other persons or circumstances."
