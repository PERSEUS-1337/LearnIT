    "content": "The Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) administers retirement, survivors, disability, unemployment, and sickness benefits for railroad workers and their families. The RRB system is separate from Social Security but closely coordinated. Lifelong railroad workers receive RRB annuities instead of Social Security benefits; those with non-railroad employment receive benefits from either RRB or Social Security, depending on their railroad service length. To be insured for an RRB annuity, a worker must generally have at least 10 years of covered railroad work, or five years performed after 1995. The family of an insured railroad worker receives RRB annuities equal to or greater than the Social Security benefits they would have received if the worker's railroad work had been covered by Social Security. If a worker does not qualify for an RRB annuity, his or her railroad work counts toward Social Security benefits. RRB annuities have two components: tier I and tier II, with tier I amounts equivalent to Social Security benefits. Tier II retirement amounts are paid in addition to tier I amounts and any private pension and retirement savings plans offered by railroad employers. They are similar to private pensions and are based solely on covered railroad service. Tier II amounts are increased annually by 32.5% of the Social Security COLA. RRB survivor annuities for widows and widowers of railroad workers may be higher than Social Security benefits due to tier II amounts. Surviving spouses can receive up to 100% of the worker's RRB annuity at full retirement age. Widows and widowers can receive a reduced annuity as early as age 60 (or age 50 if disabled) and may care for a deceased worker's child at any age. The Railroad Retirement and Survivors' Improvement Act of 2001 increased annuities for widows and widowers of qualifying railroad employees. It allows a widow(er) caring for a deceased worker's child under age 16 to receive up to 75% of the worker's tier I amount plus 100% of the worker's tier II amount. Other provisions in the 2001 law include investing railroad retirement funds in non-governmental assets and removing the early retirement reduction for employees with 30 years of service. The Railroad Retirement and Survivors' Improvement Act of 2001 increased annuities for widows and widowers of qualifying railroad employees by removing early retirement reduction, reducing vesting years for tier II annuities, repealing maximum limitation on annuities, and phasing in changes to tier II tax structure. The changes apply to widow(er)s receiving annuities starting in February 2002 or later, and some who began before if they would have received a higher benefit under the 2001 law. The 2001 law increased initial annuities for qualifying widow(er)s by adding a new guaranty amount, initially set at 50% of the employee's tier II amount. This raised the total initial minimum amount to 100% of the tier I and tier II amounts the employee would have received. The 2001 law increased initial annuities for qualifying widow(er)s by adding a new guaranty amount, initially set at 50% of the employee's tier II amount, raising the total initial minimum amount to 100% of the tier I and tier II amounts the employee would have received. The widow(er)'s regular annuity components change over time, with tier I and regular tier II amounts increasing annually based on Social Security COLA adjustments. The 2001 law increased initial annuities for qualifying widow(er)s by adding a new guaranty amount, initially set at 50% of the employee's tier II amount. The widow(er)'s annuity will stay the same in nominal terms but decline in real terms due to inflation. Once the guaranty amount is reduced to zero, the widow(er) will see an increase in their total monthly annuity for the first time. The 2001 law increased initial annuities for qualifying widow(er)s by adding a new guaranty amount. In 2005, the average aged widow(er) annuity awarded was $1,416 per month. Widow(er) annuities are calculated under current law and prior law, with an example provided for a widow reaching full retirement age. The widow's initial annuity under prior law would have been $1,150, while under current law, it would be $1,300 per month. Her total annuity amount is $150 more than under prior law due to the addition of a guaranty amount. COLAs will not increase her total annuity until her tier I and regular annuity amounts. The widow's total annuity will not increase due to COLAs until her tier I and regular tier II amounts exceed her initial minimum amount. Her total annuity of $1,300 would remain the same between 2006 and 2012, but the components would change each year. Tier I amount would increase from $1,000 in 2006 to $1,023 in 2007, and regular tier II amount would increase from $150 in 2006 to $151 in 2007. The widow's guaranty amount would decrease by $24 from $150 to $126 annually. In 2012, the widow's total monthly annuity would begin to increase due to COLAs, as her guaranty amount gradually declines each year to offset the annual COLA. Starting in 2012, her tier I and regular tier II amounts would exceed her initial minimum amount. In 2012, the widow's total monthly annuity would exceed her initial minimum amount, with her annuity amount under current law being $1,323, higher than the previous year. The differences between current and prior law are presented in Figure 1, showing that her annuity amount remains the same under both laws. Under prior law, her monthly annuity in 2006 would have been $1,150. The widow's total annuity in 2006 is $1,300, consisting of the amount from tier I and tier II ($1,000) and the guaranty amount ($150). The guaranty amount decreases annually after 2006 as tier I and tier II amounts increase."
