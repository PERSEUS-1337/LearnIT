    "content": "The \"Border Security and Responsibility Act 2009\" aims to protect Federal lands along the US-Mexico border from unauthorized immigration, smuggling, and border enforcement activities while ensuring border security operations are carried out. In this Act, definitions are provided for terms such as \"Indian tribe\" as per the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, \"Secretary\" referring to the Secretary of Homeland Security, and \"Secretary Concerned\" depending on the jurisdiction of various government departments. The curr_chunk states that the Secretary of Defense, a military department secretary, or the Secretary of Commerce have jurisdiction over specific lands. The curr_chunk focuses on the Border Protection Strategy outlined in Section 4. The Border Protection Strategy for international land borders of the United States must be developed and submitted to Congress by September 30, 2009, by the Secretaries of various departments in consultation with tribal, State, and local officials. The strategy should include a comparative analysis of border protection levels. The Border Protection Strategy for US international land borders must include a comparative analysis of operational control levels achievable through various security measures such as fencing, barriers, additional agents, and natural barriers. The Border Protection Strategy includes using advanced remote sensing technology like unmanned aerial vehicles for surveillance and response analysis in challenging terrain and adverse conditions. The Border Protection Strategy involves enhancing cooperation with intelligence, security, and law enforcement agencies in Mexico and Canada to address unauthorized border crossings. The Border Protection Strategy includes measures such as enhancing cooperation with Mexico and Canada, land acquisition costs, construction costs, maintenance costs over 25 years, and removal of obstructive non-native vegetation. The Border Protection Strategy includes contractor costs, management and overhead costs, impacts on wildlife and habitat, and costs of mitigating adverse impacts on Federal, tribal, State, local, and private lands along the border. The impacts of the Border Protection Strategy include costs, effects on wildlife and habitats, and the potential replacement or restoration of wildlife migration corridors on various lands and waters. The Border Protection Strategy includes consultation with tribal, State, and local governments, as well as authorities from Mexico and Canada. It also considers impacts on culture, safety, and quality of life for residents near the border. Additionally, it involves compiling fiscal investments in acquiring or managing lands and waters related to the border. The land near the borders of the United States is acquired or managed for conservation purposes in various federal agencies, including the National Park System, National Forest System, Bureau of Land Management, and United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service manages land under various jurisdictions, including the Department of the Interior, Department of Agriculture, Department of Defense, Department of Commerce, tribal lands, State and private lands, and lands within Mexico and Canada. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service manages land under various jurisdictions, including tribal lands, State, private lands, and lands within Mexico and Canada. Recommendations for strategic border security management, cost-benefit analysis, and protection of investments in public lands are provided. Required training for natural resource protection is also included. The curr_chunk discusses providing natural resource protection training for Customs and Border Protection agents and other Federal personnel involved in border security infrastructure and cultural resource training for those overseeing the same. The curr_chunk focuses on training coordination for personnel involved in border security infrastructure, ensuring alignment with agency missions and border security objectives. The curr_chunk emphasizes the importance of achieving security objectives while minimizing the impact on natural and cultural resources from border security activities. SEC. 5. ACTIONS TO GAIN OPERATIONAL CONTROL OF THE INTERNATIONAL LAND BORDERS OF THE UNITED STATES. This section focuses on improving operational control of the border. The Secretary of Homeland Security must gain operational control of the international land borders of the United States, following the border protection strategy. Priority should be given to using remote cameras, sensors, natural barriers, manpower, unmanned aerial vehicles, and other low impact border enforcement techniques. The Secretary of Homeland Security must consult with various entities to minimize the impact on the environment, culture, and safety near proposed border enforcement actions. The proposed subsection (a) outlines limitations and rules of construction, including not creating or negating rights of action, affecting eminent domain laws, or waiving other applicable laws. This section does not impose requirements contrary to subsection (a). The Secretary of Homeland Security is not required to install certain resources along an international border if they are not the most effective means to achieve operational control or if they have negative impacts. The Secretary of Homeland Security is prohibited from constructing fencing, barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, sensors, or other infrastructure along the border if the negative impacts on communities outweigh the benefits. The Secretary of Homeland Security cannot build border infrastructure if it harms communities more than it benefits them. Additionally, no funds can be used for border projects until 90 days after Congress receives the required border protection strategy. SEC. 6. BORDERLANDS MONITORING AND MITIGATION. The Secretary, in consultation with various agencies, will develop a monitoring and mitigation plan to address ecological impacts of border security infrastructure along US international land borders. The plan will include measures to mitigate these impacts. The Secretary will develop a monitoring and mitigation plan to address ecological impacts of border security infrastructure, including preserving wildlife migration corridors, controlling invasive species, and maintaining hydrological functionality. The Secretary will develop a monitoring and mitigation plan to address ecological impacts of border security infrastructure, including preserving wildlife migration corridors, controlling invasive species, maintaining hydrological functionality, incorporating adaptive management, and protecting cultural and historical resources. The plan may be carried out on Federal, State, local, tribal, or private lands. The monitoring and mitigation plan for ecological impacts of border security infrastructure includes activities on State, local, tribal, or private lands near international borders of the United States. Consultation and concurrence with landowners or responsible entities are required for carrying out these activities. The Secretary of Homeland Security may transfer funds for conservation activities on non-Federal lands and mitigation activities on Federal lands. The Secretary of Homeland Security may transfer funds for conservation and mitigation activities on Federal lands managed by federal agencies, if required to implement a mitigation plan and if costs are higher than managing the lands without such activities. Transferred funds are exempt from reprogramming requirements, and the Secretary may accept and use donations. The Secretary of Homeland Security can accept donations to develop and implement a mitigation plan for border security infrastructure. Appropriated funds can also be used for this purpose."
