    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Raw Sewage Overflow Community Right-to-Know Act\" and includes findings related to the issue. Congress finds that there are millions of cases of waterborne diseases in the United States each year due to inadequately treated sewage, leading to various illnesses such as gastroenteritis, hepatitis, and respiratory diseases. Millions of Americans become sick as a result. Between 1.8 to 3.5 million Americans get sick annually from swimming in contaminated waters due to sewer overflows, leading to beach closures valued at $1-2 billion and $28 billion in economic losses from swimming-related illnesses. Many sewer systems lack monitoring and reporting practices for overflows, highlighting the need for better detection and public notification. Better monitoring, reporting, and public notification of sewer overflows are needed to prevent millions of Americans from getting sick annually. Public health authorities are not routinely informed of sewer overflows that pose a threat to public health. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. Section 502 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to define \"sanitary sewer overflow\" as an overflow, spill, release, or diversion of wastewater from a sanitary sewer system, excluding combined sewer overflows and wastewater backups caused by blockages in privately owned building laterals. The term \"sanitary sewer overflow\" is defined as wastewater overflows, releases, or backups into buildings caused by blockages in a sanitary sewer system. SEC. 4. MONITORING, REPORTING, AND PUBLIC NOTIFICATION OF SEWER OVERFLOWS. Section 402 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to require owners of publicly owned treatment works to implement a system to alert them of sanitary sewer overflows within a year of the enactment of the subsection. Publicly owned treatment works must notify the public of sanitary sewer overflows promptly to protect human health. They must also inform public health authorities and other affected entities immediately of any overflow that poses a significant health risk. Publicly owned treatment works must promptly notify authorities of sanitary sewer overflows that endanger human health. Owners or operators must report overflows to the Administrator or State within 24 hours orally or electronically, and provide a written report within 5 days. Publicly owned treatment works must report all sanitary sewer overflows to waters of the United States on its monthly discharge monitoring report to the Administrator or the State. The written report must describe the magnitude, duration, suspected cause, steps taken to reduce and prevent recurrence, and steps taken to mitigate the impact of the overflow. Publicly owned treatment works must report all sanitary sewer overflows to waters of the United States on its monthly discharge monitoring report to the Administrator or the State. The report should include details such as the amount of wastewater released, duration of each overflow, location, responses for cleanup, and actions to prevent future overflows. The State must report annually to the EPA on sanitary sewer overflows that occurred within the State to prevent further overflows at the site. SEC. 5. ELIGIBILITY FOR ASSISTANCE.\n\nAmends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to include requirements for monitoring, reporting, and notifying the public of sanitary sewer overflows.\n\nSEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\nIncreases funding to $2.2 billion for fiscal years 2004 through 2008 for water pollution control."
