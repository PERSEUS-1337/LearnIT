    "content": "The \"Antitrust Improvements Act of 1998\" aims to empower the Attorney General to prevent mergers that could harm competition in the telecommunications industry. It amends the Clayton Act to address restraints of trade in telecommunications. The \"Antitrust Improvements Act of 1998\" defines a large local telephone company as one serving more than 5% of telephone access lines in the US. It prohibits mergers or acquisitions between such companies unless approved by the Attorney General to promote competition in the telecommunications industry. The Antitrust Improvements Act of 1998 prohibits mergers or acquisitions between large local telephone companies unless approved by the Attorney General to promote competition. The FCC must ensure that companies involved in the merger have implemented the requirements of the Communications Act of 1934. The Attorney General must report to the Senate and House Judiciary Committees within 10 days of making a finding on a merger or acquisition's impact on competition in the telecommunications industry. Each large local telephone company or affiliate proposing a merger must go through an application process. When an affiliate of a large local telephone company seeks to merge or acquire another company, they must submit an application to the Attorney General and the Federal Communications Commission simultaneously. The decision on the application must be made within the timeframe specified for merger reviews. The jurisdiction of the United States courts is applicable in such cases. The district courts of the United States have jurisdiction to prevent mergers or acquisitions that are inconsistent with specific findings. The Attorney General can take legal action in any district court for appropriate relief if a proposed merger violates regulations. If a proposed merger or acquisition fails to meet conditions or if the FCC finds that parties involved do not meet requirements, legal action can be taken to prevent it. SEC. 4 of the Act preserves existing authorities related to antitrust laws and FCC regulations for mergers involving large incumbent local exchange carriers. SEC. 5 specifies the applicability of the Act. SEC. 5 of the Act specifies that it applies to mergers or acquisitions of controlling interests in large local telephone companies after the enactment date."
