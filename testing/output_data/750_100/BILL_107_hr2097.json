    "content": "The \"Child Care Quality Incentive Act of 2001\" may be cited as the short title for this legislation. The findings and purposes of the Act are outlined in Section 2. The \"Child Care Quality Incentive Act of 2001\" highlights the importance of early brain development and quality early care and education for children. Research shows that early learning and nurturing care significantly impact a child's growth and future success in school and life. Approximately 13,000,000 children, including 6,000,000 infants and toddlers, receive child care daily, but only 1 in 7 meet quality standards. Only 1 in 7 child care centers provide care that promotes healthy development, while 1 in 8 centers provide care that threatens safety. Full-day child care can cost $4,000 to $10,000 per year, and Federal assistance is limited, making it difficult for many families to afford child care. For families with a monthly income under $1,200, child care typically consumes 25 percent of their income. Low payment rates for child care providers impact the quality of care children receive, leading to staff cuts and reduced training opportunities. This affects families' ability to find quality child care in their communities. Low payment rates for child care providers result in staff cuts, reduced training opportunities, and limited educational activities. Children in low-quality child care may experience delayed language skills and increased aggression. Higher payment rates lead to better quality child care by enabling providers to hire qualified staff, offer professional training, maintain a safe environment, and provide educational materials. The purpose of this Act is to improve the quality of child care by increasing payment rates and access to educational materials. Incentive grants are provided to improve the quality of child care. Funding for improving the quality of child care is authorized with $500,000,000 appropriated for fiscal year 2002. The text chunk discusses the appropriation of $500,000,000 for fiscal year 2002 and subsequent years for grants under section 658H of the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990. Amendments are made to the use of block grant funds under section 658E(c)(3), specifying the source of funds and excluding section 658H. The Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 is amended to establish a program excluding section 658H. Grants to improve the quality of child care are also introduced after section 658G. \"Grants to improve the quality of child care are introduced under section 658H of the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990.\" The Secretary will use funds to make grants to eligible States for child care services based on market rates surveys conducted within the last 2 years. To be eligible for a grant for child care services, a State must have conducted market rates surveys within the 2 years prior to the application submission and submit the application as required by the Secretary. Each grant application must detail the State's market rates survey methodology and results, outline plans to increase payment rates, and explain how rates will be raised in compliance with regulations. The Secretary may increase payment rates based on market survey results, with the condition that the State shows progress in maintaining higher rates and conducts a survey update every two years. Matching funds are also required. To be eligible for a grant under this section, the State must provide State contributions amounting to at least 25 percent of the costs in cash, excluding Federal funds. The Federal Government is not considered in determining State contributions. Allotted funds must be used by eligible States to increase child care assistance payment rates up to the 100th percentile of the market rate survey. An eligible State that achieves the 100th percentile of the market rate survey can use grant funds for activities enhancing child care services, ensuring funds supplement and do not supplant existing resources. The eligible State must provide information on efforts to increase payment rates and the impact on child care quality and accessibility. The Secretary will submit reports to Congress. The Secretary will submit biennial reports to Congress on the information regarding efforts to increase payment rates and the impact on child care quality and accessibility. The reports will include data from applications as a baseline for determining progress in maintaining increased payment rates. The Block Grant Act of 1990 is amended to allocate funds under section 658B(a) after section 658O. This amendment affects various subsections of the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990.
