    "content": "The \"Swine Producers Market Loss Assistance Act of 1999\" includes sections on short title, table of contents, findings and purposes, definitions, market loss assistance, payment amounts, livestock market reporting, and regulations. The marketing relationships of swine producers with meat packers have changed significantly in recent years, adversely affecting the prices swine producers receive. The concentration of the meat packing industry and the increase in live swine imports have reduced slaughter capacity and impacted swine prices in the United States. During the fourth quarter of 1998, a swine market price crisis in the United States was influenced by a 10% increase in swine available for slaughter, an 8% decrease in packer slaughter capacity compared to the previous year, and a 37% rise in Canadian swine imports. In the fourth quarter of 1998, the United States experienced the lowest live swine prices of the 20th century, with swine producers facing a significant reduction in equity capital investment. Swine producers received only $0.22 of the consumer pork dollar in 1998, marking the first time they received less than 30 percent of the consumer dollar. In 1998, swine producers received less than 30 percent of the consumer dollar spent on pork products, despite a seven percent increase in consumption. The purpose of the Act is to compensate producers for losses incurred due to adverse economic factors in the swine market. The Act aims to compensate swine producers for losses caused by adverse economic factors in the market and the government's failure to pursue foreign trade opportunities and limit imports. The Act aims to compensate swine producers for losses caused by adverse economic factors in the market and the government's failure to pursue foreign trade opportunities and limit imports. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"swine\" refers to porcine animals raised for feeder pigs or slaughter solely in the United States. \"Swine producer\" is defined as a person in the U.S. who produced swine for feeder pigs or slaughter during the crisis period from October 1, 1998, to December 31, 1998. \"Packer\" is given the meaning in the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921. \"Feeder pig\" refers to young swine. The term \"feeder pig\" refers to young swine sold during the crisis period for further feeding for more than one month. \"Swine operation\" means a person or group raising swine as a single unit in the United States. \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture. SEC. 4. MARKET LOSS ASSISTANCE. The Secretary of Agriculture administers a program to provide financial assistance to swine producers for market losses incurred during the crisis period. Eligibility requires maintaining a swine operation and marketing swine for slaughter. Certain swine producers are ineligible for assistance. Certain swine producers are ineligible for assistance under this Act if they are subsidiaries of publicly owned packers, wholly or substantially owned by affiliated companies, or directly or indirectly controlled by a publicly owned packer. The Secretary of Agriculture will limit assistance to eligible swine producers through an application process outlined in the Act and related regulations. The swine producer must provide necessary information to the Secretary for eligibility determination under this Act. SEC. 5. PAYMENT AMOUNTS AND PAYMENT LIMITATIONS. Assistance under this Act will be distributed fairly and equitably to swine producers who have incurred losses. The payment amount per swine will not exceed $25.00 for slaughter-weight swine and $9.00 for feeder pigs marketed during the crisis period. Payments to swine operation producers under this Act will not exceed $9.00 per feeder pig marketed during the crisis period. The calculation for payments involves multiplying the number of eligible swine marketed and slaughtered by $25.00, adding the number of eligible feeder pigs marketed multiplied by $9.00. Payments to swine producers are limited to $50,000 per operation. The calculation involves multiplying the number of eligible swine marketed by $25.00 and the number of eligible feeder pigs marketed by $9.00, then deducting payments received in the program. SEC. 6. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER PAYMENTS. Assistance provided under this Act is in addition to assistance, payments, or loans obtained under other agricultural programs such as the Agricultural Market Transition Act and the noninsured crop assistance program for the 1998 crop year. Payments and assistance for swine producers under the Small Hog Operation Program of the Department of Agriculture were announced on January 8, 1999, using funds from the Act of August 24, 1935. This assistance is in addition to support from other agricultural programs like the Agricultural Market Transition Act and the noninsured crop assistance program for the 1998 crop year. Funds from the Act of August 24, 1935 will be deducted from payments to swine producers under this Act. The Act designates funds as an emergency requirement and authorizes the use of the Commodity Credit Corporation to implement the provisions. Additionally, mandatory livestock market reporting is required. SEC. 8. MANDATORY LIVESTOCK MARKET REPORTING. The Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 is amended to include a new section requiring mandatory livestock market reporting. In this section, livestock is defined as cattle, sheep, and swine, whether alive or dead. Livestock product refers to any product or byproduct made from livestock. A packer is defined as a person involved in buying livestock for slaughter or processing livestock products. The term 'prices, volume, and terms of sale' in the context of livestock products includes various factors such as base price, premium and discount price factors, formula-based pricing systems, and quality characteristics. This applies to individuals involved in slaughtering livestock, manufacturing livestock products for sale, or marketing livestock products in an unmanufactured form. The term 'Secretary' refers to the Secretary of Agriculture. Mandatory reporting is required for packers estimated to be involved in buying, manufacturing, preparing, or marketing more than five percent of livestock products in the United States. The Secretary of Agriculture requires mandatory reporting for packers involved in buying, manufacturing, or marketing livestock products in the United States. Packers must report information on prices, volume, and terms of sale for domestic and imported livestock and products as determined appropriate by the Secretary. The Secretary mandates packers to report domestic and imported livestock separately and provide required information by the next business day. Noncompliance is unlawful, and the Secretary can verify the accuracy of the information. The Secretary can issue a cease and desist order and impose a civil penalty of up to $10,000 for each violation if a packer is believed to be violating reporting regulations. The Secretary can issue a cease and desist order and impose a civil penalty of up to $10,000 for each violation. The penalty amount is determined based on the gravity of the offense, the size of the business, and the impact on the packer's ability to continue operating. If there is no appeal or if the civil penalty is upheld, the case may be referred to the attorney general. The Secretary may refer the matter to the Attorney General to recover unpaid civil penalties in a civil action. The Secretary encourages voluntary reporting by packers not under mandatory reporting. The Secretary must make information available to the public in a timely manner while ensuring the confidentiality of parties involved in transactions and packers submitting reports. The Secretary must ensure the confidentiality of proprietary business information and may collect voluntary reports under other laws. The reporting requirement will expire after three years. Repeal of section 1127(a) of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1999. SEC. 9. REGULATIONS. The Secretary and the Commodity Credit Corporation must issue regulations promptly after the enactment of the Act to implement it. The regulations will address misrepresentations, appeals, and entitlement to benefits without the need for notice and comment provisions. The Secretary must issue regulations promptly to implement the Act, following specific provisions and using the authority provided under section 808(2) of title 5, United States Code."
