    "content": "The Washoe Tribe Land Conveyance is addressed in Section 1. Congress finds that the ancestral homeland of the Washoe Tribe of Nevada and California included approximately 5,000 square miles around Lake Tahoe, recognized as indigenous people of the area in 1997 through meetings convened by governments. The Washoe Tribe's ancestral homeland encompassed Lake Tahoe, with meetings held to protect its natural resources. A multiagency agreement supports the Tribe's traditional land use, including access to the lake for cultural practices. The Act aims to implement local, State, tribal, and governmental cooperation. The Act aims to return the Washoe Tribe to Lake Tahoe and provide opportunities for cultural practices on the shore, including spiritual renewal, land stewardship, horticulture, subsistence gathering, traditional learning, and family bonds. The Secretary of Agriculture will convey land with conditions. The Secretary of Agriculture will convey approximately 24.3 acres of land to the Washoe Tribe in trust for no cost. The land is located within the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit north of Skunk Harbor, Nevada. The conveyance includes a reservation of a nonexclusive easement for public and administrative access over Forest Development Road #15N67 to National Forest System land. The Secretary of Agriculture will provide a reciprocal easement to the Washoe Tribe for vehicular access over Forest Development Road #15N67 to National Forest System land. This access is for administrative and safety purposes, as well as for Tribe members who have difficulty accessing the land on foot due to age, infirmity, or disability. The Tribe and its members must limit the use of the conveyed parcel to traditional and customary uses for the benefit of the Tribe. No permanent residential, recreational, or commercial development is allowed on the parcel, including gaming, timber sales, or mineral extraction. The conveyed parcel must be used for traditional and customary purposes by the Tribe, with restrictions on residential, recreational, and commercial development. Environmental compliance is required, and if violations occur, corrective action must be taken as directed by the Secretary of the Interior. If violations occur, the Secretary of the Interior can take corrective action, leading to termination of trust title to the parcel for the Tribe and reverting title to the Secretary of Agriculture. The Senate passed the bill on August 1, 2002."
