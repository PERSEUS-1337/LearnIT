    "content": "This report provides a comparison of Department of Energy (DOE) funding for renewable energy with other energy technologies over different time periods, including the past 10 years, the 41-year period since DOE was established, and a 71-year funding history. The final amount of FY2017 Energy and Water Development appropriations for DOE energy technologies was established by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 and the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 set funding levels for Department of Energy (DOE) programs. Figure 1 and Table 1 display funding totals for DOE in real terms since 1978. The funding totals for Department of Energy (DOE) programs over the past 10, 41, and 71 years are shown in Table 1. Table 2 converts this data into relative shares of spending for each technology or energy source. Figures 2, 3, and 4 display pie charts showing the relative shares of cumulative DOE spending for each period. During the post-World War II era, the federal government applied research and development (R&D) to energy sources for economic growth, focusing on fossil fuels, nuclear fission, and fusion. The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 established the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) to continue the Manhattan Project's work. The Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) was established in 1946 to oversee nuclear weapon development and civilian nuclear power management. The AEC focused on research for \"atoms for peace\" and in response to the 1973 oil embargo, the Federal Energy Administration and Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) were established in the mid-1970s. The Department of Energy (DOE) was established in 1977, incorporating activities of the FEA and ERDA. All energy R&D programs were brought under its administration, including fossil, nuclear, renewable, and energy efficiency. Total spending on fossil energy technologies from FY1948 to FY1977 was about $17.1 billion in constant FY2016 dollars. The federal government spent $51.6 billion in constant FY2016 dollars on nuclear energy R&D, which also includes renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies. DOE has been the primary source of energy R&D funding since FY1978. DOE has been the primary source of energy R&D funding since FY1978, with funding for energy technologies peaking at $8.6 billion in FY1979 before dropping to $2.0 billion per year in the late 1990s. Funding has gradually increased since then, with a spike to $13 billion in FY2009 due to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. In FY2018, DOE energy R&D funding was nearly $4.5 billion."
