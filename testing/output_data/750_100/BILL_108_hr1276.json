    "content": "The Act is titled the \"American Dream Downpayment Act\" and amends the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act to include a Downpayment Assistance Initiative. The Secretary may grant funds to help low-income families achieve homeownership through downpayment assistance for single-family housing. Eligible families can receive assistance to acquire a principal residence. The term 'eligible family' refers to low-income families who are first-time homebuyers or those that include uniformed employees or teachers from the participating jurisdiction providing downpayment assistance. The downpayment assistance is provided to eligible families with income not exceeding 115 percent of the median income of the area. To be eligible for a grant under this section, a participating jurisdiction must include in its housing affordability strategy an income limitation set at 150 percent of the median income of the area, as determined by the Secretary. The comprehensive housing affordability strategy must include a description of grant use, targeted outreach to residents of public housing for downpayment assistance, and actions to ensure suitability of families receiving assistance. The Secretary allocates assistance for homebuyers based on a formula considering jurisdictions' need and prior commitment. The formula may include minimum allocation amounts and assesses prior year commitments to assistance. The formula for allocating assistance to homebuyers considers amounts committed under various programs and factors determined by the Secretary. Reallocation of funds to other jurisdictions occurs if allocated amounts become available. The reallocation of funds under this section is based on a formula established in subsection (d). If a local jurisdiction in a participating State does not receive allocated amounts, the funds will be reallocated to the State. Grants under this section are not subject to the provisions of this title, except for specific requirements outlined in the section. Grants under this section are subject to specific provisions of title I, sections 215(b), 218, 219, 221, 223, 224, and 226(a) of subtitle A, and subtitle F. References to funds under subtitle A are considered to refer to amounts for assistance under this section. Administrative and planning costs for participating jurisdictions under this section can be covered by funds from subtitle A, with the limitation based on the total available funds. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorization of Appropriations: $200,000,000 for fiscal years 2004 and 2005. Relocation Assistance and Downpayment Assistance provisions added to the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act. The Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 does not apply to downpayment assistance under this title."
