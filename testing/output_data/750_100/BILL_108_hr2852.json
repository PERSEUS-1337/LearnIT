The Congress finds that research has shown the feasibility of using cord blood for clinical applications, including bone marrow reconstitution for certain diseases. Cord blood, containing stem cells, is a valuable source for transplantation and research. It can be collected after childbirth without risk to the donor, preserved for many years, and used in routine or emergency clinical situations. Advantages of cord blood stem cell transplants over bone marrow transplants include reduced risks to the donor, quicker availability of donor cells, and lower transplant complications. In bone marrow transplants, matched siblings are preferred donors, but only 30% of patients have a match. If no sibling match is found, a search for an unrelated donor is initiated to optimize transplant success. Finding a fully matched unrelated donor is crucial for successful bone marrow transplantation, especially for patients of ethnic minorities who often struggle to find fully matched donors. Partially matched transplants result in higher complication rates, including graft versus host disease and mortality. Cord blood stem cell banks can increase genetic diversity in donor supply, potentially improving transplant outcomes. Cord blood stem cell transplants using partially matched units reduce the risk of graft versus host disease compared to conventional bone marrow transplantation. Identifying and delivering an unrelated bone marrow donor typically takes many months to over a year, while an inventory of 150,000 cord blood stem cell units can provide quicker access to matched transplant units for qualified candidates. An inventory of 150,000 cord blood stem cell units, considering ethnic diversity, can provide matches for 90% of transplant seekers quickly. Matched donors from the same ethnic group increase success rates, especially for conditions like Sickle Cell Anemia prevalent in certain ethnicities. Patients with Sickle Cell Anemia are at high risk of severe bacterial blood infections and frequent painful crises. Those with recurrent crises, chest syndrome, or strokes have a high risk of premature death before the age of 20. The median lifespan for Sickle Cell Disease patients is 42 years, but those with severe disease in childhood rarely live past 20 years. Cord blood stem cell transplantation has successfully cured 80% of children with Sickle Cell Anemia. In a recent study, patients with Sickle Cell Anemia or thalassemia were cured through cord blood transplants. The earlier the transplant is done in severe cases, the better the outcomes. Unrelated cord blood transplants are beneficial for African American and other ethnic minority patients due to less stringent matching requirements compared to bone marrow transplants. An ethnically balanced national cord blood bank can increase the chances of finding a suitable donor. Since its establishment in 1987, the National Marrow Donor Program has facilitated 17,000 bone marrow transplants. An ethnically balanced national cord blood bank with at least 150,000 units could greatly benefit African American patients with Sickle Cell Anemia or other conditions requiring bone marrow replacement by providing appropriately matched cord blood stem cells for successful treatment. Cord blood is a source of stem cells used in transplantation, especially beneficial for patients of non-caucasoid ethnicity who struggle to find adequate matches through the National Marrow Donor Program. Radiation exposure can lead to bone marrow failure, and in such cases, cryopreserved cord blood stem cell units can be crucial for treatment. Recent scientific developments suggest that research on cord blood stem cells may lead to a greater understanding of chronic diseases like Parkinson's disease, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer, potentially improving therapies and finding cures for these debilitating conditions. Chronic disabilities are a significant contributor to healthcare costs in the United States. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include a National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include definitions related to cord blood units, donors, and donor banks. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include definitions related to cord blood units, donors, and donor banks. The term 'human cord blood stem cells' refers to stem cells collected from neonatal blood after birth. The 'National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network' is a network of qualified cord blood stem cell banks established by the Secretary. The Secretary will contract with cord blood stem cell banks to establish a National Network containing at least 150,000 units of human cord blood stem cells for the purpose of acquiring, testing, and storing donated units with donor consent. The cord blood stem cell banks must obtain donor consent, comply with regulations, make units available for transplantation, and allocate a portion for research. Eligible banks must have necessary licenses and certifications. The cord blood stem cell bank must have necessary licenses, certifications, registrations, and authorizations required for operation. They must also implement donor screening and collection practices to protect donors and recipients, prevent transmission of infections, and maintain strict confidentiality. The cord blood stem cell bank must ensure confidentiality, protect patient and donor identities, encourage donation from diverse groups, and communicate with other stem cell banks. The cord blood stem cell bank communicates with other banks, transplant centers, and physicians for cord blood unit distribution and tracking clinical outcomes. It also educates the public and patient advocacy organizations. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network educates the public and patient advocacy organizations about the benefits of donating and utilizing cord blood stem cells. The Secretary establishes a Board of Directors to administer the Network, including coordinating donor banks and establishing a national cord blood stem cell registry. The Board of Directors for the National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network is appointed by the Secretary and includes representatives from transplant centers, birthing hospitals, and stem cell organizations. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network's Board of Directors includes representatives from the cord blood stem cell research community, recipients of stem cell transplants, family members of patients, social science experts, the general public, and the Division of Stem Cell. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network's Board of Directors includes representatives from various sectors, including the Division of Stem Cell Transplantation of the Health Resources and Services Administration and network donor banks. Members can serve up to 2 consecutive 3-year terms, except for specific appointments. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network's Board of Directors ensures continuity by staggering the expiration of Board members' terms. The Secretary will establish a national cord blood stem cell registry through the Administrator. The Administrator will establish a National Cord Blood Stem Cell Registry as part of the Network. The Registry will operate a system for identifying, acquiring, and distributing donated cord blood units matched to patients, and provide a website function for searching suitable donor matches. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Registry will maintain a database to document the collection, storage, distribution, and transplantation of cord blood units, as well as the clinical outcomes of all transplantations related to the Network. The database will operate according to standards of consent, disclosure, and confidentiality. The Administrator will report to the Secretary on the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of the Network's activities. The Secretary will make this information public. The Board of Directors will ensure Network standards are met. The Board of Directors oversees the National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network to ensure donor banks meet requirements and that collection sites are distributed across the US. $15,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2004, and $30,000,000 for fiscal year 2005 for this purpose. The Board of Directors authorizes $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2004 and $30,000,000 for fiscal year 2005 to acquire a 150,000 unit inventory for the National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network. Additional funding will be provided for fiscal years 2006 through 2008 as needed."
