    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Brownfield Redevelopment and Economic Development Innovative Financing Act of 2014\". It establishes the Brownfield Redevelopment and Economic Development Innovative Financing Program. The Brownfield Redevelopment and Economic Development Innovative Financing program, established by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, guarantees repayment of loans for brownfield redevelopment and urban renewal projects. Eligibility requirements include applications from local governments and redevelopment agencies. The Program requires local governments, agencies, or projects to submit a master plan meeting specific requirements and a certification from the Environmental Protection Agency for brownfield redevelopment. The Program requires a master plan for brownfield redevelopment and environmental remediation. Loans must be used for brownfield site acquisition and remediation to promote urban renewal. The Program requires a master plan for brownfield redevelopment and environmental remediation, including relocation of existing facilities and site preparation. Loan guarantees are not available if the applying agency caused contamination on the brownfield site. The Program limits the number of guaranteed loans to one per entity and sets the loan principal between $25,000,000 and $150,000,000 based on the project cost. The loan amount under the Program ranges from $25,000,000 to $150,000,000. The interest rate is negotiated between the lender and borrower, with a term of 20 to 30 years. Repayment of principal or interest is not required within 10 years of loan disbursement. The loan under the Program ranges from $25,000,000 to $150,000,000 with a negotiated interest rate and a term of 20 to 30 years. Repayment begins no later than 15 years after the loan is made. A master plan must describe the brownfield redevelopment project funded by the loan guarantee. The brownfield redevelopment project must demonstrate major economic and environmental benefits for the community, including non-Federal funds commitment, job creation, environmental remediation, and overall environmental and economic impact. The brownfield redevelopment project must show economic and environmental benefits for the community, including affordable housing, reduced vehicle congestion and emissions, integration of green technology, improved air quality, and complete streets planning. The selection criteria for receiving loan guarantees under the Program include incorporating complete streets planning and transit-oriented development, demonstrating investment commitments from non-Federal entities, and having an approved remediation action plan by the Environmental Protection Agency. The selection criteria for receiving loan guarantees under the Program include considering information required under subsection (c)(2) and providing favorable consideration to existing BRAC redevelopment projects with Federal grants or commitments. The full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to guarantee payments, which are conclusive evidence of eligibility for obligations. The Federal Government guarantees payments for obligations under the Program, protecting against liability for environmental remediation. The Secretary processes and approves loan guarantee requests under this section. To qualify for a loan guarantee under this section, applicants must show a viable repayment schedule and provide sufficient collateral. The approval process for loan guarantees is similar to that used for section 108 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. Before final approval of any loan guarantee under this section, the Secretary must notify relevant Congressional committees. The applicant may provide collateral in forms other than grants under title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. Definitions for this section include \"BRAC redevelopment project\" as a project to redevelop a site designated as a Base Realignment and Closure Site by the Secretary of Defense, and \"brownfield\" as defined in section 101(39) of the Comprehensive. The term \"local redevelopment agency\" refers to a State government agency that aims to improve blighted areas. A \"remediation action plan\" for a brownfield redevelopment project outlines the site's remediation process and technology used. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development will issue regulations for the Brownfield Redevelopment and Economic Development Innovative Financing program within 6 months of enactment. Authorization of appropriations is also provided. Authorization of $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2015 for loan guarantee costs, available through fiscal year 2019."
