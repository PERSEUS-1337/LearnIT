    "content": "Many observers criticized the United Nations for leaving Timor-Leste prematurely in 2005, leading to political violence in 2006. President Jose Ramos-Horta requested the UN to stay for five more years in 2008 due to ongoing security concerns. In 2008-2009, many displaced civilians returned home after civil disturbances. A failed assassination attempt on President Ramos-Horta and Prime Minister Gusmao in 2008 was orchestrated by a group led by former Major Alfredo Reinado, who was killed in the attempt. The security situation in Timor-Leste has improved since the failed assassination attempt on President Ramos-Horta and Prime Minister Gusmao in 2008. Former Major Alfredo Reinado, leader of a group of fired soldiers, was killed in the attempt. Despite the improved security, concerns remain about the lack of progress in implementing security reforms following the 2006 mutiny by security forces. The joint Indonesian-East Timorese Truth Commission blamed Indonesia for atrocities in 1999, leading to President Yudhoyono expressing regret. President Ramos-Horta urged moving on from the past. Concerns arise over government plans to withdraw funds from Timor's Petroleum Fund in 2009. Timor seeks economic benefit from gas reserves in the Timor Sea amidst political instability. China's involvement in Timor-Leste increased in 2009, providing assistance with construction and offering to sell power plants and patrol boats. East Timor created the National Recovery Strategy Program in 2007, focusing on housing, trust-building, security, social protection, and socio-economic development. The government of East Timor is closing IDP camps with support needed through 2009 for decommissioning. Portuguese colonial control lasted until 1975 when Fretilin declared independence. Indonesia invaded on December 7, 1975, beginning an occupation period. Indonesia invaded East Timor on December 7, 1975, leading to a period of occupation and significant loss of life. A referendum in 1999, supervised by the United Nations, resulted in a majority vote for independence. This decision sparked violence from pro-integrationist militias supported by elements of the Indonesian military. In 1999, violence erupted in East Timor after a referendum for independence. More than 1,300 people were killed, and over 460,000 were displaced. The militias destroyed much of the country's infrastructure. A U.N.-authorized peacekeeping mission, INTERFET, led by Australia, was deployed to restore order. Australia has continued to support East Timor since then. Jose Ramos-Horta, the president of Timor-Leste since 1999, played a key role in U.N. operations and advocating for his country's independence. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1996 for his efforts. Ramos-Horta was appointed president in 2006 after the resignation of Mari Alkatiri and survived an assassination attempt in 2008. Former President Xanana Gusmao of Timor-Leste was seriously wounded in an assassination attempt by Alfredo Reinado in 2008. Gusmao, a former civil servant under Portuguese rule, led the resistance against Indonesian occupation after the death of Nicolau Lobato in 1978. Captured in 1992, he was released in 1999 by President B.J. Habibie. Gusmao became Timor-Leste's first president in 2002 and stepped down in 2007 to run for office again. Former President Xanana Gusmao of Timor-Leste stepped down in 2007 to run for prime minister, forming a coalition with smaller parties. He escaped an assassination attempt by Reinado forces in 2008. Mari Alkatiri, a former prime minister, resigned in 2006 amidst unrest. Alkatiri, a Muslim, has support within the country and went abroad during the Indonesian invasion in 1975. Mari Alkatiri, a Muslim, is part of the minority in Timor-Leste. His relationship with Xanana Gusmao is hostile as Fretilin opposes Gusmao's use of petroleum reserves to fund a budget deficit. The Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste has a unicameral parliament with 65 members, elected in 2007. East Timor gained independence in 2002 under UN administration after Indonesia's withdrawal in 1999. East Timor gained independence in 2002 after Indonesia's withdrawal in 1999. The new constitution established a parliamentary government with a popularly elected President. Xanana Gusmao led a coalition government formed in 2007. The Alliance of the Parliamentary Majority (APM) is a four-party coalition in East Timor, with the main opposition party being Fretilin. The parliament faces challenges with members lacking legislative experience and education, and the use of multiple languages hampering business. Committees try to oversee parliamentary activities. In 2007, parliamentary and presidential elections were held in East Timor. Former prime minister Ramos-Horta was elected president with 69% of the vote. Xanana Gusmao became prime minister after the parliamentary elections, leading the largest coalition of parties. Fretilin party had the most seats but not a majority, causing violent protests. In 2007, East Timor held elections for a constituent assembly and a presidential election. Xanana Gusmao won the presidential election with 86% voter turnout. Events in 2006 led to the reintroduction of foreign peacekeepers from Australia, New Zealand, and Portugal. In 2006, foreign peacekeepers from Australia, New Zealand, Portugal, and Malaysia were reintroduced in East Timor at the invitation of the government. The Australian military contingent was the largest with 1,100 troops. UN Security Council Resolution 1704 established the United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT) with a civilian component, up to 1,608 police personnel, and up to 34 military officers to support stability and democratic governance. The strife in East Timor in 2006 stemmed from divisions within the Fretilin party during their struggle against the Indonesians. This led to splits within the military and police forces, with most military members aligning with Xanana Gusmao. Gusmao's influence contributed to the formation of paramilitary units within the police, hindering efforts for national reconciliation. Gusmao's involvement in creating paramilitary units within the police exacerbated divisions between the military and police in East Timor. Recruitment processes favored Xanana loyalists in the military, while over 300 former Indonesian police officers were hired into the new East Timor police force. The International Crisis Group report highlighted tensions between the president's pluralistic approach and the ruling party's authoritarian tendencies, along with the lack of regulatory framework for security forces. The dismissal of 591 military members by former Prime Minister Alkatiri in March 2006 triggered political turmoil in East Timor due to protests over conditions and discrimination. The military leadership was mainly from the eastern districts, while the political leadership and police were from the western districts. In July 2006, police factions emerged in East Timor, with some officers joining rebels in the hills. The dismissal of protesting troops in March 2006 led to rioting, looting, and the fleeing of thousands from the capital. Former Prime Minister Alkatiri was accused of forming \"hit squads,\" but denied the allegations. Former Interior Minister Lobato was sentenced for his involvement in transferring weapons to civilians. Former Interior Minister Rogerio Lobato was sentenced to seven years imprisonment for authorizing the transfer of weapons to pro-Fretilin supporters and a Fretilin-linked hit squad. Major Alfredo Reinado, a leader of violent protests in March 2006, escaped from prison in August 2006. Australian forces failed to capture Reinado on March 11, 2007. In 2006, Australian forces failed to capture Reinado on March 11, 2007, after he persuaded a border patrol unit to hand over their assault rifles. The East Timor government ordered the operation to apprehend Reinado, who had attracted support among young men resentful of the foreign military presence. Reinado was also resentful of Fretilin for dismissing protesting troops. The escalating violence in East Timor involves gangs of unemployed youth, with high levels of unemployment and underemployment. Gang violence following the 2006 police and military clashes led to deaths, displacement of residents, and property destruction. Dili gangs view Reinado positively, contributing to instability and affecting livelihoods. The violence in East Timor since April 2006 displaced around 178,000 people initially. By February 2007, about 100,000 remained displaced, with 30,000 in camps and 70,000 with host families. Lack of water, poor sanitation, and flood risks were major issues for the displaced population. The United Nations reported that over 40% of the East Timorese population lived below the poverty line, with high child mortality due to lack of sanitation, infectious diseases, and malnutrition. Rice shortages, food price increases, and deteriorating social structures affected healthcare, education, and disaster response. Distribution of essentials and projects focused on internally displaced persons, but significant needs persisted throughout the country. The transition from humanitarian programs to development activities in East Timor remains a challenge due to extreme poverty levels. Funding increased during times of insecurity and displacement, with the U.N. providing emergency assistance and generating a Flash Appeal in 2006. Nearly $40 million was contributed that year. In 2006, funding increased for humanitarian programs in East Timor. Security incidents in early 2007 led to restrictions on humanitarian personnel movement. Concerns arose about the protection of displaced individuals and aid organizations. Local gang-related motivations were suspected behind violent demonstrations. Contingency planning was initiated by the National Disaster Management Office and Ministry of Labour. The international humanitarian aid community, including the U.N., international organizations, NGOs, and donor governments, provide assistance in East Timor. IDPs willing to return received support packages by April 2008, with the government decommissioning some IDP camps. The Ministry of Social Solidarity oversees the returns process with help from international organizations. Limited access to food, water, and basic services remains a problem for returning IDPs in East Timor, despite assistance from international organizations. Increasing food prices, shortages of dietary staples, lack of arable land, and natural disasters have led to a deterioration in food security since 2008. The sustainability of returns is also a concern. Limited access to food, water, and basic services remains a problem for returning IDPs in East Timor, despite assistance from international organizations. The sustainability of returns has been impacted by unsettled land disputes, condition of homes, and fear of violence in home villages, presenting difficulties with reintegration. Walter Kalin, the U.N. Representative on Human Rights for IDPs, emphasized the need to sustain returns and develop durable solutions during his visit in December 2008. In December 2008, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) ended its formal mission in East Timor. A new mission, the U.N. Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT), was established by the U.N. Security Council to assist with security, political, and humanitarian issues, including support for electoral processes. The Secretary General's report emphasized the need for support in the presidential and parliamentary electoral process in East Timor. The International Security Force (ISF) was deployed after violence in April 2006, consisting of troops from Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, and Portugal. The U.N. Security Council extended the mandate of UNMIT until February 26, 2009, and approved temporary police reinforcement for national elections. In 2008, the U.N. Security Council extended the mandate for East Timor until February 26, 2009. The mandate was further extended until February 26, 2010, with Resolution 1867 (2009). Despite some improvements, challenges like reintegration of IDPs, poverty, underdevelopment, and high unemployment persist in a fragile political environment. The Secretary General's report in early January 2007 highlighted the ongoing need for support in the country. The Secretary General highlighted the need for long-term commitment by the international community to achieve stability, development, and democratic governance in East Timor. He outlined three main areas of focus: Political Developments, Restoration and Maintenance of Public Security, and Support for the 'Compact'. These areas include activities such as support for dialogue and reconciliation, promotion of human rights, and socio-economic development. In early January 2009, the Secretary General's report focused on political and security developments, the promotion of human rights, and socio-economic development in East Timor. Key areas of emphasis included increasing dialogue and reconciliation, improving democratic governance, maintaining public security, strengthening security institutions, and capacity building in the justice system. The Secretary General's report in early January 2009 highlighted key areas of emphasis in East Timor, including increasing support for capacity building in the justice system, socio-economic development through various initiatives, and preparation of a medium-term strategy for the country. The U.N. peace operations in East Timor since 1999 have evolved through specific benchmarks. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1246 authorized the United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) to organize a national referendum in August on East Timor's status. After the violent post-referendum rampage, Resolution 1264 authorized the establishment of INTERFET, a non-U.N. multinational force. Indonesia's parliament confirmed the results of the August referendum on October 19, 1999. The United Nations Transitional Authority for East Timor (UNTAET) was established to administer East Timor through its transition to independence, providing humanitarian aid, reconstruction assistance, and assisting in establishing a functioning government. UNTAET's mandate overlapped with INTERFET until military operations were integrated in February 2000. The United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) was established in May 2002 as a successor to UNTAET, with subsequent extensions of its mandate until May 2005. Security Council Resolution 1599 (2005) was adopted on April 28, 2005. The United Nations Office in Timor-Leste (UNOTIL) was established by Security Council Resolution 1599 (2005) on April 28, 2005, with a mandate until May 19, 2006. UNOTIL focused on peace-building activities, supporting state institutions, strengthening democratic governance, human rights observance, and developing the national police force, including the Border Patrol Unit. Special Representative Sukehiro Hasegawa provided an overview of UNOTIL's efforts to the U.N. Security Council on January 23, 2006. The Secretary-General for Timor-Leste summarized UNOTIL's efforts in building skills for state institutions, training national judges, and developing expertise in the finance sector. Progress was also made in democratic governance, human rights observance, and training the Border Patrol Unit. Hasegawa raised concerns about weaknesses in capacity building in justice and finance sectors, emphasizing the need for international advisory support. Human rights activities require continued supervision, especially regarding accountability for crimes in East Timor in 1999. Mr. Hasegawa raised concerns about weaknesses in capacity building in justice and finance sectors, emphasizing the need for international advisory support. He highlighted the importance of accountability for crimes in East Timor in 1999, describing the situation as \"fragile\" and stressing the need to maintain stability and peace for the upcoming elections in 2007. UNOTIL's mandate was extended multiple times due to escalating violence in 2006. The U.N. Security Council extended the mandate for UNOTIL multiple times in 2006 until a new mission was established on August 25, 2006. The United States provided bilateral assistance to East Timor for building a self-sufficient economy, improving public services, and supporting good governance. U.S. assistance in East Timor has supported economic and political development, including independent media, civil society organizations, and political parties. Experts believe sustained support is still needed for the country's democratic system and governance. The Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) under USAID provides non-food humanitarian aid during international crises and disasters, supporting the U.S. government's emergency assistance efforts through grants to implementing partners. In East Timor, the United States utilizes OFDA and FFP for humanitarian aid efforts, funding implementing partners for tasks such as coordination, shelter, water, sanitation, peacebuilding, and psychosocial services. OFDA provided $1.2 million and FFP contributed over $1.1 million in FY2008. In FY2008, USAID provided just over $3.1 million in humanitarian assistance to East Timor, with contributions from OFDA, FFP, and CMM. The U.N. role in East Timor was questioned in 2005, and events in 2006 highlighted the need for improved security services. The need to improve security services and judiciary in East Timor is crucial to ensure institutional transparency and the rule of law. The U.N.'s presence terms must be reviewed to prevent destabilization upon their departure. U.S. relations with East Timor are linked to Indonesia, with Congress expressing concerns about past human rights abuses by the Indonesian military. The East Timorese government is looking to move past its history of human rights abuses and establish a productive relationship with Indonesia. The United States is considering its policies towards both countries, with a focus on human rights concerns. Legislation has been proposed to include Timor-Leste in tariff relief assistance for developing economies. The proposed legislation aims to provide preferential tariff treatment for designated states to promote economic growth. Timor-Leste seeks to strengthen relations with various countries, including Australia, New Zealand, Portugal, Indonesia, and China, and aspires to join ASEAN. Australia and New Zealand have supported peace and security efforts in the region. Australia and New Zealand have been active in supporting peace and security in Timor-Leste since 1999, providing peacekeeping troops as part of the International Stabilization Force (ISF). Australia has 650 soldiers and New Zealand has 150 troops in the ISF, with Australian police also working alongside officers from 20 other countries in Dili. The ISF supports the police as needed, reflecting Australia's strategic interest in Timor. Australia has been actively involved in Timor for many years, including fighting Japanese forces in World War II and blockading Timor in 1975. They have economic interests in hydrocarbon resources between the two countries and recognized Indonesian control of the province in 1989. This was part of the Timor Gap Treaty, which focused on joint development of resources in the maritime area. The Timor Gap Treaty, signed in 1989, was replaced by the Timor Sea Treaty in 2003 between Australia and Timor-Leste. Despite disagreements on sovereignty, they cooperate on developing hydrocarbon resources. Timor-Leste prefers a processing facility in Timor, while Australia supports one in Darwin due to commercial and political factors. The political security situation in Timor favors the use of facilities in Darwin for commercial reasons. Key participants in the greater Sunrise project include Woodside, ConocoPhillips, Shell, and Osaka Gas. Timor-Leste has a historical relationship with Portugal, with Portuguese colonial influence until 1975. The nation is predominantly Catholic and Portuguese is one of the official languages spoken by 13% of the population. Portugal remains a key partner for Timor. Portugal is a key provider of foreign assistance to Timor-Leste, offering Portuguese language teachers and a cultural center in Dili. Indonesia invaded Timor-Leste after Portuguese departure in 1975, leading to a guerilla movement and significant loss of life. Indonesian military-backed militias further devastated Timor's infrastructure and killed additional Timorese after a 1999 referendum for independence. Following the 1999 referendum for independence in Timor-Leste, elements within the Indonesian military committed atrocities to send a message to other provinces with secessionist movements. The Indonesian government has since sought positive relations with Timor-Leste, with President Ramos-Horta urging acceptance and moving forward without trials for those responsible. A truth commission found that the Indonesian army supported pro-Indonesian Timorese. In 1999, the Indonesian army armed and funded pro-Indonesian Timorese militias responsible for atrocities in Timor-Leste. Former General Wiranto ran for vice president in 2009 elections. China has increased investment in Timor-Leste since 2005 to balance U.S. influence and gain access to hydrocarbons. China's increasing influence in Timor-Leste, including high-profile projects and arms sales, raises concerns for Australian strategic planners due to Timor's potential ASEAN membership and hydrocarbon resources. China is providing patrol vessels and defense equipment to Timor for $30 million. Timor-Leste's Foreign Minister supports a One-China policy and China's support for Timor's ASEAN membership. Plans to buy oil burning power stations from China for $381 million faced criticism for being unnecessary and polluting. Fretilin opposes the proposal and is preparing a legal challenge. East Timor, a member of the ASEAN Regional Forum since July 2005, is interested in full ASEAN membership. The country's offshore energy resources could provide financial resources for development. Disputes with Australia over maritime boundaries have been partially resolved through revenue sharing agreements. In January 2006, Australia and East Timor signed a treaty increasing East Timor's share of hydrocarbon revenues to 50% for the Greater Sunrise field. East Timor earned $360 million in hydrocarbon revenues in 2005-2006. They also have a 90%-10% revenue sharing agreement for the Bayu-Udan field, containing 400 million barrels of oil and 3.4 trillion cubic feet of gas. Greater Sunrise is estimated to have 300 million barrels of oil and 2.53 trillion cubic meters of gas. The completion of processing centers in Darwin, Australia has facilitated the extraction of millions of barrels of light oil and trillions of cubic meters of natural gas. Industry favors Darwin over East Timor for pipeline configuration, lack of infrastructure, and potential instability. ConocoPhillips has built a new LNG plant near Darwin, while Timor-Leste prefers a plant on its southern coast. The Bayu-Udan field is expected to be depleted by 2023. East Timor earned $3.2 million in hydrocarbon revenues in 2005-2006. East Timor has banked between $3.2 billion and $5 billion in energy revenues since 2005, with most placed in a Petroleum Fund. The government was criticized for spending money from the fund, intended to save oil and gas revenues for future generations. Timor's top export destinations are Australia, Germany, Portugal, and Brazil. It is the poorest country in Asia with a dual economy serving the international donor community. East Timor has a dual economy, with one part focused on servicing the international donor community and the other 90% agriculturally based. The violence in 1999 left the country's infrastructure devastated, leading to widespread poverty and lack of basic amenities like electricity and clean water. The mountainous terrain is difficult and infertile, requiring sustained efforts for job creation, infrastructure reconstruction, and improved health and literacy rates. Language barriers exist, with Indonesian being more widely used than the official Tetun or Portuguese. Significant economic development is needed in East Timor to improve the standard of living. External assistance remains crucial post-independence, especially for governance capacity building. Revenue from oil and gas in the Timor Gap has increased. Other economic activities include coffee, tourism, and fisheries. The UNDAF 2003-2005 provides a roadmap for U.N. agencies. Economic challenges include strengthening democratic institutions, civil society, and education. East Timor is focused on strengthening democratic institutions, civil society, and education, as well as rebuilding infrastructure. In 2000, an international commission recommended an international tribunal for crimes after the 1999 independence referendum, but Indonesia conducted its own investigation. The US and allies expressed concerns. The Indonesian process for investigating crimes in East Timor after the 1999 referendum faced criticism from the United States, allies, and U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan. The Serious Crimes Unit (SCU) of UNMISET indicted over 380 individuals, convicted 55, and acquitted three, while Indonesia only imprisoned one person. President Gusmao supported a joint East Timor tribunal. President Gusmao has supported a joint East Timor-Indonesia Commission of Truth and Friendship to address past atrocities in East Timor in 1999. Critics have faulted Gusmao for not holding Indonesia accountable for documented executions, torture, mutilations, and rape. The 2005 report on human rights abuses in East Timor highlighted issues such as police brutality, arbitrary arrests, and poor conditions in displacement camps. If Gusmao becomes prime minister, it is unlikely that there will be a change in policy regarding addressing past atrocities by Indonesians during East Timor's independence. The 2005 report on human rights abuses in East Timor highlighted issues such as police brutality, arbitrary arrests, and poor conditions in displacement camps. Concerns were raised about the government's control over the National Police and Defense Forces, with issues of discipline and accountability. Questions were raised about extending the UN presence in East Timor due to fragility of state institutions and vulnerability despite some achievements. East Timor requested U.N. presence for security and judiciary improvements, institutional transparency, and rule of law. The U.S. suggested reducing reliance on direct U.N. assistance but continuing support in political and economic sectors. East Timor could receive assistance from international organizations and donors for strengthening democratic institutions, infrastructure, economic development, and security services. There is a debate on the timing of the United Nations' departure from fragile states, with questions about the length of their stay and the support needed. Questions arise about the duration of the United Nations presence, required international support, and criteria for measuring aid effectiveness and national capacity building progress amidst donor fatigue and limited budgets. The East Timor situation highlights the complexities in determining the appropriate course of action."
