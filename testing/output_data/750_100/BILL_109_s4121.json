The curr_chunk discusses the treatment of applicable pension plans by eligible employers, where the employer's liability is determined by reference to an eligible spunoff plan. This liability is in lieu of any other liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or the applicable pension plan. The curr_chunk discusses the ongoing funding liability of employers electing spinoff for eligible spunoff plans, exempt from certain amendments until the plan ceases to be eligible. Employers electing spinoff for eligible spunoff plans are liable for ongoing contributions on the same terms as before certain amendments, in lieu of other liabilities.

In applying section 4006(a)(3)(E)(iii) of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 to an eligible spunoff plan, the third segment rate determined under section 303(h)(2)(C)(iii) and section 430(h)(2)(C)(iii) of the Act applies for plan years beginning after December 31, 2007. If an eligible spunoff plan terminates under title IV of ERISA before December 31, 2010, the employer's liability from the termination under section 4062 of ERISA will be determined using specific interest rates. The employer's liability for a terminated pension plan under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 is determined based on specific assumptions and methods. This liability replaces any other obligations to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or the pension plan. If an eligible employer chooses not to spin off the plan, their liability will be determined differently. An eligible employer not electing to spin off a pension plan is liable to the corporation for the plan's unfunded benefit liabilities as of December 31, 2005. The term \"adjusted unfunded benefit liabilities\" refers to the amount of unfunded benefit liabilities with a specific interest assumption. The term \"fractional portion\" refers to a fraction representing employer contributions to a pension plan for specific plan years. The term \"applicable pension plan\" refers to a single employer plan established in Alaska on March 18, 1967, with 2 or more contributing sponsors, at least 2 of which are not under common control. The term \"allocable portion\" relates to eligible employers making an election. An eligible employer, in the context of an applicable pension plan, refers to the portion of liabilities and assets that corresponds to the employer's share of the plan's excess, determined without any eligible employer elections. An eligible employer is defined as an employer that participated in an eligible multiple employer plan on or after January 1, 2000."
