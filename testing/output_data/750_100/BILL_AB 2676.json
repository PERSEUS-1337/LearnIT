The child must receive over half of their support from parents who never married and lived apart during the last six months of the year. The child must also be in the custody of one or both parents for more than half of the year. Amendments to this section apply to taxable years starting in 2002 and 2011. This act enacts a tax levy under the Constitution and takes immediate effect."
