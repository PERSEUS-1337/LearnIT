The \"Genetically Engineered Food Right-to-Know Act\" aims to establish a standard for labeling foods produced using genetic engineering, including fish, to inform consumers about the production process. Congress recognizes the material changes in genetically engineered food, the FDA's labeling requirements for various ingredients, and the right of individuals to know if their food was genetically engineered. The \"Genetically Engineered Food Right-to-Know Act\" aims to establish a standard for labeling foods produced using genetic engineering. Over 60 countries have laws mandating disclosure of genetically engineered food on labels. The Codex Alimentarius allows governments to decide on labeling genetically engineered food. The Codex Alimentarius allows governments to decide on labeling genetically engineered food, which can preserve economic value in exports or sensitive markets. SEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO THE FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG, AND COSMETIC ACT. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to require clear disclosure of genetically engineered ingredients in food, with exceptions for restaurant food, medical food, and certain other foods. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to require clear disclosure of genetically engineered ingredients in food, with exceptions for certain foods produced using genetic engineering techniques. The term 'genetically engineered' refers to a material intended for human consumption that is produced through the intentional use of genetic engineering techniques, such as injection of nucleic acid into cells or organelles, or fusion of cells beyond the taxonomic family. The term 'genetically engineered ingredient' refers to a material derived from an organism that has been genetically engineered, regardless of detectable molecular or cellular changes, and regardless of the organism's suitability for human use. The term 'genetically engineered ingredient' refers to a material derived from an organism that has been genetically engineered and is suitable for human consumption. Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act include provisions regarding misbranded food and penalties for violations. The section 403(z) requires a recipient to provide a guaranty or undertaking signed by a person in the US stating that the food received is not genetically engineered. The exclusion from penalties applies to a recipient who provides a guaranty that the food is not genetically engineered, regardless of how the food is used, such as processing, repacking, or producing it. No person can avoid responsibility for misbranded food by transferring liability to another person through a contract, except for requiring a guaranty. The terms 'genetically engineered' and 'genetically engineered ingredient' are defined in this subsection. The terms 'genetically engineered' and 'genetically engineered ingredient' are defined in this subsection. Section 301 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include penalties for violations involving misbranded food. Section 301 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act includes penalties for violations involving misbranded food, specifically related to contamination with genetically engineered material. The Secretary must establish labeling regulations for compliance with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act within one year of the Act's enactment. The regulations aim to address contamination issues not intended by agricultural producers, except in cases of producer negligence."
