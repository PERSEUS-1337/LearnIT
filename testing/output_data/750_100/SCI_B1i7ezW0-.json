    "content": "A new semi-supervised learning framework is developed using an inversion scheme for deep neural networks, applicable to various systems and problems. The approach achieves state-of-the-art results on MNIST and shows promising performance on SVHN and CIFAR10. It introduces the use of residual networks in semi-supervised tasks for the first time, demonstrating its effectiveness across different signal types. This method is simple, efficient, and does not require changes to the network architecture, addressing the challenge of acquiring large labeled datasets for training deep neural networks. Semi-supervised learning leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to train deep neural networks, reducing the need for large labeled datasets. Current methods for semi-supervised learning in DNNs have limitations such as training instability. In this paper, a new semi-supervised learning approach is introduced for deep neural networks. It includes an universal methodology to add an inverse to any DNN for input reconstruction and a loss function with an additional term based on this inverse for weight updates. This allows for incorporating information from unlabeled data into the learning process efficiently. The defined and general inverse function can be easily derived and computed for unlabeled data points to minimize error between input signal and estimate without extra cost. This approach promises to advance semi-supervised and unsupervised learning significantly. The semi-supervised approach with ladder network employs per-layer denoising reconstruction loss, turning a deep unsupervised model into a semi-supervised model. However, it lacks a clear path to generalize to other network topologies and the per-layer reconstruction loss may be too restrictive. The probabilistic formulation of deep convolutional nets in BID14 supports semi-supervised learning, but requires ReLU activation functions and a deep convolutional network topology. Temporal Ensembling in BID8 aims to ensure stability in representations despite dropout noise.

Distributional Smoothing with Virtual Adversarial Training BID12 proposes a regularization term for DNN mapping regularity in a semi-supervised setting.

It also presents a new optimization framework for semisupervised learning. The paper introduces a method for inverting piecewise differentiable mappings, like DNNs, without altering their structure. It also proposes a new optimization framework for semisupervised learning, which includes penalty terms leveraging input reconstruction formulas. Experimental results show significant improvements over existing methods for various DNN topologies. Additionally, the work of BID1 is reviewed, focusing on interpreting DNNs as linear splines and providing a mathematical justification for deep learning reconstruction. The paper introduces a method for inverting piecewise differentiable mappings, like DNNs, without altering their structure. It enables deriving an explicit input-output mapping formula for DNNs, represented as a linear spline. The total number of layers in a DNN is denoted as L, with the output of the last layer before softmax application represented as z(L)(x). After softmax application, the output is denoted as \u0177(x). The output \u0177(x) is obtained after applying the linear mappings in a Resnet DNN, with bias terms accumulated from per-layer biases. The presence of an extra term in \u03c3 C ( ) provides stability and a direct linear connection between input x and inner representations z ( ) (x), reducing information loss sensitivity to nonlinearities. The Resnet DNN utilizes linear mappings to obtain the output \u0177(x), with stability provided by an extra term in \u03c3 C ( ). This reduces information loss sensitivity to nonlinearities in inner representations z ( ) (x). The optimal templates for prediction in DNNs are proportional to the input, positively for the belonging class and negatively for others, minimizing cross-entropy with softmax nonlinearity. This result is specific to this setting, with optimal templates becoming null for incorrect classes in spherical softmax. Theorem 1 states that when all inputs have a norm of 1, reconstruction is implied by the optimal DNN solution. The corollary proposes an inverse of a DNN for reconstruction, leveraging the closest input hyperplane. This method provides a reconstruction based on the DNN representation. The method provides a reconstruction based on the DNN representation of the input, distinct from exact input reconstruction. Bias correction has meaningful implications compared to known frameworks. With ReLU nonlinearities, the scheme resembles soft-thresholding denoising. The next section details efficient network inversion and semi-supervised applications. The inverse strategy is applied to arbitrary DNN tasks. The method involves reconstructing input based on DNN representation, different from exact input reconstruction. Changes for semi-supervised learning are made in the objective training function by adding extra terms. Automatic differentiation is used for efficiency, allowing for easy adaptation of updates via gradient changes. Deep networks can be rewritten as linear mappings, simplifying the derivation of a network inverse for unsupervised learning. The derivation of a network inverse, denoted as f \u22121, is used to derive unsupervised and semi-supervised loss functions efficiently. This involves computing a matrix on deep networks through differentiation. The reconstruction error is defined as the inverse transform in neural networks and common frameworks like wavelet thresholding and PCA. Incorporating this loss improves the training function for semi-supervised learning. The reconstruction loss R is defined as the mean squared error or any other differentiable reconstruction loss like cosine similarity. A \"specialization\" loss, the Shannon entropy of class belonging probability prediction, is introduced for semi-supervised learning to force clustering of unlabeled examples towards learned clusters. Experiments show the benefits of this approach. The complete loss function combines standard cross entropy loss for labeled data, reconstruction loss, and entropy loss with parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 controlling the ratio between supervised and unsupervised losses. Proper weighting of these losses guides learning towards a better optimum, as demonstrated in experiments. Results of our approach on a semi-supervised task on the MNIST dataset show reasonable performances with different topologies. MNIST consists of 70000 grayscale images split into a training set of 60000 images and a test set of 10000 images. The case with N L = 50, representing the number of labeled samples from the training set, was explored. A search was conducted over (\u03b1, \u03b2) values to optimize the loss function for better learning outcomes. The study conducted a search over (\u03b1, \u03b2) values to optimize the loss function for better learning outcomes using different topologies and pooling methods. The Resnet topologies, especially wide Resnet, showed the best performance, outperforming previous state-of-the-art results on the MNIST dataset. The proposed semi-supervised scheme yielded promising results, as shown in Tab. 2, using Theano and Lasagne libraries. The study optimized the loss function for better learning outcomes using different topologies and pooling methods. Results on MNIST, CIFAR10, and SVHN datasets are presented in Tabs 2, 3, and 4 respectively, showcasing the impact of changing loss and labeled data amounts.

Results on MNIST, CIFAR10, and SVHN datasets were presented, showcasing the impact of changing loss and labeled data amounts. The cases correspond to the absence of entropy loss when \u03b2 = 1. Results with leaky-ReLU nonlinearity and sigmoid activation function were provided, along with an example of the approach on a supervised task on the Bird10 dataset for classifying 10 bird species from their songs recorded in a tropical forest.

Results showed the impact of changing loss and labeled data amounts. Networks based on raw audio using CNNs were trained, varying (\u03b1, \u03b2) over 10 runs to demonstrate non-regularized supervised models are not optimal. Regularized networks learned more slowly but always generalized better. The study demonstrated that regularized networks learn more slowly but generalize better than non-regularized models.

The reconstruction loss can be developed into a per-layer loss, allowing for weighted penalties and meaningful reconstructions. Weighting can be adjusted to prioritize high reconstruction for inner layers close to the final latent representation, reducing costs for layers closer to the input. Updates to the weighting can be made during learning. One approach to updating loss weighting coefficients during learning is to optimize them after each batch or epoch using backpropagation. This involves defining an iterative update based on a given policy, such as gradient descent.

This involves defining an iterative update based on a given policy, such as gradient descent. An alternative strategy is to use adversarial training to update hyper-parameters, where updates cooperate to accelerate learning. EBGAN and BID18 are GANs where the discriminant network measures the energy of input data, with high energy for generated data and low energy for real data. Authors suggest using an auto-encoder to compute this energy function, but a proposed method aims to reconstruct input data and compute energy directly. The proposed method allows for reconstructing X and computing energy, requiring only half the parameters for D. It enables unsupervised tasks like clustering by setting \u03b1 = 0. The framework differs from a deep-autoencoder as it focuses on final output in the reconstruction loss, not greedy per layer reconstruction. The proposed method focuses on the final output in the reconstruction loss, unlike a deep autoencoder. It involves parameter and activation sharing, with backward activation states induced by backward projection. The reconstruction of a test sample by different nets is shown, with thanks to supporting organizations. The network successfully reconstructs the test sample using different methods like mean-pooling and max-pooling."
