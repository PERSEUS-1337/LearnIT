    "content": "Foreign assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean is used by the United States to advance its interests, with aid programs tailored to the diverse needs of countries in the region. Some countries still face challenges and receive a full range of assistance, while others have progressed and receive support for new security issues like citizen security and organized crime. Foreign aid plays a crucial role in advancing U.S. policy in Latin America and the Caribbean, focusing on issues such as citizen security and combating organized crime. Congress oversees and allocates foreign assistance to the region, especially in light of budget constraints following the global financial crisis and U.S. recession. The report provides an overview of U.S. assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean, examining historical and recent aid trends. Congress is scrutinizing foreign assistance for potential spending cuts due to budget constraints. The Budget Control Act of 2011 may lead to downward pressure on aid budgets. The report also details the Obama Administration's FY2013 request for State Department and USAID-related assistance to the region. The United States has been a major contributor of foreign assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean since the 1960s, with a spike in aid following President Kennedy's Alliance for Progress initiative. Congressional consideration of Latin America and Caribbean funding provisions in the FY2013 foreign aid appropriations bills is also highlighted. The United States increased assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean to counter Soviet and Cuban influence after Fidel Castro's rise to power in 1959. Support continued during the leftist Sandinistas' rule in Nicaragua in 1979 and the Contras' efforts to overthrow them in the 1980s. Aid decreased in the mid-1990s with the end of Soviet influence and civil conflicts, but began to rise again with the spread of democracy in the region. U.S. foreign assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean increased in the late 1990s, with higher levels of humanitarian and development aid. Aid was provided after Hurricane Mitch in 1998, and new sources of assistance were established with programs like PEPFAR and MCC. The Obama Administration also played a role in providing aid to the region. The Obama Administration emphasized economic growth in Latin America and the Caribbean, increasing aid levels for development efforts. Significant assistance was provided to Haiti after the 2010 earthquake. However, most of the aid through 2010 focused on counternarcotics and security programs in the region. The US provided substantial foreign aid to Colombia and its Andean neighbors for \"Plan Colombia\" to combat drug trafficking and internal conflict. President Bush and the Mexican counterpart announced the M\u00e9rida Initiative in FY2008 for counterdrug assistance in Mexico and Central America. In FY2010, the Obama Administration split M\u00e9rida into CARSI for Central America and created a similar program for the Caribbean called Caribbean Basin Security. The US provided foreign aid to Colombia and its neighbors through \"Plan Colombia\" to combat drug trafficking and conflict. In FY2008, President Bush and the Mexican counterpart announced the M\u00e9rida Initiative for counterdrug assistance in Mexico and Central America. The Obama Administration split M\u00e9rida into CARSI for Central America and created a similar program for the Caribbean known as the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI). However, US assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean has been declining since FY2010, with a 10% decrease in aid between FY2008 and FY2012. In FY2008, US aid to Latin America and the Caribbean decreased by 10%. Aid to East Asia, Europe, and Eurasia also declined, while aid to South and Central Asia, the Middle East, and Africa increased. These changes reflect shifts in US foreign policy towards development efforts in Africa and strategic anti-terrorism operations in Afghanistan and Pakistan. U.S. foreign assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean decreased from 10% in FY2008 to under 8% in FY2012 due to shifts in U.S. foreign policy towards development efforts in Africa and strategic anti-terrorism operations in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Obama Administration focused on development and humanitarian assistance programs in the region to promote economic progress and social stability. The U.S. foreign assistance, including funding from the Global Health Programs (GHP) accounts, aims to promote sustainable economic progress and social stability in developing nations. This funding supports long-term projects in economic reform, democracy promotion, basic education, human health, and environmental protection. Humanitarian assistance focuses on immediate relief for emergencies, such as food aid through the Food for Peace account and support for refugees and internally displaced persons through the Migration and Refugee Assistance account. USAID manages most programs, while the State Department oversees the MRA account. The State Department administers the MRA account and manages a portion of the global health account addressing HIV/AIDS. U.S. assistance to the region is also provided through the Economic Support Fund (ESF) account, which promotes U.S. economic, political, or security interests. ESF-funded programs aim to promote political and economic stability, managed by USAID in conjunction with the State Department. The United States funds security assistance programs in the region through various accounts such as INCLE for counternarcotics and law enforcement efforts, NADR for global threats like terrorism, and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The United States provides support to Latin American and Caribbean militaries through various accounts such as INCLE, NADR, FMF, and IMET. Aid levels to the region have decreased in recent years, leading to a shift towards development and humanitarian assistance over security assistance. In FY2012, U.S. aid to Latin America and the Caribbean focused on development and humanitarian assistance, with over $730 million provided through aid accounts. Additionally, $466 million was allocated through the ESF account to support U.S. strategic interests. In FY2012, the United States provided nearly $700 million in aid to Latin American and Caribbean countries for security efforts, representing 37% of total U.S. bilateral assistance to the region. Haiti, Colombia, and Mexico were top recipients of U.S. foreign aid, with Haiti receiving high levels of aid due to development challenges and humanitarian relief after the 2010 earthquake. Since FY2000, U.S. aid to Colombia has focused on long-term development in energy, infrastructure, basic services, and governance through \"Plan Colombia.\" Aid has decreased as Colombia's security situation improved, with a shift towards economic and social development efforts. U.S. assistance for Mexico primarily supports the country's fight against. U.S. assistance for Mexico, Colombia, and Haiti has declined somewhat as the focus shifted to rule of law programs. In FY2012, the United States provided $357 million for Haiti, $379 million for Colombia, and $330 million for Mexico, totaling over 56% of all aid to the region. The Obama Administration's FY2013 foreign aid budget request would continue the downward trend in assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean, with approximately $1.7 billion requested for the region. The Obama Administration's FY2013 foreign aid budget request for Latin America and the Caribbean is approximately $1.7 billion, which is a 10-11% decrease compared to FY2011 and FY2012 levels. The proposed cuts are widespread, affecting every account except Development Assistance, with countries like Brazil, Venezuela, Argentina, and Guyana facing significant percentage cuts. Colombia and Mexico would also see notable reductions in funding. The Obama Administration's FY2013 foreign aid budget request for Latin America and the Caribbean is approximately $1.7 billion, a 10-11% decrease compared to previous years. The proposed cuts would affect every account except Development Assistance, with a shift towards development and humanitarian aid. El Salvador would receive an increase in aid, while Colombia and Mexico would see significant reductions. The Obama Administration's FY2013 foreign aid budget request for Latin America and the Caribbean is approximately $1.7 billion, with a 4% decrease in total funding compared to FY2012. The request includes $434 million through the Economic Support Fund (ESF) account, representing a 7% decline from FY2012. If fully funded, $567 million, or 33% of U.S. aid, would go to security assistance accounts. The Obama Administration's FY2013 foreign aid budget request for Latin America and the Caribbean is approximately $1.7 billion, with a 4% decrease in total funding compared to FY2012. U.S. security assistance for the region would decrease by about 19% compared to FY2012 and 10% compared to FY2011. The distribution of assistance within the Western Hemisphere shows a focus on Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, and the Andean nations of South America. The United States provided Mexico and Central America with foreign assistance worth $27.5 billion between FY1980 and FY2010, with over 91% in economic assistance. Brazil and the Southern Cone countries would receive just 1% of U.S. assistance for the region, while 7% is dedicated to regional programs.

During the 1990s, U.S. assistance to Central America and Mexico declined considerably, totaling $7.6 billion in 2010 U.S. dollars, a 41% decrease from the previous decade. Aid further decreased between FY2000 and FY2009 to about $5.9 billion in 2010 U.S. dollars. Despite the decline, new aid initiatives benefited several countries in the sub-region. In the aftermath of declining U.S. assistance to Central America and Mexico, new aid initiatives benefited countries in the sub-region. El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua received MCC compacts, while Mexico started receiving significant aid through the M\u00e9rida Initiative. In FY2010, Mexico and Central America received almost $1.3 billion in U.S. assistance, with 57% going to Mexico. In FY2013, Mexico and Central America received $532.4 million in aid through the State Department and USAID appropriations. In FY2011 and FY2012, Mexico and Central America received $532.4 million and $696.2 million in U.S. assistance, respectively. The FY2013 request for the sub-region is $619.8 million, with Mexico receiving $269.5 million, a decrease from the previous year. Mexico would still receive over 45% of aid due to U.S. support in combating organized crime. In FY2013, U.S. assistance to Mexico focuses on providing training, technology, and equipment to strengthen law enforcement entities and combat organized crime. The shift in the M\u00e9rida Initiative prioritizes capacity building programs over expensive security equipment like helicopters. Support also includes justice sector reform efforts, such as transitioning to an oral, adversarial system. Support for the Mexican military includes human rights training and equipment to improve intelligence and communications capabilities. Aid also goes towards partnerships with Mexican universities, private sector competitiveness reforms, and climate change mitigation efforts. Congress has required withholding 15% of assistance until human rights conditions are met. The \"Northern Triangle\" countries of Central America also face challenges in combating organized crime. Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala receive security assistance through the Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI).

The FY2013 U.S. assistance request for Guatemala includes support for trade capacity, environmental conservation, education, combating trafficking, promoting good governance, food security, and healthcare. Additionally, 4% of the assistance would go towards training and equipment for security forces to improve border control. U.S. assistance has been conditioned since 2005, with support for the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG). Honduras would receive $58.2 million in U.S. assistance under the FY2013 request, with the majority allocated to decentralize governance, improve service delivery, ensure transparency in elections, enhance education quality, and implement a food security strategy. Health assistance would support the national HIV/AIDS strategy and health system reform. Training and equipment for security forces are also included. The State Department is required to withhold 20% of the assistance for Honduran security forces until human rights conditions are met. El Salvador would receive $41.8 million in U.S. assistance, an increase of $12.6 million from FY2012. El Salvador is part of the Partnership for Growth initiative for economic development. The Partnership for Growth initiative aims to promote economic growth in low-income countries by addressing constraints such as crime and lack of competitiveness. U.S. assistance for El Salvador in FY2013 focuses on security and justice sector reforms, anti-corruption efforts, education system improvements, and public sector strengthening. The FY2013 request includes support for strengthening education systems, public administration, and private sector competitiveness in El Salvador. Assistance would also enhance the Salvadoran security forces' capabilities in border control, counternarcotics, and humanitarian relief. U.S. aid to Nicaragua would decrease by $390,000, reflecting strained relations with President Daniel Ortega and concerns about democratic governance. The majority of the U.S. assistance for Nicaragua would be funded through the DA account, focusing on democracy promotion projects, market-oriented economic policies, and resource management. Some assistance would also be provided to the Nicaraguan military, which is seen as an independent and strong counternarcotics partner. The USAID Missions in Belize, Costa Rica, and Panama are expected to close, but these countries still receive U.S. assistance. The FY2013 request includes $6.4 million for these countries, a $2.3 million increase from FY2012, for equipment and training to combat drug trafficking and security threats. Additionally, there is $29.7 million for regional programs.

CARSI was initially part of the M\u00e9rida Initiative but became a separate program in FY2010, receiving significant appropriations from Congress between FY2008 and FY2012. U.S. agencies provide equipment, technical assistance, and training to partner nations to improve narcotics interdiction and disrupt criminal networks in the region. CARSI supports Central American law enforcement and justice sector institutions, addressing deficiencies and enhancing capacities for citizen safety. It also aids in prevention efforts to reduce drug demand and provide opportunities for at-risk youth. CARSI is funded through the State Department's Western Hemisphere Regional program. The United States has provided significant assistance to the Caribbean region since FY1980, totaling almost $14 billion in constant 2010 U.S. dollars.

Additionally, a new Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI) was initiated to support efforts in reducing illicit trafficking and promoting citizen security. The U.S. provided significant assistance to the Caribbean in FY2010, with a large portion going to Haiti after the earthquake. In FY2011 and FY2012, funding for the region totaled $1.7 billion, with Haiti receiving the majority. For FY2013, Haiti is expected to continue to receive the most assistance, focusing on reconstruction efforts. The U.S. will continue to focus on assisting the Caribbean, particularly Haiti, in rebuilding after the earthquake. Efforts include addressing poverty, stability, security, and democratic processes. The post-earthquake strategy focuses on infrastructure, energy, food security, health services, and governance. Thomas C. Adams is the Special Coordinator for Haiti appointed by Secretary of State Clinton in 2010. USAID leads the assistance program for Haiti. The U.S. continues to assist Haiti in rebuilding after the earthquake, with USAID leading the efforts. Over 1.5 million Haitians were initially in tent camps, but by early 2012, 550,000 remained.

FY2013 foreign aid request includes programs for various Caribbean countries to combat HIV/AIDS and support security forces. In the Eastern Caribbean, a $35.2 million program based out of Bridgetown, Barbados, would support assistance activities for Barbados and the six countries of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS): Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Almost two-thirds of the aid would support HIV/AIDS programs in the Eastern Caribbean. The USAID Mission in Barbados manages HIV/AIDS programs in Guyana, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago. In the Dominican Republic, global health activities focus on HIV/AIDS and maternal and child health. For Cuba, the Administration supports various projects to strengthen government institutions, education, small businesses, and natural resources. The Administration is requesting $15 million for Cuba to provide humanitarian assistance to political prisoners and their families, strengthen civil society, and promote uncensored information flow. Congress had previously appropriated $20 million annually for this assistance, with concerns about program effectiveness and conduct delaying the provision of assistance in 2010 and 2011. Alan Gross, a USAID subcontractor distributing communications equipment to Jewish organizations in Cuba, has been imprisoned.

The program has received $203 million in funding since FY2010, focusing on areas such as maritime security, law enforcement capacity building, border security, justice sector reform, and crime prevention for at-risk youth. The State Department does not provide a breakdown of CBSI assistance by country, making it difficult to determine the overall level of aid each Caribbean country is receiving. U.S. assistance under the CBSI likely surpasses regular bilateral aid levels for many Caribbean nations. Since the 1980s, the United States has provided significant economic and military assistance to the Andean region of South America, including Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela. Colombia received the largest share of assistance at 45%, followed by Peru (26%), Bolivia (21%), Ecuador (8%), and Venezuela (1%).

The Department of Defense (DOD) provides humanitarian assistance programs primarily as training opportunities for the U.S. Armed Forces in Latin America and the Caribbean. DOD operations in the region are overseen by U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) and U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM). Congress authorizes DOD to engage in various humanitarian activities and provide disaster relief under 10 U.S.C. Section 2561. In FY2010, DOD provided $84 million in humanitarian assistance through nearly 200 projects in at least 28 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. Assistance included alert systems, insecticide-treated nets, and health center renovations. Haiti received the largest amount, $34.8 million, after the 2010 earthquake. After the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, DOD provided critical support within 24 hours, deploying military engineers, planners, and communication specialists to restore operations, deliver supplies, and ensure security for the population. DOD plays a crucial role in disaster response by providing humanitarian assistance, security, and counterdrug support in Latin America and the Caribbean. Despite USAID being the lead authority for disaster response, DOD often takes the lead due to its capabilities. Congress has granted independent counterdrug authorities to DOD under Section 1004 of the NDAA of 1991. In Latin America and the Caribbean, DOD supports foreign counterdrug efforts through training, transportation, reconnaissance, intelligence analysis, and infrastructure construction. DOD also provides nonlethal equipment to certain countries for counterdrug activities. In FY2010, DOD provided nearly $435 million in counterdrug assistance to the region. In Latin America and the Caribbean, DOD supports foreign counterdrug efforts with training, transportation, reconnaissance, intelligence analysis, and infrastructure construction. Colombia and Mexico were the top recipients of DOD counterdrug assistance in the region, receiving $129.4 million and $71.6 million, respectively. Additionally, DOD has provided $72.1 million in assistance to 10 countries in the region for counterterrorism and stabilization activities under Section 1206 of the FY2006 NDAA. The Department of Defense (DOD) provided $72.1 million in assistance to 10 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. No nations in the region received Section 1206 funding in FY2010. DOD also provided $67.5 million in assistance to six countries in the region under Section 1207 authority between FY2006 and FY2010, which expired at the end of FY2010. The Inter-American Foundation (IAF) is an independent U.S. foreign aid agency that provides grants for grassroots development to help the poor. The Inter-American Foundation (IAF) is an independent U.S. foreign aid agency that provides grants for grassroots development to help poor communities in Latin America and the Caribbean. Since FY1972, the agency has given almost 5,000 grants totaling $695 million to local groups for various development projects, including basic needs, small business support, job creation, and market access. Grant recipients are expected to contribute their own resources or secure additional funding from other sources. The Inter-American Foundation (IAF) has provided over $1 billion in additional resources since its establishment, surpassing IAF contributions. In FY2011, the IAF awarded 61 new grants and provided 33 supplements totaling $14.9 million in various areas such as agriculture, education, enterprise development, corporate social investment, cultural expression, environment, health, and legal assistance. Grant recipients were located throughout the region, with a focus on the Andean and Central regions. In FY2011, the Inter-American Foundation (IAF) awarded grants to various regions, with 33% in the Andean region, 24% in Central America, 15% in the Southern Cone of South America, 13% in Brazil, 10% in the Caribbean, and 5% in Mexico. High priority grantees included women, children, youth, indigenous people, and African descendants. The IAF also supports doctoral students from US universities to conduct research in Latin America and the Caribbean. Funding for the IAF was $22.45 million in FY2011 and an estimated $22.5 million in FY2012, with a FY2013 request for $18.1 million. The Administration's FY2013 request for the Inter-American Foundation is $18.1 million, a 20% decline from FY2012 appropriations. Despite the funding cuts, the agency plans to maintain its program level by partnering with other U.S. government agencies and the private sector. Congress ultimately appropriated $22.5 million for the IAF in FY2012. The Inter-American Foundation receives additional funding from the Social Progress Trust Fund (SPTF) administered by the Inter-American Development Bank, which will decrease in future years. In FY2017, SPTF funding will be reduced to about $3 million and will decline further to about $0.5 million or less beginning in FY2019. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) was established in 2004 to provide economic assistance to developing nations based on certain indicators. MCC awards grants up to five years in length with a focus on measurable impact. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) provides economic assistance to developing nations based on measurable impact indicators. Three Latin American and Caribbean countries have been awarded compacts, while three others have received threshold programs. El Salvador signed a $461 million compact in 2006 to develop its northern border region, where over half the population lives in poverty. El Salvador signed a $461 million compact in 2006 to develop its northern border region, where more than half of the population lives in poverty. The compact included projects to improve physical infrastructure, human capital, support small farmers and businesses, and build transportation arteries. MCC announced El Salvador's eligibility for a second compact in December 2011, with the proposal expected to be finalized in 2013. In June 2005, Honduras signed a $215 million economic growth compact with MCC, consisting of a rural development project and a transportation project. $10 million in funding was terminated after the ouster of President Manuel Zelaya in 2009, reducing the total funding to $205 million. The compact was completed in September 2010, and MCC announced in January 2011 that it would not be renewed. Honduras's MCC compact was not renewed in January 2011 due to corruption issues. However, Honduras remains eligible for a $20 million threshold program. Nicaragua signed a $175 million compact in July 2005 focusing on economic growth in the western region through transportation and rural development projects. Nicaragua's MCC compact funding was reduced to $113.5 million after disputed elections in 2008. The compact ended in May 2011. Guyana signed a $6.7 million threshold program in 2007 to improve fiscal policy indicators. Paraguay and Peru signed threshold programs with MCC focusing on reducing corruption and improving fiscal policy indicators. Paraguay received $30.3 million for a two-year program in 2009, while Peru signed a $35.6 million program in the same year. The programs aimed to combat corruption in various sectors and increase immunization rates. The Peace Corps in Latin America and the Caribbean aims to increase immunization rates and combat corruption. Nearly 65,000 volunteers have served in the region since 1961, with about 2,600 volunteers assigned to 22 countries in FY2011. Program funding for the region was around $65 million in FY2011 and is estimated to be $61 million in FY2012, with a budget request of $60 million for FY2013. In Latin America and the Caribbean, the Peace Corps will allocate about $60 million for programs. Due to budget cuts, the number of volunteers in the region will decrease to 2,250 by the end of FY2012 and 1,800 by the end of FY2013. Most countries will see reductions in volunteers, except for Colombia. The Peace Corps plans to close programs in Antigua and Barbuda, St. Kitts and Nevis, and Suriname due to the Country Portfolio Review. The Peace Corps has suspended operations in some Latin American and Caribbean countries due to security concerns. In 2005, volunteers were withdrawn from Haiti and in 2008 from Bolivia. In January 2012, volunteers were pulled out of Honduras because of high levels of violence. The Peace Corps suspended operations in Honduras in 2012 due to violence and homicides. Volunteer programs in El Salvador and Guatemala were also affected, with training classes cancelled in December 2011. Despite security concerns, the Peace Corps plans to send new volunteers to these countries in 2013. The U.S. Administration's foreign aid budget request for Latin America and the Caribbean focuses on promoting economic opportunity, citizen security, democratic governance, and clean energy. Citizen security programs in Mexico, Colombia, Central America, and the Caribbean make up 45% of the total budget, emphasizing a multilateral partnership approach. The U.S. Administration's foreign aid budget request for Latin America and the Caribbean prioritizes citizen security programs in Mexico, Colombia, Central America, and the Caribbean. The FY2013 request also includes assistance for Haiti to support earthquake recovery, development efforts, and sanitation and health services. The FY2013 request for Latin America and the Caribbean prioritizes \"Peace and Security\" assistance at 30%, \"Governing Justly and Democratically\" at 24%, \"Investing in People\" at 23%, and \"Economic Growth\" programs. The FY2013 request for Latin America and the Caribbean includes assistance for a variety of projects in the \"Economic Growth\" program area, accounting for about 20% of aid to the region. The request is about 10% less than the amount provided in FY2012, taking advantage of favorable development trends in the region. USAID plans to close its mission in Panama, manage programs for Guyana from Barbados, reduce aid to Colombia and Peru, and withdraw from sectors where progress has been made. Concerns have been raised about the proposed 10% decrease in funding for Latin America and the Caribbean. There is broad agreement between Congress and the Administration on the importance of maintaining assistance for citizen security and counter-narcotics efforts in Mexico, Colombia, Central America, and the Caribbean. Some Members have concerns about declines in assistance for these programs, while others oppose portions of the Administration's proposed FY2013 funding for the region. Assistance for Haiti's recovery is also a point of consensus, with calls for adequate monitoring to ensure transparency and accountability in the assistance program. Some Members on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs oppose parts of the Administration's proposed FY2013 funding for Latin American and Caribbean countries, including the Global Climate Change Initiative and increases in funding for Bolivia, Ecuador, and Nicaragua. They argue that these governments undermine U.S. interests and disregard the rule of law. Additionally, some committee members are against cuts in democracy funding for Cuba and Venezuela. Committee members opposed cuts in democracy funding for Cuba and Venezuela by $5 million and $3 million respectively, stating it is crucial to support democracy advocates. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees have marked up their versions of the FY2013 State Department appropriations, potentially reducing worldwide foreign aid funding significantly from the Administration's request. The House version could mean a substantial cut in assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean. The House version of the FY2013 State Department appropriations could lead to a significant reduction in foreign aid funding for Latin America and the Caribbean. Questions for Members of Congress to consider include whether the request aligns with U.S. interests, if aid programs are effective, and if there are specific metrics to evaluate their effectiveness. The potential impact of the Administration's proposed FY2013 aid cuts for Latin America on U.S. policy and bilateral relations is a key concern. Congress may need to identify areas for reduction in foreign aid with the least harm to U.S. interests. Resource coordination among U.S. government agencies and international donors could help maximize the impact of scarce foreign assistance funds. The U.S. foreign assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean is managed by various government agencies, including the State Department, USAID, and DOD. However, there is a lack of coordination among these agencies, leading to potential overlap in aid efforts. Efforts to improve coordination are underway, but there is no formal framework in place. There is a lack of formal framework for sharing information among U.S. agencies providing assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean. Better coordination could ensure complementary efforts and increase the impact of programs. The United States provided $2.7 billion (25%) of the $10.7 billion in official development assistance to the region in 2010. In 2010, major international donors provided a total of $10.7 billion in official development assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean. The United States contributed $2.7 billion (25%), while other bilateral donors gave $5.1 billion (48%) and multilateral organizations provided $2.8 billion (26%). Studies have shown a lack of coordination among donors, leading to duplicated efforts and conflicting goals. Closer coordination could improve efficiency and ensure funds are used more effectively for foreign assistance. The United States has signed trilateral cooperation agreements with Brazil, Chile, and Colombia to provide assistance to third countries, aiming for more efficient aid programs. Coordination among donors is crucial for improving efficiency and ensuring effective use of foreign assistance funds. The United States has signed trilateral cooperation agreements with Brazil, Chile, and Colombia to provide access to new solutions and expertise, aiming to multiply the impact of development programs by combining best practices with larger financial resources. Assistance requested for Brazil in FY2013 would strengthen the government's development agency and implement jointly funded programs in third countries. The House FY2013 foreign aid appropriations bill recommends $18.6 million to support Colombian government efforts in counternarcotics and law enforcement. Critics raise oversight concerns about providing assistance through foreign governments. The House FY2013 foreign aid appropriations bill recommends $18.6 million to support Colombian government efforts in counternarcotics and law enforcement. Questions for Members of Congress to consider include agencies' comparative advantages in providing assistance, clarifying roles of U.S. agencies in foreign assistance, encouraging inter-agency coordination, identifying types of assistance programs where the U.S. has a comparative advantage, and exploring support from other donors for countries or sectors of lower strategic importance. When considering foreign assistance levels for Latin American and Caribbean nations, Congress might examine political will and program sustainability. The State Department's Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review suggests assessing host nations' political will to make necessary reforms for effective use of U.S. assistance. Controls are needed to ensure U.S. funds provided through partner nations are used in accordance with U.S. law. The effectiveness of U.S. assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean depends on partner nations' willingness to implement reforms and sustain programs. Colombia, a major recipient of U.S. aid, has shown political will and program sustainability through reforms and increased revenue. This allows for a managed transition of assistance programs. The United States is gradually reducing aid to Colombia as the country takes over financial and technical responsibility. USAID is also closing its mission in Panama and ending family planning programs in other Latin American countries. However, political will in the region has been lacking in terms of generating sufficient government revenue to sustain efforts initiated with U.S. support. A 2003 study of U.S. democracy programs in Latin America found issues with sustainability after U.S. support ended. Counternarcotics programs faced challenges in using U.S.-provided boats due to lack of funding for fuel and maintenance. Even MCC-funded projects in Honduras had problems with program sustainability. The sustainability of MCC-funded projects in Honduras is questioned due to limited lifespan of roads built for small farmers' access to markets. Concerns include municipalities lacking equipment, expertise, and funding for road maintenance. Considerations for foreign aid appropriations include assessing the host country's capacity for equipment maintenance and financial responsibility. The House Committee on Appropriations marked up FY2013 appropriations bills for the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs in May 2012, totaling $48.3 billion, including $40.1 billion for various purposes. The House Committee on Appropriations reported a $48.3 billion FY2013 appropriations bill for the State Department and Foreign Operations, with $40.1 billion for core purposes. The Senate Committee on Appropriations marked up a $52.3 billion bill, including $50 billion for core purposes. Funding levels would have been lower than previous estimates. The Obama Administration criticized the House bill for proposing funding levels 2.3% lower than FY2012 and 4.7% lower than their request, calling it \"unworkable\" and damaging to national security. The impact on foreign assistance for Latin America and the Caribbean was uncertain under the proposed bills. The House report expressed concerns over conditions in Latin America and the Caribbean and intended to provide assistance levels above the Administration's request for some countries in the region. The Committee recommended restoring reductions proposed in the request for key countries in Latin America to address immediate security needs. The Senate report (S.Rept. 112-172) emphasizes the importance of supporting counternarcotics and law enforcement efforts in Mexico, Colombia, Central America, and the Caribbean to combat drug trafficking and violent crime before it reaches the United States. The report also highlights the challenges faced by countries in Central and South America due to struggling economies and weak governmental institutions, calling for additional U.S. aid. The Committee directs additional resources to strengthen democratic institutions and address poverty in the region, with specific funding levels recommended for Colombia and Mexico above the requested levels. The House report recommended increased funding levels for Colombia and Mexico to support training, technical assistance, anti-crime, and counternarcotics efforts. For Colombia, the House report suggested additional funding in ESF, FMF, and INCLE. In comparison, the Senate report recommended funding for alternative development and institution building in ESF, FMF at requested levels, and increased funding in INCLE. For Mexico, the House report recommended additional funding in DA, ESF, FMF, and INCLE to support efforts along the U.S.-Mexican border. The Senate and House reports differed on funding priorities for anti-crime and counternarcotics efforts along the U.S.-Mexican border. The Senate recommended INCLE funding at the requested level and $10 million above the request in ESF for economic development activities. The House recommended $5 million in ESF for democracy programs in Venezuela, while the Senate supported the Administration's request for $3 million and suggested NED administer the programs. The House and Senate reports differed on funding levels for regional security programs like CARSI and CBSI. The House recommended additional funding for democracy programs in Cuba, while the Senate capped funding at the requested level. The Senate also recommended more funding for conservation programs in the Brazilian Amazon compared to the House report. The Senate bill proposed $5.4 million above the request for the Inter-American Foundation, while the House bill funded it at the requested level. Congress did not take action on H.R. 5857 or S. 3241, instead enacting a six-month continuing resolution (P.L. 112-175) that expired in March 2013. New legislation (P.L. 113-6) was approved before the expiration of the continuing resolution, funding federal programs. Congress approved new legislation (P.L. 113-6) funding federal programs through the end of FY2013, maintaining State Department and Foreign Operations funding at FY2012 levels with some exceptions. However, funding was subject to budget sequestration cuts, resulting in a 5% reduction. Country-level allocations for FY2013 are not yet available due to the account-level application of the cuts."
