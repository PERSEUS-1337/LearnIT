Additionally, it includes provisions for supplemental environmental programs in coastal areas. The \"Coastal Resources Enhancement and Restoration Act of 2000\" includes provisions for supplemental environmental programs in coastal areas, allowing federal agencies violating the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to choose constructing artificial reefs or aquatic habitat restoration projects instead of paying fines. SEC. 4. ACCESS TO PUBLICLY OWNED SHORES. (a) Eligibility of Shoreline Protection Projects.--Subsection (d) of the Act authorizing Federal participation in shoreline protection projects is amended to consider publicly owned shores with insufficient public access as privately owned shores. (b) Cost Sharing.--Section 103(d) of the Water Resources Development Act is amended to address cost sharing for such projects. The Development Act of 1986 is amended to include publicly owned shores with insufficient public access as privately owned shores. The Secretary of the Army will issue rules to ensure public access to every one-half mile of publicly owned shore with assistance provided. Exceptions to access requirements may be allowed. The Secretary may allow exceptions to access requirements for shores in environmentally sensitive areas. SEC. 5. BEACH NOURISHMENT ACCOUNT. Establishment of the Beach Nourishment Account in the Treasury to receive funds from the general fund under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act for beach nourishment without the need for further appropriation. Funds in the Beach Nourishment Account are available for the pilot program authorized by section 6 and for projects for beach nourishment, shore protection, and beach erosion control. The funds remain available until expended. The Secretary of the Army is responsible for carrying out these projects. The Secretary of the Army is responsible for beach nourishment, shore protection, and erosion control projects funded by the Beach Nourishment Account. Transactions are reported to Congress annually, and the Treasury invests a portion of the account. The Secretary invests a portion of the Beach Nourishment Account in interest-bearing obligations of the United States, which can be acquired on original issue or by purchase of outstanding obligations at market price. Obligations may be sold at market price, and interest is earned on the proceeds. Interest on proceeds from the sale or redemption of obligations held in the account will be credited to and form part of the account. SEC. 6. COMPREHENSIVE OCEAN OBSERVING SYSTEM PILOT PROGRAM. The Secretary of Commerce and the Administrator of NASA will jointly implement a pilot program to establish a comprehensive ocean monitoring network in the United States. They will partner with local and regional entities to collect a wide range of data on coastal oceans and inland waterways for real-time availability to interested parties. The pilot program will collect various data in real-time, including wave heights, coastal currents, mammal movement, sewage outfall, water quality, fishing boat tracking, oil spill tracking, beach erosion, and weather information. The pilot program will collect data on oil spill tracking, beach erosion, weather, river mouth outflow sediment observation, and GIS coastal mapping. Federal cooperation includes the Geological Survey, Navy, and EPA. Two regional test projects will be established, with one located at the Southern California Bight. The pilot program in the Southern California Bight will coordinate with existing efforts to collect data on ocean conditions. Authorization of appropriations is available for the program. The Beach Nourishment Account will have $4,000,000 available annually from 2001 to 2006. $2,000,000 per year will be allocated for two regional test projects."
