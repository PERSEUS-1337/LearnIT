    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Dollar Bill Act of 2011\". Congress acknowledges the power to regulate currency value and weights and measures. The Federal Reserve System was given authority to regulate currency value in 1913. The US dollar has significantly decreased in value compared to gold, oil, and foreign currencies. The United States dollar has become unstable and uncertain, with the Federal Reserve System failing to produce a stable value. This instability hinders economic growth by increasing capital costs, risks in long-term investments, and the effective corporate income tax rate. An unstable dollar negatively impacts American workers, financial assets, pension plans, retirement accounts, economic and political standing, and creates anxiety in financial markets and the public. SEC. 3. DIRECTIVES TO THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is directed to make the value of the U.S. dollar equal to the price of gold on the COMEX exchange and maintain it at that level. They are also instructed not to conduct open market operations indirectly in regulating the dollar's value. The Federal Reserve will use its banking powers to maintain stable financial markets during and after transitioning to a defined value for the US dollar. Effective January 1, 2011, entities can expense 100 percent of capital investment for tax purposes in the year of investment. The Congressional Budget Office will calculate the impact on Federal revenues of the tax changes in this Act on a present value basis, similar to the Social Security Trustees. It will consider the acceleration of first-year expensing of capital investment and the historical capital investments by businesses. Capital investments by businesses historically yield higher returns than government bond interest rates. The Act supersedes conflicting provisions of the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978. It also removes the Federal Reserve Bank's authority to pay earnings on reserves. The Federal Reserve Act is amended to remove the authority of Federal Reserve Banks to pay earnings on reserves."
