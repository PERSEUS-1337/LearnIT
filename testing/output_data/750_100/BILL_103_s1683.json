The Palisades Park Commission is authorized to acquire an open space tract of land from the Sterling Forest Corporation in the Sterling Forest area of the New York/New Jersey Highlands Region. The Commission shall manage the acquired land to enhance it. The Palisades Park Commission is authorized to enhance protection of watershed, outdoor recreational, wildlife habitat, and Appalachian Trail values in the Sterling Forest area of the New York/New Jersey Highlands Region. The Palisades Park Commission is authorized for the appropriation of funds. The Palisades Park Commission is authorized to appropriate $35,000,000 for acquiring land. The Secretary of the Interior shall transfer necessary funds to the Commission to carry out this Act. The Act titled \"Sterling Forest Protection Act of 1994\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 outlines the findings of the Act. The Palisades Interstate Park Commission manages 23 parks and historic sites in New York and New Jersey, totaling over 82,000 acres. With over 8 million visitors annually, the park system offers outdoor recreational opportunities. Sterling Forest is a biologically diverse open space on the New Jersey border, comprising approximately 17,500 acres. It is a significant watershed area providing clean drinking water for 25% of the state. The forest is an important outdoor recreational asset in the densely populated northeastern United States region, featuring hardwood forests, wetlands, lakes, and glaciated valleys. Sterling Forest, strategically located on a wildlife migratory route, provides habitat for 27 rare or endangered species. Protecting Sterling Forest would enhance the Appalachian National Scenic Trail, offering recreational opportunities and preserving important trail viewsheds. Stewardship costs for the Palisades Park System are covered by the States of New York. The protection of Sterling Forest through the Palisades Interstate Park Commission will involve minimal Federal funds due to funding from the States of New York and New Jersey. There is a clear Federal interest in acquiring Sterling Forest for permanent protection of its watershed, recreational opportunities, flora and fauna, and open space, given its nationally significant qualities and the demand for open space in the northeastern United States. The protection of Sterling Forest through the Palisades Interstate Park Commission is a cost-effective investment compared to the costs of protecting drinking water for the region if the forest is developed. The purpose of protecting Sterling Forest through the Palisades Interstate Park Commission is to prevent the high costs associated with protecting drinking water for the region if the forest is developed. The Act aims to establish the Sterling Forest Reserve in New York to protect watershed, wildlife, and recreational resources, authorize federal funding for acquisition costs, direct the transfer of certain lands to the Secretary of the Interior, and provide for the management of the Reserve. The Act establishes the Sterling Forest Reserve in New York to protect watershed, wildlife, and recreational resources, authorize federal funding for acquisition costs, direct the transfer of certain lands to the Secretary of the Interior, and provide for the management of the Reserve by the Palisades Interstate Park Commission.
