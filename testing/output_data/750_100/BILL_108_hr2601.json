    "content": "The \"Public Domain Enhancement Act\" may be cited as the short title. The findings section is included in the Act. The Congress finds that the copyright clause in the United States Constitution grants Congress the power to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing exclusive rights to authors for limited times, providing an economic incentive for creating new works. The copyright term is limited to prevent permanent deprivation of the public from an artist's work. Both commercial and noncommercial creators benefit from a healthy public domain, with book publishers printing titles from the public domain for availability. The public domain is utilized for various purposes such as creating new productions, educational materials, and benefiting media sources like the World Wide Web. The public domain, including historical materials from sources like the Library of Congress on the World Wide Web, benefits from copyright protection laws that still apply to works published as early as 1923. However, a study shows that only 2 percent of works between 55 and 75 years old retain commercial value, indicating that many older works are no longer commercially available. Despite this, abandoned works under current law will not enter the public domain for many years. Abandoned works under current copyright law will not enter the public domain for many years, hindering entities from utilizing them. This contradicts the original intent of copyright laws and deprives the public of valuable historical resources. The Copyright Act aims to prevent the public from being deprived of works without commercial or copyright purpose. A mechanism is needed for abandoned American copyrights to enter the public domain.
