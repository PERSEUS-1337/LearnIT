    "content": "The Act is titled the \"District of Columbia and United States Territories Circulating Quarter Dollar Program Act\" and it involves the issuance of redesigned quarter dollars honoring the District of Columbia and each of the territories. Section 5112 of title 31, United States Code, is amended to include a new subsection for the redesign and issuance of circulating quarter dollars honoring the District of Columbia and the territories in 2009. The redesign and issuance of circulating quarter dollars in 2009 honoring the District of Columbia and the territories include flexibility in the placement of inscriptions by the Secretary. The reverse design of quarter dollars issued in 2009 will represent the District of Columbia and various territories. Each of the 6 designs required for the territories will be emblematic of the specific region. The Secretary will select 6 designs for quarter dollars after consulting with the chief executive of the District of Columbia or the territory being honored. The Secretary may include participation by District or territorial officials in the design selection and approval process for quarter dollars. The Secretary may involve District or territorial officials, artists, engravers, and the public in selecting dignified designs for quarter dollars minted under this subsection, prohibiting frivolous or inappropriate designs. No head or bust portraits of any person, living or dead, and no portrait of a living person can be included in the design of any quarter dollar under this subsection. All coins minted under this subsection are considered numismatic items. The Secretary may mint and issue a specified number of quarter dollars of each design in uncirculated and proof quality. The Secretary may mint and issue quarter dollars in uncirculated and proof qualities with a 90 percent silver and 10 percent copper content, as determined appropriate. Coins honoring the District of Columbia and territories will be issued in equal timing and order. The Secretary will issue quarter dollars in equal intervals to the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the United States Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands in 2009. If any territory becomes a state before the 10-year period ends, specific provisions will apply. If a territory becomes independent or ceases to be a territory of the United States before quarter dollars with designs emblematic of that territory are minted, this subsection will no longer apply to that territory. The definition of \"territory\" is provided for the purposes of this subsection. The term \"territory\" in this subsection refers to specific regions like Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the US Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands. The House of Representatives passed the bill on January 23, 2007. Karen L. Haas is the Clerk."
