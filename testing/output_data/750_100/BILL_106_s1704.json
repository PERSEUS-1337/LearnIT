    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Access to High Standards Act.\" Congress finds that many students lack academic preparation in secondary school, leading to limited job opportunities, high college dropout rates, and the need for remediation in college. There is a consensus that raising academic standards and expectations is crucial for improving public education, with a focus on modeling standards after advanced placement courses. Advanced placement programs are endorsed by education leaders and almost half of all States. These programs offer 30 college-level courses, are available in almost 60% of secondary schools, and serve over 1,000,000 students. Test scores from these programs are accepted for college credit at over 3,000 colleges and universities, as well as in Germany, France, Austria, Canada, and the United Kingdom. \"24 States fund programs to increase participation in advanced placement, including teacher professional development, offering courses in public schools, paying test fees, and granting academic credit for high scores. These State programs are supported by education leaders and are accepted for college credit at numerous institutions in the US and abroad.\" The State programs for advanced placement have shown success in raising academic standards, increasing enrollment, achievement, and minority participation.
