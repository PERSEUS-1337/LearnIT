    "content": "The U.S. EPA proposed to repeal the controversial Clean Power Plan (CPP) in October 2017. The CPP aimed to limit CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel-fired power plants but has faced legal challenges and has not been implemented. Stakeholders have debated the rule's legal basis, design, and cost-benefit analysis. The CPP established national CO2 emission rates for existing fossil-fuel-fired power plants, giving states flexibility in compliance options. States could choose a \"rate-based\" or \"mass-based\" approach to achieve emission goals while minimizing costs. The EPA's proposed repeal of the CPP would result in a significant change from the previous Administration's policy. The repeal is based on an analysis that projected a 32% reduction in total power sector CO2 emissions by 2030. The EPA's proposed repeal of the Clean Power Plan (CPP) is based on a change in interpretation of its authority under the Clean Air Act. The current Administration believes the CPP exceeds legal authority by setting CO2 emission goals that can only be achieved using measures outside the power plants' \"fence line\". The agency also conducted a cost-benefit analysis of the repeal. The proposed repeal of the Clean Power Plan by the EPA is considered an economically significant regulatory action. The benefits and costs are not relevant to the decision due to the current legal interpretation. However, the benefit-cost analysis of the repeal reveals methodological changes that could impact how EPA estimates benefits and costs of other regulations. Members of Congress may be interested in understanding EPA's analysis of the repeal. EPA's analysis of the proposed repeal focuses on changes in benefit-cost comparisons from 2015 to 2017. Senators requested more information on how EPA estimated benefits and costs, which could influence future regulations on greenhouse gases and pollutants. The EPA conducted an analysis of the impacts of the Clean Power Plan's proposed repeal, focusing on changes in benefit-cost comparisons from 2015 to 2017. The report compares the economic analysis of the repeal with the approach used in developing the 2015 CPP final rule, highlighting three primary changes in the 2017 analysis. The EPA conducted an analysis of the impacts of the Clean Power Plan's proposed repeal, focusing on changes in benefit-cost comparisons from 2015 to 2017. The analysis includes estimation of climate benefits, consideration of human health co-benefits, and accounting treatment of energy savings impact. EPA prepares benefit-cost analyses for significant regulatory actions in accordance with Executive Order 12866 and OMB Circular A-4. E.O. 12866 replaced prior regulatory analysis directives with similar requirements, directing federal agencies to assess benefits and costs of significant regulatory actions. Significant actions are defined as those with an annual impact on the economy of $100 million or more. Rules that meet the criteria of impacting the economy by $100 million or more, creating inconsistencies, altering budget impacts, or raising novel legal or policy issues are considered economically significant and require a detailed regulatory analysis. OMB Circular A-4 provides guidance on what constitutes a good regulatory analysis and how to develop one. OMB Circular A-4 defines a good regulatory analysis as explicitly stating the need for the proposed regulatory action, analyzing alternative approaches, and assessing benefits and costs. It aims to standardize measurement and reporting of economically significant regulatory actions across federal agencies, informing consideration of whether benefits justify costs. The \"justify\" criterion in regulatory analysis does not require monetized benefits to outweigh costs. Circular A-4 recognizes that quantified benefit and cost estimates may not capture all impacts of a regulatory proposal. EPA determined the CPP rulemaking was economically significant in 2015. When the EPA promulgated the CPP in 2015, it prepared a regulatory analysis following specific guidelines. State-specific emission rate and goals were calculated for different scenarios. The impacts estimated were not definitive but represented the EPA's best assessment. EPA estimated emission reductions and compliance costs under different scenarios using the Integrated Planning Model (IPM). Compliance costs were based on the net change in capital investment and operating costs for pollution controls at coal-fired units. The EPA estimated emission reductions and compliance costs for the Clean Power Plan using the Integrated Planning Model (IPM). The costs included operating pollution controls, fuel shifts, energy efficiency measures, and monitoring expenses. The plan aimed to reduce CO2 and non-GHG emissions, with the social cost of carbon used to estimate climate benefits. The Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) is an estimate of the monetary value of impacts associated with changes in CO2 emissions, including agricultural productivity, flood risk, and energy system costs. The EPA also quantified human health benefits from reductions in non-GHG emissions like SO2 and NOx, referred to as \"co-benefits\" under the Clean Power Plan. EPA monetized human health benefits from reduced exposure to PM and ozone using a \"benefit-per-ton\" approach. The estimates represented the value of reductions in premature deaths and illnesses associated with exposure to PM and ozone, with PM health effects accounting for most of the monetized health co-benefits. The monetized health co-benefits estimates focused on PM exposure, with 98% from reductions in premature deaths. SO2 emission reductions contributed significantly to the estimated dollar value of human health co-benefits. Ozone health effects accounted for a smaller share of the monetized health co-benefits in the scenarios analyzed for 2030. The EPA, under the Trump Administration, proposed to repeal the CPP two years after it was finalized under the Obama Administration. Clean Air Act Section 307(d) requires EPA to follow the same rulemaking process for promulgating, revising, or repealing a rule. The requirements include summarizing data and specifying the methodology used. EPA based the proposed repeal on a legal change. The EPA proposed to repeal the CPP based on a legal change in its interpretation of the Clean Air Act. The agency revisited the 2015 CPP regulatory analysis and prepared a regulatory analysis for the repeal, defining the benefits and costs of repealing the rule. The EPA defined the benefits of repealing the CPP as avoided compliance costs, while the costs were forgone reductions in emissions and associated climate and health benefits. EPA used existing power sector projections for the analysis and plans to conduct updated modeling in the future. The EPA plans to conduct updated modeling using IPM for the proposed repeal of the CPP, based on power sector projections. The benefit-cost estimates for the repeal were derived from compliance costs and emissions reductions under different scenarios. The EPA used sector projections from the AEO 2017 to monetize the avoided compliance costs and benefits of the proposed repeal of the CPP. They also changed the accounting treatment of cost savings from energy efficiency measures, counting them as a positive benefit in the analysis. The EPA's analysis of the CPP repeal included counting energy efficiency savings as a forgone benefit. The 2015 analysis showed that the benefits of the CPP outweighed the costs, but the 2017 analysis presented less favorable benefit-cost comparisons. Net benefits occur when benefits outweigh costs, while net costs occur when costs outweigh benefits. The 2015 analysis of the CPP repeal showed benefits outweighing costs, with a difference of $25 billion to $45 billion in 2030. In contrast, the 2017 analysis ranged from costs outweighing benefits to benefits outweighing costs, with estimates ranging from $28.3 billion in net costs to $14 billion in net benefits of the proposed repeal. The agency did not explicitly state whether the benefits of the repeal are likely to outweigh the costs. Table 1 presents the highest and lowest net impacts reported for each analysis. The AEO 2017 projections show a range of net costs and benefits for the proposed repeal of the CPP. Half of the benefit-cost comparisons indicate net benefits, while the other half show net costs. The estimates for 2030 range from $30.6 billion in net costs to $14.0 billion. The AEO-based estimates are similar to the proposed repeal estimates in Table 1, but not directly comparable due to modeling differences. The AEO-based estimates for the proposed repeal in 2030 ranged from $30.6 billion in net costs to $14.0 billion in net benefits. EPA noted that changes in the power sector were not reflected in the benefit-cost estimates based on 2015 modeling. These changes include shifts in electricity demand, growth in renewable energy generation, retirements of older units, fuel prices, and regulations. The AEO 2017 projections indicate a shift towards lower-emitting sources and potentially lower CO2 emissions under the CPP. EPA plans to update its power sector modeling before finalizing the proposed repeal. The projections also suggest greater SO2 reductions and higher human health co-benefits compared to 2015 estimates. The AEO 2017 scenarios showed higher human health co-benefits due to increased SO2 reductions compared to EPA's 2015 estimates. A study by Resources for the Future found that AEO 2017 projected a greater reduction in coal emissions under the CPP in 2030. It is unclear what mechanisms are behind these results and to what extent differences between models play a role. EPA revised its analysis of the CPP's benefits and costs in three primary ways. EPA revised estimates of the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) by excluding international impacts and discounting future benefits of CO2 reductions. They also assumed no human health co-benefits below pollution thresholds and counted energy efficiency savings as benefits. These changes led to different conclusions in their 2017 analysis of the CPP's benefits and costs. The EPA revised estimates of the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) by excluding international impacts and discounting future benefits of CO2 reductions. This section details the changes made to the estimates of the CPP compliance costs and benefits. The SCC is used to value the climate benefits of CO2 reductions, presenting it as a monetary value of impacts from changes in emissions. The impacts include changes in agricultural productivity, property damage from increased flood risk, and energy system costs. Models are used to calculate SCC values based on changes in emissions. In 2015, EPA estimated the climate benefits of the CPP using four SCC values developed by an interagency working group (IWG). The IWG SCC estimates, which measured the global value of CO2 reductions, were $17, $53, $77, and $160 per metric ton of CO2 emissions in 2030 (2011$). The values were based on the average SCC from model runs at discount rates of 5%, 3%, and 2.5%, respectively. In 2017, the Trump Administration withdrew the IWG's SCC estimates and disbanded the IWG as part of a broader executive order, E.O. 13783, which directed federal agencies to review certain federal requirements with respect to domestic energy development. E.O. 13783 specifically mentioned the Circular A-4 guidance for agencies to focus on domestic benefits and costs and to use discount rates of 5%, 3%, and 2.5%. EPA developed new SCC values based on E.O. 13783, using domestic focus and discount rates of 3% and 7%. The models and assumptions were similar to the IWG, but EPA calculated domestic SCC estimates using two of the three models. EPA used two models to calculate domestic SCC estimates, adjusting global values to domestic values. The interim estimates are $7 and $1 per metric ton of CO2 emissions in 2030 at discount rates of 3% and 7%. US emissions contribute to global GHG concentrations and impact the global climate. The gases mix globally, affecting GHG concentrations and climate worldwide. Stakeholders debate using domestic or global SCC values, with the IWG recommending global values due to the global nature of GHG emissions' damages. EPA adopted this rationale in 2015. EPA agreed with the IWG's rationale in 2015 to use global SCC estimates due to the interconnected global economy and potential spillover effects in national security, international trade, and public health. Stakeholders supported this, stating that a domestic SCC would underestimate benefits to the United States because of climate impacts beyond its borders. Some stakeholders disagreed with using global social cost of carbon (SCC) estimates, arguing for a focus on domestic SCC values in U.S. climate regulations. They questioned the effectiveness of using global values for international climate mitigation efforts and criticized the comparison of impacts measured on a global scale. Some stakeholders criticized the use of global social cost of carbon (SCC) estimates in U.S. climate regulations, arguing that it overstates benefits when considering non-U.S. populations. The EPA focused on domestic SCC estimates in the 2017 analysis of the proposed repeal, citing direction in E.O. 13873 and OMB Circular A-4. Circular A-4 allows for consideration of global values but emphasizes analyzing benefits and costs that accrue domestically. The EPA focused on domestic social cost of carbon (SCC) estimates in the 2017 analysis of the proposed repeal, in line with E.O. 13873 and OMB Circular A-4. Circular A-4 emphasizes analyzing benefits and costs that accrue domestically, rather than global values. EPA presented global estimates as part of a sensitivity analysis but did not compare them to the avoided costs of the repeal. Experts acknowledge challenges in accurately estimating the domestic SCC, particularly in capturing relevant regional interactions. The EPA and NAS noted challenges in estimating the social cost of carbon (SCC) due to difficulties in capturing relevant regional interactions. OMB Circular A-4 discusses discount rate selection for benefit-cost analysis based on scenarios affecting consumer spending or private capital. The EPA and NAS highlighted challenges in estimating the social cost of carbon (SCC) due to regional interactions. OMB Circular A-4 discusses discount rates for benefit-cost analysis based on scenarios impacting consumer spending or private capital, with rates of 3% for consumption and 7% for capital investments. Discounting in the SCC calculation allows for comparisons of economic impacts occurring at different times, with implications for how the current generation values climate change. The selection of a discount rate is particularly challenging due to the intergenerational aspect of climate change. The current generation must choose a discount rate for future generations in the context of climate change impacts. Higher discount rates lead to lower present values, while lower rates result in higher present values. The selection of a discount rate is crucial in considering future generations' preferences and economic impacts over time. The literature shows that Social Cost of Carbon estimates are sensitive to discount rate selection, with lower rates leading to higher present values. OMB Circular A-4 recommends considering lower discount rates for intergenerational analysis, with rates in the 1990s ranging from 1% to 3%. The Circular has not been updated since 2003, but the Obama Administration's Council of Economic Advisers assessed discount rates in 2017 based on more recent market data. The Obama Administration's Council of Economic Advisers recommended lowering discount rates for the Social Cost of Carbon in 2017 based on recent market data. Stakeholders have differing views on discount rate selection, with environmental groups advocating for lower rates and industry groups suggesting higher rates like 7%. The literature generally supports the use of lower discount rates in climate change studies. The literature supports lower discount rates in climate change studies, with the NAS and IWG recommending rates of 2.5%, 3%, and 5% for the Social Cost of Carbon analysis. EPA agreed with these rates in the 2015 CPP analysis. The NAS recommended a new approach for calculating discount rates to better capture uncertainty over long periods of time, suggesting that the OMB Circular A-4 guidance is insufficient for choosing SCC discount rates. EPA agreed with the IWG's selection of discount rates, aligning with economics literature and OMB Circular A-4 guidance. The EPA estimated the forgone climate benefits of the proposed repeal using interim SCC estimates, which were lower than previous analyses. The use of a 7% discount rate in the 2017 analysis reduced the estimates of climate benefits under the CPP. The EPA conducted a sensitivity analysis on the forgone climate benefits of the proposed repeal, using global values and a 2.5% discount rate. The agency did not directly compare these estimates to the avoided compliance costs. The EPA's sensitivity analysis on the forgone climate benefits of the proposed repeal diverged from the 2015 analysis by excluding human health co-benefits from some benefit-cost comparisons. This approach appeared inconsistent with guidance in OMB's Circular A-4. The EPA's approach to focus on benefits due to reductions in the target pollutant relative to costs appears inconsistent with OMB's Circular A-4 guidance. EPA requested public comment on this approach and its rationale for evaluating regulatory actions. EPA's rationale for breaking out costs in the decision-making process relates to stakeholders' concerns about co-benefits in regulations targeting pollutants. Some critics questioned the inclusion of co-benefits in the analysis of the CPP's impact on CO2 and whether PM benefits from other regulations were double-counted. EPA's 2015 analysis stated that human health co-benefits were incremental to the baseline. The estimated human health co-benefits are considered incremental to existing regulations of PM and emissions. Federal guidance directs agencies to quantify and monetize co-benefits and adverse impacts not already included in direct cost estimates. EPA's economic analysis guidelines recommend including intended effects, associated costs, and ancillary effects. The analysis includes intended effects, costs, co-benefits, and costs of federal regulations, with a focus on EPA's Clean Air Act analyses. OMB reports highlight the monetization of co-benefits in EPA rules, particularly in reducing public exposure to fine particulate matter. This approach aligns with standard accounting practices and OMB Circular A-4 requirements. The EPA's benefit-cost comparisons did not include all estimated health co-benefits, applying a threshold to only count forgone health co-benefits exceeding a defined PM level. This diverged from past practice, using a threshold to calculate PM mortality impacts based on federal air quality standards. The EPA set thresholds based on federal air quality standards for PM to estimate deaths related to PM. One threshold was based on the current standard of 12 \u03bcg/m3, while the second threshold was based on the lowest measured levels from two long-term studies. The PM air quality standard served as a higher threshold, lowering the forgone co-benefit. The EPA set thresholds based on federal air quality standards for PM to estimate deaths related to PM. The PM air quality standard threshold lowered the forgone co-benefit estimates more than the LML threshold. Benefit-cost comparisons of the proposed repeal were mostly favorable with the PM air quality standard threshold. EPA used these thresholds to enhance transparency and provide insight into the uncertainty in estimated PM benefits. EPA referenced the agency's 2012 analysis of the rule updating the federal air quality standards. EPA justified using the LML threshold to examine uncertainty in PM-related mortality benefits, citing scientific evidence and peer-reviewed studies. The agency acknowledged the lack of a clear dividing line for setting a threshold, referencing the NAS and its own 2009 Integrated analysis. The EPA's 2015 analysis acknowledged lower confidence in benefits from reductions at lower concentrations of PM but did not apply a threshold, stating that federal air quality standards are not \"risk-free.\" The EPA's 2015 analysis acknowledged lower confidence in benefits from reductions at lower concentrations of PM but did not apply a threshold, stating that federal air quality standards are not \"risk-free.\" EPA's 2017 analysis plans to evaluate the uncertainty associated with the benefit-per-ton approach for estimating and reporting PM impacts. The EPA changed the accounting treatment of demand-side energy efficiency savings in their analysis. In 2015, savings were treated as a negative cost, reducing compliance cost estimates, while in 2017, they were considered a benefit following OMB guidance. The EPA changed the accounting treatment of demand-side energy efficiency savings in their analysis, moving energy savings from cost to benefits. This resulted in larger cost and benefits estimates, without changing the overall difference between benefits and costs. The EPA changed the accounting treatment of demand-side energy efficiency savings in their analysis, resulting in larger cost and benefits estimates without altering the overall difference between benefits and costs. This change became more significant in a cost analysis conducted under E.O. 13771, which specifies that new incremental costs associated with regulations should be minimized. The EPA's analysis under E.O. 13771 focused on cost savings from repealing regulations but did not consider the benefits. The agency calculated cost savings by omitting demand-side energy efficiency savings, viewing them as benefits in a previous analysis. The EPA's analysis under E.O. 13771 focused on cost savings from repealing regulations, exceeding compliance costs considered in previous benefit-cost analysis. Benefit-cost analysis informs policy decisions by evaluating potential effects of regulatory options, but does not solely determine decisions. Decisionmakers consider various factors when developing regulatory proposals, such as legal, technical, statutory, and ethical considerations. EPA's proposed CPP repeal was based on a change in legal interpretation and adherence to rulemaking procedures. Quantifying and monetizing the benefits and costs of regulations can be complex, drawing upon scientific data. The EPA's analyses of the 2015 CPP and the 2017 proposed repeal show how changes in policy priorities and technical information can influence benefit-cost estimations. The 2017 analysis reached different conclusions due to changes in estimating economic impacts, specifically the use of new SCC estimates. The EPA's analysis of the 2015 CPP and the 2017 proposed repeal highlighted the impact of changes in policy priorities and technical information on benefit-cost estimations. The differences in conclusions were driven by new SCC estimates lowering climate benefit estimates and thresholds reducing human health co-benefit estimates. Congress has varying views on EPA regulatory policy, especially regarding GHG-related regulations. The decisions on regulations like the CPP can significantly impact industries like the U.S. energy sector and the health of U.S. citizens. The EPA's assessment of the benefits and costs of the CPP changed between the Trump and Obama Administrations, reflecting differences in policy priorities. The 2017 analysis used interim SCC estimates, differing from the Obama Administration's IWG SCC estimates. The interim SCC estimates followed a domestic perspective and used a 7% discount rate. The domestic perspective and use of a 7% rate lowered the interim SCC estimates, impacting the estimated CPP climate benefits. Congress may need to consider potential differences in federal agencies' decisions on GHG-related regulations due to the withdrawal of the IWG SCC estimates. EPA's 2017 analysis lacked details on next steps for the SCC and its implications for other federal analyses. The EPA developed interim estimates for regulatory analyses until a better estimate of climate change impacts can be determined. It is uncertain if other agencies will use these estimates. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management has followed a similar approach, while the Department of Energy used the estimates in a rulemaking after they were withdrawn. Congress may need to consider EPA's changes to health regulations. The EPA's changes to health regulations may set a precedent for future air pollution rulemakings. The 2017 analysis reflected different policy determinations than the 2015 analysis, with lower confidence in benefits occurring from PM reductions at lower concentrations. Previous EPA analyses explored uncertainty in benefit estimates relative to benchmark concentrations. The 2017 analysis departed from previous EPA analyses by using a threshold to calculate PM mortality impacts and excluding health co-benefits from benefit-cost comparisons."
