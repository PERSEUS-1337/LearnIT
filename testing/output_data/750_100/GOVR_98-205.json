    "content": "The House and Senate approved FY1999 defense bills, with additional funding of $8.3 billion, signed into law on October 17 and 20. The FY1999 defense bill, signed into law on October 21, provides $8.3 billion in additional funding for various defense-related purposes, including Bosnia operations, military readiness, intelligence, missile defense, year 2000 fixes, storm damage repairs, purchasing fissile materials from Russia, antiterrorism activities, and defense counter-drug activities. The FY1999 defense bill provides funding for military activities of the Department of Defense, including pay, benefits, weapons procurement, and research. It also includes small amounts for the Central Intelligence Agency retirement fund and intelligence community management. Additionally, classified amounts are allocated for national foreign intelligence activities. The FY1999 defense bill allocates funds for military activities of the Department of Defense, including pay, benefits, weapons procurement, and research. It also includes funding for the Central Intelligence Agency retirement fund and intelligence community management. The Administration's budget included $270.6 billion for national defense, with $250.8 billion requested in the defense appropriations bill. Congress also passes a national defense authorization bill annually, which details defense programs similar to the appropriations bill. Congressional debate over major defense policy and funding issues usually occurs mainly in action on the authorization bill. This report tracks congressional action on both defense authorization and appropriations bills. Congress completed action on the annual defense authorization and appropriations bills on October 1. The final status of action on these bills and related legislation is as follows: House and Senate 302(b) allocations were approved in May. House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bob Livingston announced proposed initial 302(b) allocations on May 22, determining funding for defense and other programs. Final Senate allocations for defense are slightly below the Administration's request, while military construction allocations are above the request. The House Appropriations Committee Chairman announced proposed initial 302(b) allocations on May 22 for defense and other programs. The final House allocations for national security subcommittee are $250.499 billion in budget authority and $244.965 billion in outlays. The House approved the FY1999 defense authorization bill on May 21. The House approved the FY1999 defense authorization bill on May 21, and the Senate passed the bill on June 25. Conferees reached agreement on the authorization bill on September 17, and the President signed the bill into law on October 17. The House National Security Appropriations Subcommittee marked up its bill on June 3-4. The House and Senate passed their versions of the FY1999 defense appropriations bill in June and July. The full Senate passed H.R. 4103 on July 30 after substituting its text into S. 2132. Conferees announced the FY1999 defense appropriations conference report. The FY1999 defense appropriations bill (H.R. 4103) was signed into law (P.L. 105-262) on October 17. The Senate approved S.Con.Res. 86 for the congressional budget resolution on April 2, while the House approved H.Con.Res. 284 on June 5. A conference agreement on the resolution was never completed. The House and Senate approved a conference agreement on H.R. 3579 for supplemental defense appropriations for FY1998, providing funding for military operations in Bosnia and Southwest Asia, domestic and defense disaster relief. The bill, signed into law as P.L. 105-174, allocates $2.7 billion for the Defense Department, including specific amounts for Bosnia, Southwest Asia, and disaster relief. The House and Senate approved an omnibus appropriations bill for FY1999 (H.R. 4328) providing $8.3 billion in defense-related funding, including allocations for Bosnia operations, military readiness, intelligence, missile defense, and year 2000 fixes in the Defense Department. The omnibus appropriations bill for FY1999 includes $1 billion for missile defense, $1.1 billion for year 2000 fixes in the Defense Department, $469 million for storm damage repairs, $200 million for the defense health program, $525 million to purchase fissile materials from Russia, $529 million for defense antiterrorism activities, and $42 million for defense counter-drug activities, all designated as emergency appropriations. Additionally, the bill includes rescissions of $67 million. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill includes emergency funds for missile defense, Y2K fixes, storm damage repairs, defense health program, purchasing fissile materials from Russia, antiterrorism, and counter-drug activities. The defense authorization and appropriations bills resolved issues related to China, including limitations on satellite and missile technology exports. The authorization conference dropped contentious China-related amendments, including a ban on satellite exports to China. Instead, they transferred technology export review to the State Department, required congressional notification for satellite sales to China, and prohibited missile equipment exports unless certified by the President. The conference agreement prohibits the export of missile equipment or technology to China unless certified by the President. It also includes measures to prevent the transfer of port facilities near San Diego to a Chinese shipping company. Additionally, there is a provision condemning forced abortions in China and denying visas to foreign officials involved in such practices. The appropriations conference agreement does not include measures denying visas to foreign officials involved in forced abortions in China. It contains a prohibition on DOD doing business with Chinese Army-owned companies and requires a report on the security situation in the Taiwan Strait. Neither the House nor the Senate authorization bills approved new rounds of military base closures. The Senate dropped a provision that would make it difficult for the Defense Department to realign military bases without a congressionally established base closure process. The conference agreement dropped a provision objected to by Sen. Inhofe regarding COSCO. The House-passed bill required separation of men and women in basic training, while the Senate bill prohibited new policies until a commission reports. The Senate rejected a proposal to incorporate the House language. The Senate endorsed a substitute by Senator Snowe allowing current integrated training practices to continue with additional steps for separate sleeping quarters. The conference adopted the Senate language with a \"sense of the House\" statement urging separate training units. The House authorization included a requirement for commanders to display \"exemplary behavior,\" which was included in the conference agreement as a similar provision. The House and Senate rejected amendments to lift the ban on abortions in military medical facilities. The House bill included a provision to prohibit the DOE from buying tritium for nuclear weapons from commercial reactors, potentially costing billions to produce tritium in new facilities. The Senate-passed authorization bill allows DOE to choose between buying tritium from commercial sources or new facilities, with a one-year review period by Congress. The House and Senate agreed to the Administration's proposed reductions in active duty end-strength levels. The authorization conference report agrees to the Administration request for reductions in end-strength. The Senate approved an amendment to increase the military pay raise to 3.6%, offset by a reduction in R&D funds. Senators Thurmond, Levin, Stevens, and Inouye were involved in the amendment. The authorization and appropriations conference agreements provide a 3.6% pay raise in the defense appropriations bill, including $1.9 billion for Bosnia as emergency funding. The Senate approved the funding, while the House bill did not address emergency funding but capped Bosnia spending at $1.9 billion. The authorization conference agreement included a provision to cap Bosnia spending at $1.9 billion, with the option to spend $100 million more to protect U.S. troops. Both houses rejected measures to withdraw U.S. troops by a specific date, but the Senate version encouraged conditions for a drawdown of forces in Bosnia. The agreement authorized $1.9 billion in emergency funding for Bosnia, with the possibility of larger expenditures. The appropriations conference agreement did not include emergency funding for Bosnia, but it was later provided in a supplemental appropriations measure included in the FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill. Weapons priorities were few compared to past years, with the Administration requesting just one C-130J aircraft and objecting to additional aircraft funding in the House bills. The authorization and appropriations bills provided funds for 7 aircraft, more than requested. Funding for the THAAD system was reduced after a test failure in May. The program will be restructured with cuts of $294 million in the authorization agreement and $376 million in the appropriations agreement. Funding for another TMD system was also reduced or eliminated in the Senate bills. The authorization conference agreement cuts funding for the Medium Extended-Range Air Defense System (MEADS) from $44 million to $24 million and prohibits expenditure unless the Defense Department includes MEADS in future budget plans. The appropriations conference agreement provides only $10 million. The Senate also reduced funding for the Airborne Laser (ABL) program and increased funding for Space-Based Laser (SBL) R&D, despite objections from the Administration. The authorization and appropriations conference agreements follow the Senate's decisions on funding for ABL and new aircraft carrier development. The Navy will use some of the money for progressive changes in current design. The agreements provide $110 million and $105 million respectively out of the $190 million requested. The Senate also included advance procurement funds for a new LHD-8. The Senate authorization and appropriations bills included advance procurement funds for a new LHD-8 amphibious ship, with $50 million in the authorization agreement and $45 million in the appropriations agreement. The House and Senate disagreed on the number of new F/A-18E/F aircraft to procure, but ultimately funded 30 F-18s and one F-16. The Administration objected to a Senate requirement for F-22 aircraft testing before additional procurement contracts are signed. The F-22 aircraft must undergo testing before new procurement contracts are approved, with some restrictions that can be waived. The Administration objected to cuts in certain areas to fund increases in programs, but the authorization conference agreement made smaller cuts. Long-term weapons issues, such as the B-2 bomber procurement battle and the design competition for the New Attack Submarine program, seem to have been resolved this year. The House and Senate authorization bills took steps to ensure military retirees have access to the defense health care system. Pilot projects were approved to test alternative approaches, including allowing retirees to join the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan (FEHBP) and access TRICARE pharmacy benefits. The defense debate this year covered various key issues such as military base closures, Bosnia funding, technology exports controls, efficiency measures, military readiness, defense modernization funding, personnel levels, National Guard and Reserve funding. Budget constraints, results of the Quadrennial Defense Review, and ongoing battles over social issues contributed to the broad agenda. Retirees were granted access to TRICARE pharmacy benefits as a supplement to Medicare. The defense debate in FY1999 covered various key issues including defense modernization, military personnel levels, National Guard and Reserve funding, major weapons programs, social issues like sexual harassment, and military health care policy. Budget constraints from the 1997 agreement influenced the discussions. The defense debate in FY1999 was influenced by budget constraints from the 1997 agreement. The Administration's request for defense spending was at the agreed level of $270.5 billion. Congress had to offset any additions for favored programs with reductions in other defense programs. In the end, Congress provided an additional $8.3 billion for defense programs. The omnibus appropriations bill provided an additional $8.3 billion for defense programs, added at the end of the process. Congress and the Administration avoided potential conflicts by compromising on programs of ongoing interest. Senior Administration officials fully funded national missile defense development and requested more money. Officials fully funded national missile defense development, requested more money for National Guard and Reserve equipment, identified and funded all defense health program costs, and accelerated funding for the next Nimitz-class aircraft carrier to FY2001. The House and Senate did not engage in a contentious debate over defense budget priorities in FY1999, with only small amounts added for unrequested weapons programs. Additional funding of $8.3 billion was provided for defense programs in the omnibus appropriations bill. The omnibus appropriations bill for defense in FY1999 included $1 billion for ballistic missile defense, influenced by the Quadrennial Defense Review, Defense Reform Initiative report, and National Defense Panel report. These reports reassessed defense policy and identified efficiency measures. The Quadrennial Defense Review and National Defense Panel report in 1997 proposed efficiency measures and highlighted key defense strategy themes for the 2010-2020 period, including the need for U.S. forces to prevail in two major theater wars and address the \"revolution in military affairs.\" These reports will continue to be important topics of discussion in Congress. The Quadrennial Defense Review and National Defense Panel report in 1997 emphasized efficiency measures and the \"revolution in military affairs.\" They called for increased focus on homeland defense and preparing for diverse future threats, suggesting less emphasis on preparing for two major theater wars. The Quadrennial Defense Review and Defense Reform Initiative recommended additional military base closures to save money for future defense modernization programs. The Defense Department proposed two closure rounds in 1999 and 2003, but Congress was not receptive. Secretary Cohen prioritized congressional approval for two new base closure rounds in 2001 and 2005. The Defense Department's report on base closures reaffirmed previous estimates of $5.6 billion in annual savings from past closure rounds. Future closure rounds are projected to save $2.8 billion annually when fully implemented. The White House's plan to privatize two Air Force aircraft depot maintenance facilities in Sacramento, California, and San Antonio, Texas, has faced resistance within Congress due to objections following the 1995 base closure round. This plan is expected to lead to annual savings of $2.8 billion when fully phased in, crucial for funding future weapons programs. The Administration's plan to \"privatize in place\" at two Air Force maintenance facilities is being implemented, with private contractors bidding for contracts. Congress has raised concerns about politicizing the base closure process and ensuring public facilities receive adequate work. Secretary Cohen and other officials discussed a White House request for the Defense Department to encourage a private company to bid on a contract for work at the Sacramento facility. Secretary Cohen suggested that Congress could include a prohibition on privatization in place in future base closure legislation. He also advocated for more base closures to be approved now to allow the Defense Department to prepare for them in the long-term defense plan for FY2000-2005. The Senate rejected additional military base closures for FY1999, despite some support for another round in 2001. Senator Inhofe's amendment aimed to make it harder for DOD to realign facilities without congressional approval. However, he predicted that Congress would approve another base closure next year. Senator Inhofe predicted that Congress will approve another base closure round in 2001, despite his amendment being dropped. The Administration requested $1.8 billion for military operations in Bosnia and the Persian Gulf in FY1998, and an additional $1.9 billion for FY1999 defense budget. The Administration requested $1.9 billion for extending the mission in Bosnia through FY1999, with funding ultimately provided in the omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 4328) as \"emergency\" appropriations to raise caps on defense discretionary spending. The Administration requested $1.9 billion for extending the mission in Bosnia through FY1999, with funding ultimately provided in the omnibus appropriations bill as \"emergency\" appropriations to raise caps on defense discretionary spending. This proposal was contentious as it broke the precedent of including anticipated costs of ongoing military operations in regular defense appropriations measures within caps on defense spending. The Administration argued that Bosnia costs were not assumed in defense plans at the time the 1997 budget agreement was reached. If Congress did not agree to designate Bosnia funding as emergency appropriations, costs would need to be offset by cuts in other defense programs. The Senate approved $1.9 billion for Bosnia in FY1999 as emergency appropriations, while the House established a cap of $1.9 billion for Bosnia expenses with an additional $100 million available. The House rejected a motion to cut off funds for Bosnia operations without prior congressional approval. The Senate approved an amendment urging a reduction in U.S. troop levels in Bosnia but rejected a proposal to cut off funds. The Senate rejected an amendment to cut off funds for Bosnia operations unless approved by Congress. Instead, they added an amendment to provide $1.9 billion in emergency appropriations. The House also included a provision to prohibit expenditures on offensive military action without advance congressional approval. The Senate rejected an amendment to cut off funds for Bosnia operations without congressional approval. The White House threatened a veto if the Skaggs provision was included in the appropriations bill. The authorization conference agreement approves $1.9 billion in emergency funding for Bosnia, contingent on presidential certification for national security needs. The appropriations conference agreement does not include emergency funding for Bosnia, leaving the issue for later consideration. The Skaggs amendment was dropped in the appropriations conference agreement. $1.9 billion emergency funding for Bosnia was provided in the FY1999 Omnibus appropriations bill. Congressional focus on relations with China, technology exports, and allegations of assistance to China by Loral Space Corporation. Congressional attention on nuclear tests by India and Pakistan, trade sanctions legislation, and export controls. The House approved amendments to restrict technology exports to China and other countries, including limitations on missile and satellite technology exports. The White House objected to these measures. The bill also included provisions to review nuclear technology exports. The House-passed bill included provisions to restrict technology exports to China and other countries, with a focus on missile and satellite technology. Additionally, there was a provision to prohibit the transfer of facilities at Long Beach naval shipyard to a Chinese shipping company. In Senate action on the defense authorization bill, several amendments related to technology exports, China relations, and trade sanctions were proposed. Senator Hutchinson's China-related amendments were not tabled, leading to a delay in the debate on China policy. Senator Stevens postponed floor action on the bill due to concerns about contentious issues. Senator Stevens delayed floor action on the bill due to concerns about contentious amendments on China or other issues. Ultimately, Senator Hutchinson offered a revised amendment on the defense appropriations bill, requiring the State Department to deny visas to foreign officials involved in forced abortions, sterilization, or genital mutilation, which passed unanimously. The authorization conference agreement included provisions on technology exports to China. The conference agreement on technology exports to China includes transferring review authority to the State Department, requiring congressional notification for satellite sales with a presidential justification for waiving human rights limits, and prohibiting missile equipment exports unless certified not to harm the U.S. space launch industry or enhance China's missile capabilities. It also bans transferring port facilities to COSCO. For more on China policy, refer to CRS Issue Brief IB98018. The Defense Reform Initiative report recommended efficiency measures including a one-third reduction in staff at the Office of the Secretary of Defense and cuts in military service headquarters staff. Congress has pressured the Defense Department to reduce personnel and pursue public-private competitions for activities currently carried out by civilian DOD employees. Congress has pressured the Defense Department to reduce personnel engaged in \"overhead\" activities and imposed barriers to civilian personnel reductions. Key issues include determining the real impact of DOD cuts in OSD and headquarters personnel, potential deeper cuts in overhead personnel, and Congress's response to privatization measures at local facilities. The House has pushed for significant reductions in personnel involved in \"acquisition\" activities, while the Senate and Administration have sought to moderate these measures. The House has pushed for reductions in acquisition personnel, while the Senate and Administration have sought to soften these measures. HNSC urged the Defense Department to not waive cuts in acquisition personnel mandated in the previous year's defense authorization act and imposed a $500 million across-the-board cut in funding for consultants. The White House objected to the cut in consulting. The White House objected to cuts in consulting funds and measures in the House-passed authorization bill that would restrict DOD's efficiency efforts. The authorization conference agreement includes withholding funds for the Office of the Secretary of Defense, reducing acquisition personnel, cutting consultant funding, and decreasing Assistant Secretary of Defense positions. Military readiness has been a key focus in congressional hearings. Many Members of Congress have raised concerns about military readiness, citing various problems such as shortages of spare aircraft engines, lower Army recruitment standards, personnel shortfalls in key skill areas, and declining pilot retention rates in the Air Force and Navy. Some believe these issues indicate an imminent readiness crisis due to inadequate defense funding and the Clinton Administration's commitment to missions beyond the force's capacity. The Clinton Administration acknowledges some readiness problems in the military, but denies an overall crisis. They claim that early deploying units are fully ready, while later deploying units may take longer to prepare. Officials argue that anecdotal evidence does not accurately reflect the force's state, and overall readiness reports show a highly capable force. Issues like Air Force engine spares shortages are being addressed. Officials have expressed concerns about personnel recruitment and retention, with a focus on pilot retention and Army recruiting meeting quality goals. Efforts are underway to address these issues, including increased pilot reenlistment bonuses and steps to limit deployments. Senior military officers identified serious readiness problems and urged support for higher defense spending. The Joint Chiefs testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee, highlighting a need for over $17 billion per year in additional defense spending. Congressional action included restructuring funding for maintenance and mandating changes in readiness reporting, which the DOD finds challenging and costly. The Senate approved amendments on defense appropriations, including reports on food stamp use by military families and the erosion of readiness due to budget cuts and expanded missions like Bosnia. The authorization conference agreement mandates improved readiness reporting and increased funding for recruiting. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill includes $1.3 billion for enhanced military readiness, with a focus on recruiting, troop benefits, flight duty pay, and quality of life measures. However, there were no changes to military retirement benefits to improve personnel retention. The bill also addresses long-term funding for defense modernization programs. In FY1999, the Administration prioritized readiness-related funding, leading to reallocation of funds from weapons procurement to operation and maintenance accounts. The requested procurement funding of $48.7 billion is similar to the previous year, with adjustments made due to the Quadrennial Defense Review. Additionally, emergency funding for FY1999 Bosnia costs was requested. The Administration requested emergency funding for FY1999 Bosnia costs, not subject to the defense spending cap. To reach a goal of $60 billion in procurement funding by FY2001 without increasing overall defense spending, efficiency savings like base closure are planned. Failure to achieve these savings could delay the goal. The $60 billion procurement target is becoming harder to reach due to various expenses such as weapons maintenance costs, quality of life requirements, contingency operations, and health care cost growth. Congressional bills do not include substantial increases in modernization funding, except for $1 billion for BMD programs. Military personnel costs are also a concern. The QDR mandated a cut of 37,000 active duty personnel and 55,000 reserve positions through about the year 2003, mainly from support activities. There has been resistance in Congress to proposed personnel cuts, particularly in the Army due to existing strains from contingency operations and forward presence abroad. Army has long had shortages of personnel in certain skills. The Army has faced shortages in personnel for certain skills, relying on reservists for major conflicts. However, for smaller operations like in Bosnia, fully manned units are drawn from other active duty units, creating shortages elsewhere. Congress must agree to reduce or eliminate statutory floors to carry out QDR reductions, but some Members are hesitant. Some Members of Congress are hesitant to reduce active duty end-strength as requested by the Administration. HNSC rejected the request to repeal statutory floors on end-strength and agreed to reduce authorized positions by 11,000 less than requested due to concerns about troops being overworked. SASC approved the end-strength reductions and repeal of statutory floors. House and Senate versions of the defense appropriations bill assumed the cuts in end-strength for FY1999. The authorization conference report agrees to the Administration request for cuts in end-strength in FY1999. A dispute between the active Army and the Army National Guard over the role of Guard combat units has escalated. Congress approved the appointment of special advisors to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs from the Guard and Reserve. The Defense Department has requested more money for Guard and reserve weapons procurement. The Army Chief of Staff is working to ease a dispute with ARNG leaders. Congress has consistently added funds for Guard and reserve weapons programs. Congressional action includes adding substantial amounts for equipment earmarked for National Guard and Reserve. Congress has consistently added substantial amounts for equipment earmarked for National Guard and Reserve forces, including major weapons programs like Missile defense. This year's disputes over major weapons programs include National Missile Defense (NMD) and Theater Missile Defense (TMD) programs. Funding for NMD programs has become less contentious following the QDR. The funding for NMD programs has become less contentious, but major policy disputes remain unresolved. The Administration is pursuing NMD technology development while deferring deployment decisions. Congress advocates for early deployment of a nationwide defense due to threats to the United States. Disputes over TMD systems, including THAAD and Navy Theater-Wide programs, continue. The Administration has delayed THAAD development due to test failures and wants to delay Navy Theater-Wide procurement. MEADS is a cooperative program with European allies for improved air/missile defense for troops. Congressional action has sometimes held up defense authorization and appropriations bills. Congress has considered separate legislation for missile defense policy in the past two years, with the Senate Armed Services Committee reporting S. 1873, \"The American Missile Protection Act of 1998,\" calling for nationwide defense deployment. However, cloture on the bill was not invoked in May and September. Additionally, the House approved H.R. 2786, \"The Theater Missile Defense Improvement Act of 1998,\" authorizing $147 million in additional funding for TMD programs. The FY1998 supplemental funding bill, H.R. 3579, includes $179 million for TMD programs. The House-passed FY1999 authorization added money for Navy Area Defense and other TMD systems. The SASC bill provided funding for Navy Theater Wide but reduced THAAD. However, THAAD suffered a test failure and the Senate approved an amendment to trim $253.9 million from the program. The Senate committee approved a measure to trim $253.9 million from the THAAD program due to engineering development delays. The House also restructured the program, requiring a second contractor to compete with Lockheed-Martin and shifting $142.7 million from engineering to technology development. MEADS funding was reduced from $43 to $10 million, with DOD instructed to study alternatives. No additional funding was added for NMD. The Senate committees cut funding for the Air Force Advanced Airborne Laser program by $97 million and increased funding for Space-Based Laser R&D by $94 million. They also reduced funding for the ABL by $57 million and added $10 million to the TMD budget for boost phase intercept technology. Congressional defense committees endorsed accelerated development of the Navy Theater Wide TMD system with budget additions ranging from $70 million to $150 million. The House defense appropriations bill reduced funding for THAAD by $294 million and MEADS by $19 million. Further MEADS expenditures are prohibited until included in long-term defense budget plans. The Space Based Laser program saw increases while the Airborne Laser was cut by $57 million. The appropriations conference agreement cut THAAD by $376 million, MEADS to $10 million, and the Airborne Laser by $25 million. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill included an additional $1 billion for missile defense with unspecified allocation. The B-2 bomber procurement battle in Congress continues, with no additional funding allocated for 9 more bombers. An independent commission recommended against producing more bombers due to cost concerns. This year's defense bills do not include money for more B-2 bombers, potentially marking the end of the battle. HNSC added funds for B-2 upgrades, while SAC made cuts. The B-2 bomber procurement battle may be coming to an end as no additional funding is allocated for more bombers. HNSC added funds for B-2 upgrades, while SAC made cuts. Three new fighter aircraft programs are in development: Navy F/A-18E/F, Air Force F-22, and Joint Strike Fighter (JSF). DOD requested funding for these programs in FY1999, with reductions made in the QDR study. Members of Congress debate the affordability of all three programs. Members of Congress are debating the affordability of three new fighter aircraft programs: Navy F/A-18E/F, Air Force F-22, and Joint Strike Fighter (JSF). The cost of the F-22 is a major concern in the Senate. Congressional actions include reducing F/A-18E/F procurement and imposing requirements on the F-22's flight tests before further funding is released. The Senate rejected a Bumpers amendment for 601 hours of flight testing before the next procurement round. The authorization conference approved funds for 30 F-18s and waived the flight test requirement for the F-22. Congress has increased shipbuilding programs to avoid production gaps and ensure shipyards have enough work. The Navy has moved up the procurement of the CVN-77 aircraft carrier to FY2001 to avoid production gaps and maintain employment levels. Newport News Shipbuilding's \"Smart Buy\" proposal aimed to save the Navy $600 million, but the new DOD plan will not save as much. The Navy's new DOD plan will not save as much as the proposed $600 million by Newport News Shipbuilding's \"Smart Buy\" for the CVN-77 aircraft carrier. The development of the next generation DD-21 destroyer involves teaming arrangements between shipbuilders and combat system integrators for competition in combat systems and design. The Navy has abandoned plans for a new-design aircraft carrier \"CVX\" and will focus on incremental improvements to the next three Nimitz-class carriers. Congressional approval was given for the Administration's shipbuilding program, including funding for a new Attack Submarine (NSSN). This marks the end of the debate over competition between Newport News Shipbuilding and General Dynamics Electric. The Navy has decided not to pursue development of a new-design aircraft carrier \"CVX\" and will focus on incremental improvements to the next three Nimitz-class carriers. Congressional approval was given for the Administration's shipbuilding program, including funding for a new Attack Submarine (NSSN). The Senate supported a competition between Newport News Shipbuilding and General Dynamics Electric Boat Division for submarine design. Additionally, $50 million in advance procurement was added for a new LHD-7 class amphibious ship instead of overhauling older ships, which has sparked some controversy due to the ships being built in Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott's home state of Mississippi. The authorization conference agreement provides $50 million in LHD-7 advance funds, while the appropriations conference provides $45 million. The Navy has decided not to pursue a new design for the CVX aircraft carrier, focusing on upgrades for existing carriers instead. There are disagreements on funding allocation, with the Senate recommending a reduction in CVX R&D funding and an increase for CVN-77 upgrades. The House also cut funding for the CVX by $100 million. The House Appropriations bill reduced funding for the CVX aircraft carrier concept by $100 million, while the authorization conference agreement allocated $110 million for CVX R&D and the appropriations conference agreement provided $105 million. Other weapons issues include the lack of funding in the FY1999 budget for additional F-16 aircraft purchases and the recommendation to reduce the procurement of JSTARS aircraft from 19 to 13 in the QDR. The House added funds for procurement of F-16s and JSTARS aircraft, as well as for National Guard and Reserve equipment. Additionally, funds were provided for multiple C-130 cargo aircraft types, exceeding DOD's request. The House appropriations bill provided funds for various aircraft types, including 8 C-130 cargo aircraft, exceeding DOD's request. SASC also allocated funds for additional C-130s, advance procurement for JSTARS, and Guard and Reserve equipment. Rep. Obey proposed an amendment to eliminate contentious C-130J funding. Rep. Obey proposed an amendment in the HAC markup to cut funds for 4 aircraft and redirect savings to F/A-18E/F procurement and C-130 upgrades. He criticized the increase in C-130J program funding, stating it came at the expense of more valuable programs like the F/A-18E/F. The authorization conference agreement included funds for 7 C-130s, 1 F-16, advance procurement for JSTARS, and $60 million for Guard and Reserve equipment. The appropriations conference agreement provides funding for C-130s, JSTARS advance procurement, and Guard and Reserve equipment. The National Defense Panel criticized planned procurement of weapons and recommended pursuing leap-ahead technologies for land forces, fighter aircraft, and ships. The National Defense Panel criticized various military programs, including the Army M1A2 tank upgrade, Crusader artillery, and Comanche helicopter programs, as well as the Navy and Air Force F/A-18E/F and F-22 programs, and the Navy CVN-77 aircraft carrier. Congressional action included approving a measure for a Quadrennial Defense Review and criticizing the Army's Crusader artillery program. The SASC criticized the Army's Crusader artillery program and ordered a review in light of the National Defense Panel's argument. The authorization conference agreement requires a report on Crusader, focusing on social issues like sexual harassment and gender-integrated training. Last year, commissions were established by the Administration and Congress to review gender-integrated training. The Administration-appointed commission, led by former Senator Nancy Kassebaum Baker, made recommendations to improve recruitment and training in the military. One key recommendation was to provide separate units and barracks for men and women during basic training, a policy followed by the Marine Corps. However, the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services disagreed with this recommendation for greater gender separation in training. The Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services disagreed with the recommendation for greater gender separation in training. Congressional action included a provision for separate units and barracks for men and women in basic training, but no changes have been made by the services yet. The congressionally-mandated commission is still investigating the issue. The Senate approved a Snowe substitute allowing current service practices to continue despite the House's push for gender-integrated training. The authorization conference agreement maintains current unit training practices but requires separate sleeping quarters for men. The current unit training practices will continue, but there is a requirement for separate sleeping quarters for men and women in basic training. Congress is evaluating defense health care issues, including the effectiveness of the Tricare program and health care benefits for military retirees. Last year, a demonstration program was established to test a system similar to Medicare. Congressional action: HNSC and SASC established demonstration projects to test alternative means of providing healthcare to military retirees, including access to the Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan. The authorization conference agreement includes three major demonstrations for continued health care for retirees.
