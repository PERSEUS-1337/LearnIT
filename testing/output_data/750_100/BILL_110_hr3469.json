The Act \"America's Border Security Act of 2007\" mandates increased use of Department of Defense equipment for surveillance at US borders to prevent illegal immigration. The \"America's Border Security Act of 2007\" requires a report from the Secretaries of Homeland Security and Defense on the current and planned use of Department of Defense equipment for border surveillance, assessing risks and foreign policy implications. During a 1-year period, the Secretary of Homeland Security will conduct a pilot program using unmanned aerial vehicles for border surveillance along the international border between Canada and the United States. The program aims to test the effectiveness of this technology in enhancing border security. The Secretary of Homeland Security will conduct a pilot program using unmanned aerial vehicles for border surveillance along the international border between Canada and the United States. This program aims to test the technology's effectiveness in enhancing border security without altering the prohibition on using the Army or Air Force as a posse comitatus. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2008 through 2012 to support this initiative. SEC. 3. INFRASTRUCTURE.\n\nThe Secretary of Homeland Security is tasked with constructing roads, acquiring vehicle barriers, and facilities to control the international borders of the United States. Quarterly progress reports to Congress are required, and appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2008 through 2012 to support these efforts. The Secretary of Homeland Security is authorized to construct additional ports of entry along the international land borders of the United States and make necessary improvements to existing ports of entry. Additionally, secure communication measures are to be implemented. The Secretary of Homeland Security is tasked with developing a plan to enhance satellite communications for clear and secure 2-way communication among Border Patrol agents, their stations, residents in remote areas along international borders, and other relevant border security agencies.

This program aims to achieve operational control of the international borders of the United States by implementing a \"virtual fence\" using unmanned aerial vehicles, cameras, sensors, and other necessary equipment. The Secretary ensures that technologies in the Integrated and Automated Surveillance Program work together seamlessly, with motion sensor alerts activating cameras automatically. Cameras in the program do not require manual operation. The Integrated and Automated Surveillance Program includes cameras that are not manually operated, have flexible views, and can be viewed at multiple centers. A standard process is used for collecting intrusion data, and future technology upgrades can be integrated with existing systems. Performance measures are developed and applied. Performance measures are developed and applied to evaluate the Program's effectiveness in monitoring and detecting illegal intrusions along the US international borders. Plans are in place to streamline site selection and installation processes for surveillance technology infrastructure. Standards are being developed to expand the shared use of existing private resources.
