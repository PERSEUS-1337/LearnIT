    "content": "The Howard M. Metzenbaum ``Menu Education and Labeling Act'' or the ``MEAL Act'' is the short title of this legislation. Congress acknowledges the strong link between diet and health, with diet-related diseases starting early in life. Increased caloric intake is a key factor contributing to the rise in obesity in the United States, where 2/3 of American adults are overweight or obese. Obesity also increases the risk of diabetes and heart disease. Over the past 2 decades, there has been a significant increase in meals prepared or eaten outside the home, with a third of calories and almost half of total food dollars spent on restaurant food. Excess saturated fat intake is a major risk factor for obesity-related health problems. The annual cost of obesity in the United States is $117 billion. Excess saturated fat intake is a major risk factor for heart disease, the leading cause of death in the United States. Heart disease also leads to disability among working adults and has a significant economic impact, costing $142 billion in healthcare and lost productivity in 2005. Increased sodium intake is linked to high blood pressure, which can lead to cardiovascular disease, including stroke. The proportion of adults with high blood pressure increases with age, reaching over 70 percent at age 70. The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 requires nutrition information on packaged foods, but restaurant foods are exempt unless a nutrient content or health claim is made. Approximately 75 percent of adults use food labels on packaged foods, leading to healthier diets. Approximately half of people change their minds about buying food products due to nutrition information on labels. Consumers find it difficult to limit calorie intake at restaurants without nutrition information. Studies show consumers want nutrition information when ordering food to make educated decisions. Surgeon General calls for action. The Surgeon General and Secretary of Health recommend increasing availability of nutrition information for foods eaten away from home to reduce obesity. SEC. 3. NUTRITION LABELING OF STANDARD MENU ITEMS AT CHAIN RESTAURANTS. Section 403(q)(5) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include provisions for restaurants and retail food establishments regarding nutrition labeling of standard menu items at chain restaurants. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act now requires chain restaurants with 20 or more locations to disclose nutrition information for standard menu items, except for certain food items. Chain restaurants with 20 or more locations must disclose nutrition information for standard menu items, including calories, saturated fat plus trans fat, and sodium content in a standard serving of the food. This information should be displayed clearly on menus or through equivalent means specified by the Secretary. Additionally, regulations will provide information to help the public understand the significance of the nutrition information in the context of a total daily diet. Chain restaurants with 20 or more locations must disclose nutrition information for standard menu items, including calories, saturated fat, trans fat, and sodium content. This information should be displayed clearly on menus or through equivalent means specified by the Secretary. The nutrition information required for standard menu items at chain restaurants with 20 or more locations must be provided in writing upon request by a prospective purchaser. Certain food items, like condiments and daily specials, are exempt from this requirement. Self-service facilities must display calorie information per standard serving for food items like salad bar, buffet line, or cafeteria line. Retail food establishments can voluntarily provide additional nutrition information that complies with regulations. Retail food establishments can voluntarily provide nutrition information that complies with regulations, including state or local requirements. Proposed regulations must be implemented within one year of enactment. The Secretary will promulgate proposed regulations within two years of enactment to allow for variations in serving sizes and food preparation due to human error and other factors. If the Secretary fails to finalize regulations within 2 years, proposed regulations will automatically become effective as final regulations, and the Secretary must publish a notice in the Federal Register. The final regulations require vending machine operators with 20 or more machines to provide a conspicuous sign for food items that cannot be examined before purchase. Vending machine operators must display a sign near the food item with the calorie count. They can also provide additional nutrition information voluntarily as long as it meets labeling requirements. The nutrition labeling requirements in this clause allow states to impose additional requirements on vending machine operators. The Secretary must propose regulations within a year of enactment to implement these requirements. The Secretary must promulgate final regulations within 2 years of enactment to implement the nutrition labeling requirements for vending machine operators. If the regulations are not issued by the required date, the proposed regulations will become effective. The final regulations for nutrition labeling requirements for vending machine operators must be promulgated by the Secretary within 2 years of enactment. If not issued by the required date, the proposed regulations will become effective. The Secretary will publish notice of the final regulations in the Federal Register."
