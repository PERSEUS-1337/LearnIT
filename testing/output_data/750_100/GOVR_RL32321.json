    "content": "After years of experience in peacekeeping and peacebuilding, analysts emphasize the importance of establishing a secure environment for sustainable peace. Instability in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Haiti has prompted Congress to explore effective security measures, with military forces playing a crucial role in initial security and maintaining law and order in peacekeeping operations. The use of international civilian police (CivPol) in peacekeeping operations has increased significantly over the past decade. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee recognizes the importance of United Nations peacekeeping operations in promoting stability in post-conflict environments. Policymakers are addressing issues with the use of international civilian police (CivPol) in post-conflict situations. Congress is considering improvements to the existing system and the development of new U.S. and international CivPol capabilities. Advocates propose facilitating recruitment and deployment of qualified personnel for complex missions and ensuring proper training for handling law enforcement situations. The proposals aim to enhance the training and skills needed for handling various law enforcement situations, emphasizing the importance of U.S. and U.N. reform efforts. Key documents, such as the Clinton Administration's PDD-71, have recommended mechanisms to improve existing CivPol systems. The Bush Administration has begun implementing some measures from the largely unimplemented PDD-71 directive. The United Nations has also started implementing recommendations from the Brahimi Panel report to address issues with the U.N. civilian police system. Other proposed reforms are still under discussion. Advocates recommend creating a reserve CivPol force, diversifying international police forces with units of police with military skills, and establishing more robust civilian response mechanisms. This report provides a brief synopsis of the evolution of international police in peacekeeping operations, highlighting problems encountered and discussing the gradual expansion of policing in U.N. and U.S.-led operations during the 1990s. (Appendix A and B offer additional details on these operations.) The report discusses the current mechanisms for providing CivPols to international operations, recommendations for improving those systems, and the status of their implementation. It also assesses various approaches to resolve problems and provides options for the U.S. Congress for continued improvements. The international community increasingly relies on CivPols for various functions in international peace. The number of international civilian police participating in U.N. operations has increased significantly, with 4,655 currently deployed as of February 29, 2004. This includes 476 Americans assisting with law enforcement tasks in eight U.N. peacekeeping missions. Additionally, nations like the United States provide bilateral assistance, especially training, to indigenous police forces in post-conflict situations. Some analysts recommend deploying international civilian police to Afghanistan, Iraq, and Haiti to assist in rebuilding indigenous police forces. U.S. assistance for law enforcement abroad is governed by Section 660 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, which prohibits aid for training, advising, or financial support, except in specific exempted cases. Section 660 of the Foreign Assistance Act prohibits aid for police, prisons, or law enforcement forces of foreign governments, except in exempted cases like post-conflict situations. Assistance in such cases is determined on a case-by-case basis due to lack of specific statutory authority. International civilian police forces have been utilized for various purposes since the late 19th century. International civilian police forces have been used since the late 19th century for monitoring, advising, training, and supporting human rights. In some cases, these forces are armed and given arrest powers. Policing in peacekeeping has involved joint patrols, restructuring local forces, and expelling undesirable members. During the past decade, policing in peacekeeping operations has evolved through five phases aimed at establishing security, involving expansion of U.N. activities and mandates, addition of training components, and building on previous experiences. Operations do not need to be modeled after the latest ones. The evolution of policing in peacekeeping operations has progressed through five phases, including the addition of training components and the development of mandates for substantial reform. This evolution has involved the creation of new institutions, specially constituted constabulary units for hostile situations, and expanded mandates for international police in various operations. The evolution of policing in peacekeeping operations has progressed through five phases, including the expansion of mandates to provide international police with \"executive authority\" to bear arms and make arrests. This evolution reflected the international community's growing awareness of security needs and types of assistance required by indigenous police forces in peace operations. As international interventions have expanded, ensuring public security is seen as a joint responsibility with indigenous personnel. Policymakers and analysts face challenges in clear mandates and effective implementation. Two key problem areas have been identified in improving peacekeeping mechanisms. The first problem area identified in improving peacekeeping mechanisms is a system gap related to recruitment and training deficiencies, particularly within the United Nations due to the diverse pool of volunteers with varying police standards and practices. The United Nations faces challenges in recruiting well-trained and professional policemen, some of whom lack basic skills and engage in corruption. Despite efforts to address these issues, additional training is needed to instill necessary policing skills for complex missions. The presence of three security gaps in establishing law and order in peacekeeping and post-conflict situations is a significant challenge. Deficiencies in recruitment and training systems can contribute to these gaps, especially in situations where not all parties are dedicated to peace or criminal networks are present. The deployment gap in establishing law and order in peacekeeping and post-conflict situations is a significant challenge, as seen in various international missions where police forces were unable to deploy quickly or in sufficient numbers. This was evident in interventions like Panama in 1989 and early 1990s missions in Cambodia, where delays in deployment hindered mandated tasks. In Somalia, it took nearly a year to deploy the first dozen UNCIVPOL. The deployment gap in peacekeeping missions is a challenge, with delays in deploying police forces and a lack of specialized skills. The enforcement gap also exists, where deployed police lack the necessary skills to ensure security for normal policing operations. The police deployed in peacekeeping missions often lack the necessary skills for handling hostile situations and organized crime, compromising the operations. The institution gap arises when the indigenous law enforcement system lacks sufficient honest and efficient judicial personnel. The indigenous law enforcement system lacks adequate personnel and resources for effective prosecution and punishment, hindering sustainable security. International police assistance has been provided post-Cold War, primarily by the United Nations. The United Nations, European countries, and the United States are key players in international police operations. The UN international civilian police system provides assistance through multilateral operations, with 4,655 UNCIVPOL officers from 65 nations serving in eight missions as of February 29, 2004. Jordan and the United States are the largest contributors, with over 100 countries providing officers. As of February 29, 2004, the United Nations international civilian police system had 4,655 UNCIVPOL officers from 65 nations serving in eight missions. The largest contributors were Jordan (553) and the United States (476), with other countries like India, Germany, Turkey, and Ukraine also providing officers. Kosovo had the largest UNCIVPOL mission with 3,508 officers, followed by missions in Liberia, East Timor, Sierra Leone, and other countries. Many nations also provided training and reform assistance individually or as part of multilateral efforts. During the early to mid-1990s, the United States provided police assistance in Somalia and Haiti under U.N. authority. The U.S. developed police training programs in Somalia through ICITAP. European Union member states like the UK, Germany, and France also contributed police assistance individually. In the past decade, countries like Sweden, Belgium, Netherlands, France, Spain, and Italy have been involved in police missions led by the OSCE and EU, often in conjunction with U.N. missions. For example, the OSCE has provided CivPols for police training in Kosovo and other countries, while the EU took over the police mission in Bosnia from the U.N. in 2003. In 2003, the EU took over the police mission in Bosnia from the United Nations and launched the PROXIMA mission in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. U.N. Member States contribute police personnel voluntarily for peacekeeping operations based on international standards for democratic community policing and human rights. The UNDPKO oversees peacekeeping operations, including civilian police missions, based on democratic community policing principles and human rights. The Civilian Police Division within UNDPKO is responsible for policy, planning, and management of civilian policing activities. The Civilian Police Division in the UNDPKO manages the recruitment, deployment, and rotation of international civilian police officers. Training is handled by the UNDPKO training unit. UNCIVPOL personnel in the field report to the UNCIVPOL Police Commissioner under the U.N. Secretary-General's Special Representative. The Brahimi Panel report addresses problems and proposed reforms in civilian policing missions. The Panel report identified issues with recruitment, training, and deployment of police personnel in U.N. peacekeeping. It recommended actions to improve rapid deployment of CivPols, including creating ready rosters and on-call lists for mission planning. Training was also highlighted as a key aspect for strengthening the U.N.'s capacity for effective police missions. Between March 1998 and mid-August 2000, the UNDPKO held conferences with police-contributing nations to address issues with recruitment, training, and deployment in U.N. policing operations. Donor countries reached consensus on proposals to improve these areas. The UNDPKO held conferences with police-contributing nations to address issues with recruitment, training, and deployment in U.N. policing operations. Some recommendations from the Brahimi Panel and UNDPKO seminar have been implemented, but significant problems remain with the UNCIVPOL system. Many analysts believe that significant issues persist with the UNCIVPOL system, particularly in recruitment, training, and deployment. Reforms recommended by the Brahimi Panel and UNDPKO seminars aim to address these problems, with some progress noted in operational and internal management reforms. Constraints on UNCIVPOL reform are also discussed. The Brahimi Panel and UNDPKO seminars recommended reforms for UNCIVPOL operations, emphasizing a new approach of reforming and restructuring local police with better-trained personnel. This doctrinal shift focused on integration and restructuring rather than monitoring and advising activities. The doctrinal shift in UNCIVPOL operations required law enforcement personnel to integrate with rule of law experts to strengthen institutions. This shift may strain U.N. Member States by demanding more specialized police experts. Some analysts see challenges in implementing this approach within the U.N. CivPol system. The primary role of UNCIVPOL personnel is seen as building local police services capacity, with concerns about infringing on national sovereignty. The United Nations is moving towards greater use of rule of law experts in peacekeeping operations through a new unit. Progress towards integrating rule of law-related efforts is noted by the Henry L. Stimson Center. The Henry L. Stimson Center's recent report criticizes the slow progress in integrating rule of law components in UN peacekeeping operations. The UNDPKO faced challenges in recruiting civilian police for rule of law operations, hindering its ability to deploy missions with a substantial criminal justice component. The United Nations faces challenges in recruiting police officers with necessary skills and experience for peacekeeping missions, leading to uneven results. Additionally, there is a lack of a comprehensive civilian police strategy, hindering the determination of mission needs. The United Nations struggles to recruit civilian police officers with required skills and experience for peacekeeping missions due to a lack of a comprehensive strategy. This hinders determining mission needs and recruiting suitable personnel. The United Nations faces challenges in recruiting civilian police officers for peacekeeping missions due to a lack of a comprehensive strategy. Requirements for police include minimum age of 25, 5 years of police service with community policing experience, proficiency in an official U.N. language, possession of a driver's license, ability to operate a four-wheel drive vehicle, and meeting medical standards. Firearms experience is required for executive authority missions. Some civilian police personnel may not meet basic selection criteria despite U.N. efforts to improve skills. The United Nations has faced challenges in recruiting civilian police officers for peacekeeping missions due to deficiencies in key criteria such as language, driving, and firearms skills. Selection Assistance Teams have been sent since 1996 to guide Member States in selecting police candidates, with a focus on basic requirements like language, driving, and firearms. Retraining and retesting of these requirements continue in missions, with high repatriation costs being a result of these deficiencies. Recruitment challenges for civilian police officers in UN peacekeeping missions include deficiencies in key skills like language, driving, and firearms. Specialized skills recruitment is even more difficult, with better success in recruiting for general skills. Advance recruitment of specialists is recommended to improve the quality of recruits. The Brahimi Panel Report recommended establishing a national \"ready roster\" of pre-selected CivPol personnel for quick deployment in UN peacekeeping missions. Success in implementing these recommendations has been mixed. The UNDPKO seminar recommended enhancing the UNSAS by creating an effective ready roster of international police personnel. Progress has been made in strengthening UNSAS for military, civilian police, and civilian personnel. The December 2003 evaluation of progress on the Brahimi recommendations highlighted the need for more national pools of candidates for international operations. It emphasized the importance of having qualified candidates with professional experience and familiarity with UN rules and procedures. The report also called for the UN to maintain an on-call list of 100 police officers and related experts for advance mission planning and early deployment. The UN established a 100-person on-call roster of civilian police personnel in February 2002 for advance mission planning. By March 2004, 10 Member States had nominated individuals for the roster, although they may not have been screened or trained for UN operations. Training exercises have been conducted to improve the efficiency of the on-call system, and recruitment efforts for specialists have been enhanced since spring 2003. Since spring 2003, SAT visits for recruitment of specialists now include substantive skills like management, planning, training, mentoring, criminal investigations, forensic analysis, and traffic control. Analysts have identified shortcomings in U.N. procedures that hinder recruitment efforts, including the lack of standardized criteria for determining the number of civilian police needed for missions. The audit criticized UNDPKO for not consistently matching skills to missions, leading to civilian police personnel performing non-policing functions in UNMIBH and UNMIK. Nearly 18 percent of civilian police in UNMIBH, UNMIK, and UNTAET were assigned to mission headquarters, with administrative functions accounting for eight percent of police officers. Mission-preparedness training varies among police-contributing Member States and can undermine the effectiveness of UNCIVPOL missions due to lack of uniform experience and standardized training. The effectiveness of UNCIVPOL missions can be undermined by the lack of standardized training for civilian police personnel. Member States are responsible for providing pre-deployment training, but officers may come from up to 40 countries with varying practices and doctrines. In-theater training is also conducted for UNCIVPOL personnel. UNCIVPOL personnel receive in-theater training covering standard procedures, safety, security, human rights, computer, and local language. Reasons for inadequate pre-deployment training include lack of experienced trainers, resources, and varying national programs. Recommendations from the Brahimi Panel and UNDPKO focus on developing regional partnerships for training. The Brahimi Panel and UNDPKO recommend developing regional partnerships for joint police training exercises in accordance with U.N. standard operating procedures. Efforts have been made to improve pre-deployment training by distributing training publications to assist Member States. UNDPKO has developed common training standards, including standardized \"generic training modules\" to ensure uniformity in the competence of deployed peacekeepers, including police. PDD-71 identified training as an area where the United States could contribute to enhancing the capabilities of other nations in CivPol operations. PDD-71 recognized the need for international organizations to supplement national training for coalition peace operations. The State Department's INL office was tasked with providing tailored training packages to U.S. and international CIVPOL when requested. Under a new State Department CivPol program, foreign police officers may train with the U.S. contingent if appropriate funding is available. Deployment of UNCIVPOL involves defining mission needs, recruiting personnel, and procuring equipment. The deployment times for UNCIVPOL missions historically range from six to eighteen months due to insufficient resources. The Brahimi Report identified reasons for the deployment lag, including the lack of a standing police force. Recommendations aimed to address the lack of a reserve corps of mission leadership, unreliable standby arrangements, and an insufficient supply of ready personnel and equipment. The Brahimi Panel recommended rapid deployment of peacekeeping missions within 30 days for traditional missions and within 90 days for complex emergencies after Security Council authorization. Mission headquarters should be operational within 15 days for complex emergencies. Uncertainty remains regarding the 30-90 day deployment timeframe for military and police. The Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations expressed uncertainty about meeting the 30-90 day rapid deployment timeframe for military and police personnel. Constraints include the U.N. system's capacity for concurrent missions, limited civilian standby expertise, and the need for contributing states to quickly deploy trained personnel. Some reforms are underway for the United Nations System for Standby. Some reform is underway for the United Nations System for Standby Arrangements (UNSAS) to enable rapid deployment in the future. The development of a 100-person on-call roster of civilian police personnel is also in progress. Equipment is being pre-packaged and stored at the U.N. Logistics Base in Brindisi, Italy for quick deployment at the start of new missions. However, there is no program in place to prepare UNCIVPOL for rapid deployment. The U.S. does not have a program to prepare UNCIVPOL for rapid deployment, unlike other countries with generic rapid deployment programs. The Department of State's Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs manages the U.S. CivPol program but lacks a national police force to draw from for police operations. The State Department recruits civilian police personnel from local law enforcement agencies through contractors like DynCorp International and Civilian Police International LLC. These companies maintain rosters of up to 2,000 prescreened personnel for missions. The State Department recruits civilian police personnel through contractors like DynCorp International and Civilian Police International LLC. A third contract was issued to a joint venture in March for deploying CivPol personnel. The program is funded through various State Department bureaus and officers receive a base salary of $50,000-100,000 depending on the mission. Officers participating in U.N. missions receive a subsistence allowance ranging from $75-95 per day, along with danger pay. The total cost of U.S. CivPol personnel varies by mission, with annual costs ranging from $100,000 in Kosovo to $150,000-$175,000 in Iraq. This covers salary, equipment, transportation, and morale support. The cost of providing support for U.N. missions in Iraq includes security, food, and housing expenses. The Congressional Budget Office estimated the incremental cost per troop for soldiers in Iraq ranged from $179,000 to $206,000, depending on rotation schedules and reserve component soldiers. As of March 27, 2004, 1,016 U.S. CivPol and support personnel were participating in international CivPol missions, with deployments in Kosovo, Liberia, East Timor, Sierra Leone, Afghanistan, and Iraq. As of March 27, 2004, the United States deployed personnel to Afghanistan (30/20) and Iraq (295/63) as unilateral contributions. Additionally, six police officers were provided to monitor high-profile prisoners in Israel. U.S. policymakers acknowledged challenges in recruiting and deploying qualified CivPol personnel, leading to the development of PDD-71 to enhance response capacities and operational activities for U.S. CivPol personnel. The U.S. CivPol program provides guidance on personnel recruitment, training, management, and deployment. Challenges include matching skills with mission requirements, training inconsistencies, and deployment delays. Despite ongoing improvements, analysts stress the need for further enhancements. The U.S. CivPol program has seen positive improvements in recent years, including the establishment of a reserve cadre of up to 2,000 law enforcement personnel for international police service. The Department of State issued contracts for recruitment, training, and deployment support to facilitate rapid deployment of qualified CivPols. The State Department issued contracts for recruitment, training, and deployment support for a new cadre of U.S. civilian police to streamline the process of contributing police to international CivPol operations. Multiple companies were awarded contracts for the program instead of one as originally planned. The State Department issued contracts to multiple companies for a cadre program to deploy U.S. civilian police for international CivPol operations. Questions arise about potential delays and costs due to increased competition and unclear RFP provisions. Recruitment for international police missions involves hiring officers from state and local law enforcement agencies, leading to concerns about drawing resources from already stretched forces. The recruitment of officers for international police missions strains already overextended municipal and state forces, exacerbated by call-ups of U.S. military reserve forces. Some analysts suggest that the current contracting system fails to attract high-quality recruits due to reluctance of police departments to allow valuable officers to take extended leaves. The United States could improve recruitment for international police missions by providing compensation to state and municipal governments for detailing police officers. This would require new legal arrangements as currently, there are no financial incentives for officers participating in such missions. Some argue that recruiting individual officers instead of formed police units has made the U.S. police contingent less cohesive, contributing to the varied mix within UNCIVPOL forces. Additionally, analysts suggest that the U.S. selection criteria may not accurately reflect the needs of international police missions. Some analysts argue that the U.S. selection criteria for civilian police candidates do not accurately reflect mission requirements. Criteria include U.S. citizenship, work experience as a sworn civilian law enforcement officer, an unblemished record, a valid driver's license, physical and psychological fitness, a U.S. passport, and English proficiency. The Department of State is improving recruitment for specialized skills by expanding qualification requirements for missions in Kosovo, East Timor, and Iraq. The new State Department CivPol cadre program aims to address the challenge of recruiting high-quality personnel. The bid solicitation document for the program indicates that nearly 55% of the total cadre will have specialized experience. The CivPol cadre program bid solicitation states that nearly 55% of the total cadre will be specialists with specific qualifications including interpersonal, leadership, training, negotiation skills, knowledge of international police standards, and experience in multicultural environments. Selected individuals will receive annual training in essential policing skills recognized in the United States to attract high-quality officers to join the program. The CivPol cadre program aims to attract high-quality officers by providing training for career advancement. Funding for training all members is uncertain due to varying skill levels among recruited officers. Some experts criticize the current U.S. CivPol program for inadequate training length and content. The pre-deployment training for U.S. police officers includes topics like United Nations operations, mission overview, team building, and human rights. The new State Department CivPol cadre program includes training in team building, lifestyle in the mission, human rights, contractor logistical support, personal safety, defensive tactics, use of police baton and aerosol subject restraint, driving, language, and firearms tests. The improved curriculum aims to meet Police Officer Standards and Training certification requirements and international principles of democratic policing and human rights. Ongoing training courses cover policing skills, specialized, and in-service training. The new training program for policing skills seeks recognition and certification from U.S. and foreign law enforcement organizations. It includes annual additional training and may have higher costs due to increased trainees and facilities. The U.S. CivPol contingent can deploy to a U.N. operation within 30-45 days following authorization. The United States fulfills the deployment requirement for U.N. operations within 30-45 days, but proposed legislation calls for deployment capability within 15 days. Analysts question if the U.S. can maintain this under the new CivPol cadre system. The contractor would maintain a database of commercial sources as detailed in the bid solicitation documents. The contractor would maintain a database of commercial sources for equipment on standby to decrease deployment time. A logistics support team would provide advanced support for the U.S. police contingent, potentially augmenting operational capabilities of the United Nations and regional organizations. It is unclear if these provisions still apply under the new system contracts and how deployments may be affected. European countries deploy police from their national forces to international CivPol operations, with the exception of the United Kingdom and the United States. European governments have recognized the need to reform their deployment systems to improve international CivPol capabilities since 1999. The EU has developed goals and procedures to enhance these capabilities. Since 1999, the EU has focused on improving European contributions to international police missions. At the Feira European Council in June 2000, Member States agreed to establish a 5,000 civilian reserve police force for peace operations by 2003, within the framework of the European Security and Defense Policy adopted in 1999. At the December 1999 Helsinki Summit, European heads of state adopted a Police Action Plan in June 2001, establishing guidelines for police selection, training, command, and control. The EU also created the Rapid Reaction Mechanism for flexible funding of civilian crisis management operations, with Member States committing up to 5,000 police officers for such operations as of late February 2004. Member States have committed up to 5,000 police officers for crisis management operations, with 1,400 available for rapid deployment within 30 days. They also pledged to provide 13 rapidly deployable police units and four headquarters units for missions. In November 2003, personnel from 22 European countries tested the interoperability of integrated police units in Italy. The EU launched its first ESDP mission in Bosnia and Hercegovia on January 1, 2003. The EU launched its first ESDP mission in Bosnia and Hercegovia on January 1, 2003, with almost 500 police officers and 70 civilian experts from 33 states. The mission aims to establish sustainable policing arrangements in BiH according to European and international best practices, with an annual budget of US $47.2 million. The EU launched its first ESDP mission in Bosnia and Hercegovia on January 1, 2003, with almost 500 police officers and 70 civilian experts from 33 states. The mission aims to establish sustainable policing arrangements in BiH according to European and international best practices, with an annual budget of US $47.2 million. The EU mission in Macedonia has an authorized strength of 200 police and civilian personnel, with a budget of US$18.6 million (15 million Euros). EU Member States have met their goal for police officer commitment and exceeded the goal for rapid deployment availability. However, some analysts doubt that the reformed EU crisis management and rapid reaction capabilities will significantly enhance the EU's response ability, citing concerns about Member States' willingness to relinquish national sovereignty for EU foreign policy coordination. The OSCE has 160 CivPols conducting policing activities in eight countries. The Rapid Expert Assistance and Cooperation Teams (REACT) program was created at the Istanbul Summit in 1999 to enable the OSCE to respond quickly to crises. The REACT program enables the OSCE to deploy experts in conflict prevention, crisis management, and post-conflict missions. It focuses on training and developing local police and establishing databases of qualified civilian experts in various areas to promote security. The REACT program, established in April 2001 by the OSCE, aims to deploy personnel for specific missions ranging from elections to economic stabilization within two to eight weeks. Steps have been taken to improve the program, including creating national websites for recruitment and providing mechanisms for applications via the OSCE website. Many OSCE participating States prefer not to nominate specific individuals for efficiency, legal, and privacy reasons. The OSCE developed a framework of standards for educational and experience requirements to identify necessary skills for its activities. A staffing matrix based on past and current field activities assists participating States in recruiting qualified candidates, including CivPols for advising, mentoring, and development functions through the REACT program. OSCE sets standards for CivPols, including graduation from police training school, active police experience, English communication, negotiation skills, mapping skills, and first aid. Desired skills include liaison experience with NGOs and ability to operate police radio equipment. Mission-specific requirements focus on specific skills. OSCE also recruits law enforcement administrators. In the 108th Congress, Members introduced three bills to strengthen U.S. and international capabilities for CivPol missions and rule of law missions. H.R. 1414 aims to enhance UNCIVPOL capabilities, H.R. 2616 addresses issues with U.S. CivPol capabilities and proposes creating NATO capabilities for post-conflict efforts, and S. 2127 aims to improve U.S. civilian response capabilities. S. 2127 aims to enhance U.S. civilian response capabilities for crises abroad, building upon prior international efforts. Analysts suggest options to address training deficiencies and improve constabulary functions. H.R. 1414 proposes significant reforms to make UNCIVPOL more deployable and effective. The bill proposes substantial reform to make UNCIVPOL more rapidly deployable and effective, including the establishment of a professional United Nations civilian police corps. It calls for negotiations within the United Nations and requests a report on the corps' establishment. The bill emphasizes the need for the corps to be available for rapid deployment to peace operations within 15 days. The bill proposes the establishment of a United Nations civilian police corps that should be available for rapid deployment to peace operations within 15 days of authorization. It emphasizes the need for law enforcement professionals who are trained and equipped for civilian policing functions. The bill proposes the establishment of a United Nations civilian police corps with appropriate resources for rapid deployment to peace operations. It aims to address deployment and enforcement gaps by improving training and standards for international civilian police. The bill proposes creating a professional U.N. police corps to address deployment and enforcement gaps in peace operations. It aims to reduce the need for combat soldiers in civilian police tasks and ensure quicker and more effective maintenance of a secure environment. The bill proposes establishing a professional U.N. police corps to enhance standards and skills of UNCIVPOL personnel. Opponents are concerned about the cost and sustainability of a standing corps funded through mandatory assessments. Many analysts express concerns about the sustainability and management capacity of a permanent UNCPC under the United Nations. There are fears that it could infringe on national sovereignty, although proponents of H.R. 1414 argue that the U.S. could veto its use. H.R. 2616 aims to improve U.S. and NATO capabilities for providing reconstruction assistance in post-conflict situations. H.R. 2616, the Winning the Peace Act of 2003, introduced by Representatives Farr, Wolf, Hoeffel, Leach, and Wexler on June 26, 2003, proposes the establishment of a U.S. civilian police reserve to provide security in post-conflict situations and upgrade the current U.S. CivPol system. This reserve would serve as an interim police force overseas and train indigenous civilian police. The Winning the Peace Act of 2003 proposes the establishment of a U.S. civilian police reserve to provide security in post-conflict situations and upgrade the current U.S. CivPol system. It suggests training and equipping indigenous civilian police forces and calls for a new NATO mechanism to provide military and policing services in reconstruction situations. The Winning the Peace Act of 2003 proposes establishing a U.S. civilian police reserve for security in post-conflict situations. It suggests NATO create an \"integrated security support component\" for training and equipping indigenous police forces. The bill authorizes the President to commit personnel capable of providing security for civilians, including acting as a police force. Tasks include controlling belligerent groups, crowd management, policing, investigations, anti-corruption, and intelligence support. The proposed legislation aims to establish a U.S. civilian police reserve to support international capabilities in post-conflict reconstruction by bridging deployment gaps and expediting the deployment of civilian police officers. The proposed legislation aims to establish a U.S. civilian police reserve to support international capabilities in post-conflict reconstruction by bridging deployment gaps and expediting the deployment of civilian police officers. It is unclear if the intention is to establish a civilian police reserve in line with the State Department's private sector model or a new U.S. government reserve force. Proponents of the private contractor model argue for its quick response time and avoidance of new government bureaucracies, while opponents raise concerns about limitations in military and policing operations. Contractors in military and policing operations may not exhibit the same dedication to their job in situations with unexpected changes in risk and job conditions. Opponents of a government-sponsored reserve suggest that a federal agency could deploy a reserve CivPol force as efficiently as a private contractor if civilian law enforcement personnel were maintained as paid reservists. Proponents argue that a government reserve is a more potent symbol of U.S. power. Proponents argue that a government reserve is a more potent symbol of U.S. commitment, more responsive to U.S. policy, and might prove a more cohesive force than a privately-contracted force. They also believe that a government agency could better guarantee the quality of recruits and draw qualified CivPol personnel from local and state police departments with a compensation system in place. Establishing a government-sponsored reserve force for departments providing personnel to federal service could be more feasible under a federal reserve model than a private contractor model. Pre-deployment training and coordination with military forces could make government-reservists more effective and reliable. The NATO constabulary capability could bridge enforcement gaps in post-conflict situations, but some question whether NATO is the right venue for policing functions. Critics argue that using military forces for policing may send inappropriate signals and duplicate efforts within NATO. Some critics argue that creating a reserve within NATO may duplicate EU structures and strain US-European relations. Analysts suggest additional provisions for equipment, training, and coordination with the military to avoid delays in deployment. The lack of standardized training for US or international reserves could perpetuate differences in policing styles. Critics argue that creating police reserves may draw upon existing resources, contribute to tensions with local governments, and duplicate EU structures within NATO. Concerns include the lack of standardized training and the need for joint training with military forces. Some critics question the commitment of U.S. police officers to these reserves. S. 2127, introduced by Senators Lugar and Biden, aims to strengthen civilian foreign affairs agencies' capabilities to respond to overseas crises by reorganizing government structures and providing funding for personnel. The bill introduced by Senators Lugar and Biden aims to create a Response Readiness Corps and Reserve roster with trained federal and non-government personnel to enhance the ability of civilian foreign affairs agencies to respond to overseas crises. 10% of State Department and USAID personnel would be designated and trained for this force within three years of enactment. The legislation introduced by Senators Lugar and Biden aims to create a Response Readiness Corps and Reserve roster with trained personnel to enhance civilian foreign affairs agencies' ability to respond to overseas crises. The bill does not specify the types of personnel to be recruited or the extent of expertise needed. Experts suggest that improved training and professionalization of CivPol personnel could help bridge the deployment gap. Some analysts argue that police training has not kept pace with the increasing scope of missions, leading to adjustments being made in the field. PDD-71 proposed maintaining the capacity for tailored training packages for CivPol when requested, with funding considerations. Increased police training is recommended by some, with a recent report suggesting a robust approach. Increased police training is desirable, with a recent report recommending a robust increase in funds. The State Department's proposal includes training foreign police personnel, pending funding availability. Strengthening international capability for constabulary forces is also suggested to address deployment and enforcement gaps. The enforcement gap can be addressed by strengthening existing international constabulary capabilities and creating new ones in nations that lack them. This includes incorporating a unit within NATO for constabulary functions. Constabulary police handle tasks requiring more force than routine law enforcement but less than combat, such as regulating movements for safety and intervening in civil violence. Constabulary forces are essential for handling hostile situations like lynchings, looting, riots, and civil disturbances. They are trained in both military and policing skills, making them valuable in post-conflict areas. They can deploy rapidly and often have their own communication and logistical support when on peacekeeping missions. Constabulary forces are crucial for handling hostile situations like lynchings, looting, riots, and civil disturbances. They can deploy rapidly as formed units and are trained in both military and policing skills. Specialized paramilitary units in other countries, such as the Italian carabinieri, French gendarmerie, and Spanish Guardia Civil, are considered appropriate for constabulary tasks in peacekeeping operations. Several analysts suggest that resources like the U.S. army should develop its own active duty constabulary force to support military police in peacekeeping operations due to high deployment rates. Army leaders are considering this option to address shortages in peacekeeping missions. Some reports suggest that Army analysts and policymakers are considering restructuring the service to facilitate peacekeeping operations. Army leaders have traditionally resisted this idea, arguing that focusing on primary warfighting missions strengthens the military force. However, with recent interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq, there is a debate on whether military forces should also focus on establishing conditions for durable peace. Many believe that Army forces should be adaptable and capable of performing security tasks in various conflict environments. Constabulary forces can serve as an intermediary security force for peace operations, handling violent situations beyond CivPol's capabilities. This can reduce reliance on combat soldiers for policing activities and shorten their withdrawal time from post-conflict situations. Despite potential advantages, analysts are unsure if other countries would be willing to enhance their constabulary forces. Some analysts suggest developing rapidly deployable units of law enforcement and rule of law personnel to address the institution gap in peace operations and ensure sustainable security. Other countries may be hesitant to augment their constabulary capabilities, similar to the United States' concerns about meeting domestic needs. Some analysts recommend creating rapidly deployable units of rule of law professionals, including judicial branch officials and prison personnel, to ensure sustainable security. The United States currently deploys personnel with justice and corrections experience through Department of Justice contracts funded by the State Department's INL CivPol program. The State Department's new CivPol cadre program aims to identify such personnel for deployment. Robert S. Perito, a special advisor at the USIP, advocates for creating a \"U.S. force for stability\" by integrating military and civilian personnel for timely deployment in post-conflict situations. Perito proposes a new approach to post-conflict intervention with a U.S. stability force consisting of military, civilian constabulary units, civilian police, and rule of law professionals. Deployment would be simultaneous to address security gaps and prevent impunity. Perito proposes a new approach to post-conflict intervention with a U.S. stability force consisting of military, civilian constabulary units, and civilian police to address security gaps and prevent impunity. Civilian personnel would take over law enforcement functions once security conditions permit, with the military shifting to providing perimeter security after major combat operations. Constabulary units, made up of military and civilian personnel, would be responsible for internal security and suppressing civil disorder. Perito proposes a new approach to post-conflict intervention with a U.S. stability force consisting of military, civilian constabulary units, and civilian police to address security gaps and prevent impunity. Civilian personnel would take over law enforcement functions once security conditions permit, with the military shifting to providing perimeter security after major combat operations. Justice experts complete the force package by ensuring the restoration of the rule of law, with the preponderance of personnel shifting from military to civilian over time. The military component cedes operational control over law enforcement functions to the civilian component, similar to the organization of NATO military and U.N. civilian security forces in Kosovo. Two recent reports provide related recommendations, including a November 2003 report of the National Defense University (NDU) recommending the concurrent deployment of civilian \"stabilization and\" efforts. The National Defense University (NDU) recommends deploying civilian personnel alongside combat forces to expedite the transfer of nation-building responsibilities. They suggest creating a standing interagency stabilization and reconstruction team and developing an \"on-call\" civilian crisis management corps. The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) proposes establishing an Agency for Stability Operations reporting directly to the Secretary of State. The Agency for Stability Operations, reporting to the Secretary of State, would manage a Civilian Stability Operations Corps of 200-300 U.S. government civilians trained for operations. Proponents argue for early deployment of rule of law personnel to enhance security. A proposed force structure would enhance security and stability in intervened or post-conflict countries, allowing for earlier military personnel withdrawal. Changes in U.S. practices would be needed, including developing constabulary capabilities and recruiting police personnel from a new federal agency. The proposed force structure aims to enhance security and stability in intervened or post-conflict countries by recruiting police personnel from a new federal agency instead of contractors. This change could be controversial and differs from the reserve model proposed in H.R. 2616. The proposed federal agency aims to recruit police personnel for rapid deployment in crisis countries, favoring federalization over private contractors. Deployment speed may vary depending on recruitment methods, with potential challenges in quickly deploying personnel hired through a lengthy federal process compared to a reserve or stand-by system. The availability of personnel for rapid deployment in crisis countries may depend on recruitment arrangements, with benefits similar to those of the U.S. military reserve component. Sources for information include Peacekeeping Fact Sheets from the U.N. Department of Peacekeeping Operations website, fact sheets on the EU Police, and OMIK information from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). Information on OMIK can be found on the OSCE website. Additional sources include books on peace operations and public security. The dispatch of international police units to advise and train local forces predates the First World War. European nations sent police units in the late 1800s to regions of the Ottoman Empire and Albania in 1913-1914. The first use of U.N. civilian police in a peacekeeping operation occurred in 1960 with the U.N. Operation in the Congo. In 1960, the U.N. Operation in the Congo deployed Ghanaian and Nigerian police contingents to assist the local police in maintaining order. The U.N. also utilized Philippine police officers in West New Guinea during the transition from Dutch to Indonesian rule. The U.N. Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) started in 1964 and introduced the term UNCIVPOL. The term UNCIVPOL was first used in the U.N. Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) in 1964. UNFICYP CivPols assisted Cypriot police in maintaining order and security in sensitive areas to diffuse tensions. Post-Cold War operations from 1989 to 1992 focused on monitoring local police performance in Namibia and Western Sahara. The UNCIVPOL missions, starting in 1991, focused on areas with well-trained police forces. The United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) in Namibia monitored the electoral process for independence. UNCIVPOL's role evolved to patrolling separately from local police and investigating complaints. UNTAG set the model for future missions in the early 1990s. In the early 1990s, UNTAG set three main tasks for monitoring missions: accompanying local police, investigating public complaints, and supervising police investigations. MINURSO was established in 1991 for a referendum in Southwest Sahara, but it has been delayed due to opposition by Morocco. Monitoring missions in Angola and Cambodia also took place during this time. In the 1990s, monitoring missions in Angola and Cambodia faced challenges in difficult situations with limited mandates. Additional functions were occasionally deemed necessary, and police monitors were deployed to new states created by the break-up of Yugoslavia. These missions were overwhelmed by escalating armed conflicts. The U.N. Transition Administration in Cambodia (UNTAC) faced challenges due to inadequate mandate and insufficient military forces. The focus of the UNTAC police unit shifted to investigating violations of political liberties and human rights. The U.N. Transition Administration in Cambodia (UNTAC) faced challenges with complaints of political liberties and human rights violations. The U.N. Secretary-General's representative granted arrest powers to CivPols in January 1993, but these actions were deemed too late to be effective. Deployment delays hindered the operation's performance, taking 10 months to reach full strength. The UNTAC mission in Cambodia faced challenges with deployment delays and inadequate police numbers, leading to a shift from ensuring law and order to monitoring elections. Training for Cambodian police and judiciary was recognized as necessary. Analysts recognized the need for training in the Cambodian police and judiciary due to limited resources. The lack of an independent judicial system created an \"institution gap\" that hindered justice. Suggestions were made for deploying integrated \"justice packages\" to address these challenges. The idea of deploying integrated \"justice packages\" of justice and penal officials, as well as police officers, was recognized as pivotal for police reform in El Salvador during the ONUSAL mission from 1992-1994. The international community provided unprecedented levels of assistance to put internal security forces under civilian control. The establishment of an international police force in El Salvador was a result of peace accords negotiated with the United Nations, ending a decade-long civil war. The accords called for dismantling military-controlled security forces and creating a new National Civilian Police force. ONUSAL provided UNCIVPOLs to cooperate in ensuring a smooth transition. In March 1992, ONUSAL was tasked with assisting police authorities during a two-year transition period in El Salvador. They oversaw the formation of a new police academy and force, with UNDP managing international contributions. The UNDP managed international contributions from Spain, Norway, Sweden, the United States, and Chile for the establishment of a new police force in El Salvador during a transition period. Despite encountering significant problems, the success of the police force was seen as crucial for the country's reconciliation and democratization processes. The success of the new police force in El Salvador was overshadowed by high crime rates and military interference. Subsequent missions, like the Mozambique civilian police operation, also had training and reform mandates. ONUMOZ provided technical support to the Mozambican police alongside monitoring efforts. The ONUMOZ mission in Mozambique provided technical support to the police force, but did not conduct training itself. International police support continued after the UN operations through bilateral training programs, notably by the Spanish Guardia Civil. Training was a key aspect of UN missions like UNAMIR in Rwanda. The U.N. Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR) had a mandate to provide assistance in Rwanda. In Somalia and Haiti, U.S.-led efforts were made to provide humanitarian assistance and restore order. UNITAF in Somalia established an Auxiliary Security Force despite lacking a specific mandate. The Auxiliary Security Force (ASF) in Somalia was established by UNITAF to enforce locally agreed-upon laws and be controlled by the community. It aimed to eliminate the need for UNITAF troops to serve as police, reducing confusion and friction with the local population. The ASF in Somalia was established by UNITAF to enforce locally agreed-upon laws and reduce friction with the local population. It aimed to create jobs, provide income, and enable Somalis to deal with criminal activity. UNITAF provided substantial assistance for the ASF. The ASF in Somalia received support from UNITAF, the United Nations, and individual nations through bilateral assistance. The UNDP paid salaries, provided equipment, and refurbished police stations. Italian, Dutch, and German police experts worked with the new force. UNITAF provided surplus vehicles and radios from Saudi Arabia. Military forces from Morocco, Botswana, and the UAE offered training, weapons, and conducted joint patrols. The World Food Program provided food. The ASF in Somalia, supported by UNITAF and the UN, received assistance from various nations. The UNDP paid salaries, provided equipment, and refurbished police stations. Military forces from Morocco, Botswana, and the UAE offered training, weapons, and conducted joint patrols. The World Food Program provided food rations for ASF members and their families. The UN announced plans to re-establish a 10,000 member Somali police force by the end of 1994. The U.N. efforts to reconstruct the Somali police, courts, and prisons faced challenges due to inadequate staffing and funding. It took time for UNCIVPOL members to arrive and cultural differences among them hindered program development. UNOSOM II military forces collaborated with the U.S. Justice Department's ICITAP to provide basic police training. The ICITAP program collaborated with UNCIVPOL to provide police training in Somalia, but the programs collapsed due to escalating violence and insecurity. UNITAF ASF achieved some success in offering protection to citizens, but its effectiveness was attributed to UNITAF's commitment to support it during times of uncontrollable violence. The need for police institution development and reform was recognized by the end of the 1990s. The Brahimi Panel Report recommended a shift in using civilian personnel in peace operations to build local police capacity. UNOSOM II's lack of commitment to support UNCIVPOLs led to the concept of an \"enforcement gap\" in Somalia and Haiti. Analysts identified a law enforcement gap in post-conflict situations like Somalia, where a strong police force may not be enough to control violence due to the lack of a peace accord. Military force may be necessary to maintain law and order, either as the primary force during high violence or as a supplement to police in lower levels of violence. The Somalia operation also faced other challenges according to analysts. The challenges in post-conflict situations include the ineffectiveness of international civilian police forces without a cease-fire, UNCIVPOL missions not being well-suited for training local police due to diverse experiences, and the institutional gap and lack of political settlement undermining police reform efforts in the long run. Similar gaps were seen in Haiti, highlighting the problems created by the institutional gap despite intensive police reform efforts. Reform efforts in Haiti began under the U.S.-led Multilateral Force (MFN, Sept 1994- March 1995) with the formation of the International Police Monitoring Force (IPM) to develop and train a new Haitian national police force. IPM members were authorized to carry arms, use force, and make arrests, similar to UNCIVPOL members. The UNCIVPOL under the subsequent U.N. Mission in Haiti took over monitoring and training functions from the MFN. Three U.N. follow-on missions were sent to Haiti over the next five years to professionalize the Haitian police. Analysts noted coordination between the military, MNF, and UNMIH civilian police to maintain public security while the HNP was trained and deployed. The United States adjusted MFN when IPMs were slow to deploy with sufficient strength and organization. The United States adjusted MFN rules to allow military forces to detain and shoot criminals in Haiti, while the interim public security force filled deployment gaps. MNF military police conducted patrols and provided training to IPMs on patrolling and the use of force. Unlike Somalia, Haiti experienced a smooth transition in security measures. In Haiti, the U.N. operation UNMIH facilitated a smooth transition from the U.S.-led MNF, providing backup to UNCIVPOL and military patrols to deter crime and violence. UNMIH also monitored HNP performance and supported the transition of UNCIVPOLs from law enforcement to mentoring roles. The institutional gap in Haiti hindered public security despite planners' efforts to compensate for deployment and enforcement gaps. In Bosnia, the United Nations had full responsibility for international police assistance from 1995-2002, focusing on monitoring and training. The United Nations was given the role of overseeing a joint government in Bosnia by the 1995 Dayton Accords to end the conflict. This was carried out through the International Police Task Force (IPTF) as part of the UN Mission to Bosnia and Hercegovina (UNMIBH), with responsibilities including monitoring, advising, training, and facilitating law enforcement activities. The European Union took over police monitoring and training in Bosnia in January 2003 through the EU Police Mission (EUPM), focusing on developing police institutional structure. The EU Police Mission (EUPM) took over police monitoring in Bosnia in 2003. The 1,721 unarmed IPTF CivPols lacked enforcement powers and struggled to maintain public order among hostile groups. Concerns about their effectiveness were raised during the Dayton negotiations. Several analysts highlight the early 1996 transfer of control of certain areas of Sarajevo as a test for the IPTF and IFOR. IFOR assisted the IPTF in organizing and deploying personnel during the relocation of residents. Despite only one death during the process, many dwellings were gutted, burned, and booby-trapped. The transfer of control of certain areas of Sarajevo in early 1996 tested the IPTF and IFOR. Despite IFOR assisting the IPTF in organizing and deploying personnel during the relocation of residents, many dwellings were gutted, burned, and booby-trapped, highlighting an \"enforcement gap\" due to lack of authority and resources. This led to a flight of Bosnian Serbs from Sarajevo suburbs, resulting in a perception of U.N. failure and loss of credibility for the understaffed and under-resourced IPTF. In late 1996, the smaller NATO Stabilization Force (SFOR) replaced IFOR under the Dayton Peace Accord, providing backup for the IPTF in maintaining public order. Specialized units within the IPTF, including paramilitary forces, were developed to handle exceptional law enforcement situations. Foreign paramilitary-like police units, such as the Gendarmarie from France and the Carabinieri from other nations, were also involved. In the late 1990s, foreign police units from France, Italy, and Spain were integrated into international CivPols to fill a gap between military capabilities and unarmed police monitors. The Multinational Specialized Unit (MSU) was formed in Bosnia in 1998 to protect elected officials and residents in hostile areas. The Multinational Specialized Unit (MSU) was formed in Bosnia in 1998 to protect officials and residents in hostile areas. This successful experience led to the formation of similar units in Kosovo and East Timor in 1999, granting them executive authority powers. After the coalition air war against Serbia, NATO and the United Nations took responsibility for stabilizing Kosovo and providing security through KFOR and UNMIK. OSCE oversaw and trained Kosovo under UNMIK structure. The OSCE oversaw and trained the Kosovo Police Service under the UNMIK structure. In East Timor, UNTAET provided civil administration during its transition to independence from Indonesia. The U.N. forces, along with the Australian-led military peacekeeping force INTERFET, were given executive authority in East Timor. However, many analysts believe that granting executive authority in such situations is problematic and not a wise choice. The availability of international civilian police personnel capable of responsibly exercising such authority is limited, making recruitment and deployment challenging. Recruiting and deploying police with executive authority in areas where local forces are unsuitable can be challenging. Sovereignty considerations also play a role in decision-making."
