Basic research and assistance from the NSF are essential for industry knowledge and workforce development. Information management is increasingly important with a projected 49 percent growth by 2010 in sectors related to biology. There is a lack of a systematic plan for designing and implementing information systems and tools for the workforce to transition to the information age. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\nDirector - Refers to the Director of the National Science Foundation.\nInformation - Refers to data in sectors where the Federal Government is involved and transitioning to digital data use.\nInstitution of higher education - Defined as per section 101 of the Higher Education Act of 1965.\n\nSEC. 4. NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION RESEARCH. The Director will award grants for basic research on innovative approaches to improve information systems, including information studies, population informatics, translational informatics, and data security. Grants will be awarded on a competitive basis. Authorization of appropriations for the National Science Foundation for fiscal years 2008 to 2011: $3,500,000 for 2008, $3,600,000 for 2009, $3,700,000 for 2010, and $3,800,000 for 2011. The Director will award multiyear grants to institutions of higher education for informatics research centers in consultation with other Federal agencies. The Centers for Informatics Research will receive grants for multidisciplinary research partnerships with government, for-profit, or nonprofit institutions. Grants will be awarded based on merit and competition to generate innovative approaches in information research. The Centers for Informatics Research will fund cutting-edge, multidisciplinary research projects through applications submitted by higher education institutions or consortia. The applications must detail the research projects and contributions of participating entities, as well as how the Center will promote active collaboration. The Centers for Informatics Research will fund research projects through applications from higher education institutions or consortia. The applications must detail participating entities, promote collaboration among professionals from different disciplines, and contribute to increasing the number of information researchers and professionals. Evaluation criteria will be used for submitted applications. The Director will evaluate applications for the Centers for Informatics Research based on the applicant's ability to innovate, conduct research, foster collaborations, and support students. The Director evaluates applications for Centers for Informatics Research based on innovation, research ability, collaboration fostering, and student support. The Centers should provide support for students pursuing information research and partner with government or for-profit/nonprofit entities for research. An annual meeting is convened to promote collaboration among Center participants. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorization of appropriations for the National Science Foundation for fiscal years 2008 to 2011: $4,500,000 for 2008, $4,600,000 for 2009, $4,700,000 for 2010, and $4,800,000 for 2011. SEC. 5. NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION INFORMATION PROGRAMS. Capacity Building Grants program will award grants to institutions of higher education to establish or improve undergraduate and master's degree information programs, increase student enrollment in information fields, provide students with industry or government experience, and utilize distance learning where possible. Grants awarded under this program will enhance higher education institutions' ability to provide quality information education, including certification and degree programs, and attract more students through curriculum development and distance learning. The grant aims to improve information education by developing curriculum, establishing degree programs, creating research opportunities for students, acquiring necessary equipment, and supporting faculty work. The grant supports faculty collaboration with government agencies, industry, and academic institutions to develop new expertise and research directions, establish student internships, and enhance programs. The grant supports nonprofit institutions in establishing bridge programs between community colleges and universities, along with other activities determined by the Director. Selection process requires submission of an application by institutions seeking funding. Nonprofit institutions seeking grant funding must submit an application to the Director, including a description of research capacity and roles in a consortium, along with a comprehensive implementation plan. The institution or consortium must provide a plan to build instructional capacity in information fields, describe collaborations with government or industry, and analyze student enrollment and placement data for the proposed program. The Director will award grants for the proposed program to a wide range of geographic areas and categories of institutions of higher education. The plan includes evaluating the success of the program through postgraduate assessment of graduate school and job placement rates, as well as the relevance of the instructional program to graduate study and the workplace. The Director will evaluate the program established under this subsection to assess the grants' impact on increasing the quality and quantity of students pursuing undergraduate or master's degrees in information fields. The assessment will be made publicly available. Authorization of appropriations for the National Science Foundation under the Scientific and Advanced Technology Act of 1992: \n- $9,000,000 for fiscal year 2008\n- $9,200,000 for fiscal year 2009\n- $9,400,000 for fiscal year 2010\n- $9,600,000 for fiscal year 2011. Grants will be provided for specific purposes outlined in the Act. The National Science Foundation is authorized to appropriate funds for improving education in information-related fields. The allocated amounts are $7,000,000 for 2008, $7,200,000 for 2009, $7,400,000 for 2010, and $7,600,000 for 2011. SEC. 6. REPORT ON STANDARDIZATION OF MEASURES RELATED TO DIGITAL INFORMATION. The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology will report to congressional committees on informatics efforts, standards harmonization, research, and support for executive orders on digitization. The report will include timetables for information standards promulgation and major challenges. The National Institute of Standards and Technology will report to congressional committees on informatics efforts, standards harmonization, research, and support for executive orders on digitization. The report will include timetables for information standards promulgation and major challenges in reaching these standards. Efforts should be taken to ensure digital information usability by scientists and researchers, along with actions to ensure robust and timely standards."
