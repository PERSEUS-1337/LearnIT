    "content": "The report analyzes forest management provisions in the 115th Congress, comparing them with prior laws. Two legislative acts, the Wildfire Suppression Funding Act and the 2018 farm bill, address forest management from three perspectives. The report analyzes forest management provisions in the 115th Congress, focusing on federal forest management through three perspectives: management of forested federal land, federal programs for forest management on nonfederal lands, and forestry research programs. It primarily examines provisions related to the management of forested federal land by the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management. The Forest Service manages 193 million acres of the National Forest System. The report provides an overview of the National Forest System (NFS) and Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) public lands, along with key laws such as the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and Healthy Forests Restoration Act (HFRA). It analyzes provisions enacted by the 115th Congress that impact forest management activities and procedural requirements for FS and BLM. The report analyzes provisions enacted by the 115th Congress related to project planning, wildland fire management, forest management, and restoration programs. It discusses potential issues for Congress and includes side-by-side tables in the Appendix. The report analyzes provisions enacted by the 115th Congress related to project planning, wildland fire management, forest management, and restoration programs. Approximately 145 million acres of the 193-million-acre National Forest System consists of forests and woodlands. Congress directed that management of the national forests shall be to protect watersheds and forests and provide a \"continuous supply of timber for the use and necessities of citizens of the United States\" and authorized the sale of \"dead, matured, or large growth of trees.\" Congress added recreation, livestock grazing, energy and mineral development, and protection of wildlife and fish. The Appendix contains side-by-side tables comparing all of the forest-related provisions in each law to prior law. The Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960 added recreation, livestock grazing, energy and mineral development, and protection of wildlife and fish habitat as official uses of national forests. The National Forest Management Act of 1976 requires coordination for multiple use and sustained yield of resources without impairing land productivity. The National Forest Management Act of 1976 (NFMA) mandates the preparation of comprehensive land and resource management plans for each National Forest System (NFS) unit with public involvement. These plans must comply with cross-cutting laws such as NEPA, Endangered Species Act (ESA), and National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). Each forest plan outlines desired resource conditions but does not grant authorization. The forest plan outlines desired resource conditions for the NFS unit but does not authorize specific on-the-ground projects. Projects such as timber harvests, watershed restoration, and trail maintenance must align with the resource objectives in the forest plan and follow FS procedures to ensure compliance with applicable requirements like NEPA, ESA, and NHPA. Timing and scope of project review may vary based on statutory authority. BLM manages 246 million acres of public lands, including 38 million acres of woodlands and forests, under the principles of multiple use and sustained yield. The 2.6 million acres of Oregon and California Railroad Lands and Coos Bay Wagon Road Lands are also under BLM's management. The 2.6 million acres of Oregon and California Railroad (O&C) Lands and Coos Bay Wagon Road (CBWR) Lands in western Oregon are managed for permanent forest production, protecting watersheds, providing recreational opportunities, and supporting local economies under sustained yield principles. BLM is directed to prepare and maintain resource management plans for these lands, ensuring on-the-ground activities align with the plans. BLM's projects must align with resource management plans for Oregon and California Railroad Lands. Compliance with federal laws like NEPA, ESA, and NHPA is required, with NEPA necessitating environmental impact assessment for proposed actions. Impacts determine the need for an environmental impact statement or assessment. The agency may prepare an environmental assessment (EA) to determine if an EIS is needed or a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) can be issued. The analysis in the EIS or EA/FONSI informs the agency's decision-making process for proposed actions. Categorical exclusions (CEs) cover actions that do not have significant impacts. Categorical exclusions (CEs) are actions that do not have a significant effect on the environment and are excluded from preparing an EIS or an EA. These CEs are identified based on past experience and some are established by Congress. Individual agencies may determine additional documentation needed for a CE. The FS distinguishes between actions that require no further documentation and those that need a decision memorandum. In their agency-specific procedures implementing NEPA, federal agencies identify actions authorized for approval that require an EIS, EA resulting in a FONSI, or can be approved using a CE. FS and BLM regulations identify resource conditions where an excluded action may have a significant environmental effect, requiring further analysis in an EA or EIS, known as extraordinary circumstances. The presence of flood plains, municipal watersheds, endangered species or their habitat, wilderness areas, inventoried roadless areas, and archaeological sites are considered extraordinary circumstances that may prevent the use of a CE for a project. NEPA's process helps identify environmental impacts and requirements for a project, serving as an umbrella compliance process for agencies. NEPA serves as an umbrella compliance process, identifying project impacts that may trigger additional environmental review requirements under other laws. Compliance with NEPA waived for a category of action would not exempt requirements triggered by impacts under other federal laws. HFRA aims to expedite planning for hazardous fuel reduction and forest restoration projects on NFS and BLM lands. The Hazardous Fuel Reduction Act (HFRA) aims to expedite planning for projects on NFS and BLM lands by reducing biomass availability to prevent catastrophic wildfires. HFRA authorizes an expedited planning process for projects covering up to 20 million acres of federal land. It defines terms like At-Risk Community for areas with interface communities. Authorized Hazardous Fuels Reduction Projects (HFRA Projects) involve methods such as prescribed fire, wildland fire use, and mechanical methods to reduce hazardous fuels in areas prone to large-scale wildland fire disturbances, posing a significant threat to human life and property. These projects target interface communities or groups of homes with basic infrastructure and services within or near federal land. Fire regimes and condition classes are terms used to describe changes in historical fire patterns across a landscape. They help prioritize hazardous fuel reduction projects, especially in the Wildland-Urban Interface areas near at-risk communities. HFRA projects target at-risk communities without a CWPP and specific characteristics like steep slopes. Projects are conducted in the WUI, municipal watersheds with departure from historical fire regimes, wind-, ice-, insect-, or disease-damaged land, or areas with threatened species habitat. Excluded are designated wilderness areas or areas prohibiting vegetation removal by law. Projects must align with land and resource goals. HFRA projects must align with land and resource management plans and focus on thinning, prescribed fire, or removing small-diameter trees to modify fire behavior. Large or old-growth tree retention is encouraged for fire resiliency. FS established an objection process for proposed HFRA projects, requiring objections to be filed within 30 days of publication. HFRA mandates objections to be filed within 30 days of the agency's publication of draft decision documents related to the proposed project. Objections are limited to parties who submitted specific comments during the comment periods. If no comments were received, no objections will be accepted. Judicial review in federal court is the next step if the objector remains unsatisfied after the administrative review process. The judicial review in federal court is the next step after the administrative review process. Congress directed FS to replace the post-decisional administrative appeals process with the pre-decisional objection process for all FS projects. Differences exist between HFRA and non-HFRA projects, but they both fall under the same pre-decisional objection process. The Agricultural Act of 2014 added a new Section 602 to HFRA, allowing for the establishment of landscape-scale insect and disease treatment areas within the NFS. These areas are designated by the Chief of the Forest Service in response to declining forest health or risk of substantial tree mortality. Non-HFRA projects can be declared emergencies and implemented directly after a decision document is published. The Forest Service has designated approximately 74.5 million acres nationwide as areas at risk of tree mortality or with hazard trees posing a safety risk. Projects initiated before the end of FY2018 in these designated areas are considered hazardous fuel reduction projects and subject to HFRA's objections process. Projects planned within areas at risk of tree mortality or with hazard trees must go through HFRA's objections process, involve collaboration with government and interested parties, use the best available science, and prioritize retention of old-growth and large trees for insect and disease resilience. Projects in the Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) require analysis of the proposed action and one alternative, unless within 1.5 miles of an at-risk community, in which case only the proposed action is analyzed. Congress authorized the Forest Service to identify eligible NFS areas for designation as I&D areas, prioritize projects, and implement them through an expedited process. FS has proposed 206 projects in 59 national forests and 18 states as of March 2019. In some states, all eligible lands were designated, making prioritization benefits ineffective. Projects across 59 national forests and 18 states have been proposed under authorities granted by the 2014 farm bill, with 20 projects evaluated using EA analysis procedures and three using an EIS. The remaining 183 projects are being processed using a CE, with hazardous fuels projects added as a priority category eligible for implementation through the CE by the 2018 farm bill. The 2014 Farm Bill designates projects for implementation through a Categorical Exclusion (CE), exempt from administrative review objections. To qualify, projects must meet CFLRP eligibility or follow best available science, retain old-growth trees, and involve a transparent collaborative process. Projects under the 2014 Farm Bill must be developed collaboratively, transparently, and meet specific requirements. They cannot create new permanent roads, but temporary roads must be removed within three years. Projects are limited to 3,000 acres and must be located in designated areas. Maintenance of existing roads is allowed. The decision on proposals is documented using the Farm Bill CE process. The FS policy is to document decisions on proposals using the Farm Bill CE process after assessing resource conditions for extraordinary circumstances. The FY2018 omnibus and 2018 farm bill expanded HFRA authorities, including the definition of authorized fuel reduction projects to include fuel and fire breaks. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized the use of procedures to expedite priority projects in I&D areas, including projects to reduce hazardous fuels as a priority project category. This allows for the planning and implementation of fuel or fire breaks using the Farm Bill CE process. The 2018 farm bill allows hazardous fuels reduction projects in I&D areas using the Farm Bill CE. The bill also established a new statutory NEPA CE and made changes to interagency consultation requirements under the ESA. New statutory CEs were created to expedite specific projects, such as wildfire resilience projects for FS. The 2018 farm bill established a CE for projects related to greater sage grouse or mule deer habitat, available to both FS and BLM. The potential impact of these new CEs on project planning and forest management goals is uncertain. The statutory CEs allow for larger projects (up to 3,000 to 4,500 acres) to be planned through a CE, which could help achieve landscape-level goals. The 2018 farm bill established a CE for projects related to greater sage grouse or mule deer habitat, available to both FS and BLM. Some argue that larger project sizes with a CE can help FS achieve landscape-level goals more efficiently and speed up project implementation. A 2014 GAO report found that FS took less time to complete CEs compared to EAs, but used CEs less frequently before the Farm Bill CE was authorized. The Farm Bill CE authorized by Congress allows for landscape-scale projects, but concerns exist about potential resource effects. The FY2018 omnibus added a Wildfire Resilience CE for hazardous fuel reduction projects on NFS lands, similar to the Farm Bill CE. Projects must be in designated areas and documented through a decision memo. The Farm Bill CE allows for landscape-scale projects on NFS lands, with a decision memo required to determine extraordinary circumstances. Eligible projects must comply with CFLRP requirements or focus on retaining old-growth trees for resiliency. No new permanent roads are allowed, and temporary roads must be decommissioned within three years. Projects under the Farm Bill CE on NFS lands must comply with CFLRP requirements or focus on retaining old-growth trees for resiliency. No new permanent roads are allowed, and temporary roads must be decommissioned within three years of project completion. Projects cannot exceed 3,000 acres and must be located within I&D areas. Priority is given to projects in the WUI, but projects outside the WUI are allowed in areas with high wildfire hazard potential. The Secretary must submit an annual report on the use of CEs to specified committees and GAO. The Wildfire Resilience CE, like the 2014 Farm Bill CE, requires projects to be located within designated I&D areas and in specified fire regime condition classes. However, the Wildfire Resilience CE also specifies projects should be in areas with very high wildfire hazard potential. Seven projects were proposed using the Wildfire Resilience CE authority in FY2018. The Wildfire Resilience CE prioritizes projects in areas with very high wildfire hazard potential, unlike the Farm Bill CE. It is available for hazardous fuels reduction projects and requires evaluation of extraordinary circumstances. The Farm Bill CE requires assessment of extraordinary circumstances for projects to protect sage-grouse and mule-deer habitat on NFS and BLM lands. Section 8611 of the 2018 farm bill directs the establishment of this CE within one year of enactment, with specific requirements for its application. The Farm Bill CE specifies requirements for projects to protect, restore, or improve habitat in a sagebrush steppe ecosystem for mule deer and sage-grouse. Activities may include removal of nonnative vegetation, targeted grazing, and herbicide use. Projects must comply with existing resource management plans and DOI Secretarial Order 3336, and cannot occur in designated wilderness areas. Projects under the Farm Bill CE must adhere to legal requirements, including restrictions on location and size. They cannot take place in designated wilderness areas or involve new permanent roads. Temporary roads must be removed within three years of project completion. Projects on NFS lands are limited to designated I&D areas. Agencies must consider extraordinary circumstances and project efficacy when determining CE use. The CE under the Farm Bill directs agencies to consider habitat projects' efficacy, population declines, and habitat restoration. It requires a 20-year monitoring plan and differs from other CEs in project purposes and requirements. The Endangered Species Act aims to conserve endangered species and their ecosystems. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) aims to conserve species at risk of extinction and their ecosystems. Administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service, it lists species as endangered or threatened based on extinction risk assessments. Once listed, species face prohibitions, but federal agencies can seek exemptions under certain circumstances. Federal agencies must ensure that their actions do not harm endangered or threatened species or their critical habitat. They must consult with FWS or NMFS if their actions may negatively impact a listed species. This consultation, known as Section 7 consultation, is not required for actions dictated by statute, only for discretionary actions. The Secretary issues a biological opinion (BiOp) specifying terms for federal actions to avoid harm to species. If proposed actions jeopardize species or habitat, alternatives must be suggested. Most consultations result in \"no jeopardy\" opinions. The FY2018 omnibus enacted changes to Section 7 consultation requirements for land and resources management plans in Oregon. Listing a species as threatened or endangered does not require consultation for updating forest plans. The FY2018 omnibus made changes to Section 7 consultation requirements for forest plans in Oregon, allowing for updates without consultation if the plan is older than 15 years and 5 years have passed since listing a species. This has sparked controversy as some believe it sets a new precedent for implementing the Endangered Species Act. The FY2018 omnibus made changes to Section 7 consultation requirements for forest plans in Oregon, allowing for updates without consultation if the plan is older than 15 years and 5 years have passed since listing a species. This has sparked controversy as some believe it sets a new precedent for implementing the Endangered Species Act. In response, the enacted changes require FS to conduct re-consultation on its land management plans after critical habitat was designated for the Canada lynx. Proponents argue that this will provide more flexibility in plan implementation and reduce delays, while opponents argue against the lack of consultation for existing plans. Critics argue that not allowing consultation or re-consultation for changes in listing species and critical habitat could harm species and their habitat. Proponents claim that projects under a plan still require consultation, making plan consultation redundant. However, critics argue that plans address activities at a higher level and could impact the cumulative habitat. The federal government's wildland fire management responsibilities, primarily handled by FS and DOI, include various activities such as fuel reduction, prevention, detection, and suppression. Recent legislative changes in funding allocation and reporting requirements have impacted wildfire suppression efforts. The federal government's wildland fire management responsibilities, primarily handled by FS and DOI, include activities such as fuel reduction, prevention, detection, and suppression. Recent legislative changes in funding allocation and reporting requirements have impacted wildfire suppression efforts, including changes in FS and DOI's hazardous fuel reduction programs. Congress provides discretionary appropriations for wildland fire management to both agencies through the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. Funding for DOI is allocated to the department for distribution to the Office. Funding for wildland fire management is provided to the Department of the Interior (DOI), which then distributes it to the Office of Wildland Fire and four agencies. The funding supports the Suppression Operations program for controlling wildfires on federal land, covering firefighter salaries, equipment, aviation operations, incident support, and post-wildfire response programs. If the suppression funding is depleted, DOI and the Forest Service (FS) can transfer funds. Overall, funding for wildland fire management has increased significantly since the 1990s, with a notable portion going towards rising suppression costs. The Forest Service and Department of the Interior often require more suppression funds than allocated, leading to \"fire borrowing\" from other accounts. This practice raises concerns that increased suppression spending may negatively impact other areas. The 115th Congress addressed concerns about fire borrowing by establishing a new mechanism for wildfire suppression funding outside of traditional budgetary controls. In response to concerns about fire borrowing, the 115th Congress established the wildfire funding fix in the FY2018 omnibus bill to provide suppression funding outside of traditional budget limits set by the Budget Control Act of 2011. If discretionary spending exceeds the limits, sequestration may be enforced through automatic budget cuts. Certain spending is exempt from these limits under Section 251(b) of the Balanced Budget. The FY2018 omnibus bill amended the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act to exempt wildfire suppression operations from discretionary spending limits, starting in FY2020 through FY2027. The FY2018 omnibus bill exempted wildfire suppression operations from discretionary spending limits starting in FY2020 through FY2027. A new adjustment would apply to appropriations above the 10-year average spending level for wildfire suppression operations as calculated for FY2015. This adjustment would be capped and any additional funding appropriated would be considered outside the limits. The adjustment for wildfire suppression operations is capped each fiscal year, starting at $2.25 billion in FY2020 and increasing to $2.95 billion in FY2027. Congress can appropriate funds above the FY2015 baseline of $1.39 billion for suppression operations without being subject to discretionary spending limits established in the BCA for FY2020 and FY2021. The BCA discretionary limits allow for up to $3.64 billion in total appropriations in FY2020, with an additional $2.25 billion potentially available outside of the limits. In comparison, FS and DOI received $2.05 billion for suppression in FY2019 and an average of $2.16 billion annually over the past 5 years. The wildfire funding fix could ease budget process barriers for additional suppression funds. The wildfire funding fix removes budget process barriers for providing additional wildfire suppression funds for FY2020 and FY2021. If new limits are established for FY2022 through FY2027, the wildfire adjustment would still apply. It is uncertain if Congress will continue to provide fire borrowing authority once the wildfire adjustment takes effect in FY2020. The wildfire funding fix allows the Secretary, in consultation with OMB, to request supplemental appropriations from Congress if wildfire suppression funds are estimated to be exhausted within 30 days. This provision raises concerns for Congress regarding the need for additional funding to ensure continued federal services in response to wildfires. The FY2020 suppression obligation is now tied to the FY2015 baseline, raising concerns about accountability and oversight. The funding fix is a temporary change for funding suppression operations and does not address other concerns like cost forecasting and effectiveness evaluation. The Fire Modeling Institute developed a Wildfire Hazard Potential index to aid in strategic planning and fuel management decisions at a national scale. This index reflects the potential for a wildfire to occur that would be difficult to suppress or contain, covering approximately 226 million acres in the continental United States. The Fire Modeling Institute created a Wildfire Hazard Potential index for strategic planning and fuel management decisions on approximately 226 million acres in the continental United States. This index identifies high or very high WHP areas, with 53% on federal lands and 47% on state, tribal, other public, or private lands. The data, when combined with spatial data, can estimate relative wildfire risk to resources and assets. The FY2018 omnibus directs FS to pair the Wildfire Hazard Potential index with spatial data for community use, consulting with partners to develop web-based wildfire hazard severity maps for at-risk communities adjacent to NFS lands. Reports to Congress on wildland fire management are required by both the FY2018 omnibus and the 2018 farm bill. The FY2018 omnibus mandates annual reports from the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior on wildfire funding use, with the first report due by December 30, 2021. Reports must be prepared in consultation with the OMB Director, made public, and submitted to specific House and Senate committees. The report mandated by the FY2018 omnibus must document the use of wildfire funding, analyze wildland fire management spending, identify risk-based factors in suppression management decisions, and analyze a statistically significant sample of large fires. The 2018 farm bill requires a report on wildfire prevention, insect infestation, and disease control on federal land to be submitted to Congress annually. The report must address the effectiveness of fuel treatments, impact of preparedness investments, and be submitted to specific committees within 180 days of the bill's enactment. The farm bill mandates an annual report on wildfire prevention, insect infestation, and disease control on federal land. The report includes data on acres treated, fire risk levels, wildfire impact, federal response time, timber production, road and trail maintenance needs, and other measures for land maintenance and improvement. Forest restoration activities on federal land aim to enhance ecosystem resilience and resistance to disturbances like insect infestations or wildfires. This may involve thinning trees to reduce density and mitigate spread of pests. Forest restoration projects on federal land, authorized by BLM and FS, aim to mitigate insect infestations and wildfires through actions like prescribed fires and vegetation management. The Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974, as amended by NFMA, mandates forest conditions to benefit plant and animal communities. Congress has authorized various forest restoration programs for FS and BLM, including watershed condition framework, water source protection, Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program, stewardship contracting authority, and good neighbor authority. The Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management have various forest restoration programs, including stewardship contracting and good neighbor authority. These programs allow partnerships with stakeholders to address land management concerns and accelerate forest restoration to mitigate insect infestations and wildfires. Title IV of the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009 established the CFLRP to fund collaboratively developed restoration proposals for priority forest landscapes, aiming to mitigate wildfires and provide benefits to surrounding communities. Stakeholders generally support these programs, although some have raised concerns about specific aspects. Title IV of the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009 created the CFLRP to fund collaborative restoration proposals for priority forest landscapes. Proposals must be inclusive, transparent, and based on the best available science. Priority landscapes must be at least 50,000 acres of NFS lands in need of restoration, accessible to wood-processing infrastructure, and may include other federal, state, tribal, or private land. The CFLRP funds collaborative restoration proposals for priority forest landscapes, based on the best available science. Proposals must include projects for old-growth stand maintenance, hazardous fuel reduction, and no new permanent roads. The Secretary of Agriculture can select and fund up to 10 proposals per fiscal year, with 23 proposals currently funded. Annual accomplishments reports and 5-year status reports are required by law. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP) funds selected proposals for forest restoration goals. Each proposal can receive up to $4 million per year for 10 years from a fund established by law. The program has funded 23 proposals since FY2010, with a limit of 10 proposals per fiscal year. The CFLRP program received $40 million annually in appropriations from FY2014 through FY2019. It is perceived as successful in achieving land management objectives, contributing to local economies, and fostering collaboration. The dedicated funding commitment provides long-term stability for project implementation, but some may argue it directs resources away from NFS lands not covered by selected projects. The CFLRP program provides economic benefits but falls short in fostering new markets for smaller-scale wood products or reducing treatment costs. It is perceived as improving relationships with community stakeholders and fostering collaboration, although some collaboration has focused on simple issues rather than resolving complex ones. Section 8629 of the 2018 farm bill reauthorized the program with up to $80 million in annual appropriations through FY2023. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized the CFLRP program with up to $80 million in annual appropriations through FY2023. The law allows for a one-time waiver to extend funding commitment to existing projects for up to 10 years, with the House and Senate Committees on Agriculture receiving program status reports. The funding commitment for 23 selected proposals is set to expire in FY2019, but reauthorization and extension of eligibility could allow some projects to continue beyond that timeframe. If Congress appropriates to the new authorization level, more projects could benefit. The 2014 farm bill authorized FS and BLM to enter into good neighbor agreements (GNAs) with state governments for restoration work on NFS and BLM public lands, including treating trees, reducing fuels, and improving land health. The 2014 farm bill authorized FS and BLM to enter into agreements with states for restoration work on public lands, including activities like timber removal and tree planting. Treatments were prohibited in certain areas, and the authorization did not cover road construction or specify revenue treatment from wood product sales. States may perform the work, but FS and BLM must comply with federal laws. The Master Agreement (MA) between states and FS or BLM outlines the scope of the Good Neighbor Authority (GNA), with Supplemental Project Agreements (SPAs) detailing specific project terms. FS has executed 48 MAs and 105 SPAs in multiple states, covering 82 national forests, allowing for various authorized activities with a primary focus on specific tasks. The Good Neighbor Authority (GNA) allows for various authorized activities with a primary focus on specific project types such as timber production, wildlife, hazardous fuels management, and others. It is perceived as successful in enhancing state-federal relationships and performing cross boundary restoration work, although funding and resource capacity varied across participating states. Some states have concerns about the uncertainty of sustained future GNA work. The FY2018 omnibus and 2018 farm bill expanded the Good Neighbor Authority (GNA) to include road activities on NFS roads and involvement of Indian tribes and county governments. Funds from timber sales under GNA can be used for additional projects until FY2023. The expansion of the Good Neighbor Authority (GNA) to tribes and county governments has the potential to increase its use significantly, leading to more opportunities for cross-boundary restoration work and leveraging nonfederal resources. However, this expansion may also increase administrative demands on agencies like FS or BLM. The Good Neighbor Authority (GNA) allows FS and BLM to enter into multi-year contracts for land management goals. It was established in 1999 and made permanent in 2014. Some may prefer revenue-sharing with county governments from GNA projects. The Good Neighbor Authority (GNA) allows FS and BLM to enter into multi-year contracts for land management goals, including combining timber sale contracts with service contracts to achieve specified objectives like improving water quality and forest maintenance. The Good Neighbor Authority allows FS and BLM to enter into multi-year contracts for land management goals, including improving water quality, forest health, reducing fire hazards, increasing soil productivity, restoring watersheds, fish and wildlife, and native plant species. Excess timber sale revenue can be deposited into a Stewardship Contracting Fund for use on other stewardship projects without further appropriation. Contracts can be awarded on a best-value basis, considering past performance, proposal quality, and other factors in addition to cost. Stewardship contracting allows FS and BLM to give procurement preference for contractors using wood products innovatively. Annual reports on contract development and accomplishments are required. Stakeholders view stewardship contracting favorably, citing increased restoration opportunities and economic benefits. Some concerns regarding the development of new markets for woody biomass and restoration by-products include the need for more market support, potential incentives to remove ecologically important trees, distribution of receipts from stewardship contracts, upfront financial obligations, and slow implementation pace. The initial implementation of stewardship contracting faced challenges due to integrating different contract types and poor record-keeping. Agencies improved systems, increased contracts annually, and covered larger areas. However, a 2015 USDA OIG report highlighted issues with FS' contract administration and record-keeping for stewardship contracts. The FY2018 omnibus authorized FS and BLM to enter into 20-year stewardship contracts in fire-prone areas, with a procurement preference for innovative forest product use by contractors. The law authorized FS and BLM to include a cancellation ceiling in stewardship contracts, allowing funds to be obligated in stages. Excess revenues can be used to pay for liabilities from cancelled contracts. Congressional notification is required for contracts with a cancellation ceiling over $25 million without proposed funding for cancellation costs. Ceiling provision in stewardship contracts allows funds to be obligated in stages, resolving concerns about up-front financial obligations. Use of excess revenue to offset costs and 20-year contracts may increase market certainty for forest products industries. Unclear if expanded time-frame has drawbacks. Protection of watersheds is an authorized use of the NFS. The NFS has authorized the protection of watersheds as a key goal. In a 2006 assessment report, OMB highlighted deficiencies in FS's watershed programs, including lack of water quality data and inconsistent national approach. FS committed to improving by developing outcome-based performance measures, enhancing data collection, and prioritizing watershed management on NFS lands. The Forest Service developed a Watershed Condition Framework to prioritize watershed management on NFS lands. However, a 2017 USDA OIG report found inadequacies in the management and implementation of the program. The 2018 farm bill codified the Watershed Condition Framework program for NFS land, assigning specific responsibilities and priorities to the Secretary of Agriculture. The program aims to evaluate and classify watershed conditions, including water quality, aquatic habitat, vegetation, and soil condition. The 2018 farm bill established the Watershed Condition Framework program for NFS land, focusing on evaluating and classifying watershed conditions such as water quality, aquatic habitat, vegetation, and soil condition. The program allows for the identification of priority watersheds for protection and restoration, with the possibility of developing restoration action plans and emergency designations for rehabilitation after significant wildfire impact. Post-fire stabilization activities have not fully restored the watershed to its proper function. Watershed protection, including water source protection, is an authorized use of the NFS. The Secretary of Agriculture can enter into cooperative agreements for watershed restoration with various entities, sharing costs if deemed in the public interest. The government can share costs with nonfederal partners for watershed restoration and enhancement purposes on NFS lands. The 2018 farm bill amended HFRA to establish a Water Source Protection program on NFS land, allowing FS to enter into multi-year water source investment partnership agreements with nonfederal partners. This aims to protect and restore NFS watersheds serving as sources of municipal water. The Forest Service can develop a water source management plan for watershed protection and restoration projects, including forest management activities to protect water supplies and restore forest health. They can conduct a single environmental analysis for the plan or each project. The law allows the Forest Service to accept cash, donations, and assistance from partners to implement the plan. The National Forest Foundation implements a water source management plan with partner donations matching federal funding. Congress authorized $10 million annually to the Water Source Protection Fund through FY2023. Various provisions in the FY2018 omnibus and 2018 farm bill relate to federal forest land, including designating NFS lands as part of the National Wilderness Preservation System. Other provisions cover land acquisition, special use authorizations, and Secure Rural Schools Act payments. The 2018 farm bill designated new wilderness areas and expanded existing ones on NFS lands in Tennessee, including the establishment of the Upper Bald River Wilderness covering 9,038 acres. Additional acres were added to existing wilderness areas on the Cherokee National Forest. The 2018 farm bill designated new wilderness areas on NFS lands in Tennessee, including Upper Bald River Wilderness (9,038 acres) and additions to existing wilderness areas like Mountain (966 acres) and Sampson Mountain (2,922 acres). The areas are managed according to the Wilderness Act, prohibiting most commercial activities and motorized access. The bill also introduced provisions for FS and/or BLM to acquire, exchange, or dispose of federal land, including a new program authorizing the Secretary of Agriculture to lease isolated parcels for administrative purposes. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized programs for leasing isolated parcels for administrative purposes, selling or exchanging BLM lands for disposal, and acquiring lands for administrative use. The Forest Service Facility Realignment and Enhancement program was reauthorized for FY2019 through FY2023, allowing the conveyance of administrative sites or undeveloped parcels of NFS land. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized the Forest Service Facility Realignment and Enhancement program for FY2019 through FY2023, expanding eligibility requirements and authorizing exchanges or sales for specific parcels and entities. The bill also authorized the issuance of rights-of-way for BLM and NFS lands by the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture. The Forest Service Facility Realignment and Enhancement program was reauthorized by the 2018 farm bill for FY2019 through FY2023, allowing exchanges or sales for specific parcels and entities. The bill also authorized the issuance of rights-of-way for BLM and NFS lands by the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture, allowing various purposes such as water infrastructure, electricity generation, communication systems, and transportation facilities on federal lands. The Forest Service and BLM charge fees for processing applications and monitoring activities related to communication systems, transportation infrastructure, and other necessary facilities on federal lands. Fees are based on estimated hours and land value. The Forest Service and BLM charge fees for processing applications and monitoring activities for communication systems and other facilities on federal lands. The 115th Congress directed FS and BLM to update their fee schedules for special use authorizations and regulations for activities within electricity ROWs and utility ROWs. Some concerns relate to wildfire ignitions in electricity transmission ROWs due to weather conditions causing vegetation to contact power lines. Administrative processes may hinder permit-holders from conducting necessary maintenance activities to mitigate fire risks on federal lands within their ROWs. Responsibility for fire prevention is debated among stakeholders. The 115th Congress provisions aim to improve processes for right-of-way (ROW) permit holders to conduct vegetation management projects on federal lands. Concerns exist regarding the balance between expediting project implementation and maintaining accountability. Some provisions specify responsibilities for wildfire suppression costs and place a cap on liability costs for ROW permit holders. Some are concerned with provisions limiting damages and liability for wildfires ignited within ROWs on federal lands. Others believe it will incentivize prompt agency action on maintenance requests from ROW permit holders and reflect that utilities should not bear full wildfire costs due to past agency actions contributing to increased fuel levels. The 2018 farm bill directed the Secretary of Agriculture to issue regulations for special use authorizations on NFS lands, streamlining the process and ensuring competitive and technology-neutral considerations. The 2018 farm bill directed the Secretary of Agriculture to issue regulations for special use authorizations on NFS lands, ensuring competitive and technology-neutral considerations. Regulations must establish a fee structure based on processing costs, with fees deposited into a Treasury account for managing communication sites. Activities include needs assessments, programmatic analyses, management plans, and access improvements. The FY2018 omnibus amended FLPMA to establish new guidelines for vegetation management, facility inspections, and maintenance on federal land with electric transmission facilities. The law directed FS and BLM to issue guidance for planning and implementing these activities within ROWs, outlining specific requirements for the processes. The guidance must detail the review, approval, and modification of plans for vegetation management. FS and BLM review, approve, and modify plans for vegetation management, facility inspections, and maintenance activities submitted by ROW permit holders. Owners can develop and submit plans for approval and conduct activities within their ROW with an approved plan. Certain management activities can be conducted without approval in specific circumstances. FS and BLM must identify NEPA categorical exclusions. The law directs FS and BLM to propose and finalize regulations within specified timeframes for vegetation management activities in ROWs. It also encourages the development of training programs for employees on vegetation management and the electrical system. The FY2018 omnibus specifies ROW permit holder liabilities related to vegetation management activities. The law limits liability for damages to $500,000 for ROW holders under certain conditions. FS and BLM must report on the impacts of these liability clauses to Congress within four years. A pilot program for utility ROW permit holders on NFS land was established through FY2023. The law established a pilot program for utility ROW permit holders on NFS land, allowing them to develop vegetation management plans and perform projects within their ROWs with FS approval. Participants must follow FS and state regulations for fire prevention and vegetation removal activities on NFS lands. The pilot program for utility ROW permit holders on NFS land allows them to conduct fire prevention and vegetation removal activities. Participants are responsible for project costs, with the option for FS to contribute funds. FS must be reimbursed for wildfire suppression costs if caused by participant operations. The pilot program for utility ROW permit holders on NFS land allows them to conduct fire prevention and vegetation removal activities. If a wildfire is caused by the participant's operations, they must reimburse FS for suppression costs, with a limit of $500,000 in certain cases. The FY2018 omnibus program for electricity ROWs differs from the NFS pilot program. The FY2018 omnibus program and the FS pilot program under the 2018 farm bill pertain to electricity ROWs and other infrastructure on NFS lands. The farm bill pilot includes natural gas and limits participant responsibilities to wildfire and vegetation management. Counties with NFS, O&C, and CBWR lands receive payments based on revenue generated, with SRS offering an optional payment system as an alternative. The SRS payments were based on a formula considering historic revenue payments, land acreage, and counties' per capita income. Payments were allocated among three categories for funding education, roads, projects on lands, and specified county programs like fire prevention and emergency services. Title II of the law established Resource Advisory Committees (RACs) to improve collaborative relationships and provide advice to agencies. RACs must consist of 15 members representing various interests, including outdoor recreation, timber industry, environmental organizations, and local elected officials. The authorized payment level for Secure Rural Schools (SRS) payments was set at 95% of the previous year's payment level. The Secure Rural Schools (SRS) payments were originally authorized to be at 95% of the previous year's level and were extended multiple times until FY2016. After FY2016, counties received lower revenue-sharing payments. The FY2018 omnibus reauthorized SRS payments for FY2017 and FY2018. The FY2018 omnibus reauthorized SRS payments for FY2017 and FY2018, with changes in payment allocation requirements and expanded uses for Title III funds. Counties received a full SRS payment for FY2017 in two installments, including added law enforcement patrols, training, and equipment costs. The 2018 farm bill made changes to the SRS statute, including modifications to RAC membership requirements and the establishment of a pilot program for the Secretary to appoint RAC members in Montana and Arizona. These changes were in response to concerns that the previous requirements for RACs were prohibitive. The Tribal Forest Protection Act (TFPA) allows the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior to work with federally recognized Indian tribes on forest or rangeland projects. The projects can be on Indian trust or restricted lands, as well as NFS and BLM lands adjacent to tribal lands. The Secretary evaluates requests based on a \"best value basis\" and considers unique features or circumstances of the tribe. The TFPA allows the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior to collaborate with federally recognized Indian tribes on forest or rangeland projects. The evaluation of tribe requests is based on a \"best value basis\" and considers unique tribal factors. The ISDEAA authorizes tribes to enter self-determination contracts with the federal government for operating specific federal Indian programs. The 2018 farm bill extended the good neighbor authority to tribes and authorized self-determination contracts with tribes on a demonstration basis. The TFPA allows collaboration with tribes on forest projects. Self-determination contracts can be made with tribes for administrative functions. Congress may oversee implementation of new forestry laws. The Forest Service has identified millions of acres of NFS lands at high risk, needing restoration treatments. It would take 9-29 years to eliminate the backlog at the current pace. The Forest Service aims to increase forest management projects and restoration treatments to address hazardous fuel accumulation. Administrative process barriers, including decision-making processes and challenges under the National Environmental Policy Act, hinder progress towards restoration goals. The Forest Service faces administrative barriers, including challenges under the National Environmental Policy Act, hindering progress towards restoration goals. Some stakeholders believe these barriers, such as inadequate funding and training, prevent efficient project planning implementation. Provisions enacted by the 115th Congress aim to improve agency efficiencies. The Forest Service aims to improve agency efficiencies by expanding procedures to expedite planning and review processes for projects like hazardous fuel reduction and forest restoration. Some believe that using Healthy Forests Restoration Act authorities and NEPA Categorical Exclusions would speed up project implementation. However, concerns exist about changes to decision-making processes and the legal framework for federal forest management. The legal framework for federal forest management is being changed by the use of Categorical Exclusions (CEs), making it harder for citizens to participate. Stakeholders fear that expanding these authorities could worsen environmental impacts. Concerns about forest health and high fuel levels have been ongoing for decades, highlighted after wildfires in Yellowstone National Park in 1988. In 1994, the National Commission on Wildfire Disasters recommended investing more in reducing hazardous fuels in high-risk ecosystems. Management agencies are urged to invest more in reducing hazardous fuels in high-risk ecosystems. The focus is on the inevitability of disastrous wildfires and their costs. Recommendations have been made to increase hazardous fuel treatments and develop strategies to mitigate wildfire risk. Concerns have been raised about the effectiveness of hazardous fuels reduction programs and the need for better guidance and controls. The Forest Service has ongoing issues with prioritizing, tracking, and reporting on hazardous fuels reduction projects. Congressional reports have highlighted challenges with administrative and judicial obstacles impeding fuel management project implementation, with a significant percentage of decisions being appealed. The Forest Service faces challenges with implementing hazardous fuels reduction projects, with 20% of projects from FY2006 to FY2008 being challenged. Academic studies show that project complexity and other factors like staffing and public involvement affect the likelihood of challenges. Despite provisions in the HFRA to expedite projects, obstacles persist. The Forest Service continues to face challenges in implementing hazardous fuels reduction projects despite provisions in the HFRA to expedite project implementation. Some believe the current approach has not been successful, while others suggest a broader application of the HFRA approach. Comparisons of forest-related provisions in recent legislation highlight the need for increased pace of project implementation.
