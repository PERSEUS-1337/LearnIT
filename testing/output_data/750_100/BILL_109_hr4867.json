    "content": "The \"Puerto Rico Democracy Act of 2006\" establishes a federally sanctioned process for Puerto Rico's self-determination, including an initial plebiscite and subsequent procedures. It also addresses applicable laws, requirements, and the availability of funds for the self-determination process. The Congress acknowledges previous actions by Presidents Bush and Clinton regarding Puerto Rico's political status through memorandums and executive orders. President George W. Bush adopted Executive Order 13183, amending it on December 3, 2003, to require the President's Task Force on Puerto Rico's Status to issue reports every two years on progress towards determining Puerto Rico's ultimate status. The Task Force appointed by President George W. Bush recommended a federally sanctioned plebiscite in Puerto Rico to vote on remaining a US territory or pursuing a nonterritorial status. If the latter is chosen, a subsequent plebiscite should be provided by Congress. The Task Force appointed by President George W. Bush recommended a federally sanctioned plebiscite in Puerto Rico to vote on remaining a US territory or pursuing a nonterritorial status. If the latter is chosen, a subsequent plebiscite should be provided for the people of Puerto Rico to choose between the two permanent nonterritorial status options. Congress is encouraged to begin a transition process once a majority choice is made. If Puerto Rico elects to remain a US territory, periodic plebiscites should occur to keep Congress informed of the people's wishes. The Task Force recommended a federally sanctioned plebiscite in Puerto Rico for self-determination, including an initial vote and subsequent procedures. The Puerto Rico State Elections Commission will conduct a plebiscite in Puerto Rico to choose between continuing the existing territorial status or pursuing a path towards a permanent nonterritorial status. The Puerto Rico State Elections Commission will conduct plebiscites every 8 years if majority vote favors continued territorial status. If a majority vote in a plebiscite favors permanent nonterritorial status, the Puerto Rico State Elections Commission will conduct another plebiscite with the option to choose between statehood or remaining a territory. The ballot in Puerto Rico presents two options for its political status: becoming a state on equal footing with other states or becoming a sovereign nation either fully independent or in free association with the United States. Voters must choose one option, as ballots with multiple choices will not be counted. If a majority vote in a plebiscite favors permanent nonterritorial status, another plebiscite must be held within a specific timeframe. SEC. 4. APPLICABLE LAWS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS. The Federal laws applicable to the election of the Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico also apply to any plebiscite held under this Act. Federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over legal claims related to this Act. The Puerto Rico State Elections Commission will issue necessary rules and regulations. The Puerto Rico State Elections Commission will issue rules and regulations for plebiscites under this Act. Eligibility to vote includes all eligible voters under Puerto Rico's electoral laws and US citizens born in Puerto Rico who meet Commission requirements. Persons eligible to vote can request an absentee ballot for plebiscites. The Puerto Rico State Elections Commission certifies plebiscite results to the President and Congress. The President's Task Force on Puerto Rico's Status must submit a report to Congress within 6 months of the second plebiscite. The President's Task Force on Puerto Rico's Status, in consultation with key officials, will submit a report to Congress detailing measures to implement the chosen nonterritorial status option from the plebiscite, along with recommendations. SEC. 5. AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS FOR THE SELF-DETERMINATION PROCESS. During the period from October 1, 2006, until all plebiscites required by this Act are completed, the Secretary of the Treasury can allocate up to $5,000,000 from funds provided to Puerto Rico for election expenses, including voter education materials approved by the President's Task Force on Puerto Rico's Status. The President's Task Force on Puerto Rico's Status may identify necessary amounts for laws and policies of the United States."
