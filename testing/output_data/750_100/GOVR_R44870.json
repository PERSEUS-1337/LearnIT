    "content": "Many governments recognize the international risks posed by environmental degradation and climate change, leading to the negotiation of international agreements to protect the environment and promote sustainable growth. Efforts by wealthier countries alone are deemed insufficient, with lower-income countries also needing to take measures to address these issues. International financial assistance is crucial for lower-income countries to address global environmental problems, as they lack resources and expertise. The UNFCCC, ratified by the United States in 1992, is a key treaty addressing human-driven climate change. The UNFCCC, ratified by the United States in 1992, requires higher-income Parties to provide new financial resources to help developing countries comply with their obligations. The US has delivered on these commitments over the years. The United States has provided financial and technical assistance for climate change activities in developing countries through various bilateral and multilateral programs. This assistance has been delivered through agencies such as the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Department of State, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the Export-Import Bank, and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. Additionally, contributions have been made to environmental funds at international financial institutions and organizations. The United States has provided financial and technical assistance for climate change activities in developing countries through various bilateral and multilateral programs. This assistance has been delivered through agencies such as the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Department of State, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the Export-Import Bank, and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. Contributions have also been made to environmental funds at international financial institutions and organizations like the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the Green Climate Fund (GCF), and the World Bank's Climate Investment Funds. The UNFCCC establishes a financial mechanism to provide funds to developing country Parties. The GEF, established in 1991, operates as the financial mechanism for international environmental agreements like the UNFCCC. The relationship between the UNFCCC and the GEF is outlined in a memorandum of understanding. The US has committed to six GEF resource replenishments, providing significant funding over the years. In 2002, 2006, 2010, and 2014, the US committed a total of $2.732 billion to the GEF, representing 13% of the institution's total funding. US disbursements since 1994 amount to approximately $2.2 billion. The COP adopted elements of the Copenhagen Accord in the Cancun Agreements, including Fast start financing by developed country Parties. The agreement commits developed countries to provide around $30 billion for climate finance from 2010-2012 and aims to mobilize $100 billion annually by 2020. Funding sources can be public, private, bilateral, multilateral, or alternative. The Paris Agreement (PA) adopted in 2015 brings all nations into a common framework to combat climate change and support developing countries. Developed countries, including the United States, are obligated to provide financial support for climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. The agreement encourages all Parties to provide funding from various sources, including public, private, bilateral, multilateral, and alternative sources. The Paris Agreement (PA) urges all Parties to provide financial support voluntarily, regardless of economic status. Developed countries are expected to lead in mobilizing climate finance from various sources, aiming for a progression beyond previous efforts. The COP Decision reaffirms the $100 billion annual pledge by developed countries until 2025. The Parties agree to set a new collective quantified goal for mobilizing financial resources of at least $100 billion annually to assist developing country Parties by 2025. President Trump announced his intention to withdraw from the PA in 2017, with the process to be completed by November 4, 2020. The GCF was designated as an operating entity of the UNFCCC's financial mechanism following the 2009 Copenhagen Accord. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) was designed during the 2011 COP in Durban, South Africa to assist developing countries combat climate change through grants and concessional financing. It operates independently from the UNFCCC with its own board, trustee, and secretariat, accountable to the Conference of Parties. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) provides grants and concessional financing to help developing countries combat climate change. It was capitalized by financial inputs from developed country Parties and became operational in 2014. Approximately $10.3 billion has been pledged for the fund, with the Obama Administration pledging $3 billion over four years. The U.S. Department of State made two contributions of $500 million each in 2016 and 2017 from the Economic Support Fund. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget request aims to eliminate U.S. funding for the Green Climate Fund (GCF) in alignment with President Trump's promise to cease payments to the fund. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget request aims to eliminate U.S. funding for the Green Climate Fund (GCF) in alignment with President Trump's promise to cease payments to the United Nations' climate change programs. President Trump has criticized the GCF, stating it would redistribute wealth out of the United States. Despite the U.S. disbursing $1 billion to the GCF under the Obama Administration, the U.S. remains a member of the GCF board for now. The Trump Administration has not confirmed if it will retain its board membership. The future of U.S. engagement with the Green Climate Fund (GCF) is uncertain as the State Department has not confirmed if it will retain its board membership. The GCF is not directly tied to the UNFCCC 2020 pledges for climate finance commitments. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) is just one of many public and multilateral sources for climate finance. While it may contribute to the $100 billion goal, other sources like development bank instruments, carbon markets, and private capital are also crucial. Bilateral aid will not be affected by the GCF. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) is a multilateral mechanism for climate change assistance that would exist alongside bilateral activities. The GCF would not interfere with bilateral climate change assistance to developing countries. The GCF board will determine its complementarity with other U.N. multilateral mechanisms, potentially altering future multilateral aid choices provided by the UNFCCC. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) may impact future multilateral aid choices under the UNFCCC. U.S. allocations for multilateral assistance would still be guided by Congress. Table 1 shows donor Parties to the GCF and their pledges. Withdrawal from the PA could have positive and negative effects on the United States' climate change programs. The United States' climate change programs may be impacted by nations' climate change programs, with potential benefits including fiscal savings from providing climate finance. Concerns exist regarding bureaucratic inefficiencies and misuse of funds in international financial assistance. Reductions in international financial assistance could impact climate change mitigation efforts in lower-income countries by redirecting funds to other priorities, including sustaining markets for GHG-intensive fuels and technologies. Some stakeholders argue that U.S. withdrawal from climate change commitments under the PA could redefine U.S. international relations and highlight issues of sovereignty and national interest. The U.S. withdrawal from climate change commitments under the PA could redefine international relations, focusing on sovereignty, national interest, and economic control. Potential repercussions include investment efficiencies and higher costs of future climate-related catastrophes. Developing countries may find economic efficiencies in adopting new technologies rather than retrofitting existing ones. Reducing international financial assistance could impact climate change mitigation efforts in lower-income countries. Reductions in international financial assistance could worsen economic inefficiencies and increase vulnerability to climate change impacts in lower-income countries, affecting both their interests and those of the United States. The provision of climate finance, particularly adaptation assistance, is seen as crucial for addressing humanitarian and security concerns, as highlighted by the U.S. Central Command's report on the potential consequences of global climate change. Climate finance in developing countries may benefit U.S. businesses supporting low-emissions technologies, while reductions in international financial assistance could restrict global economic activity, including U.S. exports. Financial commitments under the PA allow the U.S. to increase global environmental leadership and influence international economic and environmental policies. The United States' withdrawal from the Paris Agreement may impact its global influence on economic and environmental policies. While it would release the U.S. from specific obligations, it would not exempt it from general commitments under the UNFCCC to provide financial resources to developing countries. The Administration has not clarified its intentions regarding these commitments. The Trump Administration's withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and cessation of U.S. payments to UN climate change programs could have minimal impacts if other investments compensate. However, it may erode international efforts to help developing countries confront climate change by 2020. The U.S. Congress determines contributions to developing countries for climate change-related activities, authorizing programs, appropriations, and providing guidance. Congressional committees overseeing international climate change assistance include the U.S. House of Representatives Committees on Foreign Affairs, Financial Services, and Appropriations. The U.S. Congress oversees international climate change assistance through committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate."
