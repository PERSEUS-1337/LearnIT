    "content": "The Act titled \"Pulmonary Hypertension Research Act of 2003\" is cited as the short title. The findings section follows. The Congress finds that Federal investment in pulmonary hypertension research must be expanded to find a cure or effective treatment. Primary pulmonary hypertension is a rare, chronic, and historically incurable lung disorder with a poor survival rate. In the United States, about 300 new cases of PPH are diagnosed each year, with the majority in women aged 21-40. PPH can affect people of all ages and ethnicities equally, making it challenging to study. PPH is a rare disease that is challenging to study due to the lack of a good animal model. In about 6 to 10 percent of cases, PPH is familial. In advanced stages, patients have minimal activity and symptoms even at rest, possibly leading to complete bedriddenness. PPH is difficult to diagnose and can be mistaken for other heart and lung conditions. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute established the first PPH-patient registry in 1981, following 194 people with PPH for up to 7.5 years. Research is focused on immunologic and genetic factors in the cause and progression of PPH, as well as agents that narrow pulmonary blood vessels. During 1996-1997, 6,000,000 Americans took anorexic drugs, leading to PPH in some. Many cases of PPH from diet drugs are expected to be diagnosed in the future. Secondary pulmonary hypertension (SPH) has known causes such as breathing issues. Secondary pulmonary hypertension (SPH) has various causes including emphysema, bronchitis, inflammatory diseases like scleroderma, CREST syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), congenital heart defects, chronic pulmonary thromboembolism, HIV infection, liver disease, and certain diet drugs. The text discusses the expansion, intensification, and coordination of activities of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute regarding research on pulmonary hypertension. The Director of the Institute will expand, intensify, and coordinate research activities on pulmonary hypertension. Coordination with other national research institutes and agencies of the National Institutes of Health will be done to align efforts related to pulmonary hypertension. Additionally, Centers of Excellence will be established. The Director of the Institute will establish Centers of Excellence for research on pulmonary hypertension, providing grants or contracts to public or nonprofit entities. These centers will conduct basic and clinical research on the cause, diagnosis, and early detection of pulmonary hypertension. The Centers of Excellence for research on pulmonary hypertension will focus on cause, diagnosis, early detection, prevention, control, and treatment of the disease. They will also provide training programs for scientists and health professionals, offer continuing education to health professionals, and disseminate information to the public. Stipends may be provided for the training of health professionals. The Centers of Excellence for research on pulmonary hypertension will provide stipends for scientists and health professionals enrolled in training programs. The Director will coordinate information among centers, ensure regular communication, and may require reports on center activities. The Director will establish not less than three centers for research on pulmonary hypertension, using facilities of a single institution or a consortium of institutions. Each center may receive support for up to 5 years, with possible extensions. The Director may extend support for research centers on pulmonary hypertension for up to 5 years based on peer review recommendations. A data system will be established for collecting and analyzing data from patient populations with pulmonary hypertension. The Director of the Institute will establish an information clearinghouse to disseminate knowledge about pulmonary hypertension to health professionals, patients, industry, and the public. Public input will be provided on existing and planned programs and activities. The Director of the Institute will establish an information clearinghouse for pulmonary hypertension. Biennial reports on activities will be prepared, and up to $25,000,000 may be appropriated annually for this purpose. The Director of the Institute will establish an information clearinghouse for pulmonary hypertension, with annual appropriations of up to $25,000,000 for the fiscal years 2004 through 2008."
