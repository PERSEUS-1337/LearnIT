    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Math and Science Incentive Act of 2005\". Congress acknowledges the importance of a strong scientific and technical enterprise for the future prosperity of the United States. It emphasizes the need to produce more scientists and engineers by encouraging students to study science and mathematics and pursue related careers. The current performance of U.S. students in these fields is below international standards, highlighting the urgency of addressing this issue. The United States needs to recommit to leadership in science, mathematics, and engineering, including nanotechnology. Loan forgiveness programs can attract students to careers in these fields and help maintain technological leadership. Establishment of program. The Secretary will implement a program to cover interest payments on loans for eligible undergraduate students who have applied in accordance with the Act. Undergraduate students who are new borrowers and teachers of STEM subjects can qualify for a program that covers interest payments on loans if they agree to work in their field for 5 years. The program covers interest payments on loans for participants who agree to work in their field for 5 years, with limitations on interest payments prior to the repayment period or agreement signing. Participants are selected based on specific criteria. The program under this Act selects participants based on national security, homeland security, and economic security needs of the United States, in consultation with various Federal agencies. The program selects participants based on national security needs in consultation with Federal agencies. Eligible applicants are chosen based on academic or job performance, likelihood to complete service obligation, and stay in science, mathematics, or engineering. Loan interest payments under this Act are subject to availability of appropriations. Priority will be given to individuals who received interest payments in the previous fiscal year if funds are insufficient. The Secretary has the authority to establish regulations. The Secretary can prescribe regulations for this section. Interest payments for student borrowers selected under subsection (a) will be made until the completion of the loan repayment period or when $10,000 has been paid on behalf of the borrower. The Secretary may make a payment of $10,000 on behalf of the borrower if they fail to fulfill the service obligation or if their income exceeds 4 times the national per capita income for a calendar year. The Secretary may pay interest to eligible lenders for student borrowers selected under regulations. Each eligible individual must apply for loan interest payment. The individual must submit a complete application to the Secretary for interest payment, agreeing to repay if service requirements are not met. Consolidation loans are also addressed. Consolidation loans under the Higher Education Act or Federal Direct Consolidation Loan may qualify for interest payment if used to repay specific types of loans. No borrower can receive benefits under both this section and certain other loan forgiveness programs. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Education, and \"mathematics, science, or engineering professional\" is defined as someone with a degree in science, mathematics, or engineering working in a related field determined by the Secretary, including as a professor at a higher education institution. SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal year 2006 and the following 5 years is provided under this Act."
