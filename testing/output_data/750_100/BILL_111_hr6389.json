    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Prostate Research, Outreach, Screening, Testing, Access, and Treatment Effectiveness Act of 2010\" or the \"PROSTATE Act\". Congress finds that prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among men, with over 190,000 new diagnoses and 27,000 deaths in 2009. Approximately 2,000,000 Americans are living with prostate cancer, and younger men are also at risk. Racial and ethnic disparities exist in the disease. African-Americans have double the prostate cancer mortality rates compared to White population. Underserved rural areas face higher mortality rates than urban areas. Urologists are key in diagnosing and treating prostate cancer patients. Innovative telehealth methods can improve rural access to quality care. Prostate cancer research has made progress, but many questions remain unanswered. The causes of prostate cancer are unknown, leading to overtreatment due to difficulty in distinguishing between aggressive and indolent forms of the disease. There is significant overtreatment in prostate cancer, with no durable treatments once it has metastasized. A significant proportion of cases may be clinically indolent and overdiagnosed, leading to unnecessary treatments. More accurate tests could reduce physical, psychological, financial, and emotional trauma for patients and save billions of dollars in healthcare costs. Prostate cancer research and health care programs should be coordinated across Federal agencies to improve accountability and encourage the translation of research into practice. This will help identify and implement best practices for effective prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of the disease. Prostate cancer coordination and education. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs, in collaboration with the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, must establish an Interagency Prostate Cancer Coordination and Education Task Force within 180 days. This task force will be responsible for summarizing advancements in prostate cancer research supported by Federal agencies related to diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. The Interagency Prostate Cancer Coordination and Education Task Force will compile best practices for prostate cancer diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. They will also consider guidelines for screening men over 74 on a case-by-case basis, taking into account quality of life and family history. Additionally, they will share information on improving research and health care programs. The Interagency Prostate Cancer Coordination and Education Task Force aims to compile best practices for prostate cancer diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. They will identify gaps in research and health care programs, promote research translation into practice, and maximize Federal efforts through collaboration and resource leveraging. Additionally, they will develop a comprehensive interagency strategy and advise relevant Federal agencies on soliciting proposals. The curr_chunk focuses on soliciting proposals for collaborative research programs related to prostate cancer etiology. It emphasizes innovative approaches, key research questions, methodologies, and consistent action as outlined by the Public Health Service Act. The curr_chunk outlines the responsibilities of the Prostate Cancer Task Force, including developing a coordinated message for screening and treatment in Federal health programs and submitting recommendations to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs within two years of establishment. The curr_chunk focuses on improving research portfolios of various Federal agencies to support research and health care program priorities and prevent unnecessary duplication. The curr_chunk discusses increasing public participation in decisions related to prostate cancer research and health care programs, disseminating information on research progress, and expanding partnerships between public and private entities. The curr_chunk focuses on encouraging collaborative research and health care delivery, assessing cost savings, recommending promising efforts, ensuring no conflicts with other mandates, and identifying priority action items. The Prostate Cancer Task Force will consist of representatives from relevant Federal agencies to coordinate a unified message on prostate cancer screening and treatment. The task force will assess funding needs for implementing recommendations and ensure alignment with other mandates. The Prostate Cancer Task Force appoints expert advisory panels from relevant federal agencies and medical communities to provide input on prostate cancer diagnosis, treatment, and research. The Prostate Cancer Task Force includes urologists, primary care providers, and experts in education and outreach for underserved populations affected by prostate cancer. The Task Force meets at least twice a year, or more frequently as determined by the Secretary. Recommendations submitted to the Secretary must be shared with Congress. The Federal Advisory Committee Act applies to the Prostate Cancer Task Force. The Prostate Cancer Task Force, consisting of urologists, primary care providers, and experts in education and outreach for underserved populations affected by prostate cancer, is exempt from termination under the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Recommendations must be shared with Congress. Prostate Cancer Task Force, including urologists and primary care providers, is exempt from termination under the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Recommendations must be shared with Congress. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs, in coordination with other departments, will establish a program to intensify prostate cancer research. This program will focus on developing better diagnostic methods, understanding the disease's causes, and improving screening tests. The program aims to better understand the causes of prostate cancer, including lifestyle factors like obesity and diet, in different ethnic and socioeconomic groups. It also focuses on expanding basic research, identifying novel agents for prevention and treatment. The Prostate Cancer Scientific Advisory Board is established to accelerate research data sharing and the movement of new medicines to patients. Additionally, clinical registries for prostate cancer will be established, and appropriate imaging modalities will be assessed using specific institutes. The Underserved Minority Grant Program aims to award grants to eligible entities for research on prostate cancer disparities, integrate existing knowledge, and address barriers in access to care and clinical trial participation specific to minority populations. The Underserved Minority Grant Program focuses on research on prostate cancer disparities, outreach efforts to raise awareness in minority communities, and ensuring appropriate access to imaging modalities. SEC. 5. TELEHEALTH AND RURAL ACCESS PILOT PROJECT. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will establish telehealth pilot projects to analyze clinical outcomes and cost effectiveness in underserved areas, promoting specialist care coordination and tumor board utilization for better patient counseling. Eligible entities will be selected by the Secretary. The Secretary will select eligible entities for telehealth pilot projects in underserved areas, prioritizing those in medically underserved areas, including African-Americans, Latin-Americans, Indian Health Service facilities, and rural areas. The projects will evaluate the effective and economic delivery of care. The evaluation will focus on the effective and economic delivery of care for prostate cancer using telehealth services in medically underserved and tribal areas, including collaboration among health professionals and integration of various technologies. It will also assess the capacity building of nonmedical and nonspecialized providers to offer health services for prostate cancer in these areas. The evaluation will focus on the efficient use of telehealth services for prostate cancer treatment in medically underserved areas, including collaboration among different medical specialists and primary care teams. A report on the outcomes of pilot projects must be submitted to Congress within 12 months. The report on pilot projects using telehealth services for prostate cancer treatment in underserved areas must be submitted to Congress within 12 months, detailing outcomes, cost savings, efficiencies, and recommendations for expanding telehealth services. SEC. 6. EDUCATION AND AWARENESS. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will develop a national education campaign for prostate cancer, including written materials and public service announcements to encourage men to seek screening. The campaign will address racial disparities and ensure materials are available in communities with higher incidence rates. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will develop a national education campaign for prostate cancer, targeting communities with racial disparities and men with a family history of the disease. Grants will be awarded to nonprofit entities for testing outreach and education strategies. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2011 through 2015 is provided to carry out the Act."
