    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Commercial Engagement Through Ocean Technology Act of 2018\" or the \"CENOTE Act of 2018\". The table of contents for this Act is provided. The \"Commercial Engagement Through Ocean Technology Act of 2018\" or the \"CENOTE Act of 2018\" includes definitions, coordination for assessment and acquisition of unmanned maritime systems by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, regular assessments, acquisition of unmanned maritime systems, reports on their usage, and funding. The term \"Administration\" refers to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The term \"Administrator\" refers to the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere and Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \"Cooperative activities of the Administration\" involve collaborations between the Administration and external entities such as Cooperative Institutes, Sea Grant Colleges, and the National Oceanographic Partnership Program. The term \"data specifications\" refers to the details required for data by the Administration. A \"test or training range\" is an area for operating unmanned maritime systems and training personnel. The term \"test or training range\" may include specialized instrumentation for unmanned maritime systems and other types of systems. Unmanned maritime systems are remotely operated or autonomous vehicles designed to function without human presence, including control, communications, and data processing systems. Unmanned maritime systems encompass various vehicles such as unmanned undersea vehicles, unmanned surface vehicles, autonomous underwater vehicles, and autonomous surface vehicles. The term also includes unmanned aerial vehicles and autonomous aerial vehicles used for maritime purposes as determined necessary by the Administrator. The Administrator shall direct the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research and the Office of Marine and Aviation Operations to coordinate research, assessment, and acquisition of unmanned maritime systems for cooperative activities. The Administrator directs coordination of unmanned maritime systems through the Unmanned Systems Executive Oversight Board (USEOB) within the Administration, ensuring representation from the Office of Ocean Exploration (OER). The Administrator coordinates unmanned maritime systems through the Unmanned Systems Executive Oversight Board (USEOB) within the Administration, in collaboration with the Navy to leverage expertise in development and operational transition. The Administrator coordinates unmanned maritime systems through the Unmanned Systems Executive Oversight Board (USEOB) within the Administration, in collaboration with the Navy to align with strategic priorities, utilize test ranges, and formalize coordination through a memorandum of understanding with the Secretary of the Navy. The Administrator coordinates unmanned maritime systems through the Unmanned Systems Executive Oversight Board (USEOB) within the Administration, in collaboration with the Navy to align with strategic priorities, utilize test ranges, and formalize coordination through a memorandum of understanding with the Secretary of the Navy, incorporating priorities and requirements of the Administration into research and development activities, partnering to procure unmanned maritime systems, and accessing test procedures defined by the Navy. The Administrator collaborates with the Navy to access test ranges and facilities for various purposes, including mapping, bathymetry, and ocean exploration. Activities authorized by this Act aim to gain efficiencies through collaboration and advance the development of unmanned maritime systems. Advancing development of unmanned maritime systems includes research, testing, modifications, and integration. Accelerating transition from concept to manufacturing and acquisition. Coordination with other federal agencies through the National Oceanographic Partnership Program for interagency coordination. The Administrator may coordinate with academic institutions to maximize research opportunities, provide training in unmanned maritime systems, and facilitate commercialization through partnerships. The Administrator coordinates with academic institutions, private industry, and public safety agencies to support testing, training, and certification of unmanned maritime systems. This includes arranging access to facilities, increasing operational tolerance, certifying capacity, and training operators in real or simulated environments. Additionally, the Administrator facilitates engagement with other academic institutions with expertise in unmanned maritime systems. Promoting information sharing and collaboration between academic, environmental, and military institutions to enhance unmanned maritime systems. The Administrator may also engage with the private sector to support commercialization and assessment of available unmanned maritime systems. The Administrator will regularly assess unmanned maritime systems for potential use in supporting National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration missions. The Administrator will assess unmanned maritime systems for potential use in supporting missions of the Administration through science-based assessments and assessment of operational utility. The Assistant Administrator and the Director will convene the Unmanned Maritime Systems Ocean Technology Coordinating Committee and consult with various stakeholders to conduct assessments. The Administrator will coordinate the acquisition of unmanned maritime systems for the Administration. The Administration will acquire unmanned maritime systems to meet data requirements identified by OAR and OMAO, approved by the USEOB. The Administrator may develop a memorandum of agreement with the Secretary of the Navy for procurement participation, accepting decommissioned systems, and sharing policies. The Administrator will acquire unmanned maritime systems to meet data requirements, potentially collaborating with the Navy for procurement participation and sharing policies. The Act also mandates reports on unmanned maritime systems usage for NOAA's mission. The report to Congress on the usage of unmanned maritime systems for the Administration's mission includes an inventory of current systems, data summary, benefits realized, prioritized data requirements, and commercially available systems with operational capabilities. The term \"appropriate committees of Congress\" is defined in this section, including specific committees from the Senate and House of Representatives. The Administrator will fund this Act using existing appropriations. The Administrator may enter into contracts, agreements, and transactions with governments, accept donations and services, receive funds from other federal departments, and utilize the National Oceanographic Partnership Program for funding. The Administrator has the authority to accept funds, donations, and enter contracts with various entities, transfer funds to organizations, and utilize resources from different government levels and international bodies. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
