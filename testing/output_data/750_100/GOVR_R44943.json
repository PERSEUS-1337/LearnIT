    "content": "Some Members of Congress have long been interested in the rules governing patentable subject matter. The term refers to the requirement that an invention must consist of a \"process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter\" to be patented. The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act of 2011 restricted patents on human organisms and tax avoidance strategies. The courts and USPTO have historically interpreted Section 101 broadly for patentable subject matter. The courts have long recognized exceptions to patentable subject matter, including laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas. Recent Supreme Court decisions have tightened the interpretation of Section 101, leading to increased scrutiny of patent applications. Since 2010, opinions addressing patentable subject matter have led to increased scrutiny of patents under Section 101. The recent prominence of Section 101 in the U.S. patent system has sparked debate on its impact, with some declaring a \"state of crisis\" due to confusing legal standards. The U.S. patent system is facing a \"state of crisis\" due to confusing legal standards set by the Supreme Court, causing chaos and a departure from sensible patent policy. This has led to debates on the impact of Section 101 on patents, with some believing it may result in appropriate scope patents, reduce abusive litigation, and promote higher quality patents. The report discusses the patent system, principles of patentable subject matter, Supreme Court decisions on Section 101 of the Patent Act, implications in information technology and life sciences industries, and legislative reform options. Applicants must submit applications to the USPTO for patent protection. The patent application process involves assessing whether the invention meets patentability criteria such as novelty and non-obviousness. Applicants must provide a detailed description of the invention and draft specific claims. The examiner reviews the application to determine if it meets the standards set by the patent statute. The patentability criteria for an invention include novelty and nonobviousness. Novelty requires that the invention is not fully anticipated by prior art, while nonobviousness means the invention must not have been readily achievable by an artisan based on prior knowledge. Additionally, the invention must be useful and provide a tangible benefit to be patentable. Section 101 of the Patent Act states that for an invention to be patentable, it must meet the criteria of novelty, nonobviousness, and utility. Process patents claim a series of steps to achieve a specific result. Process patents typically relate to methods of manufacture or use, claiming a method of making a product or using a chemical compound. The Supreme Court has defined \"machine\" and \"manufacture\" in the context of patentable subject matter. The term \"composition of matter\" encompasses all compositions of two or more substances, including composite articles. While Section 101 of patent law is broad, there are limits on patenting processes, with laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas deemed non-patentable. The Supreme Court views certain inventions as essential tools for scientific and technological progress, meant to be accessible to all and not monopolized. If a patent application meets the requirements, the USPTO grants a patent, giving the owner the right to exclude others from using the invention. The patent proprietor has the right to exclude others from using the claimed invention for twenty years. This exclusivity allows inventors to practice their inventions or license them to others, enabling them to recoup their investment. The patent holder is responsible for monitoring competitors to ensure they are not using the patented invention. The patent owner has the right to exclude others from using the invention for twenty years, monitoring competitors for infringement. Litigation in federal courts is usually necessary to enforce intellectual property rights. The Federal Circuit handles most patent appeals, with the Supreme Court having discretionary review authority. The Court's recent decisions mark the first time in nearly four decades that it has addressed patentable subject matter. In 1980, the Supreme Court ruled in Diamond v. Chakrabarty that genetically engineered microorganisms could be patented. A year later, in Diamond v. Diehr, the Court held that a process involving a computer and a mathematical formula was also patentable. These decisions broadened the range of patentable subject matter for information technologies and life sciences. Since then, lower courts and the USPTO have rarely used Section 101 to invalidate patents. The Supreme Court's recent decisions mark the first time in nearly four decades that it has addressed patentable subject matter. The Supreme Court's recent decisions from 2010 to 2014 narrowed patent eligibility, impacting the patent system significantly. In the 2010 Bilski v. Kappos case, the Court considered the patentability of a method for managing consumption risk costs in commodities trading. The patent application discussed involves a method for managing consumption risk costs in commodities trading by initiating transactions between commodity providers and consumers at fixed rates based on historical averages, and then balancing the risk with market participants through additional transactions at a second fixed rate. The USPTO rejected the patent application for managing consumption risk costs in commodities trading, citing it as ineligible for patenting under Section 101. The Federal Circuit questioned whether the application was claiming a fundamental principle or a mental process, stating that a process is patent-eligible if tied to a machine or apparatus, or if it transforms an article. The Federal Circuit concluded that Bilski's patent application did not claim patentable subject matter as it did not satisfy the first prong of the Section 101 inquiry. The claimed process did not achieve a physical transformation, leading to the rejection of the application. The USPTO denied Bilski's patent application because his invention could not be patented as it did not meet the physical object or substance requirement. The Supreme Court issued three opinions, with Justice Kennedy agreeing that Bilski's invention could not be patented, but rejecting the machine or transformation test as the sole standard for identifying patentable processes. The Supreme Court rejected the machine or transformation test as the sole standard for identifying patentable processes. Justice Kennedy reasoned that hedging was a fundamental economic practice and allowing it to be patented would grant a monopoly over an abstract idea. Justice Stevens issued a concurring opinion on his retirement day. Justice Breyer, along with Justice Scalia, issued a concurring opinion on the Supreme Court's rejection of the machine-or-transformation test as the sole standard for patentable processes. Breyer emphasized that methods of doing business should not be covered by patent law, and identified four key points of agreement among all nine justices regarding the broad but limited scope of patentable subject matter. The Supreme Court shifted focus to life sciences in Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., where patents claimed methods for determining optimal dosages of thiopurine drugs used to treat autoimmune diseases. The Court emphasized that not everything achieving a \"useful, concrete, and tangible result\" qualifies as patentable subject matter. The patents claim methods of administering thiopurine drugs to patients and determining drug levels in red blood cells. If metabolite levels are outside the known range, drug dosage should be adjusted to enhance treatment efficacy and reduce toxicity. Claim 1 of the `623 patent exemplifies the claims of the patents at issue. The patents claim a method of optimizing therapeutic efficacy for immune-mediated gastrointestinal disorders by administering 6-thioguanine and adjusting drug dosage based on the level of 6-thioguanine in red blood cells. The Supreme Court ruled that claims directed towards natural laws, like adjusting drug dosage based on red blood cell levels, are unpatentable to prevent hindering innovation. The Supreme Court ruled that processes applying natural laws in a useful way are eligible for patenting under Section 101 of the Patent Act. The claims in question recited relationships between thiopurine metabolite concentrations and drug effectiveness, but also included steps like administering the drug and determining metabolite levels for dosage adjustment. Justice Breyer considered whether these additional steps made the claims patentable. The Supreme Court considered whether the additional steps in the claims, such as administering the drug and determining metabolite levels, were enough to make the inventions patentable. Justice Breyer concluded that merely limiting the use of a natural law to a specific audience or environment does not qualify for patent protection. The Supreme Court ruled that limiting the use of a natural law to a specific audience or environment does not make it patentable. Justice Breyer emphasized that routine steps or advising individuals to use a law of nature does not transform it into a patent-eligible application. The Supreme Court in Mayo v. Prometheus concluded that advising individuals to use a natural law does not make it patentable. The Court rejected the argument that the Prometheus patents satisfied the machine-or-transformation test, stating that the claims only required routine steps. In Mayo v. Prometheus, the Supreme Court ruled that simply measuring metabolite levels did not make a natural law patentable. Justice Breyer argued that the transformation of the human body was not relevant to patentability, as it only identified potential users of the law of nature. The Court also addressed the argument that any step beyond stating a law of nature should meet patent standards, emphasizing the importance of novelty and nonobviousness under the Patent Act. The Supreme Court in Mayo v. Prometheus ruled that measuring metabolite levels alone does not make a natural law patentable. Justice Breyer emphasized the importance of novelty and nonobviousness under the Patent Act, rejecting the proposal that other patentability requirements should play a significant role in patent issuance decisions. The Court also addressed concerns that rejecting the Prometheus patents would discourage diagnostic research, with Justice Breyer noting that granting patents on the body's natural responses to illness could limit physician access to critical scientific data. In a June 2013 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that genomic DNA was ineligible for patenting under the \"product of nature\" doctrine. Preexisting substances found in the wild may not be patented, but significant artificial changes can make them patentable. The USPTO issued over 50,000 patents related to DNA, including human genes, but experts argued that isolating genes was a technicality and should not be patentable. The Supreme Court's Myriad decision in June 2013 reflected this view, stating that genomic DNA was not eligible for patenting under the \"product of nature\" doctrine. The Association for Molecular Pathology and other plaintiffs filed a lawsuit against USPTO, Myriad Genetics, Inc., and University of Utah Research Foundation challenging Myriad's patents on isolated human genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 linked to breast and ovarian cancers. Myriad held exclusive rights to genetic testing for these genes. The plaintiffs challenged Myriad's gene patent claims on BRCA1 and BRCA2, arguing that human genes are naturally occurring and not patentable. The U.S. District Court invalidated Myriad's gene patents, but the Federal Circuit later reversed this decision, stating that isolated DNA is manipulated and therefore patentable. The Appeals reasoned that \"isolated\" DNA is chemically manipulated to create a molecule different from that in the body, making human genes patentable. The Supreme Court vacated the judgment in the Myriad case and remanded it to the Federal Circuit for reconsideration. The Federal Circuit upheld Myriad's claims again, leading to the Supreme Court agreeing to hear the case. The Supreme Court ruled that Myriad did not create anything by isolating the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, stating that separating genes from surrounding genetic material is not an act of invention. They were unimpressed by Myriad's claims of patenting isolated DNA, as it involved only the severing of chemical bonds. The Supreme Court ruled that Myriad's claims on isolated DNA were not patentable as they did not involve chemical composition or changes. However, they viewed claims on complementary DNA (cDNA) more favorably, stating that cDNA, being synthetic and distinct from naturally-occurring DNA, could be patented. The Supreme Court ruled that cDNA, being synthetic and distinct from naturally-occurring DNA, could be patented as it did not constitute a \"product of nature.\" Justice Thomas clarified that the Myriad opinion did not involve innovative gene manipulation methods or new gene applications, but simply held that isolated genes are not patent eligible under \u00a7101. The Supreme Court ruled that cDNA, being synthetic and distinct from naturally-occurring DNA, could be patented as it did not constitute a \"product of nature.\" Justice Thomas, joined by seven colleagues, held that isolated genes are not patent eligible under \u00a7101. Justice Scalia concurred but disagreed with the fine details of molecular biology. In a recent Section 101 decision, the Supreme Court reviewed the patentability of a computer-based financial exchange system in Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International. The patents in question aimed to reduce settlement risk in financial transactions through method claims, computer system claims, and computer-readable media claims. The district court's ruling was discussed. The Supreme Court reviewed the patentability of computer-based financial exchange system patents in Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International. The district court deemed the inventions unpatentable as they were considered basic business concepts. The Federal Circuit and Supreme Court upheld this decision, focusing on whether computer-implemented inventions are eligible for patents under section 101. The Supreme Court agreed with the Federal Circuit that the patents were directed to abstract ideas. The Federal Circuit determined that the patents were directed to a patent-ineligible abstract idea. Justice Thomas explained the two-part test for identifying patents claiming laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas. The second test determines if the claim includes additional elements that make it a patent-eligible application of the excluded subject matter. Justice Thomas described the second test as determining if a claim includes an \"inventive concept\" beyond applying laws of nature, natural phenomena, or abstract ideas to a specific technological environment. The Court applied the two-step process from Mayo v. Prometheus to method claims, determining they were directed to the abstract idea of intermediated settlement. The inquiry then focused on whether the claim contains an \"inventive concept\" to transform the abstract idea into a patent-eligible application. The Court found that the patented claims were merely implementing an abstract idea on a computer, with Justice Thomas stating that simply using a generic computer does not make an abstract idea patent-eligible. The claims were rejected for only including generic computer hardware. The Supreme Court decisions in Bilski, Mayo v. Prometheus, Myriad, and Alice establish the current law on patent eligibility. The key theme is a two-part test to determine if an invention is patentable, focusing on whether the claim recites a law of nature or natural concept. The Supreme Court decisions in Bilski, Mayo v. Prometheus, Myriad, and Alice established a two-part test for patent eligibility, focusing on whether a claim recites a law of nature, natural phenomenon, or abstract idea. The Court analyzes if a patent claim preempts a field of activity and considers if it covers every practical application of a fundamental concept, which would make it ineligible for a patent under Section 101. Routine hardware like a general-purpose computer does not alleviate concerns over eligibility. The machine-or-transformation test is a useful guidepost for patent eligibility of processes, with Section 101 determinations often resolved early in litigation without formal claim construction. Statistical analyses show a good probability of invalidating challenged claims when Section 101 challenges are raised. Statistical analyses show a high probability of invalidating challenged claims under Section 101, with courts invalidating 66.5% of patents brought under \u00a7101 motions citing Alice. The Federal Circuit upheld 3 patents and invalidated 34 patents, with an average invalidation rate of 91.9%. The USPTO has rejected over 36,000 published patent applications under Alice. Recent statistics suggest that around two-thirds of issued patents may not comply with Section 101, indicating a good chance of success in asserting patent claim invalidity. This trend is particularly notable in areas such as chemicals, consumer devices, electronics, medical devices, pharmaceuticals, tools, vehicles, and other technologies. The Supreme Court's interest in patentable subject matter has influenced a patent validity doctrine with broad implications. The Supreme Court's interest in patentable subject matter has influenced a patent validity doctrine with broad implications for information technologies and life sciences. Recent case law has led to the invalidation of numerous patents on computer-related inventions, particularly those that do not describe specific solutions or improvements in technology. Several patent claims were invalidated, including inventions related to generating menus, analyzing electric power grid data, extracting data from hard copy documents, and administering life insurance policies. The patent invalidated in another representative decision, Affinity Labs of Tex. v. DIRECTV, LLC, claimed a broadcast system in which a cellular telephone located outside the territory of a regional broadcaster requests and receives content via a streaming signal. The Federal Circuit invalidated a patent for a broadcast system involving out-of-region access to local content, deeming it an abstract idea. Judge Bryson noted that the patent did not address the implementation of out-of-region broadcasting on a cellular telephone, focusing instead on the concept itself. The Federal Circuit invalidated a patent for an abstract idea related to out-of-region access to local content on cellular telephones. The patent did not explain how the invention achieved its functions, limiting the idea to a specific technological environment. This did not meet the requirements of Section 101 according to Supreme Court case law. The Federal Circuit has upheld patents in other cases, such as those related to e-commerce systems, information management, Internet content filtering, and three-dimensional animation techniques. The Supreme Court decisions in Mayo v. Prometheus and Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics have had consequences for the life sciences industry, particularly in the area of predictive diagnostic methods and biomarker-related patents. The Myriad case has implications for isolated bodily patents. The Myriad case has implications for isolated bodily patents, making any isolated bodily substance of doubtful patentability. Fewer judicial opinions have addressed the interaction of Section 101 with life sciences compared to information technologies. The 2015 ruling of the Federal Circuit in Ariosa Diagnostics, Inc. v. Sequenom, Inc. has sparked considerable discussion within the patent community. Sequenom held the exclusive license for a non-invasive prenatal diagnostic method to determine fetal gender, blood type, and genetic disorders using cell-free fetal DNA in maternal plasma or serum. The method involved amplifying and detecting paternally inherited nucleic acid in the sample. The inventors discovered cell-free fetal DNA in maternal plasma or serum and developed a method to detect paternally inherited ccfDNA to determine fetal characteristics. The Federal Circuit ruled that the invention failed the patentable subject matter test as it focused on a naturally occurring phenomenon and instructed physicians to use conventional techniques. Judge Linn concurred with the decision but expressed dissatisfaction with the outcome. Judge Linn concurred with the Federal Circuit's ruling that the invention failed the patentable subject matter test, but expressed dissatisfaction with the outcome. He argued that the patented invention was a breakthrough in prenatal diagnosis, eliminating the need for invasive techniques that could harm the mother and pregnancy. Congress has options to address the law of patentable subject matter, including taking no action or altering the law through legislation. No bill has been introduced before Congress on this issue as of the report's publication. No bill has been introduced before Congress addressing the law of patentable subject since the enactment of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act in 2011. However, industry associations like the American Intellectual Property Law Association (AIPLA) and the Intellectual Property Owners Association (IPO) have proposed modifications to Section 101. The AIPLA proposal suggests replacing the existing Section 101 with new language. The language of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 outlines the eligibility criteria for patents, stating that inventions must be useful processes, machines, manufactures, compositions of matter, or improvements thereof. Exceptions to eligibility include inventions existing in nature independent of human activity or solely in the human mind. Eligibility is determined without regard to specific requirements. The IPO and ABA proposals aim to amend Section 101 to clarify conditions for patentability, focusing on eligible subject matter without considering specific requirements like sections 102, 103, and 112. The IPO and ABA proposals aim to amend Section 101 to clarify conditions for patentability, focusing on eligible subject matter without considering specific requirements like sections 102, 103, and 112. Patent eligibility under this section shall not be negated when a practical application of a law of nature, natural phenomenon, or abstract idea is involved. The AIPLA asserts that Section 101 should act as an \"enabling provision\" rather than determining patentability based on Sections 102, 103, and 112. The ABA Section on Intellectual Property shares a similar perspective. The ABA Section on Intellectual Property and IPO criticize recent Supreme Court decisions for injecting ambiguity into patent eligibility determination by applying criteria like 'well known,' 'routine,' 'conventional or obvious,' turning eligibility into a patentability test contrary to congressional intent. The ABA Section on Intellectual Property and IPO criticize recent Supreme Court decisions for injecting ambiguity into patent eligibility determination by applying criteria like 'well known,' 'routine,' 'conventional or obvious,' turning eligibility into a patentability test contrary to congressional intent. Some commentators argue against legislative reform, stating that more restrictive patent eligibility rules have not affected innovation or investment significantly. They believe proposed amendments would remove limits on software patenting and subject matter eligibility. The AIPLA proposal would also change the current statutory phrase regarding patent conditions. Recent Supreme Court decisions have caused controversy in the fields of software and life sciences by making patenting more difficult. Section 101 is seen as crucial in maintaining a balance between innovation and patent eligibility. Proposed changes to patent conditions could have unintended consequences, such as eliminating common law patentability standards. Observers believe that Section 101 maintains a balance between inventors' contributions and patent rights, while some experts fear a lack of patent availability may hinder innovation and investment in the US, sparking debates on patentable inventions."
