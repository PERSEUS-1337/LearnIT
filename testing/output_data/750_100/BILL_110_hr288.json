    "content": "The \"Notch Baby Act of 2007\" establishes a new guaranteed minimum primary insurance amount for those eligible during a transitional period. Section 215(a) of the Social Security Act is amended to include provisions for individuals becoming eligible for old-age insurance benefits between 1978 and 1989. The primary insurance amount is calculated by adding the individual's amount with any applicable transitional increase amount. The term 'applicable transitional increase amount' refers to the excess under former law multiplied by the applicable percentage in relation to the year when an individual becomes eligible for old-age insurance benefits. The applicable percentage for individuals becoming eligible for benefits in different years is as follows: 1979 or 1980 - 60 percent, 1981 or 1982 - 35 percent, 1983 or 1984 - 30 percent, 1985 or 1986 - 25 percent, 1987 or 1988 - 10 percent. The term 'excess under former law' refers to the difference between an individual's applicable former law primary insurance amount and the amount that would be their primary insurance amount under current law. The 'applicable former law primary insurance amount' is the amount that would be an individual's primary insurance amount if calculated without certain provisions. The individual's primary insurance amount is determined based on calculations under former law provisions, with modifications as specified. The individual's primary insurance amount is determined based on calculations under former law provisions, with modifications as specified, including limitations on computation base years and adjustments to the table for increases. The primary insurance amount for an individual is determined based on calculations under former law provisions, with modifications and limitations on computation base years. This paragraph applies only if it results in a greater amount than computed under a different paragraph. The effective date and related rules are outlined in Section 3. The amendments made by this Act are effective as if they were part of the Social Security Amendments of 1977, with no benefit increases before January 2007. Individual entitled to benefits in December 2006 may have their benefits recomputed to reflect increases. The Commissioner of Social Security will recompute benefits for individuals entitled to benefits in December 2006 to reflect increases based on the amendments made by this Act."
