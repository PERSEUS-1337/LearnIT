Congress authorizes and appropriates foreign aid, overseeing executive agencies' management of aid programs. The Middle East is a major recipient of U.S. economic and security assistance, making it a focus of congressional interest. Data in the report is sourced from various resources, including the U.S. Overseas Loans and Grants Database. U.S. foreign aid to the Middle East aims to advance core interests such as supporting Israel, promoting peaceful relations with Arab neighbors, protecting energy supplies, and combating terrorism. Data for aid programs is sourced from various resources including the U.S. Overseas Loans and Grants Database. U.S. foreign assistance in the Middle East supports peace treaties between Israel and Egypt, Jordan, and promotes a two-state solution with Palestine. Military aid is provided to Iraq and Lebanon to counter Iranian influence. The period of upheaval in the Arab world since 2011 has led to governments falling, political conflict, sectarian violence, and weakened economies. Iraq, Syria, Libya, and Yemen are facing civil wars and terrorist violence, threatening neighboring states. Al Qaeda and ISIS affiliates are fighting security forces in battles that could reshape the region. The Arab world has been in upheaval since 2011, with governments falling, political conflict, sectarian violence, and weakened economies. Countries like Iraq, Syria, Libya, and Yemen are facing civil wars and terrorist violence. Tunisia is making strides towards a stable democratic system, but its gains are fragile. The US debates the amount of resources to devote to the region, with bilateral assistance remaining relatively unchanged. Israel, Egypt, Jordan, the Palestinians, and Iraq are the main recipients of foreign aid. In FY2010, Israel, Egypt, Jordan, the Palestinians, and Iraq were the leading bilateral aid recipients, with strong Congressional support for Israel and peace in the region. U.S. foreign assistance has seen changes due to violence in Syria and Iraq, with over $4 billion allocated since FY2012 to address challenges from these conflicts. The US has allocated over $4 billion for the Syrian refugee crisis and authorized new funding for security assistance to combat the Islamic State. Congress provided the Defense Department with three new train and equip authorities to counter the Islamic State. Funding for these accounts comes from new appropriations or authorized reprogramming. The US has allocated over $4 billion for the Syrian refugee crisis and authorized new funding for security assistance to combat the Islamic State. Funding for these accounts comes from new appropriations or authorized reprogramming. The conflicts in Syria and Iraq receive a significant portion of regional foreign assistance, including humanitarian spending, military aid, and support for neighboring states like Lebanon and Jordan. The Administration is seeking $3.45 billion for State and Defense Department funding in FY2016 to address these conflicts. Future appropriations may be influenced by broader considerations. Future appropriations for assistance to the Middle East may be affected by domestic-budgetary considerations. The overall foreign operations budget increased significantly during the Bush Administration due to wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Under the Obama Administration, funding for State Department, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs has remained fairly flat at around $51 billion annually since FY2009. To address regional crises within a static budgetary environment, officials have relied on foreign aid funds from Overseas Contingency Operations accounts, which are not subject to budget caps. In recent years, new bilateral aid to Iraq, the Syrian opposition, and Jordan has been designated as Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding, along with funding for multilateral accounts used in response to humanitarian crises. The House version of the State Department, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs bill would provide $47.8 billion in total funding. The House version of the State Department, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs bill would provide $47.8 billion in total funding to address the financial needs of the region's non-oil producers, complementing loans from institutions like the IMF. Loans totaling over $9 billion have been provided to countries like Morocco, Tunisia, Jordan, and Yemen, with conditions for economic reforms. The House version of the State Department, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs bill would provide $47.8 billion in total funding to address the financial needs of the region's non-oil producers, complementing loans from institutions like the IMF. Gulf states have increased aid to the Middle East to counter Islamist influence and ensure regime continuity. Iran also provides assistance to allies in the region. The Administration has requested $7.14 billion in non-humanitarian aid for Near East and North Africa countries in FY2016, representing a 5.4% increase from FY2014. Over 80% of the total aid would support Israel, Egypt, Jordan, and the West Bank and Gaza. The FY2016 non-humanitarian aid request for Near East and North Africa countries is $7.14 billion, a 5.4% increase from FY2014. Over 80% of the aid would support Israel, Egypt, Jordan, and the West Bank and Gaza. Key budget accounts for aid include Development Assistance, Global Health Programs, Economic Support Fund, International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement, Nonproliferation, Anti-Terrorism, Demining and Related Programs, International Military Education and Training, Foreign Military Financing, and Peacekeeping Operations. 95% of non-humanitarian aid to Middle Eastern countries is within the ESF and FMF accounts. The FY2016 foreign affairs request includes $873.4 million for Middle Eastern bilateral aid and $1.63 billion for humanitarian aid for the crisis in Syria and Iraq, making up one-third of all OCO funds sought. Congress did not provide specific OCO funds for countering the Islamic State in FY2015 but increased OCO funds in various accounts for other purposes. The United States provides aid to Middle Eastern countries through regional programs like Middle East Regional (MER) funded by ESF, supporting issues such as women's rights, public health, water scarcity, and education. The Administration requested $40 million in ESF funding for MER in FY2016. USAID allocates $15-20 million annually for Near East Regional Democracy (NERD) program, promoting democracy and human rights in Iran. NERD activities for Iranian activists occur outside the country due to resistance from the clerical regime. The Administration requested $30 million in ESF for NERD in FY2016. Middle East Regional Cooperation (MERC) program, managed by USAID, supports research and development cooperation in the region. MERC is a program funded through ESF that supports research and development cooperation between Israel and its Arab neighbors, including the West Bank/Gaza. Established in 1979, MERC encourages cooperation between Egyptian and Israeli scientists. It funds joint Arab-Israeli research in water, agriculture, environment, and health sectors. The Administration requested $5 million for MERC in FY2016. The MEM program, funded through ESF, promotes technical cooperation between Arab and Israeli parties on water scarcity, environmental protection, and renewable energy. The Administration is requesting $1.4 million for MEM in FY2016. The TSCTP initiative supports 11 countries in North and West Africa to counter terrorism and prevent radicalization, with three North African countries participating. The Administration is requesting $69.8 million for the TSCTP initiative in FY2016, with $13.4 million designated for North African countries. Actual funding for TSCTP has often exceeded the Administration's requests in the past. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) selects countries for assistance based on performance in ruling justly, investing in people, and economic freedom. Morocco and Jordan have received MCC grants in the Middle East and North Africa. Morocco signed a $697.5 million agreement with the MCC in 2007. Morocco and Jordan have received MCC grants in the Middle East and North Africa. In 2007, Morocco signed a $697.5 million agreement with the MCC focused on assisting the private agricultural and tourism sectors. Jordan also received a five-year, $275.1 million compact from the MCC to increase water supply in cities and improve water delivery and treatment efficiency. Some critics argue that countries with low scores on democratic indicators should be ineligible for MCC aid, urging the MCC board to bypass such countries. Freedom House suggested that countries like Jordan, scoring below 4 out of 7 on its index, should be automatically disqualified. Jordan performed well on 3 out of 6 other indicators in the category. Analysts argue that Jordan should not be eligible for U.S. aid for democracy promotion due to its access to private sector capital, being a non-democracy, and already receiving significant aid. The debate on funding democracy promotion in the Arab world has been ongoing since the 9/11 attacks, with a shift in U.S. policy towards addressing possible links between authoritarianism and terrorism. At the height of the Arab Spring, U.S. funding for democracy promotion in the Middle East sparked controversy, with accusations of interference in domestic affairs and support for Islamists. Amid ongoing upheaval and authoritarian resurgence in the Arab world, the U.S. foreign policy community debates the relevance of democracy promotion in the region. The U.S. government lacks a centralized agency for coordinating democracy promotion in the Middle East. The Administration is requesting $442 million for democracy and governance activities in the region for FY2016, with most assistance provided bilaterally. Funding also comes from the State Department's Bureau of Democracy. Funding for democracy promotion in the Middle East comes from various sources including the State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, USAID, and the National Endowment for Democracy. MEPI, an office within the State Department, supports political reform, women's and youth empowerment, education, and economic opportunity in the Arab world. Congress has allocated around $913.4 to $960.6 million in Economic Support Funds for MEPI since 2002. MEPI directly funds indigenous NGOs in the Middle East and North Africa to promote democracy. The Local Grants Program builds capacity for small organizations, but legal restrictions in some countries pose risks for cooperation. Egypt's arrests of NGO workers in 2011-2013 highlight these challenges. The State Department is requesting $70 million in ESF funding for MEPI in FY2016, with annual allocations averaging $76-80 million. MEPI aims to provide $8.5 million in direct support to local civil society organizations through its Local Grants Program. Israel has received $124.3 billion in U.S. foreign assistance since World War II. Since World War II, the United States has provided Israel $124.3 billion in bilateral assistance, mostly in military aid. Israel is the largest recipient of U.S. Foreign Military Financing, with strong congressional support resulting in benefits not available to other countries. Israel receives U.S. military assistance for equipment purchases from U.S. manufacturers. They can also use the aid for research, development in the U.S., and military purchases from Israeli manufacturers. Israel gets its assistance at the start of the fiscal year, unlike other recipients who receive it in installments. They can use cash flow financing for U.S. arms purchases and receive funds for rocket and missile defense programs from defense appropriations bills. In 2007, the Bush Administration and the Israeli government agreed to a 10-year, $30 billion military aid package for Israel. U.S.-Israeli discussions have been held for a possible future aid deal beyond 2018. Between 1948 and 2015, the United States provided Egypt with $76 billion in bilateral foreign aid, including $1.3 billion a year in military aid. Egypt receives foreign aid funds from primary accounts: FMF, ESF. Egypt receives the bulk of its foreign aid funds from three primary accounts: FMF, ESF, and IMET. For FY2016, the President requested $1.3 billion in military assistance and $150 million in economic aid for Egypt. The $150 million FY2015 ESF appropriation was the lowest since 1978. Aid to Egypt has been a focus since the military's ouster of President Morsi in 2013. The FY2015 Consolidated Appropriations Act includes provisions on U.S. assistance to Egypt similar to FY2014, with a waiver allowing assistance for national security reasons. Total U.S. aid to Jordan from FY1951 to FY2015 was $15.83 billion. The U.S. and Jordan signed an MOU for $1 billion in annual foreign assistance from FY2015 to FY2017. The Administration is requesting nearly $1 billion in aid for Jordan in FY2016, including economic aid and USAID programs. Cash transfers are used for foreign debt and to support Syrian refugees in Jordan. ESF funds are also provided. The US provides military assistance to Jordan to maintain conventional weapons systems and support border monitoring and counterterrorism capabilities. FMF grants enable Jordan to maintain F-16 fighters, purchase AMRAAM missiles, and acquire Blackhawk helicopters. Additionally, ESF funds support loan guarantees for Jordan and aid for Syrian refugees in the kingdom. The U.S. government has provided over $5 billion in bilateral assistance to Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza since the mid-1990s. However, due to political concerns related to Israeli-Palestinian disputes, little to no bilateral assistance has been given since FY2014. From FY2007 to FY2013, the Bush and Obama Administrations allocated between $100 and $200 million annually in ESF for the West Bank and Gaza, primarily for budgetary assistance to pay PA creditors. Future executive branch plans for obligating funds, including potential PA budgetary assistance, are uncertain. Most bilateral funds for Gaza are currently allocated for humanitarian and economic recovery needs, with U.S. assistance for Palestinian refugees provided through UNRWA. The Administration is seeking $442.0 million for West Bank and Gaza in FY2016, with $370.0 million for economic and development programs and $72.0 million for security assistance. Additionally, $3.45 billion is requested for responding to the crisis in Syria and fighting the Islamic State, with the majority being OCO funds. The Department of Defense is requesting $715 million for train and equip programs for Iraqis and $600 million for Syrians in FY2016. These funds would continue programs initiated in FY2015 under defense authorization and appropriations bills. In FY2016, $1.6 billion in DOD/OCO funding is allocated for an \"Iraq Train and Equip Fund\" to support training missions for Iraqi Security Forces, Kurdish peshmerga, and Sunni tribal fighters. Additionally, $255 million is requested for assistance to opposition groups in Syria. In FY2016, $255 million is allocated for security assistance related to Syria, with $65 million from the peacekeeping operations account for non-lethal assistance to armed Syrian opposition, $160 million from ESF-OCO for non-lethal aid to national and local-level opposition groups, and $10 million from INCLE-OCO for justice sector support in opposition-held areas. Additionally, $20 million from the NADR account would support law enforcement. The FY2016 budget request includes $20 million from the NADR account to support law enforcement training for opposition members, border security training, and weapons abatement initiatives. Additionally, there is $250 million in FMF-OCO to build up the capabilities of the ISF against the Islamic State. The request also includes sales of combat aircraft, tanks, and armored vehicles to replenish equipment lost or seized by the Islamic State. The Administration's FY2016 budget request includes $5.64 billion in global humanitarian assistance, with $1.63 billion in OCO funds for Syria and Iraq crisis. Over $4 billion has been allocated for humanitarian needs since 2011. The Administration and Congress have been discussing reprogramming U.S. foreign aid policy in response to the changing realities in the Middle East since the Arab Spring in 2011. The State Department and USAID have been repurposing foreign aid towards countries in transition or civil war using existing authorities, but the Administration has found this approach inadequate due to limitations in transparency, efficiency, and flexibility of aid allocation. The Administration sought more legal latitude and funding from Congress in FY2013 and FY2014 to respond to the needs of Arab transition states. Proposals for a Middle East and North Africa Incentive Fund (MENA-IF) were made, but Congress did not authorize or appropriate any funding due to concerns about broad spending authorities. In FY2015, the Administration requested increased transition support funding for the MENA Initiative using ESF and INCLE-OCO funds. The request aimed to support reforms in transitional states with lower ESF funds compared to previous MENA-IF requests. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 included language supporting a \"Middle East Response.\" The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2015 included language supporting \"Middle East Response,\" providing flexibility for the Department of State to transfer funding between accounts for unanticipated contingencies. There have been proposals to restructure U.S. assistance to Egypt, with concerns about military aid subsidizing conventional weaponry purchases that may not align with current threats facing Egypt. The White House announced the release of selected weapons systems to Egypt, but will stop providing cash flow financing starting in FY2018. This decision was made due to concerns that military aid could perpetuate control by the military-guided state and not align with current threats facing Egypt. The White House announced the release of selected weapons systems to Egypt but will stop providing cash flow financing starting in FY2018. Critics argue that financing expensive weapons undermines congressional independence, while supporters believe aid should continue due to Egypt's fight against terrorism. The Administration's decision to phase out cash flow financing to Egypt is part of a broader policy approach balancing national security interests and democratic principles. The White House will maintain security cooperation with Egypt, including ending weapons suspension and continuing other forms of assistance. The President's proposed policy changes aim to maintain security cooperation with Egypt while moving away from traditional military-to-military foundations. Public discussion on these changes has been limited, with the House committee-approved FY2016 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill requiring consultation on restructuring military assistance for Egypt. Annual appropriations legislation also imposes conditions on aid to Palestinians. Legislation imposes conditions on aid to Palestinians, including restrictions on aid for Hamas, the Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation, and PA employees in Gaza. Aid for a future Palestinian state or government must be contingent on commitments toward peaceful coexistence with Israel. Efforts to gain recognition for Palestinian statehood and pressure Israel have led to delays in aid disbursement. Congress has imposed conditions on aid to Palestinians, including restrictions on aid for Hamas and the Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation. ESF aid for the PA is prohibited if they support an ICC investigation against Israeli nationals. The Palestinians have initiated an investigation against Israeli nationals for alleged crimes. Some lawmakers have called for the suspension of aid to the Palestinians in response to ICC actions. The State Department has stated that aid to the PA is still under evaluation for compliance with relevant legislation. Observers believe that the situation is escalating amidst violent upheaval. The U.S. is requesting $134 million for Tunisia in FY2016 to support its transition to democracy, combat terrorism, and promote economic growth. This is more than double the FY2015 request and follows $580 million in aid allocated between FY2011 and FY2014. The House and Senate Committees reported FY2016 appropriations bills for Tunisia, with significant funding increases compared to previous years."
