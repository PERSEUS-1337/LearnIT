    "content": "The Act titled \"Hydrographic Services Improvement Act Amendments of 2007\" redesignates sections 302 through 306 as sections 303 through 307 and adds a new section 302 for findings and purposes. The Congress finds that in 2007, the Survey of the Coast, established by President Thomas Jefferson in 1807, evolved into the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, providing research, development, and services for safe navigation along the coastline. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration provides services for safe navigation along the coastline, including hydrographic surveying, cartography, tides observation, and maintenance of a national spatial reference system. Federal expertise in hydrographic data is crucial for supporting marine transportation and promoting international trade and commerce. The Nation's marine transportation system is increasingly congested, with the volume of international maritime commerce expected to double in the next 20 years. Nearly half of the cargo in U.S. waters is oil, refined petroleum products, or other hazardous substances, supporting national needs for emergency response, homeland security, and marine resources. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration leads in establishing national standards for hydrographic data and services, supporting emergency response, homeland security, marine resource conservation, coastal resiliency, and ocean science advancement. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Office of Coast Survey serves as the U.S. National Hydrographer and provides hydrographic expertise for baseline and boundary demarcation, including marine territorial limits like the Exclusive Economic Zone. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Office of Coast Survey serves as the U.S. National Hydrographer, providing expertise for marine territorial limits like the Exclusive Economic Zone. The Act aims to enhance efficiency, competitiveness, safety, and environmental protection through research and technology development. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Office of Coast Survey provides data and services to support safe international trade, interstate commerce, homeland security, emergency response, and coastal resiliency. This includes hydrographic surveys, electronic navigational charts, real-time tide and current information, shoreline surveys, and geodesy data with various applications. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Office of Coast Survey provides data and services for various management applications such as storm surge, tsunami, coastal flooding, erosion, and pollution monitoring. It also promotes integrated ocean and coastal mapping, supports research in hydrographic data and technologies to enhance efficiency and accuracy. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Office of Coast Survey aims to enhance the efficiency, accuracy, and availability of hydrographic data and services to promote scientific and technological competitiveness. It also provides leadership in hydrographic and related services, sciences, and technologies nationally and internationally. SEC. 4. CHANGES IN DEFINITIONS. Section 303 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 is amended to define hydrographic data as information acquired through various surveying methods for providing hydrographic services. The amendment to Section 303 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 includes the management, maintenance, and dissemination of various types of geospatial and hydrographic information, such as nautical charts and databases derived from hydrographic data. The Coast and Geodetic Survey functions and duties were outlined in a legislation approved on August 6, 1947. SEC. 5. CHANGES IN FUNCTIONS OF THE ADMINISTRATOR. Section 304 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 is amended to fulfill data gathering and dissemination duties under the Coast and Geodetic Survey Act, promote safe marine transportation, and fulfill the purposes of the Act. The Administrator may procure, lease, evaluate, test, develop, and operate vessels, equipment, and technologies to fulfill data gathering and dissemination duties under the Coast and Geodetic Survey Act, promote safe marine transportation, and fulfill the purposes of the Act. The Administrator is responsible for developing, operating, and maintaining vessels, equipment, and technologies for safe navigation and hydrographic data acquisition. They also design and operate real-time hydrographic monitoring systems to enhance navigation safety and efficiency. Additionally, they may acquire hydrographic data to support conservation and management of coastal and ocean resources. The Administrator may acquire hydrographic data and provide services to save lives, protect property, and support commerce during emergencies, disasters, and security needs. They have the authority to create joint centers and enter into contracts for coastal and ocean resource management. The Administrator has the authority to award contracts for acquiring hydrographic data in accordance with the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949. Changes were made to the quality assurance program and the hydrographic services review panel under the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998. Section 306 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 is amended to update the composition of the panel, with 15 voting members appointed by the Administrator and nonvoting members from the Joint Hydrographic Institute and NOAA. The voting members of the panel appointed by the Administrator must be qualified in disciplines related to hydrographic data and services, as defined in the Act. Nonvoting members include individuals from the Joint Hydrographic Institute and NOAA. The panel's voting members will be reimbursed for expenses incurred in performing their duties, such as travel and per diem. SEC. 8. Changes to authorization of appropriations under the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998, authorizing $168,771,000 for fiscal year 2008 and necessary sums for fiscal years 2009 through 2012."
