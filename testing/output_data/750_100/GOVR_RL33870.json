    "content": "The 107th Congress approved reauthorization legislation to extend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act through FY2007. The President requested $324.2 million for FY2008, with $100 million for state grants and $224.2 million for national programs. For FY2007, the President requested $216.0 million for national programs only. No funding was requested for state grants. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended funding for the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act program, with varying amounts allocated for state grants. Congress appropriated $568.8 million for the program in FY2006, with funding for both state grants and national programs. The program is currently operating at FY2006 levels under a continuing resolution. The 107th Congress SDFSCA reauthorization and appropriations for the SDFSC program were discussed in a report until February 15, 2007. The program aims to prevent drug abuse and violence in schools through federal funding awarded to state and local educational agencies. The No Child Left Behind Act amended and reauthorized SDFSCA as Part A of Title IV\u201421st Century Schools. Funds from the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act (SDFSCA) are allocated to state and local educational agencies (SEAs and LEAs) in all 50 states, DC, and Puerto Rico. The funds support programs to prevent youth from using drugs and committing violent acts in schools. National programs receive discretionary funds for projects to prevent drug abuse and violence across all educational levels. $650 million was authorized for state grants in FY2002, with continued funding through FY2007. 1% or $4.75 million (whichever is greater) is reserved for Guam and American territories. Funds from the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act are allocated to state and local educational agencies in all 50 states, DC, and Puerto Rico to prevent drug abuse and violence in schools. A portion of the funds is reserved for Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, as well as for programs for Indian youth and native Hawaiians. The remaining funds are distributed to states based on school-aged population and ESEA Title I, Part A concentration grants. No state receives less than 0.5% of the total allotted amount. State grant funds may be redistributed if not used within two years of initial award. A limitation states that national program funds cannot increase unless state grant funding is at least 10% more than the previous year's appropriation. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act removed the \"limitation\" provision for FY2006, but it did not apply as the national programs appropriation was less than the previous year. The Administration did not propose funding for state grants in FY2007, so the limitation provision was not relevant. 20% of the state allotment is given to the Governor for competitive grants, with a maximum of 3% for administrative costs. At least 93% of the allotment must be distributed to LEAs for drug prevention programs. Unused state grant funds can be redistributed after two years. In FY2002, SEAs must distribute 93% of their allotment to LEAs for drug and violence prevention programs. 60% is based on ESEA Title I, Part A funds, and 40% on school enrollments. LEAs can use up to 2% for administrative costs, while SEAs can use up to 3% for program administration. Additionally, SEAs could use 1% of their allotment for a management information system in FY2002. Funds were allocated for the implementation of a uniform management information and reporting system (UMIRS) to collect data on truancy rates, violence, drug-related crimes, curricula, and drug use among minors. SEAs could use funds directly or through grants and contracts for this purpose. The state grants component of the SDFSC program was rated \"ineffective\" by the Administration's instrument, PART, due to the inability to demonstrate program effectiveness. The state grants component of the SDFSC program was deemed \"ineffective\" by the Administration because it lacked evidence of program effectiveness and distributed funds too thinly. Approximately 64% of LEAs received less than $10,000 per year, which was considered insufficient for effective drug prevention and school safety programs. The program also lacked a track record of producing measurable outcomes, leading to its proposed termination due to fiscal constraints. The Administration proposed to terminate the state grants program in the FY2007 budget to prioritize funding for national SDFSC programs, which were seen as more promising in achieving results and expanding knowledge on drug and violence prevention methods. National programs were believed to provide direct support to select LEAs with sufficient funding to make a difference, allowing for progress assessment, accountability, and effectiveness measurement by grantees and evaluators. The Department of Education uses national survey data to assess the impact of state grants program on teen drug use and violence. They are conducting evaluations to measure the effectiveness of promising interventions and support grants. The Department of Education uses national survey data to assess the impact of state grants program on teen drug use and violence. They conduct evaluations to measure the effectiveness of interventions and support grants for improving data collection and reporting outcomes of SDFSC programs. The authorization for national programs allows consultation with relevant authorities to administer programs aimed at preventing violence and illegal drug use among students. In FY1999, the National Coordinator Initiative was created under national programs allowing LEAs to recruit, hire, and train persons to serve as SDFSC program coordinators in middle schools. ED officials believed that middle school students were at the age where they were most likely to begin experimenting with drugs and becoming more involved in violence and crime. NCLBA expanded the coverage of this permissive activity for national coordinators to serve. The National Coordinator Initiative was created in FY1999 to recruit, hire, and train SDFSC program coordinators in middle schools. NCLBA expanded this permissive activity for national coordinators to serve as drug prevention and school safety program coordinators in schools with notable drug and safety problems. Funding for this initiative was terminated in FY2004, with funds potentially available as formula grants to states based on school-aged population and ESEA Title I, Part A concentration grants. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMSHA) allows school districts to develop programs to reduce alcohol abuse in secondary schools. Grants can be awarded to assist in creating mentoring programs for children in middle schools. Other initiatives include grants to assist localities directly. The ED Secretary will provide grants to assist localities affected by hate crimes and establish a School Security Technology and Resource Center at Sandia National Laboratories. Additionally, a National Center for School and Youth Safety will be created by the ED Secretary and the Attorney General. The ED Secretary and the Attorney General will establish a School and Youth Safety Office to provide emergency assistance, establish a student hotline, offer consultation on school safety, compile best practices, and reach out to rural communities. The President requested $324.2 million for the program in FY2008. The President requested $216.0 million for the SDFSC program in FY2008, with the House Appropriations Committee recommending a total of $526.0 million, including $310 million for state grants. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $492.5 million for the program, with $310 million for state grants and $182.5 million for national programs. In FY2008, the President requested $216.0 million for the SDFSC program. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $492.5 million for the program, with $310 million for state grants and $182.5 million for national programs. In FY2008, the President did not request funding for the mentoring program, which received $19 million in FY2007 as part of a two-year phase-out. Congress appropriated $49.3 million for mentoring in FY2006, meeting the President's request despite a 1% budget reduction. The Administration did not request funding for the Alcohol Abuse Reduction program from FY2005 through FY2008, as it was considered duplicative. Congress, however, appropriated $32.7 million for the program in FY2005 and FY2006, with funding slightly reduced to $32.4 million in FY2006 due to a budget rescission. The House Appropriations Committee did not recommend funding for AAR in FY2007, but the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $32.4 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $32.4 million for the SDFSC program, operating at FY2006 levels. The Gun-Free Schools Act is part of SDFSCA, requiring states to have laws expelling students bringing weapons to school. The Gun-Free Schools Act allows the chief administering officer of a LEA to modify expulsion requirements on a case-by-case basis. States can provide educational services to expelled students in alternative settings. LEAs must comply with expulsion requirements, report expulsion details to the ED Secretary, and have a policy on firearms to receive GFSA funds. The Gun-Free Schools Act requires LEAs to report any student bringing a firearm to school to the criminal justice system. Exceptions include firearms lawfully stored in locked vehicles on school property or used for approved activities with safety measures. Bills related to school safety in the 109th Congress mostly died except for H.R. 3010. H.R. 3010, the Department of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2006, was amended by the Senate to require a study on violence prevention programs funded under SDFSCA. However, this amendment did not become law as it was not included in the conference agreement. Another amendment to increase funding for the SDFSC program was ruled out of order by the chairman. The chairman ruled out an amendment to increase funding for the SDFSC program. Other measures introduced included bills related to bullying and gang prevention, school violence prevention, student and teacher safety, drug-free varsity sports, and fighting gangs and empowering youth. The bill H.R. 284 aimed to amend the SDFSCA to include bullying and gang prevention programs, as well as drug and violence prevention. It was introduced by Representative Shimkus in 2005 and referred to the House Education and the Workforce Committee and the House Judiciary Committee. The School Violence Prevention Act of 2005 (H.R. 3655) introduced by Representative Baca aimed to include bullying and harassment prevention programs under the definition of violence. It directed the ED Secretary to review and revise prevention program guidelines to align with a 2002 study. The Student and Teacher Safety Act of 2006 (H.R. 5295) was introduced by Representative Geoff Davis on May 4, 2006. It required LEAs to have policies allowing teachers to search students under reasonable suspicion for weapons on school property. The House passed the measure on September 19, 2006, and it was referred to the Senate HELP Committee on September 20. The Drug Free Varsity Sports Act of 2005 (S. 1974) introduced by Senator Bill Nelson aimed to test high school students for performance-enhancing drug use through statewide pilot programs. The Fighting Gangs and Empowering Youth Act of 2006 (S. 4028) introduced by Senator Menendez focused on addressing gang-related issues. Non-compliance with safety requirements would result in denial of SDFSCA funds for LEAs after FY2008. The Empowering Youth Act of 2006 (S. 4028) introduced by Senator Menendez aimed to reauthorize SDFSCA, increase state grants authorization level, allocate funds for national programs, and require LEAs to hire gang prevention coordinators and drug prevention coordinators. Additionally, it would reserve funds for mentoring programs. The bill proposed allocating funds for mentoring programs, with a priority given to serving elementary and middle school children in rural and high crime areas, troubled homes, or schools with violence problems. Additionally, it included an Anti-Gang Discretionary Grant for nonprofit groups to create programs assisting public schools. The Safe Schools Against Violence in Education Act (SAVE Act) was introduced in the 110th Congress to amend the ESEA, prioritizing programs targeting teens in high-crime communities. The SAVE Act aims to allow students in unsafe schools or victims of violent crimes on school property to transfer to a safe public school within the same district, including private charter schools. Counseling or removal of offenders may also be considered. H.R. 354 allows violent crime victims at public schools to transfer to a safe school within the same district, including charter schools. It expands the definition of victimization to include incidents on school buses or at school functions, and offers counseling or removal of offenders as options. In the 110th Congress, the Administration recommends restructuring the SDFSC program to focus on creating safe, drug-free school environments. This includes consolidating national programs into a flexible grant program with priorities such as managing emergencies, violence prevention, school culture, and character education. Congress may consider reauthorization proposals related to drug testing, school culture, and character education under the SDFSCA. Policy makers might also discuss the need for K-12 schools to report school crime data to law enforcement agencies, as there is currently no federal mandate for this. ED data on school crime is based on surveys and studies, not actual reported crimes. The Department of Justice (DOJ) may be considered for responsibility in school safety and crime data collection instead of the Department of Education (ED) due to DOJ's expertise in public safety and crime analysis. The DOJ maintains the Uniform Crime Reporting System and has more experience in collecting and analyzing crime data compared to the ED. The effectiveness of state grant programs under the ED was questioned in a PART assessment due to a lack of evidence showing their success. Consideration may be given to restructuring the responsibility for state grant programs. One potential option for restructuring state grant programs is to divide responsibilities between different departments. For example, ED could focus on drug and alcohol prevention, suicide prevention, and curriculum-based programs in collaboration with HHS. Meanwhile, DOJ could oversee school safety, security, and emergency preparedness programs due to its expertise in public safety. Another option could be allowing K-12 schools to apply for DHS funding for increased security measures. The curr_chunk discusses the potential eligibility of K-12 schools for national Critical Infrastructure programs and the unintended consequences of the Unsafe School Choice provision. It raises concerns about the pressure on state education officials to define persistently dangerous schools in a way that local schools would never meet the criteria. The curr_chunk highlights concerns about the potential underreporting of school crime and violence by officials to avoid being labeled as persistently dangerous schools, which could impact their eligibility for funding for violence prevention grants. The lack of corroborating data may prevent schools from qualifying for violence prevention grants. The 'persistently dangerous' component of NCLB lacks funding to help schools improve safety programs, while budgets cut funds that could prevent schools from becoming 'persistently dangerous'."
