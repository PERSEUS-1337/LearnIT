    "title": "AB 1847",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The Legislature amended Section 19851 of the Revenue and Taxation Code to address the low participation rate in the federal Earned Income Tax Credit program, resulting in unclaimed federal dollars by working poor families in California. In 2015, California authorized a state EITC to boost the poverty-reducing impact of the federal EITC for the poorest working Californians. To alleviate tax burden on working poor individuals and families, enhance their wages and income, and ensure access to federal and state Earned Income Tax Credits, California will provide information to help them claim these credits on their tax returns. The act aims to assist eligible taxpayers by providing notices from employers and state agencies about the EITC, and ensuring they claim both federal and state credits. The Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to define \"employer\" as a California employer subject to providing unemployment insurance. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to the federal and California earned income tax credits, including the definition of an employee covered by unemployment insurance. It also specifies state departments and agencies that serve those who may qualify for these tax credits. The curr_chunk amends the Revenue and Taxation Code to require employers to notify employees about eligibility for federal and California Earned Income Tax Credits when providing annual wage summaries. State departments and agencies must inform program recipients annually about potential eligibility for federal and California Earned Income Tax Credits, either between January and April or during regular contact via various communication methods. State departments and agencies are encouraged to find effective ways to notify recipients of federal and California EITC eligibility, ensuring the notice aligns with specified language requirements. The employer must provide notification to employees either in person or by mail, including instructions on obtaining IRS and Franchise Tax Board notices, or a notice with similar language. The employer must provide notification to employees about the availability of federal and California EITC, with specific language required in the notice. Posting on a bulletin board or sending through office mail is not sufficient, but encouraged for informing all employees. Amendments to this section apply to notices given after the effective date of the act. Based on your annual earnings, you may be eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) from the federal government. The EITC is a refundable federal income tax credit for low-income working individuals and families. It does not affect certain welfare benefits like Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income, food stamps, low-income housing, or temporary assistance for needy families. Even if you don't owe federal taxes, you must file a federal tax return to receive the EITC. Fill out the EITC form in the federal income tax return booklet for more information on eligibility. To inquire about eligibility for the federal Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), contact the IRS at 1-800-829-3676 or visit www.irs.gov. The California Earned Income Tax Credit (California EITC) is available starting from the 2015 tax year for low-income working individuals and families. It is a refundable state income tax credit that does not affect eligibility for welfare benefits. To claim the California EITC, file a California income tax return and complete form FTB 3514. For more information on eligibility and how to obtain the necessary forms, seek assistance with filing. To obtain the necessary California forms and get help filing for the California Earned Income Tax Credit, contact the Franchise Tax Board at 1-800-852-5711 or visit their website at www.ftb.ca.gov. The amendments to this section apply to notices provided after the effective date of the act."
