The Act \"Nigerian Democracy and Civil Society Empowerment Act of 1999\" acknowledges the progress made by the current regime in Nigeria towards liberalizing the political environment. It also mentions the establishment of a timeframe for a transition to civilian rule and efforts to cooperate with the United States in halting drug trafficking. Limited sanctions have been imposed by the international community in response to human rights violations and political repression in Nigeria since 1993. Despite some sanctions being lifted due to recent political liberalization, Nigeria still has decrees in place that suspend constitutional protection of human rights, allow indefinite detention without charge, and revoke civilian court jurisdiction over executive actions. Nigeria is obligated to conduct fair elections as a party to international human rights agreements. Nigeria, as a leading military force in ECOWAS peacekeeping, has played a major role in securing peace in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Despite optimism about progress, recent events in the Niger Delta highlight the critical need for fair elections to express the will of the electors.
