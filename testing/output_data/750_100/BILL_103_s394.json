    "content": "Credit for payments or contributions to certain cooperative research organizations. The amendment allows for a 50 percent credit on qualified cooperative research expenditures. The amendment introduces a 50 percent credit on qualified cooperative research expenditures, defined as contributions to research consortia for qualified research. The taxpayer's contributions to qualified cooperative research consortia for qualified research are limited by the private source funding ratio. The private source funding ratio for taxpayer contributions to qualified cooperative research consortia is calculated as 50% of the organization's gross receipts (excluding governmental support) for the previous taxable year divided by the total gross receipts. The private source funding ratio for taxpayer contributions to qualified cooperative research consortia is calculated based on a formula that includes 50% of the organization's gross receipts for the previous taxable year, as well as percentages from the second and third preceding years. Contributions representing costs allocated to services performed by a taxpayer are not considered qualified contributions. Contributions exceeding cash contributions, overhead, and one-third of the salary and benefits allocated to services performed by a taxpayer's employees are considered qualified contributions to a qualified cooperative research consortium. Contributions exceeding one-third of the consortium's total nongovernmental support for the taxable year are considered qualified contributions to a qualified cooperative research consortium. If the consortium has fewer than 5 participants making nongovernmental contributions, each person's qualified contributions will be reduced by 20 percent if there are 4 participants. The term 'qualified cooperative research consortium' refers to an organization registered under the National Cooperative Research Act of 1984, with a reduction in qualified contributions by 20 percent if there are 4 participants or by 40 percent if there are 3 participants. A qualified cooperative research consortium must have at least 3 contributors, with specific contribution limits to ensure diversity. A qualified cooperative research consortium must have at least 3 contributors, with contribution limits to ensure diversity. Contributions must not exceed 50% from a single member or 85% from two members, and contributors must be engaged in the same trade or business. Special rules apply for noncash contributions. Contributions other than cash, including services provided by a taxpayer's employees, are considered at their cost. Overhead costs for services by employees are included. Amounts for qualified cooperative research expenditures cannot be double-counted. Prepaid contributions are also addressed. Prepaid contributions to qualified cooperative research consortia for research conducted after the taxable year are treated as paid or incurred during the research period. Each consortium must report its certification, private funding ratio, and other details to the Secretary. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after the date of enactment of this Act. Each consortium must report its certification, private funding ratio, and other details to the Secretary."
