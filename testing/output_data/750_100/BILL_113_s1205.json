    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Local Energy Supply and Resiliency Act of 2013\". It includes findings and purposes. Congress finds that a significant amount of energy, more than 27% of total energy consumption in the United States, is wasted as heat from power plants. This waste heat, which accounts for 36% of total energy consumption, can be recovered and used for building or industrial heating purposes. Renewable energy resources in the United States can be utilized for local thermal and electric energy needs, enhancing energy supply reliability and resilience during extreme weather events or fossil fuel shortages. District energy systems utilizing local waste heat and renewable energy resources can strengthen US industrial competitiveness, reduce reliance on fossil fuels and emissions, increase energy supply resiliency and security, and boost local economies by creating jobs. District energy systems tap waste heat and renewable energy resources, serving various institutions and areas. They help reduce peak power demand and constraints on power transmission by shifting power demand through thermal storage. District energy systems can reduce peak power demand by shifting power demand through thermal storage, generating power near load centers with a CHP system, and meeting air conditioning demand through chilled water delivery. Evaluation and implementation of district energy systems involve technical, economic, legal, and institutional issues, often requiring technical assistance. The Act aims to promote the use of waste heat and renewable energy to reduce fossil fuel consumption, enhance energy supply resiliency, and decrease air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Lack of capital funding is a major obstacle to utilizing local waste heat and renewable energy resources. The Act aims to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, strengthen industrial competitiveness, and retain energy dollars in local economies. It facilitates the implementation of local energy infrastructure through technical assistance and low-cost financing. The Act facilitates the construction of local energy infrastructure through loan guarantees. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The curr_chunk defines \"combined heat and power system\" as a system that generates electric energy and heat efficiently, and \"district energy system\" as a system that provides thermal energy to buildings from one or more plants. The curr_chunk defines \"local energy infrastructure\" as a system that recovers or produces energy from waste or renewable resources, and generates electricity using a combined heat and power system under the Loan Guarantee Program. The curr_chunk defines a microgrid as a group of interconnected loads and distributed energy resources within defined electrical boundaries that can act as a single controllable entity with respect to the grid. The curr_chunk explains that a microgrid can operate in grid-connected or island-mode and defines renewable energy resources. The curr_chunk defines renewable thermal energy as heating or cooling energy derived from renewable sources, including natural sources like cold lake or ocean water, or other sources determined by the Secretary. The curr_chunk defines thermal energy as heating or cooling energy in the form of hot water, steam, chilled water, or other media used for various purposes. The curr_chunk specifies sources of thermal energy, including exhaust gases, hot liquids, and waste gas from industrial processes. The curr_chunk outlines criteria for waste energy sources that can be utilized, including condenser water and other forms of waste energy as determined by the Secretary. It specifies that the waste energy must not be currently used in existing facilities or conventionally used in new facilities. The technical assistance program outlined in Section 4 aims to support the utilization of waste energy sources, as determined by the Secretary, that are not currently used in existing facilities or conventionally used in new facilities. The Secretary will establish a program to provide technical assistance for identifying opportunities to use waste energy or renewable energy resources in local energy infrastructure. The program will provide technical assistance for utilizing waste energy or renewable resources, including assessment of characteristics, utility interconnection, negotiation of contracts, permitting, marketing, business planning, financial analysis, and engineering design. Information dissemination will include topics from successful case studies. The program offers technical assistance for utilizing waste energy or renewable resources, including assessment, design, and operation software. Nonprofit or for-profit entities are eligible for grants covering up to 100% of initial assessment costs. The program provides technical assistance for identifying local energy opportunities and offers grants to cover feasibility studies, guidance on overcoming barriers, and detailed engineering of local energy infrastructure. Eligible entities must submit an application for assistance. The program offers technical assistance for local energy opportunities through a competitive application process. Priority is given to projects that aim to maximize the elimination of fossil fuel use. The program aims to maximize the elimination of fossil fuel use, strengthen local energy supplies, boost energy infrastructure resilience, minimize environmental impact, facilitate renewable energy use, increase industrial competitiveness, and create local jobs. Rules and procedures must be established within 180 days. The Secretary must establish rules and procedures within 180 days for the program aimed at reducing fossil fuel use, strengthening energy supplies, and promoting renewable energy. $150 million is authorized for fiscal years 2014 through 2018 for this program. SEC. 5. LOAN GUARANTEES FOR LOCAL ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE. This section introduces the Local Energy Infrastructure Loan Guarantee Program under Title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The Secretary may provide loan guarantees for local energy infrastructure projects defined in the Local Energy Supply and Resiliency Act of 2013, using $4 billion from the remaining loan guarantee authority. Unobligated funds from section 1703 appropriations can also be used for these guarantees. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to include a new item for the cost of loan guarantees under this section. SEC. 6. DEFINITION OF INVESTMENT AREA. Amends the Community Development Banking and Financial Institutions Act of 1994 to include local energy infrastructure as an investment area."
