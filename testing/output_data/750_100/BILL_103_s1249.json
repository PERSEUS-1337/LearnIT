    "content": "The Act titled \"Tuberculosis Prevention and Control Amendments of 1993\" is cited as the short title. Between 10-15 million people in the US have tuberculosis, with 26,000 new cases yearly and 1,700 deaths. Reported cases rose from 22,201 in 1985 to 26,673 in 1992. 14.4% of cases are resistant to at least one drug. In 1992, drug-resistant tuberculosis strains cost over $150,000 to treat, with a 40-60% mortality rate. Cases were reported in all 50 states, with drug-resistant cases in 36 states, DC, and Puerto Rico. 27% of cases occurred in foreign-born individuals, and one-third of the world's population harbors tuberculosis. Among infectious diseases, tuberculosis is the number one killer in the world with 8,000,000 new cases and 2,900,000 deaths annually, affecting one third of the global population. SEC. 3. PROGRAMS OF CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION. The text chunk discusses amending the provision of services for prevention, control, and elimination of diseases under the Public Health Service Act. It includes changes in funding for fiscal years 1994 to 1997 and requirements for State Tuberculosis Plans. The text chunk outlines requirements for State Tuberculosis Plans under a grant for prevention, control, and elimination of tuberculosis. Plans must ensure services reach high-risk individuals and areas with high infection rates, and collaborate with various entities and organizations. The text chunk discusses the use of grant funds for directly observed therapy or effective interventions for populations with high rates of tuberculosis infection. It also amends the Public Health Service Act to include research, demonstration projects, education, and training. The Secretary may conduct or support research and training for tuberculosis prevention, control, and treatment using grant funds. $26,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 1994, with additional funding for subsequent years. The authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 1995 through 1997 is in addition to previous authorizations. A technical amendment is made to Section 317(j)(2) of the Public Health Service Act. SEC. 4. Research and research training regarding tuberculosis is added to the Public Health Service Act. Section 447 of the Public Health Service Act authorizes the Director of the Institute to conduct basic research and training on tuberculosis. This amends Section 446 to include the Institute. Authorization of appropriations for this purpose is also included in Section 408(a). For research on tuberculosis through the National Institute on Allergy and Infectious Diseases, $46,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 1994, with additional funding for fiscal years 1995 through 1997. This authorization does not affect any other funding availability for the same purpose. SEC. 5. RESEARCH THROUGH THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION. A new section, SEC. 512A, is added for tuberculosis drug and device research under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs will implement a tuberculosis drug and device research program, providing assistance to other agencies, reviewing medical devices for tuberculosis, and conducting research on drugs and devices. $5,000,000 is authorized annually for this program."
