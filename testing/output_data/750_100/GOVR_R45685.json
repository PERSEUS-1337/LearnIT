    "content": "Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 provides legal relief for victims of sexual abuse and harassment at educational institutions. The statute prohibits discrimination based on sex in programs receiving federal funding. The Supreme Court has ruled that schools can be held liable for damages if they respond indifferently to abuse or harassment by staff. Court has held that school boards may be liable under Title IX for a deliberately indifferent response to student-on-student sexual harassment. Federal agencies like the Department of Education have also determined that educational institutions can be responsible for instances of sexual harassment under Title IX. Title IX is enforced through private rights of action against schools and by federal agencies providing funding to educational programs. Title IX mandates compliance with antidiscrimination rules for educational programs receiving federal funding at all levels. When any part of a school or institution gets federal funds, the entire operation falls under Title IX, even though sexual abuse is not explicitly mentioned in the law. Title IX requires compliance with antidiscrimination rules for educational programs receiving federal funding, covering all operations. While the law does not explicitly mention sexual abuse or harassment, the Department of Education has issued guidance documents instructing schools on their responsibilities under Title IX regarding allegations of sexual harassment. Educational institutions have developed procedures to investigate and respond to such allegations. The Department of Education has issued guidance on responding to sexual harassment allegations, with proposed regulations that could change institutions' responsibilities. Federal courts have interpreted Title IX in cases where students sue schools for damages. The report discusses students' rights to bring actions against educational institutions for sexual abuse or harassment, focusing on how federal agencies enforce Title IX and examining constitutional challenges against public universities. It also analyzes proposed regulations that could change schools' responsibilities in responding to allegations. Title IX prohibits sex discrimination in educational programs receiving federal funding, but does not explicitly allow victims to sue for violations. Title IX does not expressly prohibit sexual harassment or define unlawful sexual abuse. Federal courts have established the remedial scheme for victims seeking relief under Title IX through a private right of action. The Supreme Court interpreted Title IX to allow for a private right of action against federally funded educational institutions for sexual harassment, including an implied damages remedy. The Court has set a high standard for establishing liability under Title IX for sexual abuse or harassment by teachers or students, based on the \"deliberate indifference\" standard. In a Title IX private right of action for damages, educational institutions are not strictly liable for sexual harassment or abuse by teachers or principals. Liability depends on the institution's response to the conduct, with liability only arising from a deficient response amounting to \"deliberate indifference.\" The private right of action under Title IX holds educational institutions liable only for a response amounting to \"deliberate indifference\" to harassment or abuse. This right provides a legal remedy for victims of sex discrimination through specific relief or damages, contrasting with administrative enforcement focusing on institutional policies. Two Supreme Court decisions further shape this legal framework. The Supreme Court decisions Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School District and Davis N ext Friend LaShonda D. v. Monroe County Board of Education establish the liability standard for educational institutions under Title IX for damages related to sexual abuse or harassment. The institution's liability is based on \"deliberate indifference\" in responding to such conduct, creating a private right of action for victims. The Supreme Court in Gebser rejected the idea of strict liability for educational institutions in cases of sexual harassment or abuse by a principal or teacher towards a student under Title IX. Liability only applies if the institution's response to known discrimination was deliberately indifferent. Liability is based on the institution's failure to adequately address misconduct, not the misconduct itself. The Supreme Court in Gebser established that educational institutions are only liable under Title IX for sexual harassment or abuse if they show deliberate indifference to known misconduct, not for the misconduct itself. The Court based this standard on speculation of how Congress would have addressed the issue, relying on the statute's administrative enforcement provision for guidance. The Supreme Court in Gebser established that educational institutions are only liable under Title IX for sexual harassment or abuse if they show deliberate indifference to known misconduct, not for the misconduct itself. The Court relied on the statute's administrative enforcement provision for guidance, which requires agencies to provide actual notice to funding recipients before cutting funds for Title IX violations. The Court in Gebser ruled that liability under Title IX requires \"actual notice\" to an \"appropriate person\" and deliberate indifference in response. This standard is based on the administrative enforcement scheme of Title IX, which assumes officials will take action to address violations. The Court found a similar standard in case law under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The Court held that a school district cannot be held liable under Title IX for a teacher's sexual harassment of a student without actual notice and deliberate indifference. Deliberate indifference is a high standard that must cause students to undergo harassment or make them vulnerable to it. The \"deliberate indifference\" standard under Title IX does not require funding recipients to remedy harassment, but their response must be clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances. A plaintiff must show that the recipient's response to sexual abuse or harassment was clearly unreasonable to establish liability. The \"deliberate indifference\" standard under Title IX does not hold funding recipients liable unless their response to sexual abuse or harassment is clearly unreasonable. To succeed in a Title IX suit for damages, a plaintiff must establish \"actual knowledge of discrimination\" before proving \"deliberate indifference\" on the part of the school or entity. The Gebser standard requires the recipient to have \"actual knowledge of discrimination\" and notify an \"appropriate person\" to avoid dismissal of a Title IX claim for damages related to sexual harassment or abuse. The definition of \"appropriate person\" and what constitutes \"actual\" notice have led to disagreements among the circuits. The Supreme Court's liability standard is based on proving \"deliberate indifference.\" The Supreme Court's liability standard for student-to-student harassment requires showing \"deliberate indifference,\" as well as proving that the funding recipient had \"substantial control\" over the harasser and the context of the harassment, that the harassment was severe and pervasive, and that it resulted in denial of educational access. Davis limits a school's liability to situations where substantial control was exercised over the harasser in the context of the harassment. The Supreme Court's liability standard for student-to-student harassment requires showing \"deliberate indifference\" and proving that the funding recipient had \"substantial control\" over the harasser and the context of the harassment. The harassment must be severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive, undermining the victim's educational access. Davis emphasizes the recipient's authority to take remedial action against the harassment. The Supreme Court's standard for student-to-student harassment requires proving \"deliberate indifference\" and showing the funding recipient had \"substantial control\" over the harasser. The harassment must be severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive, denying equal access to educational resources. The Court in Davis emphasized the recipient's authority to address the harassment. The Court emphasized the need for evidence linking harassment to a decline in the victim's grades. Harassment under Title IX must have a systemic effect of denying equal access to education. The Court clarified that a single severe instance of harassment may not meet this standard. The Gebser and Davis decisions establish the responsibility of federally funded educational programs to address harassment. Davis decisions establish that a school receiving federal funding is liable under Title IX for student sexual abuse or harassment only if it showed \"deliberate indifference\" in response. Lower courts vary in interpreting evidence needed for a Title IX claim, some using a \"hostile environment\" analysis for teacher-to-student harassment. In analyzing Title IX claims of teacher-to-student harassment, courts consider elements like \"actual\" notice of discrimination, authorization for corrective action, and deliberate indifference by the funding recipient. For student-to-student harassment claims, plaintiffs must also prove the harassment was severe enough. In Title IX claims, courts require plaintiffs to establish severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive harassment that denies equal access to resources. Federal courts vary on evidence requirements, with failure to satisfy any element leading to claim dismissal. Plaintiffs must show funding recipients had \"actual\" notice of discrimination under Gebser. In Title IX claims, plaintiffs must prove severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive harassment for equal access denial. Courts require evidence of funding recipients having \"actual\" notice of discrimination under Gebser, not just knowledge of potential misconduct. The standard questions what type of allegations constitute \"actual\" notice, such as specific incidents or a substantial risk of abuse. Notification of a perpetrator's past misconduct may also qualify as actual notice. Federal courts differ on the issue of actual notice in cases of sexual harassment or abuse. The standard for evaluating \"actual notice\" is crucial as it determines whether a claim can proceed or be dismissed. In a specific case, the Eleventh Circuit considered whether complaints from two students about the same teacher constituted actual notice. The Eleventh Circuit addressed complaints from two students about the same teacher, alleging sexual harassment. The court found that these reports raised a triable issue of the principal having actual notice of a pattern of harassment. The court observed that lesser harassment may provide actual notice of sexually violent conduct. In Baynard v. Malone, the Fourth Circuit found that despite prior reports of sexual abuse by a sixth grade teacher, the school principal had no actual notice of the abuse. The evidence showed that the principal had met with a former student who reported being molested by the teacher and warned about his behavior. The teacher was accused of sexually molesting children, with reports from another teacher and the school librarian about inappropriate behavior. The principal was said to have been aware of the potential for abuse but lacked evidence of actual notice. The court dismissed the Title IX claim due to lack of evidence that the principal had actual notice of the student abuse. Courts vary in defining \"actual\" notice for Title IX liability in cases of sexual abuse or harassment. The Supreme Court's liability standard for Title IX requires actual notice to an appropriate person with authority to address discrimination. Courts focus on whether the individual had the ability to address misconduct or held a high enough position within the funding recipient's hierarchy. Federal courts have varying interpretations of who qualifies as an \"appropriate person\" under Title IX, especially in the context of elementary or secondary schools. Some courts have determined that a public school principal may, but not always, be considered an appropriate person to address discrimination and take corrective action. Some federal courts have differing views on whether a public school principal can be considered an \"appropriate person\" under Title IX. In Warren ex rel. Good v. Reading School District, the Third Circuit ruled that a principal could be appropriate due to their authority to investigate teacher misconduct. However, the Fourth Circuit in Baynard v. Malone disagreed, stating that a principal may not always qualify as an \"appropriate person.\" The court ruled that a principal may not always be considered an \"appropriate person\" under Title IX, as they lack certain authorities like hiring or firing teachers. In Salazar v. South San Antonio Independent School District, the Fifth Circuit held that a school official who sexually abuses a student cannot be deemed an \"appropriate person.\" The Fifth Circuit ruled that a school principal who sexually abused a student may not be considered an \"appropriate person\" under Title IX, as they lack certain authorities. The court reasoned that the principal's actions should not be treated as official actions of the school district for liability purposes. The Fifth Circuit ruled that a school principal who sexually abused a student may not be considered an \"appropriate person\" under Title IX, as they lack certain authorities. The court reasoned that the principal's actions should not be treated as official actions of the school district for liability purposes, following the Supreme Court's rejection of agency principles to Title IX. In the higher education context, federal courts of appeals analyze whether university employees, such as college deans or athletics directors, qualify as \"appropriate persons\" for Title IX private right of action based on their ranking and responsibilities. In Ross v. University of Tulsa, the Tenth Circuit ruled that campus security officers were not considered \"appropriate persons\" for Title IX purposes, despite their mandatory reporting of sexual assaults. The court likened this reporting to a clerical act and emphasized the need for specific authorities and responsibilities to be deemed an appropriate person under Title IX. The court in Ross v. University of Tulsa ruled that campus security officers, despite mandatory reporting of sexual assaults, were not considered \"appropriate persons\" for Title IX purposes. The court emphasized the need for specific authorities and responsibilities to be deemed appropriate under Title IX, rejecting the argument that participation in investigations of campus violence automatically qualified individuals as \"appropriate persons.\" Based on the legal standard set out in Gebser, a court's determination in discrimination cases will depend on the characteristics of an \"appropriate person\" and evidence of their responsibilities. To prove deliberate indifference, a plaintiff must show that the funding recipient's response was clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances, requiring more than just a failure to respond reasonably. In discrimination cases, to prove deliberate indifference, a plaintiff must show that the funding recipient's response was clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances, requiring more than just a failure to respond reasonably. The recipient's actions in response to allegations of sexual harassment or abuse are closely examined to determine if they amount to deliberate indifference. This includes whether the recipient made no effort to respond to actual notice. Evidence of deliberate indifference in cases of sexual harassment or abuse includes a funding recipient's failure to investigate serious allegations or take disciplinary actions despite repeated reports. Federal case law sets a high bar for proving deliberate indifference, with divergent analyses on what constitutes an inadequate response. In a case involving sexual abuse allegations against a third-grade teacher, the Fifth Circuit ruled that the school district's response did not meet the high bar of deliberate indifference, despite evidence of a deficient reaction. The plaintiffs accused the teacher of abusing male students over four years, but the principal dismissed the allegations and failed to take appropriate action. The court found that the principal's response to sexual abuse allegations against a teacher did not show deliberate indifference, despite evidence of a deficient reaction. The principal interviewed the student, spoke with his mother, and warned the teacher about the allegations. The court concluded that these actions were not inadequate. The Eleventh Circuit found that the school's response to allegations of teacher sexual misconduct was deemed deliberately indifferent due to serious deficiencies in handling complaints from two students about the same teacher. The principal's minimal actions, such as obtaining written statements, were considered inadequate given the notice of a possible pattern of misconduct. The school's response to allegations of teacher sexual misconduct was found to be inadequate by the Eleventh Circuit. Despite reporting complaints to the investigative unit, the principal failed to mention that the allegations involved the same teacher previously under investigation. This lack of action was deemed unreasonable by the court. The Eleventh Circuit found the school's response to teacher sexual misconduct allegations unreasonable. Failure to take corrective measures could be seen as deliberate indifference. Some courts have addressed deliberate indifference allegations not covered in previous court decisions. For example, in Simpson v. University of Colorado, Boulder, the Tenth Circuit discussed a university's alleged official policy of deliberate indifference by not providing adequate training despite an obvious need. The university's football program selected current players to host high school recruits on campus. Plaintiffs alleged sexual assault by football players and recruits during a recruiting visit. The court noted prior knowledge of sexual assaults by the coaching staff, including a rape incident two months before the plaintiffs were assaulted. The university football program had prior knowledge of sexual assaults by the coaching staff, including a rape incident two months before the plaintiffs were assaulted. The head coach resisted recruiting reforms and players received little guidance on their responsibilities as \"player-hosts.\" The handbook provided by the school did not offer guidance on appropriate behavior for player-hosts. The head coach had knowledge of sexual assaults during recruiting visits, no changes were made to the program to prevent assaults, and the university maintained an unsupervised player-host program, leading to a triable issue of deliberate indifference under Title IX. Title IX enforces nondiscrimination based on sex for educational programs receiving federal funding. Violating Title IX can result in termination or suspension of federal funds, not damages to a student. Agencies can issue regulations for enforcement. The Education Amendments of 1974 direct the Secretary of Education to enforce Title IX regulations for educational programs receiving federal assistance. The Secretary of Education plays a prominent role in enforcing Title IX alongside other federal agencies responsible for monitoring compliance with the statute. The Department of Education (ED) enforces Title IX regulations for educational programs receiving federal assistance. The Attorney General coordinates implementation and enforcement of Title IX across the executive branch, with the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division and OCR collaborating in enforcement. OCR has primary responsibility for enforcing Title IX directly against recipients of financial assistance. The Department of Education enforces Title IX regulations for educational programs receiving federal assistance, with primary responsibility for enforcement falling on the Office for Civil Rights (OCR). ED regulations prohibit educational institutions from discriminating on the basis of sex in any education program or activity. Recipients of federal financial assistance must designate a Title IX employee to ensure compliance. Educational institutions must designate a Title IX Coordinator to ensure compliance with regulations on sex-based discrimination. The Office for Civil Rights (OCR) enforces Title IX through periodic reviews, investigations of complaints, and addressing violations found. The Office for Civil Rights enforces Title IX through reviews and investigations of complaints, seeking informal resolution through agreements. If no agreement is reached, formal enforcement measures may be taken, including funding suspension or termination. Title IX does not directly address sexual harassment, but OCR guidance documents interpret it to prohibit sexual harassment and outline responsibilities for educational institutions. The Office for Civil Rights enforces Title IX through reviews and investigations of complaints, seeking informal resolution through agreements. If no agreement is reached, formal enforcement measures may be taken, including funding suspension or termination. Title IX does not directly address sexual harassment, but OCR guidance documents interpret it to prohibit sexual harassment and outline responsibilities for educational institutions. Institutions have different analysis for assessing Title IX liability for harassment compared to Supreme Court case law on private rights of action for damages. ED applies a constructive notice requirement for schools' Title IX responsibility, rather than \"actual notice\" required for suits for damages. ED has articulated baseline standards for how schools must respond to comply. The Office for Civil Rights enforces Title IX through reviews and investigations of complaints, seeking informal resolution through agreements. If no agreement is reached, formal enforcement measures may be taken, including funding suspension or termination. In 1997, OCR released a guidance document stating that sexual harassment of students by school employees, other students, or third parties is a form of sex discrimination prohibited by Title IX. The guidance explained that two general types of conduct constituted sexual harassment: 1. Quid pro quo harassment: wherein a school employee \"explicitly or implicitly\" commits misconduct in the scope of their employment. Sexual harassment under Title IX includes quid pro quo harassment and hostile environment harassment. Quid pro quo harassment involves a school employee conditioning a student's participation on unwelcome sexual advances. Hostile environment harassment creates a severe or pervasive environment that limits a student's ability to benefit from education. The 1997 Guidance explained that schools can be liable for quid pro quo harassment by an employee in a position of authority or for hostile environment harassment by employees. Schools can also be liable for sexual harassment by other students or third parties if a hostile environment exists in the school's programs or activities. The 1997 Guidance outlined that schools can be held accountable for sexual harassment by employees, students, or third parties if a hostile environment is present, and the school fails to promptly address it. The Supreme Court later established a different liability standard in private lawsuits against schools in the Gebser case in 1998. In 1998, the Supreme Court ruled in Gebser that a school district is liable for harassment by a teacher only if it has actual knowledge and responds with deliberate indifference. In Davis the next year, it was established that a plaintiff must show the conduct was severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive to deny equal access to educational opportunities. The Court in Gebser distinguished between actions by a school that could result in Title IX liability for damages in a private right of action, and Title IX administrative requirements imposed by a federal agency in implementing and enforcing the statute. Agencies have the authority to enforce requirements that effectuate Title IX's mandate, even if those requirements do not represent a definition of discrimination under the statute. Agencies enforcing Title IX may require recipients to comply with certain procedures and rescind funding for violations. The Supreme Court decisions set the standard for liability in Title IX damages suits alleging sexual harassment. The Department of Education (ED) issued guidance documents reaffirming its position on school responsibilities under Title IX, including vicarious liability in certain situations. The liability standard imposed by the Supreme Court for Title IX sexual harassment is emphasized in these documents. The liability standard for Title IX sexual harassment violations set by the Supreme Court is different in damages suits compared to administrative enforcement. The OCR's 2001 Revised Sexual Harassment Guidance reaffirmed the agency's 1997 standards, distinct from private damages actions. The OCR's 1997 Guidance on Title IX regulations applies to all federally funded educational institutions, requiring prompt and equitable resolution of sexual harassment complaints. Failure to comply results in a violation of Title IX, necessitating schools to take effective action to end and prevent harassment. The 1997 Guidance on Title IX regulations requires schools to take prompt and effective action to end harassment and prevent its recurrence. The 2001 documents provide guidance on how schools should respond to harassment incidents. The 2001 Guidance on Title IX regulations emphasized that \"unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature\" constitutes sexual harassment and focused on whether the harassment limits a student's ability to participate in school programs based on sex. It aimed to move away from specific labels for types of sexual harassment. The 2001 Guidance on Title IX regulations emphasized that \"unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature\" constitutes sexual harassment, focusing on quid pro quo harassment and hostile environment harassment. Quid pro quo harassment involves conditioning benefits on submission to sexual conduct, while hostile environment harassment requires investigation into the seriousness of the conduct. The 2001 Guidance on Title IX regulations focuses on sexual harassment, distinguishing between quid pro quo harassment and hostile environment harassment. Hostile environment harassment involves evaluating the seriousness of conduct, including whether it was welcome, and can be created by teachers or students. The 2001 Guidance explains that a school's responsibility to address harassment by teachers or school employees depends on whether it occurs within the context of their job responsibilities. If the harassment limits a student's ability to benefit from a school program, the school must stop the behavior, prevent its recurrence, and remedy the situation. The 2001 Guidance states that a school must address harassment by teachers or school employees, regardless of notice, and must prevent its recurrence and remedy the effects for the victim. Sexual harassment within an employee's job responsibilities varies based on factors. Quid pro quo harassment clearly falls within job responsibilities, while hostile environment harassment requires evaluation. The 2001 Guidance emphasizes that schools must address harassment promptly and effectively, even if it occurs outside an employee's job responsibilities. Schools are responsible for stopping and preventing harassment, whether by students, third parties, or employees, that creates a hostile environment. Failure to take prompt action to correct the situation constitutes a violation of Title IX. The school is responsible for ending harassment, preventing its recurrence, and remedying the effects for the student. In cases of sexual harassment, recipients have notice of a sexually hostile environment if a responsible school employee knew or should have known about the harassment. A responsible employee is defined as someone with the authority to address harassment and report misconduct. Schools must take immediate action upon knowing about a hostile environment to comply with Title IX. The 2001 Guidance emphasizes the importance of schools taking immediate and effective action upon notice of potential sexual harassment of students. Regardless of whether a formal complaint is filed, schools must promptly investigate and take steps to end harassment, eliminate a hostile environment, and prevent future occurrences. The 2001 Guidance emphasizes the importance of schools promptly investigating and resolving complaints of harassment. Informal mechanisms may be used if parties agree, but certain procedures like mediation are not appropriate for cases like alleged sexual assault. The 2001 Guidance emphasizes the importance of schools promptly investigating and resolving complaints of harassment, with informal mechanisms being used if parties agree. However, certain procedures like mediation are not appropriate in cases of alleged sexual assault. Additionally, in 2011, OCR issued a Dear Colleague Letter focusing on Title IX obligations for schools dealing with peer-to-peer harassment, defining sexual harassment as unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature. Sexual harassment is defined as unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature, including advances, requests for favors, and other behaviors. It also encompasses sexual violence, which involves non-consensual physical acts. This behavior creates a hostile environment in schools if it interferes with a student's ability to participate or benefit from the program. Title IX requires schools to take immediate action to eliminate student-on-student harassment that creates a hostile environment, even if it occurs off-campus. Schools must also address the effects of the harassment and follow established procedures when a complaint is filed. The Letter stated that schools must consider off-campus conduct when evaluating a hostile environment on campus. It clarified that a criminal investigation into sexual violence does not exempt a school from conducting a Title IX investigation, and schools should not delay their own investigation while waiting for criminal proceedings. Immediate steps to protect students should be taken if necessary. The 2011 Dear Colleague Letter emphasized the importance of promptly resuming and completing a school's fact-finding for Title IX purposes after a criminal investigation by police. It outlined key elements of grievance procedures for resolving sexual harassment complaints, including the use of a preponderance of evidence standard. The 2011 Dear Colleague Letter emphasized the use of a preponderance of evidence standard in school investigations, contrasting it with the prior practice of using a \"clear and convincing\" standard. The Letter also discouraged personal cross-examination in hearings. The 2014 Q&A provided more specific instructions to schools on handling allegations of student-on-student sexual violence under Title IX, clarifying that appeals must be allowed for both parties. It was a guidance document, not a legally enforceable rule. The 2014 Q&A clarified that schools must promptly investigate possible sexual violence and take effective steps to address it. It emphasized that a school violates Title IX when it fails to address serious conduct that creates a hostile environment for students. Title IX requires schools to end sexual violence, eliminate hostile environments, prevent recurrence, and remedy effects. Schools must protect complainants and ensure safety through interim steps. The 2014 Q&A detailed responsibilities of Title IX Coordinators, grievance procedures, and who qualifies as responsible employees. The 2014 Q&A document outlined the responsibilities of Title IX Coordinators, grievance procedures, and the criteria for responsible employees required to report sexual violence allegations. It emphasized the need for schools to conduct thorough investigations and implement remedies beyond just disciplinary sanctions to address hostile environments and prevent recurrence. The 2014 Q&A clarified that Title IX investigations do not require the same procedural protections as criminal proceedings. Schools must conduct their own investigations regardless of ongoing criminal investigations. Schools are not obligated to hold hearings for sexual violence allegations, but if they do, the complainant cannot be required to attend. OCR strongly discourages hearings. In 2014, OCR discouraged schools from allowing parties to personally cross-examine each other in sexual assault cases to prevent trauma and intimidation. Instead, parties could submit questions to a third party for screening and asking on their behalf. Schools developed procedures to comply with Title IX and OCR guidance between 2011 and 2016. Title IX requires educational institutions to have procedures for handling sexual assault allegations, with some flexibility for schools receiving federal funds. However, state actors like public universities must still provide due process protections for the accused. In the public university context, students facing disciplinary sanctions have challenged the Title IX procedures in state and federal courts as unconstitutional, arguing violations of the Due Process Clause. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires states to follow specific procedures when depriving individuals of life, liberty, or property. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires specific procedures to be followed when depriving individuals of life, liberty, or property. It protects against the deprivation of property interests without due process, which must originate from an independent source like state or federal law. Protected property interests must show a legitimate claim of entitlement based on existing rules or understandings. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires specific procedures to be followed when depriving individuals of life, liberty, or property. States must provide due process when depriving individuals of liberty, especially when their reputation or legal status is at stake. Courts balance factors to determine the process due, as outlined in Ma thews v. Eldridge. The Supreme Court in Ma thews v. Eldridge outlined factors to determine due process: the private interest affected, risk of erroneous deprivation, value of additional procedures, and government interest. Individuals with a protected interest are entitled to notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard before deprivation. Due process is flexible and requires procedural protections based on the particular situation. In conducting the balancing of factors pursuant to Mathews v. Eldridge, the severity of the deprivation is a key factor in determining required procedures. The stronger the private interest at risk, the more formal procedures are needed. Goss v. Lopez is the only Supreme Court case focusing on procedural due process in student discipline, where high school students challenged their suspension without a hearing. The Court ruled that public school students have a right to a public education protected by due process, requiring notice and a hearing for suspensions. More formal procedures may be needed for longer suspensions or expulsions. Public universities must adhere to constitutional standards when disciplining students. Public universities must comply with constitutional standards when suspending or expelling students, while private universities do not. Federal courts have ruled that students at public universities have liberty and/or property interests in their education, and that certain disciplinary actions can constitute a deprivation of that interest. Due process requires public schools to provide students with notice and a hearing. Public universities must adhere to constitutional standards for student suspensions and expulsions. Due process mandates that students be informed of charges, evidence, and have a fair hearing. Colleges have varied procedures to address sexual harassment allegations, with challenges from individuals undergoing disciplinary processes. Recent judicial rulings have addressed the constitutionality of disciplinary proceedings in cases of sexual misconduct at public universities. Courts have considered claims such as inadequate notice of charges and denial of the right to confront and challenge the accuser. Recent judicial rulings have addressed the constitutionality of disciplinary proceedings in cases of sexual misconduct at public universities. The accused student was not allowed to confront and challenge witnesses, faced biased decisionmakers, and unfair review processes. Some legal challenges include inadequate notice of charges. The public universities' failure to adequately notify students of charges can lead to a viable due process claim. Providing timely notice of charges and a meaningful opportunity to prepare for a disciplinary hearing is crucial. For example, one student alleged being interviewed for sexual misconduct without prior notification. A federal district court ruled that a student's three-year suspension without prior notice of sexual misconduct allegations could be a due process violation. Another case involved a student not being adequately informed of the charges against him, leading to expulsion for misconduct related to incidents not initially mentioned. The federal district court ruled that a student was expelled for sexual misconduct related to incidents not initially mentioned, leading to a due process violation. The court found that the school's limited scope of focus prejudiced the student's defense, depriving him of a liberty interest without due process of law. The university faced a due process violation when it failed to provide the evidence used in a disciplinary decision against a student. The court ruled that not providing this evidence constitutes a violation of the student's rights. Courts have often rejected claims of denial of due process in school disciplinary hearings regarding cross-examination. However, courts may entertain such claims when students are denied the opportunity to challenge witness credibility on critical facts. Cross-examination is not always considered necessary for due process in civil contexts. In civil contexts, cross-examination has not been seen as essential for due process. Courts have denied due process challenges in university adjudicatory proceedings, even in cases of sexual harassment allegations, where direct cross-examination of witnesses was not allowed. Students have challenged these proceedings, but the Due Process Clause does not guarantee the right to cross-examination in school disciplinary cases. The reviewing district court rejected a due process challenge to university disciplinary hearings where accused students could submit written questions to a panel chair instead of directly to the complainant. Similarly, the Sixth Circuit denied a due process challenge to a disciplinary hearing on sexual assault allegations where students were not allowed to cross-examine their accuser directly. Students could submit written questions to the panel but not follow-up questions, and not all questions were addressed. The court found the proceedings met the \"limited\" requirement for cross-examination. The court upheld disciplinary proceedings that met the \"limited\" requirement for cross-examination in cases where credibility was at issue, despite challenges to the lack of effective cross-examination. The decision was based on videos and a photo, not testimonial evidence, showing that the burden on the school outweighed the marginal benefit of follow-up questions. The Sixth Circuit ruled in favor of due process challenges when a university failed to provide cross-examination in a disciplinary hearing where credibility was crucial. The decision to suspend a student was based solely on hearsay without the complainant present, leading to a violation of due process. The court noted that the student only requested to pose questions to his accuser through the hearing panel. The court emphasized the importance of allowing the accused to pose questions to his accuser through the hearing panel to assess credibility. A live hearing may be necessary to ensure due process, as seen in a case where a university was ordered to provide one for an accused student facing expulsion. The court ordered a live hearing for an accused student facing expulsion to comply with due process, as the university's procedures lacked transparency and violated the accused student's rights. The Sixth Circuit ruled that universities must allow accused students to cross-examine accusers and witnesses in cases where credibility is at issue. In a specific case, a university appeals board reversed a decision based on the persuasive accounts of the alleged victim and witnesses, without giving the accused student a chance to cross-examine them. The Sixth Circuit ruled that universities must provide accused students with the opportunity to cross-examine their accusers and adverse witnesses to ensure due process. Some students have claimed they were denied the chance to present exculpatory evidence in their defense, with courts evaluating such claims on a case-by-case basis. The student alleged he was denied the opportunity to present text messages as exculpatory evidence at a sexual assault disciplinary hearing, raising concerns of due process violation. Courts generally assume school disciplinary panels are impartial unless actual bias is shown. Students in disciplinary proceedings for sexual harassment or assault have challenged decisionmakers for bias. A plaintiff must generally allege facts to overcome the presumption of impartiality, such as showing actual bias by decisionmakers or a pattern of bias in decisionmaking. For example, a Fifth Circuit panel rejected a due process claim alleging bias in a university disciplinary hearing for sexual assault due to a lack of evidence undermining the integrity of the proceedings. The investigator in the case served as a victim advocate for the school, investigated the charges, and advised the panel members who made the disciplinary decision based on photo and video evidence. The investigator relied on photo and video evidence to present findings to the panel, with no indication that a different investigator would have changed the outcome. A university attorney stated that the panel could draw their own conclusions from the evidence. However, evidence of bias in decisionmakers' behavior or statements could lead to a due process challenge. For instance, a recent Sixth Circuit case allowed a due process claim where bias was alleged in a university disciplinary hearing for sexual assault. In a recent case, a university disciplinary hearing for alleged sexual assault was challenged for bias. One panel member acted as investigator, prosecutor, and judge, allegedly making biased remarks and prejudging the case. The student claimed the panel member was not impartial, leading to a potential due process violation. Courts have addressed similar claims of bias in institutional settings. Courts have addressed claims of bias in institutional settings, including due process violations based on institutional pressures such as sexual assault training for university officials. One court rejected a claim that staff bias was influenced by unbalanced training, stating the university's goal of raising awareness of sexual assault was commendable. The school was accused of railroading students in sexual misconduct cases to maintain federal funding, but there was no evidence to support this claim. In another case, a court found bias in the training materials provided to the panel deciding on an expelled student's case, leading to a due process claim. The court noted that the training materials assumed an assault occurred, raising questions about the panel's ability to consider all aspects of the investigation. The court concluded that there may have been a due process violation in the investigation and official report. Federal district court cases have addressed allegations of unfair review processes in university disciplinary proceedings. In one case, a student was cleared of sexual assault but faced a new hearing due to lack of evidence. In a district court case, a suspended student challenged the validity of a school's procedures after being found guilty of sexual misconduct without sufficient notice or time to respond to new evidence. The student was not provided with key details or the opportunity to defend himself in a sexual misconduct case. The appeals board reversed the initial decision without explanation, leading to a federal court ruling that the student was not given a fair hearing. The student was expelled from university for sexual assault despite being found not responsible initially. The individual overseeing the appeal conducted off-the-record meetings with the accuser, prejudging the case and expelling the student without explanation. In September 2017, OCR withdrew the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter and 2014 Questions and Answers document, citing procedural inadequacies in a case where a student was expelled without a basis for the decision. ED announced plans to begin the rulemaking process to clarify schools' responsibilities under Title IX, relying on the 2001 Guidance in the meantime. The ED issued a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register on November 29, 2018, which would significantly change how schools address sexual harassment. The proposal includes allowing schools to resolve complaints through mediation and giving the option for appeals by the party found guilty of misconduct, not the victim. The proposed regulation under Title IX would narrow the definition of sexual harassment, require \"actual notice\" of harassment, only consider a school's response as a violation if it shows deliberate indifference, and introduce new procedural requirements to ensure due process during investigations. The proposed regulation under Title IX would establish a higher threshold for proving a violation based on hostile environment harassment, compared to past definitions issued by the Department of Education. The proposed regulations under Title IX would establish a higher threshold for proving a violation based on hostile environment harassment, adopting a standard from the Supreme Court's 1999 Davis decision. The proposed regulations under Title IX would define a hostile environment as one that is severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive, effectively denying equal access to education programs. This is a departure from past practices where constructive notice triggered school responsibilities in harassment cases. The proposed regulations under Title IX would establish that a school has a duty to respond to allegations of sexual harassment only when it has \"actual knowledge,\" defined as notice of harassment to a school's Title IX Coordinator or official with authority to institute corrective measures. The regulations reject imputing knowledge to a school based on respondeat superior or constructive notice. The ability or obligation to report by a school employee does not qualify them as one who possesses authority to institute corrective measures. The proposed regulations under Title IX establish that a school must respond to sexual harassment only when it has \"actual knowledge,\" defined as notice to a school's Title IX Coordinator or official with authority to take corrective measures. The regulations do not attribute knowledge to a school based on respondeat superior or constructive notice. Schools are required to respond only to sexual harassment within their \"education program or activity,\" contrasting with past guidance that sometimes held schools responsible for harassment outside these boundaries. The proposed regulations under Title IX require schools to respond to sexual harassment only when they have \"actual knowledge,\" defined as notice to a school's Title IX Coordinator or official with authority to take corrective measures. Unlike past guidance, schools are only responsible for addressing sexual harassment that occurs within their \"education program or activity.\" Deliberate indifference is defined as a response to sexual harassment that is clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances. The proposed regulations under Title IX outline situations where schools are not considered deliberately indifferent to sexual harassment, such as following grievance procedures outlined in a formal complaint. This standard holds schools accountable while allowing flexibility in disciplinary decisions. The proposed regulations under Title IX outline situations where schools are not considered deliberately indifferent to sexual harassment. Compliance with grievance procedures and offering supportive measures to complainants can negate any inference of deliberate indifference. The proposed regulations under Title IX state that schools must notify complainants of the right to file a formal complaint and respond to sexual harassment cases in a non-indifferent manner. Schools can also remove individuals accused of sexual harassment on an emergency basis after conducting a risk and safety analysis. The proposed regulations under Title IX require schools to conduct an individualized risk and safety analysis to justify the removal of individuals accused of sexual harassment. Accused individuals must be given notice and an opportunity to challenge the decision. Schools can also place nonstudent employees on administrative leave during investigations to ensure due process protections for accused students. Upon receipt of a formal Title IX complaint regarding sexual harassment, a school must provide written notice to relevant parties of the allegations and available grievance procedures. Grievance procedures must treat complainants and respondents equitably, providing remedies for complainants upon a finding. The proposal ensures equitable treatment for both complainants and respondents in cases of sexual harassment under Title IX, requiring objective evaluation of evidence and prohibiting credibility determinations based on one's status. The proposed regulations for Title IX cases require unbiased individuals in the investigation process, presumption of innocence for respondents, details on sanctions and remedies, standard of evidence, appeal process, and supportive measures. The school must bear the burden of proof and allow equal opportunity for both parties to present witnesses. The proposed regulations for Title IX cases require unbiased individuals in the investigation process, presumption of innocence for respondents, details on sanctions and remedies, standard of evidence, appeal process, and supportive measures. The school must allow equal opportunity for both parties to present witnesses and evidence, provide written notice of hearing details, and conduct a live hearing where parties can ask questions. The proposed regulations for Title IX cases require unbiased individuals in the investigation process, presumption of innocence for respondents, details on sanctions and remedies, standard of evidence, appeal process, and supportive measures. Schools must allow cross-examination by parties and witnesses, with the option for technology-assisted cross-examination in separate rooms. Decisionmakers cannot rely on statements not subject to cross-examination. Both parties have equal opportunity to review evidence and receive a report summarizing relevant evidence before a hearing. The proposed regulations for Title IX cases require a live hearing with cross-examination between parties, a departure from past guidance. Decisionmakers cannot be the investigator or Title IX Coordinator, preventing bias in reaching a decision. This would eliminate the practice of using a single investigator for both examining allegations and determining culpability. The new regulations for Title IX cases allow schools to use either a preponderance of evidence or clear and convincing standard. Schools must use the same standard for all conduct violations with the same penalty. Appeals are optional but must be available to both parties. The new regulations for Title IX cases allow schools to use a preponderance of evidence or clear and convincing standard for conduct violations. Appeals must be available to both parties, and schools may facilitate an informal resolution process with written consent. Title IX prohibits discrimination based on sex but does not specifically address sexual abuse, harassment, or assault, leaving federal courts to interpret violations. Federal courts have largely determined relief for individual victims of sexual abuse or harassment under Title IX, as the statute is silent on these issues. The Supreme Court created a remedial scheme for a private right of action, speculating on how Congress would have addressed the issue. Federal agencies have issued guidelines on the responsibilities of educational institutions due to sparse statutory language. Congress has the authority to modify Title IX to clarify standards for private suits and administrative enforcement related to sexual abuse and harassment in educational institutions. Amendments could define specific conduct violations, address liability for harassment in different school settings, and differentiate between harassment by teachers. Congress could modify Title IX by distinguishing between harassment by teachers and students, clarifying legal standards for private suits, and directing federal agencies to adjust administrative enforcement. This could include defining specific conduct violations and differentiating between various types of sexual harassment in educational institutions."
