    "content": "The FCC prepared to auction 62 MHz of radio frequencies in the 700 MHz band to comply with the Deficit Reduction Act. Rules were issued for spectrum allocation, auction, public safety use, and creating a public-private partnership for a network. 24 MHz was previously set aside for public safety in the same bandwidth. The FCC proposed to set aside 10 MHz from public safety frequency bands to create a shared network with auctionable spectrum, totaling 20 MHz for a nationwide broadband network. This decision aimed to meet public safety needs for robust communications and interoperability while also providing new funding sources through commercial user partnerships. Facilities with commercial users would benefit public safety by providing new funding sources, economies of scale, and access to additional spectrum during emergencies. The FCC structured a collaboration between two adjacent spectrum license-holders to support a broadband network. A national license for 10 MHz was assigned to a not-for-profit corporation representing public safety interests, created from the 24 MHz originally designated for public safety. The FCC designated 10 MHz of commercial frequencies to be paired with public safety's 10 MHz for a shared network. The D Block license was auctioned off but only had one bidder, Qualcomm, Inc., who bid $472 million, falling short of the FCC's $1.3 billion reserve price. The FCC did not meet the reserve price of $1.3 billion for the D Block auction, leading to a review of rules and options for disposal. The FCC prepared new auction rules for the D Block after not meeting the reserve price of $1.3 billion. The rules include a nationwide license for the Public Safety Broadband Licensee and options for commercial licenses in either national or regional coverage. Public safety associations have requested local access to the spectrum. The national licensee would ensure common standards and interoperability across all systems while allowing local networks to negotiate sharing arrangements. Congressional policy is focused on combining public and private spectrum ownership for public safety communications support. The FCC and the Office of Emergency Communications are pursuing separate paths for developing this communications response. The FCC and the Office of Emergency Communications are pursuing separate paths for developing public safety communications response. Congress is considering funding solutions for the program, including levies on commercial partners or public sector funding. The federal government could temporarily assume the role of the commercial partner to preserve critical infrastructure. The federal government could temporarily assume the role of the commercial partner to preserve the shared network principle, assure construction, and sell the business to the private sector. Sharing spectrum and network facilities with commercial users benefits public safety by providing funding, economies of scale, and access to additional spectrum during emergencies. Achieving resource sharing between public and private sectors is a goal with consensus. The goal of sharing resources between public and private sectors is consensus. Three needs for an effective solution are identified: sufficient spectrum for a broadband network (at least 20 MHz), a source of funds to cover costs associated with creating a national public safety license, including rebanding costs. The FCC's new allocation plan for 700 MHz includes rebanding costs and spectrum license administration. Key elements for a public-private partnership include a Public Safety Broadband Licensee and a Network Sharing Agreement. Incentives are needed for commercial partners to use the shared network for consumer services. The FCC's new allocation plan for 700 MHz includes rebanding costs and spectrum license administration. Incentives are required to build a network meeting public safety standards, despite significant demand from the business sector for secure and reliable mobile data access. The D Block license failed to attract bids, sparking a public debate on next steps for its assignment. The debate surrounding the FCC's auction rules for the 700 MHz spectrum includes discussions on flaws in the auction structure and potential solutions to attract more bidders. One proposed solution is to modify the auction rules to eliminate FCC requirements that may have discouraged potential bidders while keeping the public-private partnership intact. This approach assumes that the business case for the partnership is solid. To attract more bidders for the 700 MHz spectrum auction, changing auction rules without altering the public-private partnership structure is proposed. Eliminating network sharing requirements and allowing public safety to negotiate independently for partnerships or sharing agreements could help. The idea is to auction the D Block license without public safety requirements, assuming there is a solid structure and enough spectrum capacity for successful collaboration. Using federal funds to build a public safety network is also suggested, potentially funded by proceeds from the auction of 700 MHz frequencies. The course for managing a public safety network involves using proceeds from the auction of 700 MHz frequencies and requires congressional action to authorize expenditures. Different organizational structures are proposed, which may require legislation for implementation. The FCC is seeking comments on these proposals in its Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. The FCC seeks comments on various options and solutions in its Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. Commissioners support re-auctioning the D Block to create a public-private partnership for public safety. Rule changes may include modifying requirements for the winning bidder. The FCC is considering options for the D-Block winning bidder, which may involve changes to requirements such as reserve price, penalties, and network sharing agreements. One proposal is to re-auction the D Block without encumbrances, including costly build-out requirements and network sharing agreements. The FCC is considering changes to the network sharing agreement for the D Block, potentially offering it as a commercial license without encumbrances. Suggestions include using surplus funds from auctions to build a public safety network, as proposed in the Public Safety Interoperability Implementation Act. The FCC is exploring options for the D Block network sharing agreement, including potentially offering it as a commercial license. Suggestions include using auction proceeds to fund a public safety network, with FCC officials preferring federal funding for nationwide interoperability. Recommendations for using spectrum proceeds lack details on distribution for building the network. The funds for building a shared network would be distributed among public safety partners in a cooperative organization. The network would have an interoperable backbone at 700 MHz for regional, state, and local networks to connect during emergencies, requiring less financial commitment from commercial partners and more involvement from state and local agencies in building and controlling access to their parts of the network. The commercial network would collaborate with public safety partners to provide interoperability. Funds for public safety could be distributed through existing grant programs. Multiple commercial partners could be involved in the cooperative organization, with licenses assigned for local markets and rural coverage. The public safety partner would lead in designing the network. The public safety partner would lead in designing the network and choosing technology and standards for commercial partners. The FCC could potentially set standards through rule-making. Federal funds could be used to build parts of the interoperable backbone at 700 MHz. The federal government's role in structuring the agreement would be minimized. The federal government's role in structuring the agreement would be minimized and replaced by greater support and participation through funding. Funding for the public safety network could come from appropriations, empowerment to raise funds, or a combination of funding tools. A federally chartered corporation or not-for-profit organization could hire skilled professionals to operate the network. The Public Safety Broadband License could be retained by the not-for-profit corporation, Public Safety Spectrum Trust, or reassigned. Congressional oversight would replace FCC regulatory roles. A new public safety network could be created with the existing license and D Block at 700 MHz. The FCC seeks opinions and information on various topics related to the Public Safety Broadband License and the D Block, including provisions for license usage, revisions to partnerships, auction structuring, and relocation costs for frequency assignments in the 700 MHz band. The FCC seeks opinions on the Public Safety Spectrum Trust borrowing $197 million for network infrastructure for public safety, excluding operating costs. They also seek input on obligations of the D Block to build the shared network and other potential funding sources. The FCC is exploring funding options for the Public Safety Broadband Licensee's operating costs, including the possibility of using the Universal Service Fund and the Telecommunications Development Fund. The Telecommunications Development Fund (TDF) was created with the passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 to provide capital to small businesses in the telecommunications industry. The FCC is reviewing key provisions that may need to be amended by Congress for the fund to be used for the Public Safety Broadband Licensee's operating costs. Since initiating auctions in 1994, the FCC has consistently provided rules for financial requirements, setting aside licenses, and enforcing service rules for advanced wireless services. For Auction 73, the FCC expanded the scope of service rules. The FCC expanded service rules for Auction 73 to include spectrum sharing between public safety and commercial licensees, creating a public-private partnership for the 700 MHz band auction. The FCC anticipated challenges in building and operating a shared network. The FCC established a regulatory framework for a public-private partnership in the 700 MHz band auction, including requirements for the Public Safety Broadband Licensee, Commercial partner, and Network Sharing Agreement. The FCC's rules require components of a shared network to meet guidelines, with contracts approved by the FCC, compliance overseen, and disputes resolved through the FCC or litigation. The Second Report and Order focuses on public safety communications issues for policy makers. The FCC allocated 24 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz band for public safety use during the transition from analog to digital television. Planning for public safety use of these frequencies began in 1997 and concluded in 2003 with the submission of the final report by the Public Safety National Coordination Committee (NCC). The NCC developed technical and operational standards for the 700 MHz band and managed licenses through regional committees. The governance of public safety radio frequencies in the 700 MHz band is managed through 55 Regional Planning Committees (RPCs) coordinated by the National Public Safety Telecommunications Council (NPSTC). The band plan has been revised to accommodate narrowband and broadband applications, with channels reassigned accordingly. Channels have been reassigned in the 700 MHz band to support narrowband operations in 12 MHz of paired spectrum, with frequencies at 769 - 775 MHz and 799 - 805 MHz. States and localities will administer these channels through regional committees. RPCs with approved band plans must submit amended plans per FCC rules. Financing for networks on narrowband frequencies will come from local, state, and federal funds. Additionally, 10 MHz of spectrum at 763 - 768 MHz and 793 - 798 MHz will be allocated for broadband communications. The FCC has allocated 10 MHz of frequencies at 763 - 768 MHz and 793 - 798 MHz for broadband communications. The Public Safety Broadband Licensee will also administer two guard bands at 768 - 769 MHz and 798 - 799 MHz to prevent interference. Some public safety network operators may need to modify equipment for the new band plan, with costs covered by the commercial D Block licensee. The FCC allocated 10 MHz of frequencies for broadband communications, with the Public Safety Broadband Licensee responsible for administering two guard bands to prevent interference. The licensee must form a not-for-profit corporation, establish standards, and participate in creating a Network Sharing Agreement. The commercial partner will cover the cost of building the national network, with potential funding from the public sector for system enhancements. The FCC selected the Public Safety Broadband Licensee based on criteria such as not-for-profit corporate status. The Public Safety Broadband Licensee, chosen based on criteria like not-for-profit status and broad representation of public safety entities, was awarded to the Public Safety Spectrum Trust Corporation (PSST). Cyren Call Communications Corporation was hired as an advisor for negotiations. The PSST now holds the nationwide Public Safety Broadband License with representation from various organizations on its Board of Directors. The FCC designated 11 organizations to appoint board members for the Public Safety Broadband Licensee, with the board initially consisting of 13 members. Later, the board composition was changed to include three more representatives from specific organizations and four at-large members. At-large members were selected jointly by FCC bureaus, and the National Public Safety representative was eliminated. The FCC removed the National Public Safety Telecommunications Council from the board due to membership overlap. The selected licensee, PSST, must submit quarterly financial reports to the FCC and meet specific criteria for incorporation and bylaws. The FCC requires the selected licensee, PSST, to adhere to specific criteria for incorporation and bylaws. Extensive oversight will be provided to ensure compliance with corporate governance stipulations. The FCC reserves the right to re-assign the commercial license if necessary. The FCC reserves the right to re-assign or revoke the commercial license awarded to the Public Safety Broadband Licensee if it fails to meet obligations or comply with FCC rules. The public safety license is valid for ten years and renewable, with additional tasks set by the FCC for the selected licensee. The Public Safety Broadband Licensee must negotiate agreements with commercial partners, administer network access for public safety users, represent their interests, negotiate purchase agreements with vendors, and approve equipment and applications for the network. The licensee has the sole authority in determining equipment specifications. The Public Safety Broadband Licensee has the authority to approve equipment and applications for the network, including coordinating stations accessing frequencies and overseeing rebanding. They also decide on allowing federal public safety agencies access and review requests for wideband networks in unserved areas. The FCC ruled that eligible bidders for Block D in Auction 73 would receive a bidding credit of 15% for small businesses with average revenues of $40 million in the past three years and 25% for companies with higher earnings. The commercial partner in the public-private partnership would be the winning bidder for Block D, with negotiations to build network sites on public land owned by states or localities. The FCC designated frequencies for Block D in Auction 73 at 758 - 763 MHz and 788 - 793 MHz, totaling 10 MHz. The reserve price for the D Block was suggested to be $1.33 billion, despite its presumed value of $1.7 billion based on previous auctions. The FCC recommended discounting the $1.7 billion reserve price for the D Block license to reflect additional service rules and requirements. The winning bidder had to meet specific FCC requirements, including completing a Network Sharing Agreement with the Public Safety Broadband Licensee within six months of filing the long form application. The FCC required a separate agreement for the Public Safety Broadband Licensee with rights of first refusal and option to purchase network assets. The winning bidder for the D Block had to certify good faith negotiations with the FCC within ten days and provide a timetable for the first 30 days of negotiation meetings. The FCC required detailed monthly reports on negotiations after three months, with the option for additional reports as needed. Two FCC staff members would observe negotiations, and separate legal entities were required to hold the D Block license, network assets, and operate the company. The FCC requires detailed monthly reports on negotiations for the D Block license and leasing secondary rights to the public safety spectrum. Companies must be \"bankruptcy remote\" with a corporate structure approved by the FCC, consisting of quasi-independent entities with designated functions. The FCC requires companies to have a corporate structure of quasi-independent entities with designated functions for the D Block license. These entities must adhere to the Communications Act and FCC regulations, responsible for building out the shared network as per the Network Sharing Agreement. Failure to meet obligations could result in license revocation and reassignment by the FCC. The D Block license, if canceled, would result in a penalty of 10% of the auction price. The license is valid for ten years and can be renewed if FCC rules are followed. A commercial corporation must build the public safety network using the spectrum held by the public safety licensee and the D Block. The FCC established benchmarks for building a public safety network using spectrum held by the public safety licensee and the D Block license holder. The network should reach 75% of the population within four years and 95% within seven years. Modifications to requirements are subject to approval by all parties involved, including the FCC. The FCC set benchmarks for a public safety network to cover 75% of the population within four years and 95% within seven years. By the end of ten years, 99.3% of the population would be covered. The NSA had to include a build-out schedule for major highways, interstates, and communities over 3,000 people to meet FCC standards. Failure to meet deadlines could result in license cancellation. The D Block licensee must meet benchmark deadlines to avoid license cancellation. They need to offer a handset with integrated satellite solution for public safety in rural areas and ensure robust signal carriage for population coverage requirements. The NSA sets requirements for service to public safety users and network performance. The licensee is prohibited from discontinuing or degrading service to public safety customers. The FCC prohibits the D Block licensee from discontinuing or degrading service to public safety customers without approval. The Network Sharing Agreement (NSA) is crucial for the public-private partnership, with the FCC reviewing and approving all components. Adherence to the agreement is a regulatory condition for both commercial and public safety licensees. Various requirements, including network coverage, must be included in the NSA. The FCC established minimum standards for the network in the Second Report and Order, including specifications for broadband mobile voice, video, and data. The network must meet public safety needs and ensure communications interoperability. The FCC established minimum standards for the network in the Second Report and Order, including specifications for broadband mobile voice, video, and data to meet public safety needs. The network must have sufficient signal coverage, robustness, capacity, and state-of-the-art security to ensure reliability and performance during emergency situations and heavy usage. The network must have state-of-the-art security and encryption technologies, automatic prioritization of public safety communications, and operational control by the Public Safety Broadband Licensee to meet specific operational needs. The Public Safety Broadband Licensee has the right to approve equipment specifications and purchase subscriber equipment. The D Block Licensee must provide an integrated handset for public safety use. A common standard for nationwide broadband interoperability is required for all public safety users. FCC guidelines outline obligations for both licensees to negotiate in good faith for Network Sharing. The FCC rules require both licensees to negotiate in good faith for the Network Sharing Agreement, including specifying service fees for normal network service and priority access to spectrum capacity in emergencies. The FCC suggests negotiating \"reasonable rates\" with financial incentives for the commercial licensee based on usage. The FCC's fee structure for the D Block licensee includes financial incentives based on the number of subscribers from the public safety sector. Priority access fees are designed to protect public safety participants from unexpected payment obligations. The pricing structure aims for affordable rates comparable to commercial services but lower for public safety. Negotiations with public safety partners should prioritize public safety goals as outlined in the Second Report and Order. The FCC outlined tools to resolve NSA disputes and ensure reasonable fees. The NSA term would not exceed ten years, aligning with the D Block license duration. Renewal or modification of the NSA would coincide with the D Block license renewal decision, requiring FCC approval for major changes. The FCC requires approval for any major changes to the structure, which must be agreed upon by both licensee partners. The Public Safety Broadband Licensee can lease access to frequencies exclusively to the D Block licensee on a secondary basis. Commercial users can transmit on public safety band frequencies only when there is no demand from primary users. The FCC requires approval for major changes to the structure, with the Public Safety Broadband Licensee able to lease frequencies to the D Block licensee on a secondary basis. Commercial users can only transmit on public safety band frequencies when there is no demand from primary users. The D Block licensee must yield to public safety users immediately when there is demand. This privilege is part of the public-private partnership agreements, with the D Block licensee required to build a network for public safety use under a spectrum manager leasing arrangement for the full ten-year license term. Compliance responsibility lies with the lessee. The D Block licensee is responsible for ensuring public safety users do not experience interference from commercial operations in the public safety spectrum band. The FCC may require the network to prioritize first responders and allow for immediate preemption or exclusion of commercial users. In exchange for commercial usage, public safety has the right to real-time access. The D Block licensee must ensure public safety users are not interfered with by commercial operations in the public safety spectrum band. In exchange for commercial usage, public safety has the right to real-time access for emergencies, with the definition of an emergency outlined in the NSA. If an agreement on what constitutes an emergency cannot be reached, the public safety licensee can appeal to the FCC for access to D Block frequencies. The FCC revised rules to accommodate both narrowband and broadband networks for public safety. The FCC revised the band plan for 24 MHz allocated to public safety to accommodate narrowband and broadband networks. They also resolved spectrum management issues and made decisions regarding the operation of public safety networks in the 700 MHz band, including moving networks in build-out stages and requiring technical adjustments, with the D Block licensee covering the costs. The amount of allowable costs is capped at $10 million. The FCC revised the band plan for 24 MHz allocated to public safety to accommodate narrowband and broadband networks. The new band plan for public safety in the 700 MHz band has created two separate sets of paired spectrum blocks. One set of paired frequencies will be used for narrowband communications, the other set has been designated for the new, broadband network to be built by the public-private partnership. Licensees are required to cover the costs of adjustments, with a cap of $10 million for reimbursement to public safety network operators. Operations of narrowband systems on 700 MHz public safety networks will be prohibited, and the building and use of wideband networks will be limited. The FCC has required frequencies in the 700 MHz band to be vacated by February 17, 2009 for broadband use. Motorola provided cost estimates for a rebanding plan proposed by NPSTC. The FCC mandated the vacating of frequencies in the 700 MHz band by February 17, 2009 for broadband use. Motorola estimated the cost of a rebanding plan proposed by NPSTC at $9.45 million, covering all installations projected by July 2008. The D Block licensee would cover rebanding costs, with a $10 million reimbursement cap set by the FCC. Systems and radios in operation as of August 30, 2007, were eligible for coverage to control costs. The FCC set a cut-off date of August 30, 2007, to limit reprogramming costs for base stations and radios to around $6 million. They prohibited new operations on affected narrowband frequencies after this date to control relocation expenses. Rules were established for calculating actual costs and reimbursements, similar to the Network Sharing Agreement negotiations. The FCC set a cut-off date of August 30, 2007, to limit reprogramming costs for base stations and radios to around $6 million. Rules were established for calculating actual costs and reimbursements, similar to the Network Sharing Agreement negotiations. As with the negotiation of the Network Sharing Agreement, the public safety licensee and the commercial D Block licensee would be obligated to reach an agreement that must be reviewed and approved by the FCC within 30 days. Displaced public safety network operators must meet conditions to receive reimbursement, including providing accurate information on the total number of mobile narrowband mobile and portable handsets in operation on affected frequencies. The FCC rule making requires the D Block licensee to reimburse only the minimum cost for necessary changes to base stations, mobiles, and portables on affected frequencies. The licensee is not responsible for costs related to reassigning channels or other changes to Regional Planning Committee plans. The Regional Planning Committee plans for possible reimbursement for costs related to the rebanding program. The D Block licensee and public safety licensee must agree on total costs not exceeding $10 million for changes, to be submitted to the FCC with certification from all parties involved. The approved amount must be paid into a trust account. The FCC requires the winning bidder of the D Block license to pay an approved amount into a trust account administered by the Public Safety Broadband Licensee. Payments can only be made after the license is conferred, and the winning bidder must meet all FCC requirements to finalize the agreement. Safety network operators seeking to operate wideband systems must obtain a waiver, which includes an application for authorization, confirmation from the Public Safety Broadband Licensee, agreed-upon conditions of operation, a transition plan to the broadband network, and a certification of no reimbursement sought from the D Block licensee for future transition costs. Waivers are only granted for wideband operations within narrowband frequencies, with rare exceptions. In the Second Report and Order, the FCC assigned itself the role of champion and protector for public safety interests, nationwide emergency communications, and interoperable networks. Congressional oversight of the public-private partnership is also mentioned. The FCC has extended its authority to oversee the D Block license holder's obligations in a public-private partnership. The network's asset value could reach tens of billions of dollars, with a large part controlled by the Public Safety Broadband Licensee and its Board of Directors, including four members appointed by the FCC. The FCC has extended its authority over the D Block license holder's obligations in a public-private partnership. The Board of Directors, including four members appointed by the FCC, will enforce rules through litigation, license revocation, or other means supported by the Communications Act. Congress would provide guidance to FCC commissioners, with two bills in the 110th Congress addressing specific issues in creating a shared network. The Public Safety Broadband Authorization Act of 2008 (H.R. 6055, Harman) proposes funding for operating expenses of the Public Safety Broadband Licensee and promoting the establishment of a nationwide, interoperable broadband public safety communications network. The bill imposes limits on the activities of the public safety license-holder, including requirements for not-for-profit status. The RESPONDER Act of 2008 proposes creating a trust fund to purchase interoperable radios for first responders using proceeds from the auction of the D Block analog spectrum. The RESPONDER Act of 2008 proposes creating a trust fund to purchase interoperable radios for first responders using proceeds from the auction of the D Block analog spectrum. The Act would place the net proceeds of the D Block Auction in the Trust, with additional funds coming from future auctions. Auction authority for the Federal Communication Commission would be extended to ensure revenue-producing auctions continue."
