    "content": "The \"Cord Blood Education and Awareness Act of 2009\" includes sections on public education campaigns, patient informed consent, professional education, targeted education grants, and authorization of appropriations. The Act also contains findings related to cord blood education and awareness. Congress finds that leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma caused the deaths of 52,910 people in the US in 2007, with leukemia being the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among children and young adults. Additionally, up to 16,000 leukemia patients annually require a bone marrow transplant but lack a suitable donor. Umbilical cord blood stem cells have been effectively used in treating various blood diseases, with a 1 in 4 chance of a newborn baby's cord blood cells being a perfect match for a sibling. Cord blood cells have been utilized in over 14,000 transplants worldwide in the last 20 years, serving as a rich source of stem cells for transplantation. Cord blood cells are a rich source of stem cells for transplantation, especially for children, with a lower rate of graft versus host disease than bone marrow. They have been used to effectively treat various blood, immune, and metabolic disorders. Researchers have found that cord blood cells contain different types of stem cells. Cord blood cells are pluripotent and can differentiate into various cell types in the human body. They have shown potential in reducing inflammation, promoting tissue repair, and are being studied for treating conditions like type 1 diabetes, brain injury, cerebral palsy, hearing loss, renal failure, and spinal issues. Cord blood cells have potential in treating various conditions like hearing loss, renal failure, spinal cord injury, and congenital heart valve defects. Over 90 percent of cord blood cells are discarded as medical waste in the US each year. Only a quarter of states require expectant parents to receive information about banking cord blood. In 2005, the Institute of Medicine recommended establishing a national stem cell bank program. The Institute of Medicine recommended establishing a national stem cell bank program for cord blood cells. Donors should be provided with clear information about their options, including a balanced perspective on banking cord blood cells. Informed consent should be obtained before labor and delivery, after adequate disclosure of information. The public education campaign is outlined in Section 3. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will develop a publication on umbilical cord blood within a year of this Act. It will explain the value and uses of cord blood for individuals, regardless of biological relation, and the differences in using one's cord blood. The curr_chunk discusses the variances between using one's own cord blood cells (autologous) versus related or unrelated cord blood stem cells (allogeneic use) in disease treatment, public versus private umbilical cord blood banking, and a mother's options for umbilical cord blood stem cells post-delivery. The curr_chunk discusses storing stem cells in a private family umbilical cord blood bank, family or sibling donor banking programs, and discarding stem cells. It also mentions the medical processes involved in cord blood collection and criteria impacting medical or family history. The curr_chunk provides information on umbilical cord blood banking, including medical criteria, ownership options, costs, and availability of public and private cord blood banks in the United States. The curr_chunk explains the need for publicly donated cord blood samples based on medical data, including a list of accredited private cord blood banks and availability of free family banking programs. SEC. 4. PATIENT INFORMED CONSENT DOCUMENT. The Secretary must develop a patient informed consent document on cord blood disposition within a year of this Act. The document will include information on cord blood banking options and the medical value of cord blood stem cells in disease treatment. The patient informed consent document must include a woman's choice for the disposition of a child's cord blood stem cells, whether for public donation, private banking, or other disposal. SEC. 5. Duty of certain professionals to disclose information and obtain informed consent from pregnant patients. Effective 1 year after the enactment of this Act, healthcare professionals providing prenatal care must inform pregnant women about umbilical cord blood banking options before the third trimester or at the first visit. They should also provide this information at least 2 weeks before the estimated due date. Healthcare professionals must inform pregnant women about cord blood banking options before the third trimester or at the first visit, and obtain written consent regarding the disposition of cord blood stem cells at least 2 weeks before the estimated due date. Medicaid regulations are also amended to reflect this requirement. The Medicaid regulations are amended to require healthcare professionals providing ambulatory prenatal care to pregnant women to comply with certain requirements and have a method to enforce them. The Medicaid regulations are amended to require healthcare professionals providing ambulatory prenatal care to pregnant women to comply with certain requirements and have a method to enforce them. If a State fails to comply with these requirements, the Secretary may reduce payments to the State accordingly. Additionally, similar provisions are made for the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). The Medicaid regulations now require healthcare professionals to inform pregnant women about blood cord banking. Additionally, employer group health plans under ERISA must also provide this information. The Medicaid regulations and ERISA require healthcare professionals to inform pregnant women about blood cord banking when providing ambulatory prenatal care. The amendments made by this subsection require healthcare professionals to comply with regulations regarding pregnant women and apply to agreements and arrangements entered into or renewed after the enactment of this Act. The Secretary will create educational materials on umbilical cord blood stem cells for healthcare providers offering prenatal services. Additionally, targeted education grants will be provided. The Secretary may grant funds for targeted education on umbilical cord blood stem cells, focusing on current and accurate information and banking options. Targeted groups include health care providers, ethnic minorities, families with genetic disease history, and populations affected by specific conditions. The Secretary may grant funds for targeted education on umbilical cord blood stem cells, focusing on current and accurate information, banking options, and populations affected by specific conditions. Authorization of appropriations for carrying out the Act: $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2010 and $5,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2011 to 2014."
