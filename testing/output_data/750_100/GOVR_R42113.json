Projections suggest that the corporate tax could raise revenue over 2.4% of GDP in the future as the economy recovers. Despite this decline, overall federal tax revenues have remained stable, averaging around 17.7% of GDP since 1946. The individual tax revenue has remained stable at around 8.1% of economic output, while payroll tax revenue has increased from 1.4% to 6.0% of GDP. Excise tax revenue, on the other hand, has decreased from 3.1% to 0.5% of GDP. The corporate tax has also decreased in importance, generating 8.9% of federal revenue compared to 32.1% in 1952. The corporate tax revenue has declined to 8.9% of federal revenue, while individual and payroll taxes generate 41.5% and 40.0% respectively. Factors like tax rate and tax base size impact revenue collection. The decline in corporate tax revenues may be due to a reduction in corporate tax rates, a reduction in the corporate tax base, or both. Analysis suggests that both factors have played a role in the revenue decline. The effective corporate tax rate has decreased from 55.8% in 1951 to 28.4% in 2010, contributing to lower corporate tax revenue. The average effective tax rate has fallen due to a reduction in the top statutory rate, leading to lower corporate tax revenue. Since 2004, corporations have been able to claim the Section 199 deduction for certain activities, reducing the effective corporate tax rate below the statutory rate. The Section 199 deduction, like the investment tax credit, lowers the effective tax rate on corporate income. Changes to depreciation rules also contributed to reduced tax rates, with enhancements in 1954, 1962, 1971, and 1981, and reversals in 1986. Bonus depreciation in 2002 and 2009 aimed to boost the economy. According to economists Alan Auerbach and James Poterba, factors like inflation and corporate tax credits have had small effects on falling effective corporate tax rates. Accelerated depreciation and the investment tax credit have had a larger impact. Despite a general decline in effective rates over time, there were spikes above the 35% statutory rate in 2000 and 2007. During economic recessions in 2000 and 2007, businesses faced losses and could carry back losses to reduce previous years' income, resulting in lower effective tax rates. However, in severe downturns, the two-year carryback period may not be sufficient, leading struggling corporations to pay higher taxes. In response to higher overall average tax rates due to shorter carryback periods, Congress extended the period to five years in 2002 and 2008 to stimulate the economy. The decline in corporate tax revenue is not solely attributed to lower effective tax rates but also to a shrinking nonfinancial corporate tax base as more business income is generated by partnerships and S corporations not subject to corporate income tax. The distribution of business income in the United States has shifted from C corporations to partnerships and S corporations, which are not subject to corporate income tax. In 1980, C corporations generated 78% of all business income, but by 2007, they only accounted for 44%. Meanwhile, partnerships' share of income rose from 3% to 28%, and S corporations' share rose from 1% to nearly 17%. This shift has led to a smaller corporate tax base. The shift in business income distribution from C corporations to partnerships and S corporations has led to a smaller corporate tax base. C corporations accounted for 17% of all businesses in 1980 but only 6% by 2007. S corporations became more popular after the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which set lower tax rates for individuals and corporations, incentivizing businesses to organize as S corporations. Legislation increased the S corporation shareholder limit from 35 to 100, making the S corporation form more attractive. By 2007, S corporations represented 12% of businesses, up from 4% in 1980. The profitability of firms in the corporate sector has decreased, affecting the tax base. Profitability is often measured by the ratio of profit to net assets. The profit to asset ratio in the corporate sector has decreased significantly since 1966, impacting corporate taxes. Economists attribute this decline in profitability as more significant than changes in tax rates. The decline in nonfinancial corporate profitability since 1966 has impacted corporate taxes. Potential reasons for this decline include shifts to more volatile industries, younger corporations being less profitable, and possible profit shifting by American corporations. The decline in nonfinancial corporate profitability since 1966 has impacted corporate taxes. American corporations may be shifting profits to lower-tax countries, leading to lower reported profits domestically. Research shows evidence of profit-shifting among multinational corporations, affecting the income reported for tax purposes. This behavior results in growing differences between income reported to the IRS and to shareholders. Corporate tax revenues have been declining for the last six decades due to three primary factors: decreasing effective corporate tax rate, more business activity carried out by pass-through entities, and erosion of the corporate tax base. The decline in corporate tax revenues over the last six decades is attributed to factors such as the decreasing effective corporate tax rate, increased business activity by pass-through entities, and erosion of the corporate tax base. The ongoing tax reform debate focuses on reducing statutory rates, broadening the tax base, and potentially shifting to a territorial tax system. Effective tax rates are typically lower than statutory rates, suggesting a possible revenue-neutral reduction in the top statutory corporate tax rate. A revenue-neutral reduction of the top statutory corporate tax rate is possible by broadening the tax base and making reforms to business taxation. Reducing the rate from 35% to 25% would require repealing corporate tax expenditures and changing tax preferences for noncorporate businesses. Business activity may shift back to the corporate sector as the rate is reduced, naturally broadening the base. Other reforms may involve changes to the taxation of American multinationals. The curr_chunk discusses business tax reforms, including changes for American multinationals operating overseas and the calculation of average effective tax rates. It provides an equation for the average effective tax corporate tax rate calculation."
