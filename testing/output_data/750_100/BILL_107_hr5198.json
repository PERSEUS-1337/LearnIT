The Premier Certified Lenders Program (PCLP) has successfully helped small businesses expand. Increasing the number of premier certified lenders will provide more resources to small businesses as the Small Business Administration downsizes. However, the PCLP requires lenders to set aside large amounts in loss reserve accounts. Premier certified lenders should maintain loss reserve accounts based on the risk associated with PCLP loans, allowing for more efficient lending to small businesses. The risk of loss associated with PCLP loans will protect taxpayers and enhance the program's ability to support small businesses in economic development. SEC. 3.
