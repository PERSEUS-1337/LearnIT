    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Truancy Prevention and Juvenile Crime Reduction Act of 1998\". Congress finds that truancy is a significant indicator of trouble for young people, leading to school dropouts and increased likelihood of welfare dependence, unemployment, and criminal behavior. High rates of truancy are associated with high daytime burglary and vandalism rates. Up to 44 percent of violent juvenile crimes occur during school hours, and 75 percent of children aged 13-16 who are arrested for crimes are truants. Some cities report up to 70 percent of daily student absences are unexcused, with total absences reaching 4,000 per day. The social and economic costs of truancy are significant, with only 34 percent of inmates completing high school and 17 percent of youth under 18 entering the criminal justice system. Truancy among youth is linked to high rates of daytime crime. 17% of youth entering adult prisons have not completed grade school, while 25% completed 10th grade and 2% finished high school. Truants and dropouts cost the nation billions in lost earnings and taxes. Effective prevention programs can improve school attendance and reduce crime rates. There is a lack of targeted funding for effective truancy prevention programs in current law, which can reduce daytime crime rates. The lack of targeted funding for truancy prevention programs can reduce daytime crime rates. Grants are available for this purpose. In this section, an eligible partnership is defined as a partnership between local government units and local educational agencies. The terms \"local educational agency\" and \"qualified unit of local government\" are also defined. The eligible partnership must be with a local government that meets specific requirements under the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974. The term \"unit of local government\" includes various political subdivisions of a State or Indian tribes. The Attorney General has grant authority in consultation with relevant entities. The Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of Education, will award grants to eligible partnerships to reduce truancy and juvenile crime. The maximum grant amount is $100,000 per fiscal year, with at least 25% allocated for use by local educational agencies. The grant awarded under this section can be renewed for up to 2 fiscal years. Grant funds can be used by eligible partnerships to address truancy through parental involvement in prevention activities and sanctions for students. The measures to address truancy include driver's license suspension for habitually truant students, parental accountability with fines and community service, in-school prevention programs, involvement of various community entities, and technology such as automated parent notifications and computerized attendance systems. The Attorney General may prioritize funding for programs that replicate model truancy intervention projects in Fulton County, Georgia, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Several truancy intervention programs across different states include the Roswell Daytime Curfew Program in New Mexico, the Stop, Cite and Return Program in California, the Stay in School Program in Connecticut, the Atlantic County Project Helping Hand in New Jersey, the THRIVE initiative in Oklahoma, and a project in Norfolk, Virginia utilizing computers. The Attorney General may authorize funding for various model programs, including those in Norfolk, Virginia, Marion, Ohio, Bakersfield, California, Farmington, New Mexico, and others deemed appropriate. $25,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 1999 to 2001."
