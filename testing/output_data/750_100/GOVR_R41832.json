    "content": "Pakistan's stability, democracy, and prosperity are crucial to U.S. interests due to its role in combating religious militancy and addressing various urgent policy areas such as terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and regional tensions with India. The country is known for hosting extremist groups and being a rapid nuclear weapons proliferator, making it a top priority on the international security agenda. Pakistan has been praised for its cooperation with U.S.-led counterterrorism efforts post-2001, but doubts about Islamabad's commitment to core U.S. interests deepened in 2011. The country's mixed record on battling Islamist extremism includes tolerance of Afghan insurgents and anti-India militants. Pakistan's troubled economy, political instability, and history of difficult relations with neighbors pose challenges for U.S. decision makers. The Pakistani people have suffered from Islamist radicalism and terrorism, with the country facing numerous terrorist attacks in 2011. Islamabad claims significant civilian and security force casualties, as well as financial losses. Pakistani officials emphasize the country's sacrifices in the \"war on extremism.\" In May 2011, it was revealed that Osama bin Laden had been hiding in Pakistan for years, leading to increased scrutiny of the US-Pakistan relationship. Admiral Mike Mullen accused Pakistan of supporting Afghan insurgents attacking US interests, causing frustration in the US. In late November 2011, NATO troops in Afghanistan were attacked from Pakistani army outposts near the border at Salala, resulting in 24 Pakistani soldiers dead. The Pentagon investigation blamed poor coordination and miscommunication, leading to fury in Pakistan and calls to renegotiate bilateral agreements with the US. Pakistan demands renegotiation of bilateral agreements with the US related to supply lines into Afghanistan and covert activities on Pakistani territory, dating back to the early 2000s. Islamabad insists on a full apology from Washington for restored cooperation, with the closure of Pakistani ground lines of communication (GLOCs) to NATO supplies being a major point of contention. Despite expectations of a deal to reopen the GLOCs, they remain closed to date. Despite expectations of a deal to reopen the GLOCs, they remain closed to date. Pakistani negotiators are seeking a significant fee increase per truck, causing tension with senior U.S. officials who refuse to entertain such a hike. Additionally, a Pakistani doctor involved in a CIA operation received a 33-year prison sentence for treason, sparking confusion and anger among American officials. The Senate Appropriations Committee responded to the sentencing of a Pakistani doctor involved in a CIA operation by attaching a provision to dock $1 million from U.S. aid funding in the FY2013 State and Foreign Operations appropriation for each year of the sentence unless the doctor is freed. The Administration has expressed no reason for the conviction, leading to strained bilateral relations and anti-American sentiments. Anti-American sentiments and xenophobic conspiracy theories are prevalent among ordinary Pakistanis, with the United States now being the nation least favored by Pakistanis. Americans also hold increasingly negative views of Pakistan, with the State Department warning of high travel risks and diplomats facing restrictions. American civilians have been abducted in Pakistan, with one, Daniel Pearl, being executed. Islamist extremism and militancy in Pakistan are key concerns for U.S. foreign policy. Islamist extremism in Pakistan is a major concern for U.S. foreign policy, hindering progress towards defeating terrorist groups like Al Qaeda. The presence of wanted enemies in Pakistan, such as Ayman al-Zawahiri and Mullah Omar, poses a threat to regional stability. Concerns have escalated over American citizens being recruited for Islamist terrorism by Pakistan-based elements. Some American intelligence officials suspect that Al Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahiri may be protected by elements of the Pakistani government. Congress is increasingly questioning the effectiveness of current U.S. policy towards Pakistan, with some calling for a reduction in foreign assistance and placing new conditions on aid and military reimbursements. Legislation to curtail U.S. aid to Pakistan is moving through Congress in May 2012. In May 2012, legislation to curtail U.S. aid to Pakistan, including military reimbursements, is moving through Congress. Congress appropriated about $2 billion in direct aid for Pakistan in FY2012, making it a top recipient of U.S. foreign assistance. Pakistan's Ambassador to the United States has expressed concerns about restrictions on aid hindering cooperation and trust. The closure of Pakistani GLOCs to Afghanistan has not caused the expected logistical issues, with Islamabad using this as leverage in relations with Washington. Pakistan's closure of GLOCs to Afghanistan has not caused expected logistical issues, giving Islamabad leverage in relations with Washington. By bowing to domestic pressures, Pakistan risks losing foreign assistance and influence in post-war Afghanistan. President Obama urges Pakistan to increase participation in securing a peaceful future for the region. The United States urges Pakistan to increase its participation in securing a peaceful future for the war-torn region and insists on Pakistan keeping its commitments to neutralize terrorist safe havens in its territory. Despite acknowledging complicating factors in Pakistan's ties to terrorist groups, the US sees continued engagement with Pakistan as the only realistic option. The US has adopted a more confrontational stance towards Pakistan, suspending $800 million in security assistance in 2011. Aid to Pakistan is now conditioned on progress in combating militancy and promoting democratic institutions. At least $1 billion in coalition support fund reimbursements have been approved. Pakistan's behavior is unlikely to change due to long-held geostrategic perspectives of decision makers in Islamabad and Rawalpindi. This leads to continued tolerance of safe havens for militant groups, regardless of U.S. aid levels or threats. The Pakistan military's behavior is driven by perceived strategic interests, leading analysts to advocate for strong U.S. support for Pakistan's civilian authorities to reduce conflict. The current U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan emphasizes the need for a strong civilian government for successful U.S.-Pakistan cooperation, but after four years, Pakistan's civilian leaders show little willingness to address security issues. Civilian leaders in Pakistan are reluctant to address security issues and often blame the United States for extremism. This perspective overlooks Pakistan's historical support for Islamist militancy, including backing the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. President Obama did not visit Pakistan during his time in office. President Obama's decision to travel to India in 2010 without visiting Pakistan exacerbated anxiety among Pakistani officials. The Administration's India policies, including refraining from engagement in the Kashmir dispute and U.S.-India civil nuclear cooperation, are viewed suspiciously by Pakistani leaders and citizens. Afghanistan's closer ties with India in 2011 also added to the concerns in Pakistan. The events of 2011, including Afghanistan's alignment with India and the U.S.-Afghanistan partnership, have raised concerns in Pakistan about strategic encirclement by external forces. This may signal the end of the post-9/11 era in bilateral relations, leading to a more issue-based and transactional engagement in the future. Pakistan is moving towards a more narrow, issue-based relationship with the U.S., setting aside the broad strategic partnership envisioned in the past. This shift is reflected in the desire for a formal, business-like relationship with agreed-upon limits, including new restrictions on U.S. foreign assistance. Pakistan is seeking a more focused, transactional relationship with the U.S., including new restrictions on foreign assistance. Ambassador Sherry Rehman has outlined prerequisites for resetting the bilateral relationship. Pakistan is seeking a more transactional relationship with the U.S., including apologizing for past incidents, releasing suspended reimbursements, increasing intelligence sharing, halting drone strikes, and focusing on trade over aid. Former U.S. diplomats suggest reducing mutual expectations, targeting economic aid better, fostering business ties, and discreetly supporting initiatives for regional stability. The U.S. is urged to provide discreet support for initiatives promoting regional stability in South Asia, including improving Pakistan-India relations and potentially dropping opposition to the Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline project. Experts advise the Obama Administration to consider the positive trends in Pakistan's military and Pakistan-India relations, cautioning against a purely security-oriented approach that could fuel anti-American sentiment. The U.S. is advised to support initiatives for regional stability in South Asia, including improving Pakistan-India relations and potentially dropping opposition to the Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline project. Analysts caution against a purely security-focused approach that could increase anti-American sentiment. Pakistan's strong anti-American nationalism is seen as restoring credibility to its military, with some U.S. analysts criticizing Pakistan's intransigence on GLOCs and the Salala incident as a missed opportunity for cooperation. Some analysts suggest a shift to a more adversarial posture towards Pakistan, advocating for \"focused hostility\" to hold its military and intelligence services accountable. This could involve targeting individuals for sanctions and cutting military aid, with some even considering Pakistan an enemy of the United States in relation to Afghanistan. Some analysts propose a more adversarial approach towards Pakistan regarding Afghanistan policy, suggesting targeted sanctions and cutting military aid to hold Pakistani leaders accountable. Others argue against this shift, warning it could jeopardize the U.S.-led project in Afghanistan. A Washington-based Pakistani analyst also deems a \"two Pakistans\" strategy unworkable. The Washington-based Pakistani analyst believes that a \"two Pakistans\" approach is unworkable and misguided. They suggest a more passive U.S. approach focused on providing security assurances and strengthening Pakistan's civilian governance institutions. The analyst questions whether the Pakistani military's current economic rapprochement with India is a tactical choice to ease security and diplomatic pressure. The Pakistani military's economic rapprochement with India is questioned as a tactical choice to ease security and diplomatic pressure, potentially impacting Pakistan's geostrategic status. Commentators suggest a shift towards energy and trade cooperation with neighbors over traditional conflicts with India and Afghanistan. Pakistan's focus on conflict with India, \"strategic depth\" in Afghanistan, and the status of Kashmir may hinder its pursuit of transcending perpetual insecurity. The assassination of Punjab province's governor, Salman Taseer, a liberal politician critical of conservatives, highlights challenges faced by civilian leaders in implementing robust policies. The assassination of Punjab province's governor, Salman Taseer, by an Islamist for criticizing blasphemy laws in Pakistan was a blow to liberal forces. Another incident occurred on March 2, 2011, when Minorities Minister Shabaz Bhatti, the only Christian member of the federal cabinet, was shot dead by gunmen. Shabaz Bhatti, the only Christian member of Pakistan's federal cabinet, was shot to death for advocating tolerance towards religious minorities and reforming blasphemy laws. Secretary Clinton condemned the killing as an attack on values of tolerance. President Zardari addressed the assassinations in an op-ed, warning against a minority threatening principles of tolerance. Islamist radicalism is increasing in Pakistan, evidenced by the Taseer and Bhatti assassinations. Raymond Davis, an American working at the U.S. Consulate in Lahore, shot and killed two men in self-defense, leading to a diplomatic dispute over his immunity. President Obama initially claimed diplomatic immunity for Raymond Davis, describing him as \"our diplomat.\" However, it was later revealed that Davis was a CIA contractor involved in tracking militant groups in Pakistan. The controversy surrounding his legal status prompted some in Congress to suggest reducing U.S. assistance to Pakistan. In an attempt to ease tensions, Senator Kerry expressed regret during a visit to Islamabad. In late February, the CIA negotiated with the ISI to secure Davis's release. After weeks of negotiations and a pledge of $2.3 million in blood money, Davis was freed on March 16, 2011. Top U.S. officials denied any quid pro quo arrangement or providing financial compensation. On May 2, 2011, Osama bin Laden was located and killed. On May 2, 2011, Osama bin Laden was located and killed in Abbottabad, Pakistan, raising doubts about Pakistan's commitment to fighting extremism and leading to calls to reduce U.S. aid. The questioning of Pakistan's role in sheltering Osama bin Laden has raised concerns about the country's credibility. President Obama's advisor stated it was likely that bin Laden had a support system in Pakistan, leading to doubts about Pakistani officials' complicity or incompetence in the search for top Al Qaeda leaders. Pakistan's credibility suffered a serious blow when extremist figures found no refuge in the country. The military and intelligence services faced criticism for failing to detect a foreign military raid and the presence of the world's most-wanted terrorist. Army Chief Gen. Kayani warned against future incursions, and Parliament condemned the U.S. raid while calling for an end to drone strikes in western Pakistan. There were threats to close vital land lines of communication through Pakistan. The closure of land lines of communication through Pakistan disrupted NATO supply routes to Afghanistan, leading to anti-American protests. Bilateral distrust grew as Congress questioned Pakistan's knowledge of Osama bin Laden's whereabouts, calling for greater oversight of U.S. assistance. Despite some skepticism, senior Members urged a measured approach to the situation. The House Speaker emphasized the need for increased engagement with Pakistan despite existing distrust. President Obama and top U.S. officials maintained a positive stance towards Pakistan post-Abbottabad raid, raising questions about bin Laden's refuge. The U.S. government lacks conclusive evidence of official Pakistan's awareness of bin Laden's whereabouts. On May 22, 2011, militants attacked Pakistan's naval base near Karachi, resulting in casualties and a 16-hour gun battle. The incident raised concerns about Pakistan's cooperation in counterterrorism efforts. The Pakistani Taliban attacked a naval base near Karachi, destroying two U.S.-supplied aircraft. The breach raised questions about the security of Pakistan's nuclear weapons and possible inside help for the attackers. The Pakistani Taliban attacked a naval base near Karachi, destroying two U.S.-supplied aircraft. The base's attackers had inside help, as shown by their ability to avoid detection and take cover once inside. A former navy commando was arrested in connection with the case, and three navy officers, including the base commander, are to be court-martialed for negligence. ISI is accused of ordering the torture and murder of journalist Syed Saleem Shahzad, who suggested the Mehran attack was carried out. In May 2011, journalist Syed Saleem Shahzad was killed after suggesting the Pakistan Navy's crackdown on Al Qaeda cells led to the Mehran attack. The ISI denied involvement, but a government inquiry revealed senior ISI officials directed the attack to silence critics. Admiral Mike Mullen confirmed the allegations. In January 2012, a Commission of Inquiry in Pakistan was unable to identify the culprits behind journalist Syed Saleem Shahzad's murder. The commission recommended that intelligence agencies be made more law-abiding and accountable through various mechanisms. In July 2011, the Obama Administration suspended $440-$500 million in counterinsurgency training and equipment aid to Pakistan due to reduced U.S. military presence and visa processing delays. This move was also linked to the suspension of $300 million in Coalition Support Fund reimbursements. The Obama Administration suspended $440-$500 million in counterinsurgency aid to Pakistan in July 2011, linked to visa processing delays and reduced U.S. military presence. This included the suspension of $300 million in Coalition Support Fund reimbursements, seen as a warning to Islamabad about potential aid cuts. Pakistani military downplayed the impact, suggesting U.S. security assistance be redirected to development projects. Some observers believe this decision may lead to increased resentment rather than cooperation from Pakistani leaders. In October 2011, Pakistani-American businessman Mansoor Ijaz wrote an op-ed referencing a memo allegedly dictated to him by the Pakistani Ambassador to the US, requesting US assistance to prevent a military coup and install friendly leaders for Pakistan's military and intelligence services. This could be seen as validation by ordinary Pakistanis who view the US as an unreliable ally. The \"Memogate\" scandal in Pakistan involved a memo allegedly requesting US help to install friendly leaders in the military and intelligence services. The investigation led by the Pakistani Supreme Court, with military influence, implicated Ambassador Haqqani but lacked concrete evidence of wrongdoing by civilians. Haqqani denied involvement, and the scandal ultimately fizzled out, allowing him to leave his position. The civil-military clash in Pakistan raised concerns of President Zardari facing overthrow by the military. Army and intelligence officers confirmed the authenticity of the memo, leading to rumors of a possible military coup. Prime Minister Gilani warned against conspiracies to remove the elected government and emphasized the military's accountability to parliament. During December, rumors of a military coup in Pakistan were widespread, leading to tensions between the civilian government and the army. Despite the government's concerns, the public is against military intervention, and opposition politicians are not seeking the military's help. Gen. Kayani dismissed the rumors as speculation, while Prime Minister Gilani criticized the army for bypassing the government in engaging the court. In January, Parliament reaffirmed its supremacy and urged the army and Supreme Court to stay within constitutional limits. Prime Minister Gilani toned down his criticism of the military, leading to a decrease in the crisis atmosphere. The likelihood of a military coup in Pakistan is considered low due to the assertive judiciary, vocal media, and lack of support from opposition politicians. In a military operation, U.S. forces mistakenly attacked Pakistani army outposts, resulting in the death of 24 soldiers. The Pentagon stated that they believed they were under attack by Afghan insurgents and called in air support to neutralize the hilltop positions. Pakistani liaison officers tried to communicate that their soldiers were being fired upon, but the assault continued until the Pakistani casualties occurred. The mistaken U.S. military operation resulted in the death of 24 Pakistani soldiers, leading to anger and accusations of intentional killing. Prime Minister Gilani condemned the attacks as a breach of sovereignty and violation of international law. Pakistan closed NATO supply routes and evicted U.S. personnel from an airfield in response. The Pakistani government demands a formal apology from Washington for the closure of NATO supply routes, despite U.S. investigation findings of acting in self-defense. The NATO investigation into the incident involving Pakistan's military concluded that there was no intentional effort to target Pakistanis, citing miscommunication and poor coordination as central factors. Pakistan's military criticized the affixing of partial responsibility on them as unjustified and released a document in January 2012 detailing their perspective, acknowledging that Pakistani forces fired first but claiming it was legitimate. They criticized NATO investigators for claiming no Pakistani posts were known to be in the area and blamed the incident on the failure of US/ISAF coordination. The NATO investigation into the incident involving Pakistan's military found the \"fundamental cause\" was the failure of US/ISAF to share its near-border operation with Pakistan. The Obama Administration considered apologizing for the incident, with advocates believing it would mend relations, while opponents argued against showing weakness in pressuring Pakistan on counterinsurgency. Pentagon figures were involved in the decision-making process. The Obama Administration considered apologizing for the incident involving Pakistan's military, but Pentagon figures believed it would show weakness in pressuring Pakistan on counterinsurgency. Secretary Clinton was set to apologize in late February, but the plan was canceled after U.S. military personnel burned Korans in Afghanistan. Later, with insurgent attacks blamed on the Haqqani Network, arguments for an apology faded. U.S.-Pakistan relations were further strained in February 2012 during a hearing on Baluchistan. The Oversight and Investigations hearing on Baluchistan in Pakistan discussed the idea of partitioning the country into substates, including Baluchistan. A resolution expressing support for Baluchistan's right to self-determination was introduced by Representative Dana Rohrabacher, causing backlash from the Islamabad government and Pakistani media. The resolution supporting Baluchistan's right to self-determination sparked criticism from the Pakistani media and government. Prime Minister Gilani called it an attack on Pakistani sovereignty, leading to a freeze in relations with the United States. The Obama Administration distanced itself from the resolution, stating no policy to support Baluchistan's independence. The review process by the Islamabad government was completed in April 2012, showing assertiveness in foreign policy. The Pakistani civilian government's review process in April 2012 showed assertiveness in foreign policy. The 14-point guidelines issued included demands such as immediate cessation of U.S.-launched drone attacks and infiltration into Pakistani territory. The Pakistani government demands an apology from the United States for the NATO/ISAF attack, calls for justice for the Salala incident, and prohibits any use of Pakistani territory for transporting arms to Afghanistan. The Pakistani government demands an apology from the United States for the NATO/ISAF attack and prohibits any use of Pakistani territory for transporting arms to Afghanistan. Additionally, no covert operations or foreign bases will be allowed in Pakistan, and the US is urged to offer a civil nuclear deal similar to the one given to India in 2005. Despite expressions of respect for Pakistani sovereignty, drone strikes have continued at a reduced rate. Despite continued drone strikes at a reduced rate, U.S. Special Representative Marc Grossman's visit to Islamabad for high-level talks did not result in any breakthrough. Pakistan's demand for a halt to drone strikes remains a major point of contention. The CIA's reluctance to give up the ability to conduct drone strikes on \"high-value targets\" is a major point of contention. The use of \"signature strikes\" based on surveillance of suspected militants is also in question due to the risk of civilian casualties. Pakistani leaders may withhold opening NATO supply lines until drone strikes cease, with demands for an apology for accidental deaths of Pakistani soldiers being another sticking point. Pakistan continues to demand an unconditional apology for the inadvertent deaths of Pakistani soldiers at Salala. The U.S. government is withholding $1 billion in military reimbursements pending an agreement on bilateral reengagement. Pakistan's Foreign Ministry insists on abiding by Parliament's recommendations. NATO summit in Chicago focused on future engagement in Afghanistan, with Pakistan boycotting a previous summit in 2011. President Zardari received a personal call to attend the NATO summit in Chicago, despite previous tensions with the U.S. However, President Obama refused to meet with him in person, and no apology was given for the Salala incident, leading to strained relations. President Zardari's attendance at the NATO summit in Chicago was met with a snub from the U.S., with no apology for the Salala incident. Despite criticism from some in Pakistan, Foreign Minister Khar remained positive about Pakistan's participation. Urdu-language editorials praised Zardari for standing up to international pressure. On May 23, 2012, a tribal court in northwestern Pakistan convicted Shakil Afridi of treason and sentenced him to 33 years in prison for working with the CIA to collect DNA samples from Osama bin Laden's compound. The sentence sparked outrage in the United States, with the Obama Administration arguing there was no reason for Afridi to be held. The Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Armed Services Committee criticized the sentence given to Shakil Afridi, who helped the US locate Osama bin Laden. They argued that Afridi should be praised, not punished. Islamabad defended the conviction, but some Pakistani commentators are questioning it. Some Pakistani commentators are questioning the conviction of Shakil Afridi, who helped locate Osama bin Laden, due to concerns about the legal process and his right to appeal. The Administration's assessment of Afghanistan and Pakistan policy in March 2011 noted static progress on key U.S. objectives, with improved cooperation in counterinsurgency efforts but no significant progress in combating Al Qaeda. The last quarter of 2010 showed no progress in effectively executing the COIN cycle in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and the FATA. There is a lack of 'hold' and 'build' planning to complement clearing operations, hindering the path to defeating the insurgency in Pakistan. The certification under Section 203 of the Enhanced Partnership With Pakistan Act of 2009 allowed the release of security-related FY2011 aid to Pakistan, confirming Islamabad's efforts in combating terrorist groups and dismantling terrorist bases in the country. The certification under Section 203 of the Enhanced Partnership With Pakistan Act of 2009 allowed the release of security-related FY2011 aid to Pakistan, confirming Islamabad's efforts in combating terrorist groups. However, there was skepticism about Pakistan's actions against the Haqqani Network in the FATA, with the certification appearing driven by political considerations. Secretary of State mentioned considering legal requirements for the certification but no similar certification was issued for FY2012. The reporting period from January to August showed little positive news, with static indicators and metrics for enhancing civilian control and stable government in Pakistan. Pakistan's COIN capabilities also remained static in the first quarter of 2011 before declining, attributed to decreased bilateral security cooperation. International efforts to stabilize Pakistan were hindered by continued negative trends. The international community's involvement in stabilizing Pakistan has seen limited progress, with the IMF Stand-By Arrangement on hold since August 2010. The Pentagon's report highlighted positive trends in Afghanistan but emphasized that the Taliban insurgency in Pakistan remains a critical threat. The report emphasized that the Taliban insurgency in Pakistan poses a critical threat to the U.S.-led effort in Afghanistan, with sanctuaries in Pakistan being a major concern. Pakistan's actions, including selective counterinsurgency operations and provision of safe havens, continue to undermine security in Afghanistan. Pentagon and U.S. government believe Pakistan's support for Afghan Pashtuns and limited Indian influence leads to insurgent sanctuaries. U.S.-Pakistan relations strained over issues like freedom of travel for diplomats. Pakistani officials require \"No Objection Certificates\" for Americans. The strained U.S.-Pakistan relations involve issues like freedom of travel for diplomats and the revelation of U.S. citizens working for the ISI. President Obama has not visited Pakistan since taking office, and the Strategic Dialogue has not had a formal session since October 2010. However, high-level interactions continue, especially among military and intelligence officials. In October 2011, the Obama Administration sent a high-level delegation to Islamabad led by Secretary Clinton to address the issue of militant safe havens in western Pakistan. The U.S.-Pakistan Strategic Dialogue has been postponed indefinitely at the ministerial level. Strategic Dialogue between the U.S. and Pakistan has been postponed indefinitely. Secretary Clinton's formal talks scheduled for March 2011 have not taken place. However, engagement has continued at other levels, with Secretary Clinton meeting Foreign Minister Khar in February 2012. Clinton expressed U.S. eagerness to resume discussions on counterterrorism and Afghanistan, while Khar mentioned the need to address upcoming Senate elections before Parliament's recommendations. Ambassador Grossman also met with President Zardari in March. Amb. Grossman emphasized the U.S. commitment to a constructive relationship with Pakistan during a meeting with President Zardari in Dushanbe. President Obama also reiterated the desire for cooperation on counterterrorism and Afghanistan during a meeting with Prime Minister Gilani in Seoul. The U.S. welcomed Pakistan's parliamentary review process. In March, senior U.S. and Pakistani military commanders held formal talks in Rawalpindi to discuss border coordination issues. In April, Deputy Secretary of State Thomas Nides met with Foreign Minister Khar in Islamabad to build upon previous conversations and expressed optimism for achieving a balanced approach respecting Pakistan's sovereignty and interests. In April, USAID Administrator Rajiv Shah visited Pakistan to express strong U.S. commitment to building ties through civilian assistance. Amb. Grossman's visit in late April focused on U.S. desire to see GLOCs quickly, with no breakthroughs on major points of disagreement. The U.S.-Pakistan-Afghanistan Tripartite Commission met in Rawalpindi for the 35th time in mid-May. Washington's refusal to apologize for the Salala incident led to disagreements, with Grossman emphasizing the need to reopen GLOCs and Jilali opposing further drone strikes. Missile strikes by American UAVs in Pakistan have been controversial but effective against militants. The CIA oversees a covert drone program targeting Islamist militants in western Pakistan, with President Obama personally approving the \"kill list.\" In 2010, 118 drone strikes occurred, more than the previous six years combined, with 70 more strikes in 2011. The strikes have been effective against Al Qaeda but criticized for civilian casualties and militant recruitment. The Pakistani government protests the extrajudicial measures. The Pakistani government protests drone strikes in their territory, citing violations of sovereignty and international law. Despite official condemnation, there is speculation that Pakistan has allowed and even provided intelligence for the strikes. Some analysts support drone strikes on Pakistani territory as a necessary tactic against Al Qaeda and its allies. The program's messaging to Pakistan is evident, with strikes following key events like the release of Raymond Davis and the suspension of U.S. military aid. Recent strikes occurred after President Obama's refusal to meet with the Pakistani counterpart at the NATO summit in May 2012. At the May 2012 NATO summit, President Obama declined to meet with the Pakistani counterpart. There are differing opinions within the Administration on the use of UAV strikes in Pakistan, with some urging the CIA to reduce the pace. While there is agreement on the effectiveness of UAV attacks, concerns exist about the strained relationship with Pakistan and the risk of destabilizing the country. A 2011 White House review reaffirmed support for the CIA campaign but also implemented some changes, including a greater role for the State Department. The CIA campaign in Pakistan saw changes in strike decisions, with the State Department playing a larger role and Pakistani officials receiving more notice. The number of \"signature strikes\" decreased as a result. In 2011, the President's advisor praised the drone program for its precision, claiming no collateral deaths. President Obama later publicly acknowledged and defended the program. President Obama acknowledged and defended the drone program in Pakistan, claiming it had not caused many civilian casualties and was tightly controlled. However, independent analysts dispute this, estimating 145-535 civilian deaths, including children. Despite killing militants and commanders, violence in western Pakistan has not decreased. With a NATO troop drawdown in Afghanistan, the U.S. government may see no better option than to continue using drones. The U.S. government's close ties with Pakistan's ISI date back to the 1980s, but mutual mistrust has always been present. Doubts about ISI's activities and aims have compounded since 2008, with concerns about their use of militant proxies and involvement in extralegal activities and domestic politics. The ISI, under army control, is involved in abductions and manipulating politics. Lt. Gen. Zaheer-ul-Islam, appointed as DG-ISI in 2012, is seen as a potential candidate for the COAS position. The ISI has been accused by U.S. officials of supporting Afghan insurgents. The ISI is accused of actively supporting Afghan insurgents with money, supplies, and planning guidance, allowing them to sustain their insurgency. Reports suggest increased direct contacts with the Taliban, encouraging violence and supplying explosives. A leaked NATO report detailed information gathered from interrogations of captured militants. The leaked NATO report from January 2012 reveals that Afghan insurgents receive direct support from the ISI, with senior Taliban leaders regularly meeting ISI personnel for strategic advice. Pakistan's foreign minister dismissed the report as old news. The ISI is also linked to anti-India terrorist groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba, responsible for the 2008 Mumbai attack. \"Pakistani officials deny ISI cooperation with militants, but independent observers believe security services are infiltrated by extremists.\" Security services in Pakistan are believed to be infiltrated by Islamist extremists, with leaked U.S. diplomatic cables suggesting biased training for military officers. Analysts suggest that Pakistan's security services can be divided into two groups: one led by Gen. Kayani, which is nationalist, and the other driven by a revisionist Islamist ideology. Reports indicate strained CIA-ISI relations even before the Raymond Davis incident. The Raymond Davis episode worsened CIA-ISI relations, with American frustration over lack of Pakistani military action and ISI support for militants. The ISI demanded accountability for all CIA contractors in Pakistan after Davis was revealed as one. Intelligence cooperation may have been halted after the shooting. OBL's death raised concerns about ISI ties to extremism. Following OBL's death in May 2011, Pakistan cracked down on its citizens working with the CIA and allowed American investigators access to bin Laden's widows in custody. A Pakistani newspaper linked to the military and intelligence services revealed the name of the CIA's Islamabad station chief, causing concerns about deliberate disclosures of American operatives in Pakistan. After Osama bin Laden's death, Pakistan tightened control on CIA collaboration and granted access to bin Laden's widows. The ISI leadership faced increased scrutiny over collusion with Afghan insurgents, including instances of tipped-off bomb-making facilities in FATA. U.S. officials suspected deliberate disclosures by the ISI to show leverage and express anger towards U.S. policies. After Osama bin Laden's death, Pakistan faced accusations of tipping off targets about raids, which the military denied. U.S. officials believed Pakistan's delay in seeking permission allowed militants to escape. Despite interagency discord, joint intelligence work continued, leading to the arrest of a senior Al Qaeda operative in Karachi with U.S. assistance. An Al Qaeda operative, Mohammed Ali Qasim Yaqub, was arrested in Karachi with U.S.-provided intelligence. His capture was seen as a Pakistani effort to mend relations with Washington. Additionally, most-wanted terrorist Ilyas Kashmiri was killed in a drone strike, and Al Qaeda's deputy Atiyah Abd al-Rahman was killed in another strike in North Waziristan. In September, Pakistan announced the arrest of three senior Al Qaeda operatives near Quetta with CIA assistance. Bilateral intelligence cooperation targeting Al Qaeda and the \"Pakistani Taliban\" has continued despite worsening government relations. Reports suggest the CIA has invested heavily in establishing a network of \"secret friends\" in Pakistan for intelligence and counterterrorism efforts. Pakistani leaders have long sought access to Central Asia and \"strategic depth\" with regard to India through friendly relations with neighboring Afghanistan. This policy contributed to President-General Zia ul-Haq's support for Afghan mujahideen \"freedom fighters\" during the 1980s and Islamabad's later support for the Afghan Taliban regime from 1996 to 2001. The British colonialists divided the ethnic Pashtun tribes with the 1893 \"Durand Line.\" The 1,600-mile porous border known as the \"Durand Line\" divides the South Asian empire, causing tension between Afghan and Pakistani leaders. Both countries are key U.S. allies in combating Islamic militancy, but ongoing acrimony between Islamabad and Kabul hinders U.S. interests. Pakistan seeks a post-NATO Afghanistan that aligns with its goals, especially its military and intelligence services. Pakistan is believed to want a post-NATO Afghanistan that aligns with its interests, potentially using proxies like the Quetta Shura and Haqqani Network. The US aims for an independent Afghanistan that may cooperate more with India. The US relies on Pakistan for shaping the reconciliation process. Pakistan's reliance on Islamabad in shaping the reconciliation process may increase its leverage. The US seeks Pakistan's support for Afghan talks, but tensions arise from differing approaches. Pakistani officials are confused by unclear US goals for Afghanistan and pressure to use force against militants in North Waziristan. The US seeks Pakistan's support for Afghan talks, but tensions arise from differing approaches. Some argue that Washington risks rewarding Pakistani intransigence by giving their security services a key role in brokering peace with insurgent forces. ISI has been accused of trying to reinstate the Taliban regime. Pakistani cooperation is deemed necessary for reconciliation and stability in Afghanistan despite troubled relations with Kabul. Relations with Kabul remain troubled as Afghan insurgents find safe havens in Pakistani cities like Quetta and Karachi, hindering pacification efforts in southern and eastern Afghanistan. Declassified documents show the Taliban's resurgence in the mid-2000s was supported by sanctuaries in FATA. Despite some improvement in Pakistan-Afghanistan ties, Afghan officials still accuse Pakistan of aiding terrorism. Afghan wariness of Pakistani involvement persists. Many analysts are skeptical of Pakistani influence in Afghanistan, as Islamabad has a history of using \"Pashtun jihadi proxies\" to further its interests. Concerns arise over the potential U.S. military drawdown in Afghanistan and the impact on Pakistani interests. Islamabad fears being abandoned by the international community, similar to the 1990s. President Obama's announcement of a drawdown in 2011 raised further uncertainties. The U.S. military drawdown from Afghanistan signals a focus on an exit strategy, causing concerns for Pakistani leaders who view Afghan stability as vital. In 2011, Pakistani officials traveled to Kabul to accelerate the peace process, with reports suggesting efforts to weaken Kabul's partnership with the United States. In 2011, Pakistani officials aimed to shift Kabul's alliance from the U.S. to Pakistan and China, emphasizing an Afghan-led peace process. Despite initial commitments, tensions arose due to increased \"reverse infiltration.\" In the summer of 2011, increased \"reverse infiltration\" led to friction between Islamabad and Kabul after a cross-border raid resulted in the deaths of Pakistani soldiers. Afghan officials accused Pakistan of firing rockets into Afghan provinces, causing casualties. Pakistan denied involvement in cross-border attacks, but some in Afghanistan viewed the incidents as part of a larger effort to exert control over Afghanistan. Relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan deteriorated in September 2011 after the assassination of Afghan High Peace Council chairman Burhanuddin Rabbani. Afghan officials suspected ISI involvement in the murder, leading to tensions between the two countries. Pakistani officials denied any role in the assassination, but Afghan President continued to accuse Pakistan of interference. The Afghan president accuses Pakistan of supporting terrorism, with Afghan intelligence claiming a plot to assassinate Karzai was linked to Al Qaeda and the Haqqanis in the FATA region. Islamabad supports peace talks with the Afghan Taliban, emphasizing Kabul's role in setting parameters. Pakistan aims to prevent Indian influence in post-conflict Afghanistan. Pakistan's efforts to control Taliban negotiations in post-conflict Afghanistan included orchestrating the capture of Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar in 2010. The ISI's motives were questioned, with some believing it was to facilitate talks with certain Taliban commanders. Additionally, Pakistan attempted to broker reconciliation between the Kabul government and the Haqqani Network in mid-2010. Pakistan's attempt to broker reconciliation between the Kabul government and the Haqqani Network raised concerns about Islamabad exploiting the situation for maximal influence in post-conflict Kabul. NATO facilitated secret meetings between QST figures, Haqqani Network representatives, and Afghan officials in Kabul, with unclear involvement of Pakistani officials. Islamabad's substantive influence was evident in these efforts. In 2011, the U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan indicated that Pakistan has significant influence over top Afghan insurgents, hindering reconciliation talks in Kabul. Afghan President Karzai also criticized Pakistan for controlling insurgent leaders. By early 2012, Islamabad seemed to allow U.S.-Taliban negotiations to proceed. In April, Afghan President Karzai asked Pakistani leaders to influence the Taliban for negotiations. Despite initial skepticism, Prime Minister Gilani later appealed to the Taliban for peace talks. The Obama Administration welcomed this, amid concerns of Pakistan's ties to Afghan insurgents. Security services in the region are believed to be supporting Afghan insurgent groups to increase their leverage in the reconciliation process. The Haqqani Network, led by Jalaluddin Haqqani and his son Sirajuddin, is seen as the most dangerous group in eastern Afghanistan, posing a strategic threat to Afghan stability and U.S. national security interests. The Haqqani Network, Afghanistan's most potent insurgent group, maintains close ties with al-Qaeda. Military offensives are needed to address the group beyond 2012. Pakistan has not taken action against the Haqqanis in North Waziristan, citing stretched forces. Pakistan's inaction against the Haqqani Network is believed to be due to their longstanding relationship with Jalaluddin Haqqani and a desire to exert influence in post-ISAF Afghanistan. The Haqqanis have carried out high-profile attacks in Afghanistan, including the Intercontinental Hotel assault and a truck bomb attack on a U.S. military base. The attack in the Wardak province injured 77 American troops and killed 5 Afghans. A well-planned assault on the U.S. Embassy compound in Kabul on September 13, 2011, left 16 Afghans dead, including 5 police officers and 6 children. The attack was seen as a blow to the narrative of Afghanistan becoming more secure. Admiral Mullen called on General Kayani to press for Pakistani military action against militants. Admiral Mullen escalated pressure on Pakistan to take action against Haqqani bases, accusing ISI of supporting them in Afghanistan. Secretary Panetta issued a warning to Pakistan, stating the US will protect its forces from Haqqani attacks. Mullen's testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee was the strongest yet. Admiral Mullen accused Pakistan's ISI of supporting the Haqqani network in Afghanistan, linking them to various attacks including the truck bomb attack on September 13 and the assault on the US embassy. Secretary Panetta emphasized the need to pressure Pakistan to take action against the Haqqani network. The top military officials of America called for increased pressure on Pakistan to address their support for the Haqqani network in Afghanistan, signaling a new level of U.S. intolerance. Despite President Obama's statement on unclear intelligence regarding the ISI-Haqqani relationship, he still urged Pakistan to resolve the issue. The Wardak truck bombing was later referred to as a \"turning point\" in the situation. The Wardak truck bombing was a turning point in hardening Secretary Clinton's attitude towards the Haqqanis, leading to further attacks by Haqqani fighters in Afghanistan. Islamabad denies responsibility for the violence and rejects claims of supporting the Haqqanis. The Pakistani military refuted allegations of conducting a proxy war or backing the Haqqanis. Foreign Minister Khar warned against such accusations. President Zardari responded to allegations against Pakistan, warning that verbal assaults are damaging the bilateral relationship. Pakistani officials have been trying to facilitate peace talks between the Haqqanis and the Kabul government, but the close links between the Haqqanis and Al Qaeda have been a major obstacle. Pakistan's military and intelligence agencies are seen as influential in potentially pushing the Haqqanis towards negotiations. Unnamed Pakistani military officials claim they can \"deliver\" the Haqqanis to negotiations, potentially avoiding a military conflict. Bringing the insurgent group to the table would give Islamabad a central role in the process, a move some in Washington wish to avoid. The Obama Administration is considering designating the Haqqani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. The Haqqani Network is being considered for designation as a Foreign Terrorist Organization under U.S. law, with pressure from senior Senators like Carl Levin and Dianne Feinstein. Despite some leaders already being under sanctions, negotiations with the Haqqani leadership have been attempted in the past without success. The Haqqani Network Terrorist Designation Act of 2011 was passed by the Senate but has not progressed in the House committee. Congressional frustration has grown over the delay in the formal review for FTO designation. Ammonium nitrate is a widely used fertilizer and explosives precursor in IEDs used by Islamist insurgents in Afghanistan. The use of ammonium nitrate (AN) in IEDs by Islamist insurgents in Afghanistan has increased since the government banned the substance in 2010. Most illicit AN in Afghanistan is believed to come from transshipments from Pakistan. Data from the Pentagon shows a peak in total IED events in the summer of 2011, but improved detection and clearing capabilities have led to a decline in the effective IED attack rate. The Intelligence Authorization Act of FY2012 required the Director of National Intelligence and Secretary of Defense to take action. The U.S. government is urging Islamabad to adjust Pakistani national laws to restrict access to ammonium nitrate (AN) in Afghanistan. Washington's efforts include diplomatic, law enforcement, and science and technology initiatives to counter IED-related networks in Pakistan and Afghanistan. The U.S. government is working with various agencies on initiatives to combat illicit cross-border trafficking of chemical explosives precursors, including AN. Operation Global Shield, a multilateral law enforcement operation, has seen success in monitoring and preventing the movement of these precursors. The program, in collaboration with the Office on Drugs and Crime and Interpol, has achieved notable successes. Experts recommend adding urea fertilizer granules to ammonium nitrate to hinder its use in explosives. Other suggestions include adding colored dyes or radio frequency identification tags to track shipments. Pakarab Fertilizers Ltd. in Multan, Pakistan, is the country's largest fertilizer complex, producing over 300,000 metric tons of AN annually since 2004. The Multan facility in Pakistan has been producing over 300,000 metric tons of AN annually since 2004. Legislation in Islamabad to restrict AN and other precursors is still in draft stage, making near-term changes unlikely. The United States relies on Pakistani authorities to combat corruption in the absence of an outright ban. NATO depends on ground and air lines of communication through Pakistan. NATO has been reliant on ground and air lines of communication through Pakistan to supply forces in Afghanistan. These routes have been closed for six months due to Pakistan's grievances, including attacks by militants on the supply lines. The historic Khyber Pass connecting Peshawar with Jalalabad, Afghanistan, and the route from Karachi to Kandahar via Quetta and the Chaman border crossing have faced attacks, resulting in destroyed trucks and Pakistani drivers killed. Truck drivers often pay bribes to reach the Afghan border from Karachi, with some trucks being emptied of their cargo for sale in Peshawar markets. In response, the U.S. military has been exploring alternative routes from Central Asia to reduce reliance on Pakistan. The military began testing alternative routes from Central Asia and Russia, known as the \"Northern Distribution Network\" (NDN), which carries over half of NATO's supplies. While Pakistan is preferred for logistics, aerial and NDN routes are being expanded despite higher costs and reliance on authoritarian regimes. Loss of Pakistani routes has not significantly impacted Afghan operations. British deputy commander of ISAF forces stated they were managing well. The British deputy commander of ISAF forces mentioned that they were managing well without Pakistani GLOCs, but reopening them would be beneficial. Gen. Allen stated that the closure of GLOCs has not negatively affected the campaign, but the Pentagon's report highlighted concerns about the backlog of equipment for Afghan security forces due to the closure. Over 4,100 vehicles are stranded in Pakistan, impacting Afghan security forces. NATO needs to remove a significant amount of shipping containers and vehicles worth billions of dollars as they withdraw from Afghanistan. U.S. commanders emphasized the importance of reopening Pakistani GLOCs as the spring \"fighting season\" approached in 2012. Pakistani officials indicated readiness to reopen the GLOCs by mid-May. Senior Pakistani officials indicated readiness to reopen the GLOCs by mid-May, with reports suggesting a deal had already been struck before the Chicago summit. However, just days before the summit, Pakistani negotiators proposed a drastic fee increase of $5,000 per truck, a significant jump from previous levels. This sudden price hike posed challenges for the Pentagon, as the use of Pakistani GLOCs was previously considered \"free\" in exchange for billions of dollars in CSF. Negotiations on the $5,000 fee for Pakistani GLOCs have not reached a resolution. Islamist extremism and militancy have plagued Pakistani society since 2001, with a peak in attacks and victims in 2009. Additionally, Baluchistan province faces a serious separatist insurgency. Pakistan continues to struggle with a separatist insurgency in Baluchistan and politically motivated violence in Karachi. Despite a decrease in terrorist incidents since 2009, the country still ranks third in the world for such incidents. Suicide bombings have become a significant issue, with Pakistan accounting for nearly half of all worldwide deaths from such attacks in recent years. In recent years, Pakistan has seen a significant decrease in Islamist attacks, attributed to military operations, drone strikes, and improved law enforcement. However, the government is sometimes seen as being influenced by terrorists. Islamist militant groups in the country have shown mutual animosity in the past. After 2009, various militant groups in Pakistan, including Al Qaeda and the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), became more intertwined and supportive. Concerns persist about Al Qaeda's presence in Pakistan, despite recent losses of key members. The TTP, known as the \"Pakistani Taliban,\" has members from different tribal agencies and settled districts. The Quetta Shura Taliban, led by Mullah Omar, is active in Quetta and Karachi, along with the Haqqani Network. The Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), a U.S.-designated terrorist group with ties to the ISI, is considered a growing threat to U.S. national security. Analysts view LeT as the most dangerous terrorist group in South Asia, operating in Pakistan's Punjab province. The Raymond Davis affair may have revealed new U.S. intelligence operations against LeT. The LeT is identified as the most dangerous terrorist group in South Asia, with a growing global threat potential. Pakistan's Ambassador to the U.S. criticizes the country's focus on U.S. violations of sovereignty instead of combating jihadist ideology that has claimed many Pakistani lives. The Pakistan army has deployed 150,000 troops in response to militancy in western Pakistan, with over 3,000 soldiers killed in combat. Conflict has affected all seven FATA agencies and adjacent regions, with offensives in the Swat Valley in 2009. Haqqani criticizes the Supreme Court for focusing on dislodging the civilian government instead of pursuing terrorist leaders. The Pakistani military has faced challenges in the \"holding\" and \"building\" phases of operations in conflict-affected regions like Swat Valley and South Waziristan. Independent analyses show mixed results from military offensives in Swat and FATA from 2009 to 2011, with temporary success in dislodging militants. The Pakistani military has seen major successes in temporarily dislodging militants in Swat and FATA, but sustained counterinsurgency progress has not been achieved. The air force has conducted numerous combat sorties and bombings in the FATA, with ongoing fighting in Kurram and Khyber agencies. Spring 2012 battles in Khyber have displaced over 500,000 civilians. The Pakistani army has made progress in degrading Lashkar-i-Islam's capabilities, leading to the displacement of over 500,000 civilians. Despite this, a simmering insurgency still affects most FATA agencies, with TTP militants carrying out attacks in various regions. The North Waziristan agency is a key haven for Afghan- and Pakistan-oriented militants, but Pakistani officials have not moved their military into the area despite U.S. requests. Pakistan's military is inexperienced in counterinsurgency and lacks capacity for nonconventional warfare. Pakistan's military lacks capacity for nonconventional warfare, hindering US efforts to bolster COIN capabilities. Military operations and political strategies have splintered the Pakistani Taliban, leading to a decrease in suicide bomb attacks in 2011. The decrease in suicide bomb attacks in Pakistan last year may be attributed to the longstanding feuds between Mehsud and other militant commanders, leading to internal conflicts within the TTP. Pakistani officials considered new negotiations with TTP militants as the US favored talks with the Afghan Taliban. Negotiations with TTP militants were considered as the US shifted towards talks with the Afghan Taliban. Deputy TTP chief Maulvi Faqir Muhammad claimed meetings with government representatives started in November. Despite initial silence from Rawalpindi, concerns arose over failed past efforts in FATA. A TTP spokesman later denied ongoing negotiations, leading to Faqir's reported removal from his position in March, causing discontent among his lieutenants in Bajaur agency. Negotiations with TTP militants were considered as the US shifted towards talks with the Afghan Taliban. Deputy TTP chief Maulvi Faqir Muhammad claimed meetings with government representatives started in November. Despite initial silence from Rawalpindi, concerns arose over failed past efforts in FATA. A TTP spokesman later denied ongoing negotiations, leading to Faqir's reported removal from his position in March, causing discontent among his lieutenants in Bajaur agency. Meanwhile, Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Omar has pressured Pakistani militants to make peace with the Pakistani army. Al Qaeda and Haqqani group interlocutors mediated an intra-militant pact to unify four major factions under Omar's leadership in Waziristan agencies, directing hostility towards Afghanistan. The TTP and Haqqani group are shifting focus from anti-Pakistan insurgency to Afghanistan, causing concern for the Pakistani military. The US offered a $10 million reward for information on Hafiz Saeed, leader of the group behind the 2008 Mumbai attack, straining US-Pakistan relations. In April, well-armed militants attacked a prison in Bannu, Pakistan, freeing nearly 400 prisoners, including a terrorist sentenced to death for a 2003 plot against President Musharraf. The incident further strained relations between the US and Pakistan, with Prime Minister Gilani criticizing the US move as widening the trust deficit between the two countries. Opposition lawmakers also denounced the US announcement. The raid on a prison in Bannu, Pakistan, where nearly 400 prisoners were freed, including a terrorist sentenced to death, strained relations between the US and Pakistan. Secretary of State Clinton urged Pakistan to take more action against terrorist sanctuaries and extremist groups operating with impunity in the country. Pakistan-based extremist and militant groups, including the Afghan Taliban leadership in Quetta and Karachi, the Haqqani Network in North Waziristan, and U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations like LeT and Jaish-e-Mohammed in Punjab, pose significant threats to the United States and its allies. Concerns about American citizens being recruited for Islamist terrorism by Pakistan-based elements escalated in 2010, exemplified by Faisal Shahzad's failed bombing attempt as a naturalized U.S. citizen of Pakistani origin. In May, Faisal Shahzad, a Pakistani-American, tried to bomb Times Square, claiming ties to the Pakistani Taliban. He received a life sentence. Other cases involve U.S. citizens linked to terrorism in Pakistan, like the 2008 Mumbai attack and David Coleman Headley's charges in 2009. In 2009, David Coleman Headley, a Chicagoan convert to Islam, was charged with scouting for the Pakistan-based LeT terrorist group in Mumbai. He pleaded guilty to the charges and had connections to a retired Pakistani major and Ilayas Kashmiri, a former Pakistani special forces commando with ties to Al Qaeda. In 2010, the Indian government gained direct access to Headley, a former Pakistani special forces commando with ties to Al Qaeda. The interrogation revealed a Pakistani role in the Mumbai attack. In 2011, Rana was on trial for supporting terrorism related to the attack, with LeT chief Hafez Saeed and an ISI officer named \"Major Iqbal\" also indicted. Headley, the prosecution's key witness, exposed links between the ISI and terrorism. The ISI's links to terrorism, highlighted by Headley, strained U.S.-Pakistan relations. Rana was acquitted of Mumbai attack charges but found guilty of aiding LeT and plotting against a Danish newspaper. Decades of hostility between Pakistan and India, marked by wars and border tensions, stem from the bitter partition of British India in 1947 and the unresolved Kashmir issue. The partition of British India in 1947 and the Kashmir sovereignty issue have caused tension between India and Pakistan. Both countries have large defense establishments, impacting economic and social development. A \"Composite Dialogue\" initiated in 2004 led to modest successes like a formal cease-fire and increased trade across the Kashmiri Line of Control. However, relations deteriorated in 2008. In 2008, Pakistan-India relations deteriorated following a terrorist attack in Mumbai that killed 165 civilians. Territorial disputes over Kashmir, Siachen Glacier, and Sir Creek remain unresolved. Conflict over water resources emerged as another issue in 2010. Pakistani leaders believe regional peace is linked to resolving the Kashmir dispute. The U.S. government under the Obama Administration has maintained a hands-off approach to the Kashmir dispute, refraining from mediation. Pakistan and India are engaged in a \"shadow war\" in Afghanistan, with high-visibility attacks targeting Indian interests. Islamabad accuses New Delhi of using consulates in Afghanistan for interference in Pakistan, especially after the 2008 Mumbai attack. India and Pakistan resumed high-level peace talks in 2011 after a hiatus of more than two years, following a brief \"cricket diplomacy\" between Prime Minister Gilani and his Indian counterpart. The talks did not overtly mention the terrorism issue, despite concerns about anti-India terrorist groups in Pakistan receiving support from official elements. In 2011, India and Pakistan resumed high-level peace talks after a hiatus. Bilateral talks between home secretaries led to an agreement to establish a \"terror hotline.\" Commerce secretaries discussed economic cooperation, while foreign secretaries agreed to expand confidence-building measures and increase trade and travel across the Kashmiri LOC. A Joint Statement during Foreign Minister Khar's visit to New Delhi was seen as a positive step towards peace. During Khar's visit to New Delhi, the two countries' trade ministers agreed to further liberalize bilateral trade. India also dropped its opposition to an EU initiative waiving duties on Pakistani exports from flood-ravaged areas. The circumstances of OBL's death were relevant to Pakistan-India relations, with Indian PM Singh calling it a significant step forward. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh praised the killing of Osama bin Laden as a significant step forward in the fight against terrorism. However, New Delhi is concerned about a potential hastened U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and its impact on India's foreign policy interests. India also sees the event as an opportunity to push for the extradition of Lashkar-e-Taiba figures and other anti-India terrorists believed to be in Pakistan. Afghan President Karzai strengthened ties with India through a new strategic framework agreement, causing Pakistan to feel encircled. This move was seen as provocative by some analysts, as it came amidst Kabul's efforts to reconcile with the Taliban. The current tenor of Pakistan's relations with India is better than in previous years, with the Pakistan-supported separatist rebellion in Indian-held Kashmir at its lowest ebb since 1989. In late 2011, Pakistan vowed to grant normal trade status to India by the end of 2012, a move seen as a significant development by the U.S. State Department. The recent developments in Pakistan-India relations, including lower tariffs and fewer visa restrictions, could significantly boost bilateral trade and build peace constituencies in both countries. Islamabad's shift towards freer trade, moving from a \"positive list\" to a \"negative list\" for imports from India, indicates a potential easing of long-standing tensions, such as the Kashmir issue. Additionally, the absence of terrorist attacks in India linked to Pakistan is a positive sign for improved relations. President Zardari's visit to India in 2012 marked the first by a Pakistani head of state since 2005. Shortly after, an avalanche at Siachen Glacier killed 139 Pakistani soldiers, highlighting the ongoing conflict in the region. The tragic avalanche at Siachen Glacier in 2012 emphasized the ongoing conflict in the region, where Pakistan and India signed pacts with Turkmenistan to build a $7.6 billion pipeline for natural gas, supported by the U.S. as part of the New Silk Road Initiative. Despite some positive developments such as the gas pipeline agreement with Turkmenistan, India's concerns about Pakistan's support for Islamist militancy and the lack of action against terrorism masterminds continue to hinder progress in the region. The security situation in Afghanistan also remains uncertain, impacting investor confidence. The freedom of LeT chief Hafiz Saeed in Pakistan is a major issue, with India criticizing Islamabad for not acting on evidence to prosecute him and other Mumbai attack suspects. India also seeks extradition of Ibrahim and Indian Mujahedeen leaders in Pakistan. Economic cooperation could prevent open conflict, with Pakistan's generals playing a key role. Pakistan and China have a longstanding beneficial relationship. China has had a close and long-standing relationship with Pakistan, serving as a key arms supplier since the 1960s. Chinese companies are heavily involved in the Pakistani economy, and there are plans to build new civilian nuclear reactors in Pakistan. During a visit in 2010, 12 Memoranda of Understanding were signed between the two governments. In late 2010, Pakistan and China signed 12 Memoranda of Understanding, with contracts worth $15 billion in various sectors. In August 2011, Pakistan responded promptly to China's accusations of terrorist activities by dispatching ISI Director Pasha to Beijing. In 2012, Beijing expressed concerns about Uighur separatists finding refuge in Pakistan, straining bilateral relations. As U.S.-India ties strengthen and U.S.-Pakistan ties worsen, Islamabad is increasingly reliant on its friendship with Beijing. Pakistani leaders showed strong closeness with China in 2011, with Prime Minister Gilani's visit following the Abbottabad raid. In May 2011, Prime Minister Gilani's visit to China did not result in a major new embrace from Beijing, but China emphasized the need for the West to respect Pakistan's sovereignty. They agreed to expedite the delivery of 50 JF-17 fighter jets to Pakistan and are in negotiations for the purchase of six submarines worth up to $3 billion. China sees its relationship with Pakistan as a way to balance against India. China views its relationship with Pakistan as a means to balance against India. There is potential for U.S.-China coordination to improve Pakistan's military and intelligence services and pressure Islamabad to dismantle terrorist groups. Cooperation could also extend to nonproliferation, governance, and other vital areas. China's cooperation with Pakistan extends to nonproliferation, governance, and economic growth. Chinese support for Pakistan hinders India's regional ambitions, and as the US deepens its partnership with India, China's reliance on Pakistan is likely to increase. However, China's broader interests suggest that its \"all-weather friendship\" with Pakistan may no longer involve unconditional support. The Chinese government is unlikely to solely focus on balancing India in its Pakistan policies. Pakistan's relations with Iran have been troubled by differences over Afghanistan and the presence of anti-Shia terrorist groups. Both countries aim to complete a gas pipeline from Iran to address Pakistan's energy needs. Iran has completed construction on its side of the border for a gas pipeline to Pakistan, offering $500 million for Pakistan's construction after a Chinese consortium withdrew. The US opposes the project due to sanctions on Iran's nuclear program, with Secretary of State Clinton stating that starting construction on the Pakistani side would violate US law. Washington has expressed concerns to Islamabad. The US has expressed concerns to Islamabad about the Iran sanctions law and Pakistan's involvement in a gas pipeline project with Iran. Tehran has tried to bypass sanctions by proposing barter deals with Pakistan for oil in exchange for wheat and rice. The security of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal is a top US concern, especially with the presence of Islamist militants and past instances of illicit nuclear proliferation. The network overseen by Pakistani metallurgist A.Q. Khan was exposed in 2004, but no criminal charges have been filed against him or his alleged co-conspirators. Concerns remain about the integrity of Pakistan's nuclear security and the potential for leakage of nuclear know-how. Recent reports suggest Pakistan is expanding its nuclear weapons arsenal, possibly in response to US-India civil nuclear cooperation. The Obama Administration seeks civil nuclear cooperation with India and is concerned about Pakistan's rapidly growing nuclear arsenal. China's plan to build nuclear reactors in Pakistan raises international concerns. Economic issues like inflation, unemployment, food, and energy shortages add to Pakistan's challenges. Pakistan's economy faces challenges exacerbated by devastating flooding in 2010 and 2011, with losses of $10 billion. Corruption hinders economic development, reducing foreign investment and public confidence. Militancy is a major cause of declining foreign direct investment, dropping to under $2.2 billion in FY2010/2011. Analysts attribute the economic decline in Pakistan to increasing militancy, global recession, and political instability in Islamabad. International financial institutions prioritize addressing inflation, budget deficit, reviving growth, and managing higher global oil prices. Pakistan's GDP per capita was once higher than India's, but India's growth surged in the early 2000s, leading to a significant gap between the two countries. India's national wealth figures are higher than Pakistan's, even on a per capita basis. Pakistan sought multi-billion dollar loans from the IMF in 2008 due to a balance-of-payments crisis. The current IMF-supported program is a $11.3 billion Stand-By Arrangement, with $3.6 billion yet to be disbursed. Islamabad's failure to implement required reforms led to a hold on the program in 2010. Pakistan is seeking a second IMF program with stricter conditions, including restructuring public sector enterprises. Security concerns in 2011 delayed disbursement of remaining support funds. Pakistan has requested U.S. help to influence the IMF for relaxed conditions, but it is unlikely the U.S. will intervene. Repayment of IMF loans will heavily constrain Islamabad's finances. Repayment of IMF loans will heavily constrain Islamabad's federal budget due to low revenue generation and mass tax evasion by the economic elite. Secretary Clinton criticizes Pakistan's 9% tax-to-GDP ratio, one of the lowest globally. The government's efforts to implement tax reforms and reduce fuel subsidies have faced challenges. The government's attempt to lower fuel subsidies in early 2011 caused political turmoil when a coalition partner withdrew support. Electricity shortages are a major factor in Pakistan's economic decline, leading to businesses shutting down due to power outages lasting up to 20 hours a day. Public protests over gas shortages have turned violent in some cities. Public opinion surveys in Pakistan show that inflation is the top concern for citizens, with 52% considering it the most important issue. Despite economic growth of 2.4% in the fiscal year ending June 2011, challenges like public debt, inflation, and energy shortages continue to hinder progress. The devastating floods in FY2011 have exacerbated these issues. The State Bank of Pakistan acknowledges that the flooding in Pakistan cannot hide the underlying structural deficiencies in the economy, such as low tax revenues and power shortages. Plans to reform taxes and subsidies are delayed, with power outages estimated to reduce GDP growth by up to 4%. Poor governance is identified as the root cause of these economic problems. International financial institutions regularly assess Pakistan's economic situation. The World Bank's assessment of the Pakistani economy in November 2011 highlighted challenges faced by the government, including a deteriorated fiscal situation and governance issues. The outlook is negative with significant macroeconomic risks, and the World Bank recommends focusing on human development sectors like education and health to address poverty. The IMF report from February 2012 warns that Pakistan's economic prospects are not good due to low growth, high inflation, and weakening external position. Urgent policy action is recommended to strengthen public finances, reform the energy sector, and address the unsustainable fiscal deficits and monetary policy. The IMF report from February 2012 warns of Pakistan's poor economic prospects due to low growth, high inflation, and weakening external position. Urgent policy action is needed to strengthen public finances, reform the energy sector, and address fiscal deficits. Pakistani leaders aim to improve access to Western markets, especially for textile exports, to boost the economy. Islamabad is seeking reduced tariffs on textile exports following flood damage to the cotton crop, which directly employs 3.5 million people and accounts for 40% of urban factory jobs. Pakistani officials and business leaders estimate that abolishing American tariffs on cotton apparel could increase exports by $5 billion annually. Democracy in Pakistan has been unstable, with power struggles among presidents, prime ministers, and army chiefs. The bicameral Parliament holds federal power, with a 342-seat National Assembly and a 100-seat Senate. Members are elected to five-year terms, while the President is indirectly elected. President Zardari was elected in September 2008, and the military still holds significant influence over Pakistan's foreign and national security policies. The civilian government led by the PPP has struggled to stay in power and implement major reforms. The judiciary in Pakistan, empowered by the 2008 \"Lawyer's Movement,\" is battling with the executive branch and pursuing corruption charges against politicians, including President Zardari. Independent analysts warn that political turmoil could lead to economic chaos due to widening deficits. In 2010 and 2011, threats to the PPP's majority status and government arose from coalition politics. The government in Pakistan faced challenges from coalition politics, with the MQM withdrawing and rejoining the ruling coalition multiple times in 2011. The MQM's actions threatened the government's parliamentary majority, leading to concerns of potential collapse. Withdrawals were seen as attempts to gain more administrative control in Karachi. In May 2011, the PPP strengthened its standing by forming an alliance with the PML-Q faction, former supporters of Pervez Musharraf. This alliance, along with the party's support in Punjab and agreement to contest elections as PPP allies, poses a threat to Nawaz Sharif's PML-N faction. The secular Pashtun nationalist ANP is also a PPP coalition ally. The ANP, a PPP coalition ally, holds government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. PPP's gains in the 2012 Senate elections secured control until 2015. Despite potential losses in upcoming National Assembly polls, PPP's increased plurality allows them to block legislation. The embarrassment of OBL's death led to rare criticism of the Pakistani military, creating an opportunity for civilian leaders to gain more control over foreign and national affairs. The embarrassment of the May 2011 Mehran naval base attack and scandals led to increased media criticism of Pakistan's security establishment. Despite this, civilian leaders have not taken advantage of the opportunity to gain more control over foreign and national security policies. Parliament did establish a commission to investigate how Osama bin Laden found refuge in Pakistan and how American forces entered Pakistani territory. The body's lack of focus and cohesion diminished expectations for greater civilian authority in Pakistan. Civil-military tensions worsened after the May 2011 bin Laden raid, almost leading to a military coup in late 2011. In early 2012, Prime Minister Gilani faced contempt charges for not complying with Supreme Court orders regarding a corruption case against President Zardari. In early 2012, Prime Minister Gilani faced contempt charges for not complying with Supreme Court orders against President Zardari. The court found Gilani guilty of contempt but only sentenced him for the time it took to adjourn. Many legal scholars predict he will be disqualified from office after the appeal period expires in June. In late 2011, former cricket hero Imran Khan rose as a new political star in Pakistan with his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, attracting support from young and middle-class Pakistanis with anti-corruption and anti-American sentiment. Khan's PTI, previously considered a \"party of one,\" gained momentum despite minimal representation in Parliament. Imran Khan's rise in Pakistani politics with his PTI party was fueled by anti-corruption and anti-American sentiment. His rallies drew large crowds and he gained support from major national parties, posing a threat to Nawaz Sharif's PML-N. While unlikely to win enough seats to become Prime Minister, Khan could play a significant role in future governance. He has pledged to cut off U.S. aid if he comes to power. Imran Khan's rise in Pakistani politics was fueled by anti-corruption and anti-American sentiment. He vowed to cut off U.S. aid and end conflict with the Pakistani Taliban within 90 days if he comes to power. Khan's rapid ascent in late 2011 reflected the public's desire for honest politicians. There are concerns about his sympathy for Islamist causes and alleged military backing. The emergence of Pakistan's conservative Islamist political forces through the Difa-e-Pakistan (DPC) has raised concerns internationally. The DPC, consisting of over 40 Islamist and rightwing parties, including banned extremist groups, is leading protests against US cooperation and reconciliation with India. Hafiz Saeed, linked to the LeT terrorist group, is a prominent figure at DPC rallies opposing the reopening of GLOCs. The DPC, a coalition of Islamist parties including banned extremist groups, opposes reopening GLOCs, viewing it as aiding US presence in Afghanistan. Anti-American sentiment is a political tool in Pakistan, with security services possibly supporting DPC to leverage against the US and civilian leaders. Pakistan is plagued by serious human rights abuses, with the state itself being involved in some of them. The U.S. Department of State notes that despite some positive steps by the civilian government, the overall human rights situation remains poor, with a lack of government accountability leading to a culture of impunity. The most serious issues include extrajudicial killings, torture, and disappearances by security forces and extremist groups. The human rights situation in Pakistan is concerning, with issues such as poor prison conditions, arbitrary detention, weak criminal justice system, lack of judicial independence, harassment of journalists, restrictions on freedom of assembly and movement, religious freedom violations, and widespread corruption. Violence, abuse, and discrimination against minorities, women, and children persisted in Pakistan. Human trafficking, forced labor, and societal discrimination based on various factors continued to be serious problems. Human rights abuses, including violence, abuse, and intolerance, contribute to a culture of lawlessness in Pakistan. The country is ranked as the most dangerous for journalists, with concerns over disappearances and extrajudicial killings by security forces. The US has expressed concerns and withheld funding due to evidence of abuses. The Leahy amendment provisions will withhold funding for Pakistani army units involved in human rights abuses. Blasphemy laws in Pakistan protect Islamic beliefs but are criticized for being discriminatory and arbitrary. International human rights groups have raised concerns over the misuse of these laws, highlighted by a case in 2010 where a Pakistani Christian woman was sentenced to death for a minor offense. The Pakistani government faced pressure to repeal blasphemy laws after a Christian woman was sentenced to death for a minor offense. Despite calls for reform, government officials backed away from proposals due to opposition from hardline Islamist groups. Key politicians advocating for reform were assassinated, leading to the withdrawal of legislative proposals for change. In 2001, Congress renewed large U.S. assistance packages to Pakistan, totaling $15.3 billion over ten years. In 2009, Congress passed the Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act, authorizing increased nonmilitary aid and placing conditions on security-related aid. The Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act (EPPA) of 2009, also known as the \"Kerry-Lugar-Berman\" (KLB) bill, became P.L. 111-73. Congress established the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund (PCCF) to enhance Pakistani security forces' ability to combat militancy. Billions of dollars have been appropriated since FY2002 to reimburse Pakistan for its support of U.S.-led counterterrorism operations, with over $9 billion paid to date. The Administration's Pakistan Assistance Strategy Report in December 2009 outlined objectives for U.S. assistance to Pakistan, focusing on building a stable, secure, and prosperous Pakistan. It proposed allocating $3.5 billion for high-impact programs from FY2010-FY2014, out of the $7.5 billion authorized by the EPPA. Washington is considering providing grants for infrastructure projects in Pakistan, including the construction of the Diamer Basha dam. The project, led by the Asian Development Bank, aims to generate 4,500 megawatts of electricity to address the country's energy shortfall. Approximately $855 million in civilian aid funds were disbursed in FY2011, with half allocated to high-impact programs. The majority of appropriated Kerry-Lugar-Berman (KLB) aid funds for Pakistan in FY2011 have not been spent due to concerns about corruption and oversight. Security-related U.S. assistance, including \"train and equip\" programs, was largely suspended in mid-2011. Major U.S. arms transfers to Pakistan since 2001 have included items for counterterrorism operations and conventional warfare. Pakistan has received helicopters, infantry arms, and other equipment. U.S.-supplied defense equipment, especially for counterinsurgency operations, was slow in coming. Security assistance aims to strengthen law enforcement capabilities through police training and advanced identification systems. The U.S. has provided aid to Pakistan for law enforcement capabilities, including police training and advanced identification systems. The death of OBL in 2011 led to a reevaluation of aid levels and bilateral relationship, resulting in reductions and new restrictions in FY2013 legislation. Congressional figures have criticized Pakistan as a U.S. ally. The U.S. has issued strong criticisms of Pakistan as an ally, with growing recognition that military aid has not curbed Islamist militancy and may hinder the country's development. Analysts suggest focusing on nonmilitary aid to strengthen Pakistan's civil society. FY2013 spending bills include new provisions for Pakistan, with stricter conditions. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2013 includes provisions to limit procurement from Pakistan until the country reopens ground lines of communication to Afghanistan, restrict FY2013 CSF payments to Pakistan to $650 million, and withhold payments unless certain conditions are met.

Additionally, S. 3241, a bill for FY2013 funding, includes $50 million for the PCCF if Pakistan reopens the GLOCs to Afghanistan and funds are used efficiently. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2013 includes provisions to withhold funds for Pakistan unless they cooperate in counterterrorism efforts, prevent nuclear proliferation, and protect judicial independence and rule of law. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2013 includes provisions to limit State Department aid to Pakistan to about $800 million, with specific allocations for different purposes and withholding $33 million of appropriated funds unless certain conditions are met. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2013 limits State Department aid to Pakistan to $800 million, with specific allocations and conditions, including withholding $33 million unless Dr. Shakil Afridi is released and cleared of charges. The Secretary of State must submit a spend plan with goals, benchmarks, and progress reports for development, countering extremism, and promoting transparent governance in Pakistan. The bill provides conditions for State Department aid to Pakistan, including withholding funds unless specific criteria are met. It also allows $100 million of funds to be used for Overseas Contingency Operations if designated by Congress. Additionally, a bill to fund State Department operations for FY2013 includes provisions to withhold all funds for Pakistan unless certain conditions are met. The bill provides conditions for State Department aid to Pakistan, including withholding funds unless specific criteria are met related to counterterrorism efforts, nuclear proliferation, visa issuance, and humanitarian efforts. The bill includes conditions for State Department aid to Pakistan, such as counterterrorism efforts, nuclear proliferation, visa issuance, and humanitarian access for detainees and civilians affected by conflict. It also requires a spend plan with goals for development, countering extremism, and promoting transparent governance, with biannual progress reports to Congress. The bill includes conditions for State Department aid to Pakistan, such as counterterrorism efforts, nuclear proliferation, visa issuance, and humanitarian access for detainees and civilians affected by conflict. It also requires a spend plan with goals for development, countering extremism, and promoting transparent governance, with biannual progress reports to Congress. Additionally, the bill allows for ESF funds for cross border stabilization and development programs between Afghanistan, Pakistan, and central Asian republics, and permits the transfer of INCLE and FMF funds to PCCF until September 30, 2014 with proper notification to Congress. State must notify Congress 15 days before taking action, specifying funding source and implementation plan. Funds are subject to Sec. 7046(b) of this act."
