    "content": "The environmental impacts of human activity, including pollution, habitat destruction, and greenhouse gas emissions, have raised concerns. Buildings, such as residential, commercial, and government structures, are a significant part of the nation's infrastructure and are under increasing scrutiny for their environmental impacts. Buildings are a major component of the nation's infrastructure and have significant environmental impacts due to resource consumption and waste production. They account for about 40% of resource use, including electricity, water, and construction materials, leading to high environmental and financial costs. Buildings account for about 40% of energy consumption in the United States, producing approximately 40% of greenhouse gas emissions and costing consumers over $430 billion annually in energy bills. Location and interaction with the environment impact ecological and human health. Impermeable surfaces affect stormwater management, while proximity to public transportation influences energy usage for commuting. Green building addresses environmental and health impacts in construction, renovation, and operations of buildings. Indoor air quality, occupant health, and productivity are affected by building features. Green building can mitigate traffic delays, smog, and greenhouse gas emissions from car commuting. Green building is a tool for transforming the design, construction, operation, and demolition of buildings. It has gained significant interest since the 1990s and is now considered a respected approach with various stakeholders involved. This report discusses the concept of green building and major federal policies related to it. The report discusses green building, federal policies, programs, and associated issues. It covers the definition of green building, environmental impacts addressed, tools for compliance, implementation challenges, statutory authorities, and federal agency programs related to green building. The modern practice of green building emerged in the 1990s. The modern practice of green building began in the 1990s with the formation of organizations like the Committee on the Environment and the U.S. Green Building Council. The concept has since expanded to promote environmentally conscious design principles and strategies to reduce harmful impacts of the built environment. Some builders aim to reduce harmful impacts of the built environment through green building practices. The definition of green building varies, with some efforts barely distinguishable from standard practices and others aiming for greatly reduced environmental impacts. \"Greenwashing\" refers to using the term as a marketing tool. In contrast, some practitioners strive for zero-impact buildings with no net environmental impact. Green building aims to significantly reduce the environmental footprint of buildings compared to standard practices. It includes efforts like net-zero energy use and \"minus-impact\" buildings that provide a net environmental benefit. Green building is a relative concept that involves integration across multiple factors to improve environmental performance in any class of building. Techniques range from innovative technologies to design features influencing occupant behavior. Green building techniques, such as placing stairways prominently to encourage their use, are often decided in the design phase and can impact a building's environmental footprint throughout its lifecycle. The term green building is often used interchangeably with sustainable building, although they may not be exactly synonymous. Sustainable building, also known as green building, aims to maintain small environmental footprints to support future human activity and ecosystems. High-performance building, on the other hand, includes factors like security in addition to environmental aspects. Federal statutory definitions emphasize integrating all major high-performance building attributes, such as energy efficiency and durability. High-performance buildings optimize energy efficiency, durability, life-cycle performance, and occupant productivity. They integrate major attributes like energy conservation, safety, accessibility, cost-benefit, sustainability, and functionality. Aesthetics and historical preservation can also be considered in their design. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 defines high-performance green buildings in detail. The concept of high-performance green buildings is defined by specific elements such as energy, water, materials, waste, and health. Siting, related to transportation, ecology, and smart growth, has gained importance in recent years. Most descriptions do not explicitly include serviceability. The objectives for high-performance buildings include serviceability, productivity, functionality, disaster and climate resilience. These goals have become more prominent due to natural disasters like Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, and the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear meltdown. Green building projects may vary based on stakeholder needs. The design of green building projects can vary based on stakeholder needs, including the building's expected occupants. Local factors like climate zone and flood risk can influence the design process. A key element of green building is reducing energy footprint through techniques like energy efficiency, conservation, and use of renewable energy sources. The design of green building projects focuses on reducing energy footprint through techniques like energy efficiency, conservation, and use of alternative, renewable energy sources such as solar or geothermal power. Energy storage technologies and smart-grid innovations are also utilized to optimize energy use and reduce environmental impacts. Energy is a crucial element due to economic costs and environmental considerations. In a 2015 report on energy technologies, the Department of Energy estimated that buildings with the best energy efficiency technologies would consume half as much energy as current buildings. Federal law mandates energy use reductions in federal buildings, with a 22% decline in energy intensity from 2003 to 2015. However, 2015 consumption exceeded the federal goal. Energy is crucial in green building projects, but focusing solely on energy may not make a building truly green. Reducing water usage in buildings can provide cost savings and aid in the management of water resources, especially in arid areas. Measures such as reduced-flow plumbing fixtures, wastewater recycling, and water-efficient landscaping can help achieve these reductions. Water management also includes handling rain, on-site water, and run-off to ensure sustainable practices. Low-impact development focuses on managing stormwater using natural and engineered techniques like landscaping, porous materials, green roofs, holding ponds, and rain gardens. These methods, collectively known as green infrastructure, aim to mimic pre-development water handling. The materials used in construction and operations of buildings play a significant role in water management. The choice and use of materials in building construction and operations can significantly impact the environmental footprint. Environmentally preferable or green-labelled products, with recycled content or made from renewable resources, can reduce resource depletion, pollution, and energy consumption. These materials are designed to minimize health risks from pollutants like VOCs. The environmental impacts of building materials can be reduced by using environmentally preferable or green-labelled products. However, determining the sustainability attributes of materials can be challenging due to inconsistencies in measurement methodologies. Waste from construction processes can be mitigated through waste-reduction efforts such as source reduction, reuse, recycling, and waste-to-energy. Efficient use of materials and recycling can reduce environmental impacts from demolition and construction. Landscaping can help eliminate chemical pollutants and recycle waste. High-efficiency boilers and furnaces can reduce atmospheric pollutants. Recycling operational waste like paper and food can also lessen environmental impact. Indoor air pollutants like mold and radon can affect building health. The presence of indoor air pollutants like mold, radon, carbon monoxide, asbestos, and VOCs can have significant health effects on building occupants. Maintaining high indoor air quality (IAQ) involves adequate ventilation, air filtration, and using materials free of toxic substances. Overall indoor environmental quality (IEQ) includes factors like lighting, climate control, acoustics, and ergonomic design, all of which can impact occupant health. The location of a building can impact its environmental footprint by facilitating the use of public transportation and reducing reliance on private vehicles. Site selection considers ecological sensitivity to minimize adverse impacts on native species. Building orientation and proximity to vegetation affect heating and cooling needs. Climate-related risks, such as sea-level rise and flooding, are also considered in siting decisions. Green building incorporates risk factors like sea-level rise, flooding, and extreme weather events affected by climate change. Productivity and utility are essential elements not always discussed, with evidence suggesting green buildings can improve worker comfort and productivity. Green buildings can improve productivity among occupants, but trade-offs can occur, such as poor acoustic performance. Serviceability is gaining attention in green-building design, with a focus on resistance to hazards like earthquakes and hurricanes to increase a building's useful life. Approaches to resilience in building design include resistant construction, locating critical components away from flood waters, on-site power generation, rainwater harvesting, and water recycling. Climate-resilient design focuses on preparing for severe weather events and climate change to ensure assets can withstand disruptions. Green building emphasizes integration across elements and stages to improve performance and minimize environmental impacts throughout the building's lifecycle. This approach allows for better assessment of environmental impact, balance among competing goals, and examination of how different elements interact. Integration and performance in building operations can be enhanced by using information technology. Focusing on one element, like energy efficiency, without considering others can be counterproductive. For example, sealing the building envelope for energy efficiency can lead to poor air quality and moisture issues. A green building approach considers energy efficiency and health, often requiring compromises or advanced technologies like active ventilation with heat exchange. Prioritizing elements based on cost, feasibility, and occupant priorities is crucial, especially in renovations where addressing all factors may not be feasible. A focus on different stages in the life cycle of a building is essential to consider environmental impacts. Choices made during construction, such as using concrete walls for insulation, may have long-term consequences like higher carbon dioxide emissions. Balancing construction choices with energy-efficient building operation is crucial for sustainable outcomes. A green building approach can reduce problems by assessing the impact of actions on different stages. Elements like environmentally preferable products can affect occupant health and productivity. On-site renewable energy generation prepares buildings for power outages, while stormwater management provides ecological services. In the building sector, systems and tools have been developed to assess green and sustainable buildings, falling into categories like rating systems, certifications, standards, and codes. Determining a building's sustainability is complex, with no simple metric available. Professional organizations in the 1990s developed rating and certification systems to address this issue. Rating and certification systems in the building sector, such as LEED, standardize green building practices and raise public awareness. These systems assign points based on criteria in various design categories, resulting in an overall score and tier ranking. Certification validates a building's compliance with design or performance requirements. Independent third parties conduct assessments and award certifications. LEED, developed by the USGBC, is the most prevalent green building certification system in the US. LEED, developed by the USGBC in 1998, is a widely recognized green building certification system. Over 37,300 commercial buildings worldwide have been certified by LEED as of April 2017. USGBC offers certifications for various building categories including new construction, existing buildings, interiors, homes, schools, retail, healthcare, neighborhoods, and more. LEED certification is available for various building categories, including new construction, existing buildings, interiors, homes, schools, retail, healthcare, and neighborhoods. It focuses on six green building elements and has credit categories for innovation and regional priority. Buildings must meet mandatory requirements to be LEED-certified. The LEED rating system requires buildings to meet mandatory requirements and earn a designated number of points for certification levels: Certified, Silver, Gold, or Platinum. LEED v4, released in 2013, is the most recent version. Other certification systems in the US include The Building. The BREEAM In-Use certification system, introduced in the United States in 2017, allows existing commercial buildings to benchmark performance and certify improvements without prerequisites. Ratings range from Acceptable to Outstanding, indicated by one to six stars. Green Globes certification levels range from one to four Globes based on points earned out of 1000. Points are distributed across six elements: site, energy, water, materials, emissions, and indoor. Certifications must be renewed annually and were developed in Canada by the Green Building Initiative, based on BREEAM. Green Globes certification levels range from one to four Globes based on points earned out of 1000, distributed across six elements: site, energy, water, materials, emissions, and indoor. The International Living Future Institute's Living Building Challenge offers three certifications: Living Building Certification, Petal Certification, and Zero Energy Building Certification, with criteria falling into seven performance areas. Living Building Certification requires meeting requirements in all seven performance areas, while Petal Certification requires compliance with at least three of the seven Petals, including water, energy, or materials. Zero Energy Certification mandates generating all energy needs on-site without combustion. Certification under the Living Building Challenge also involves a 12-month assessment of actual building performance. Different ratings systems emphasize various aspects of green building. Different green building ratings systems focus on different aspects and types of buildings. Some systems are more suitable based on local conditions and priorities. In addition to comprehensive green certification systems, there are also programs like Energy Star, Indoor airPLUS, WaterSense, and Zero Energy Ready that certify specific environmental performance areas. Several federal statutes and policies require green building certifications for federal offices and agencies. The General Services Administration recommends using third-party green certification systems, such as Indoor airPLUS, WaterSense, Zero Energy Ready Home, and Passive House/ PHIUS+. Several federal agencies have found benefits in using third-party green certification systems, including simplifying compliance with federal guidelines, reducing the need for additional staff, and providing a recognizable label to communicate sustainability efforts. Some agencies have established internal policies on certification under available rating systems. EISA required the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with GSA and DOD, to identify a third-party certification system that encourages a comprehensive and environmentally-sound approach. The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with GSA and DOD, recommended using either LEED or Green Globes for federal agencies, with a requirement to achieve a LEED Silver rating or Two Globes for new construction and major renovation projects. The recommendation is to be reviewed and updated every five years based on a study conducted by the Director of GSA's Office of Federal High-Performance Green Buildings. The 2014 Department of Energy rulemaking on green building certification sets minimum criteria for rating systems eligible for federal agency use. Many states and local jurisdictions require green building certification for government and commercial buildings, with some offering incentives for certification. Green building rating and certification systems have influenced model building codes and standards. Building codes are mandatory, while standards may be incorporated into laws. This section focuses on comprehensive green building codes and standards, excluding those solely for energy efficiency. Building codes set minimum requirements for design and construction. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 established a baseline for energy efficiency in building codes, with state and local governments determining additional requirements. Many jurisdictions adopt national model codes for building regulations. Green building codes specify extra requirements beyond minimum standards. Green building codes go beyond minimum building code requirements and can be mandatory or voluntary. They often incorporate technical standards created by recognized standards development organizations. Green building standards are created by recognized standards development organizations and define guidelines for judging products. Buildings meeting a standard can be certified, similar to a rating system. Specific requirements can be achieved through prescriptive or performance pathways, offering flexibility to designers. Outcome-based requirements set a performance target that must be met and verified through measurement and reporting after construction ends. Green building standards are sometimes described as code-intended, written in mandatory, code-enforceable language, and may be adopted with or without modifications by jurisdictions. The development of national green building model codes and standards in the United States involves a consensus process with multiple stakeholders and accreditation by bodies like ANSI. The ICC and ASHRAE are the main developers, with the ICC responsible for the widely used International Building Code (IBC). The ICC released the International Green Construction Code (IgCC) in 2012, the first model code to include sustainability measures for construction projects. It functions as an overlay code compatible with ICC codes and was revised in 2015. Municipalities can adopt the IgCC to make requirements more or less strict. The IgCC, released by the ICC in 2012, is a model code that can be adopted by municipalities to adjust requirements based on local factors. It covers most building types except low-rise residential buildings, which are referred to the ICC 700 National Green Building Standard (NGBS). The NGBS, developed in partnership with ASHRAE and NAHB, is structured as a rating system and can be adopted by ordinance. ASHRAE, USGBC, and IES have also released a high-performance green building standard for nonresidential and residential buildings. Standard 189.1, a high-performance green building standard for nonresidential and residential buildings over three stories, includes requirements in site sustainability, energy efficiency, water-use efficiency, indoor environmental quality, and building impacts. It has been integrated into Department of Defense properties and will serve as the technical content of the 2018 IgCC. The partnership aims to integrate Standard 189.1 into the 2018 IgCC, aligning it with the LEED rating system. Various federal laws and policies also address green building practices. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT 1992) incentivized energy and water efficiency in federal, commercial, and residential buildings. It included provisions for state building energy codes, energy efficiency in federal buildings, and the development of energy-efficient technologies. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT 2005) mandated energy and water conservation programs for congressional buildings, reduced federal building energy consumption by 20% by 2015, promoted energy-efficient product procurement, and set energy consumption targets for new federal buildings. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 mandated energy and water conservation programs for federal buildings, set energy consumption targets for new buildings, and established the Energy Star labeling program. It also authorized funding for state energy conservation plans and rebate programs for energy-efficient appliances. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 established the Energy Star labeling program, set energy and water conservation standards for products, mandated energy-efficiency standards for public housing, and provided tax incentives for energy and water efficiency. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-140), known as EISA, provided a legislative framework for federal green building efforts, including efficiency standards for appliances and lighting, energy-efficient requirements for GSA facilities, and renewable energy directives. Title IV of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 includes provisions for residential and commercial buildings, requiring adherence to energy efficiency and renewable energy standards. It increased funding for DOE's low-income weatherization program and mandated a feasibility study on state rebate programs. The act also established energy-efficiency standards for manufactured housing and created an Office of Commercial High-Performance Green Buildings. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 established an Office of Commercial High-Performance Green Buildings to promote green commercial buildings, set energy reduction targets for federal buildings, and mandated green building certification for new construction and renovations. It also included water conservation guidelines and stormwater runoff requirements.

President Obama signed Executive Order 13693 in 2015, revoking previous orders on federal sustainability. Executive Order 13693, signed by President Obama in 2015, replaced previous orders on federal sustainability and set new targets for federal agencies to achieve by FY2025. Targets include reducing building energy intensity by 2.5% annually, decreasing potable water consumption intensity by 36%, generating at least 25% of building energy from clean sources, and ensuring new buildings over 5,000 gross meet specific criteria. The Executive Order 13693, signed by President Obama in 2015, set new targets for federal agencies to achieve by FY2025. It includes reducing building energy intensity, decreasing water consumption, generating energy from clean sources, and ensuring new buildings meet specific criteria for net-zero energy, water, and waste by FY2030. The order also called for climate-resilient design elements in federal buildings and compliance with sustainable building principles. The GSA analysis showed an 18% increase in federal sustainable buildings between FY2014 and FY2015 due to agency efforts to comply with E.O. 13693. In 2006, 19 federal agencies signed an MOU titled \"Federal Leadership in High Performance and Sustainable Buildings\" with five core Guiding Principles. The Guiding Principles for federal sustainable buildings were first issued in 2006, with subsequent revisions in 2008 and 2016 to address green building design progress and broader issue areas. The principles aim to optimize energy performance, conserve water, enhance indoor environmental quality, reduce environmental impact of materials, and assess climate change risks. The federal government owns or leases about 273,000 buildings in the United States, totaling nearly 3 billion square feet and costing nearly $6.1 billion. The federal government owns or leases about 273,000 buildings in the United States, totaling nearly 3 billion square feet and costing nearly $6.1 billion in energy bills. EISA and other policy instruments require all federal agencies to implement green building practices. GSA and DOD control three-quarters of all federal building floorspace. This report does not discuss green building within individual agencies, but some agencies have programs with a broader focus than just reducing environmental impacts. The General Services Administration (GSA) manages 425 million square feet of space in over 8,500 buildings for federal workers. By 2020, all new GSA-owned buildings will be designed to achieve net-zero energy, water, or waste. The GSA's Green Proving Ground program evaluates next-generation building technologies to meet agency standards for deployment. Various offices, including the Energy Program and Office of Federal High-Performance Green Buildings, contribute to GSA's green building efforts. The GSA's Office of Federal High-Performance Green Buildings oversees activities related to green buildings across federal agencies. It provides actionable information, conducts assessments, and maintains the Sustainable Facilities Tool website. The Facility Management Institute is another GSA initiative to improve the operations of federal buildings. The GSA collaborates with other agencies to improve federal building operations through green-building programs. EISA directs the Office of Federal High-Performance Green Buildings to provide recommendations on rating systems every five years. GSA and DOE cochair commercial high-performance green building activities. GSA collaborates with DOE on commercial high-performance green building activities and participates in climate adaptation planning for buildings.

The Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes Program addresses home health hazards. Green building's impact has been questioned since the 1990s. The rise of green building since the 1990s has raised questions about its impacts on market penetration, cost, building performance, measurement science, legislative goals, and implementation. The building industry is a significant part of the U.S. economy, with the total value of construction and renovation work exceeding $1 trillion in 2016, accounting for over 6% of the GDP. The percentage of the construction market dedicated to green building has grown substantially. The percentage of the construction market dedicated to green building has grown substantially in recent years. In 2005, only 2% of new construction in the US was green building, but by 2013, it had increased to 20%. Green construction spending in the US has been growing faster than general construction spending, tripling from $39 billion in 2008 to $129 billion in 2014. Green building activities have significantly increased, with spending tripling from $39 billion in 2008 to $129 billion in 2014. It is projected to generate $303.4 billion in GDP between 2015 and 2018. New institutional construction, driven by certification requirements, is expected to fuel future growth. The percentage of certified-green floorspace is rising, with a reported increase in certified office space from 5% in 2005 to 38% in 2016. Green building efforts have increased significantly, with the percentage of certified office space rising from 5% in 2005 to 38% in 2016 for the 30 largest U.S. office markets. However, there is still a significant portion of U.S. building stock that does not meet green building criteria, making rapid retrofitting or replacement challenging. Green building measures can impact a building's financial performance by influencing construction costs, operating expenses, rental rates, and property values. The costs of implementing green building measures play a crucial role in design and construction decisions, but obtaining accurate cost information can be challenging. Researchers have noted that obtaining information on true costs for green building can be challenging, leading to distorted perceptions about its economic benefits. Empirical evidence on the financial performance of green building investments is limited, with initial costs believed to be higher than conventional buildings. Higher perceived initial costs are among the top obstacles for green building in the United States. Higher costs are a major obstacle for green building in the United States, stemming from various sources such as expensive features and design costs. However, evidence suggests that construction costs for green buildings are comparable to conventional ones. Construction costs for green buildings are comparable to conventional buildings. Integrated design may reduce initial costs. Green buildings can save on operational costs by reducing utility usage and selling renewable energy back to the grid. GSA saved over $340 million in energy and water costs from efficiency improvements between FY2008 and FY2015. Green certification is associated with reduced utility expenses, but only makes up 19% of a commercial building's operating costs. Evidence is mixed on whether green certification reduces overall operating expenses. Green-labeled buildings command price premiums in the real estate market. Some real estate market features can reduce incentives for investments in green building. Investments in green building can be hindered by factors like short-term ownership, rental situations, and the split-incentive problem between owners and tenants. Constraints on capital availability may limit potential beneficiaries of green building renovations, including educational institutions, hospitals, and municipalities. Cost barriers are decreasing as green building practices become more widespread, with financial incentives from states and municipalities helping to offset initial costs. Green building investments may be more financially attractive with help to defray higher initial costs. The \"triple bottom line\" concept includes social and environmental returns in addition to financial ones. Evaluating green building efforts requires distinguishing between design and performance, with a focus on design and construction specifications like LEED. The environmental performance of green buildings is not always reflected in certification requirements. Factors like maintenance, alterations, and changes in building use can impact a green building's performance. Therefore, a certified green building may not necessarily outperform a conventional one. Studies have shown that certified green buildings may not always perform better than conventional buildings, as some green buildings can be resource-intensive postoccupancy. Green building efforts have helped reduce energy-use intensity in newer homes, but larger size and more electronic appliances offset some of the energy savings. The energy performance of green buildings has been scrutinized due to a significant difference between predicted and actual energy use, known as the \"performance gap.\" Closing this gap is a concern for the construction industry, leading to increased emphasis on postoccupancy performance assessment in rating systems like LEED. The LEED rating system addresses critiques by requiring building-level energy and water meters for data reporting. Other systems like BREEAM In-Use and Living Building Certification include performance parameters in certification criteria. Building codes are also moving towards incorporating performance outcomes, such as the 2015 IgCC's outcome-based compliance pathway for energy usage. The process of commissioning building systems improves environmental performance, especially for energy use. It can be applied to new or existing buildings during retrofitting or ongoing operations. Organizations can also develop an environmental management system (EMS) to meet international standards for certification. An organization can improve environmental performance by developing an environmental management system (EMS) to meet international standards for certification. This includes having an explicit environmental policy with commitments to conform to relevant requirements, continuously improve performance, and prevent pollution. Performance measurement in the EMS can help meet these commitments more easily. Additionally, networked building monitoring tools are increasingly used for early fault detection in critical equipment and resource use analytics for effective response to changing use patterns in real time. Recent studies have shown a lack of consensus on defining green building criteria and outcomes, making it difficult to compare results. Green buildings exhibit a wide range of measured energy performance, with mixed evidence on their significant performance compared to conventional buildings. Recent studies have shown that green buildings exhibit a wide range of energy performance, with some performing below design expectations. A study of over 100 LEED-certified buildings found that, on average, they performed 24% better than other buildings, but about one in seven performed worse than average. The study on LEED certification was criticized for sample bias and inappropriate baselines. A follow-up assessment found that energy savings were nonexistent for lower certification levels but 13% better for Gold and Platinum buildings. A GSA study of 22 green federal buildings, most LEED-certified, showed better performance in energy use, water use, costs, satisfaction, and emissions compared to the national average, although some buildings performed below average in certain areas. Some LEED-certified buildings did not meet federal energy-saving requirements, consuming more electricity than the national average. Arizona's LEED-certified buildings also underperformed in energy use compared to simulations, indicating a disconnect between strategies and results. The studies on LEED certification and building energy consumption do not consistently show performance improvements. Small sample sizes and limited access to performance data hinder comprehensive assessments. Access to more building performance data is crucial for better performance evaluations. Performance measurement is crucial for ensuring green buildings meet environmental targets and improve them. However, methods for measuring green building performance are not well-developed for most elements, with some being easier to quantify than others. Disagreements may arise even for elements like energy usage, which can be measured quantitatively. The Green Building Advisory Committee has proposed new methodologies for measuring energy use intensity (EUI) in federal buildings, including energy use per occupant and area-based EUI measuring energy used in commuter transportation. Different metrics can show varying energy use patterns in buildings. The study by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory warns that inaccurate building occupancy data could complicate calculating occupancy-adjusted EUI. Commonly accepted metrics like Energy Star scores may not be strongly correlated with intended outcomes. Regular measurement and adjustment of building performance are crucial for maintaining environmental performance over its lifespan. The study emphasizes the importance of regular measurement and adjustment of building performance to maintain environmental performance. EISA requires federal agencies to measure building performance against specified targets, with more stringent targets for new construction. Energy performance is compared against a 2005 consumption baseline, but determining an accurate baseline can be challenging due to inadequate energy use measurement. Despite available options and resources for measurement, uncertainties and gaps still exist. Uncertainties and gaps exist in measuring building performance for green building applications. Consensus on measurement goals is lacking, and obtaining reliable data is challenging. The development of appropriate measurement science is a top research need, with a focus on creating metrics and tools for sustainability. Progress towards federally mandated green building goals varies among agencies. Agency progress towards meeting federally mandated green building goals varies widely. In the Obama Administration, OMB released annual sustainability and energy scorecards for each agency with reporting requirements. Scorecards tracked agency progress in areas such as GHG emission reductions, energy intensity, renewable energy use, water intensity, fleet petroleum use, and green buildings through numeric reports and color-coded scores. The Obama Administration tracked agency progress in green building goals through annual sustainability and energy scorecards. The scorecards used color-coded scores to indicate progress in areas like GHG emissions, energy intensity, renewable energy use, water intensity, and fleet petroleum use. The color scores of green, yellow, or red represented different levels of progress towards meeting the targets. Some agencies are working towards ensuring 15% of their buildings comply with green building principles by FY2025. However, a few agencies have achieved compliance in less than 2% of their buildings. The government fell short of the goal to reduce energy intensity by 30% by 2015, with only a 22% decline. E.O. 13693 directs agencies to reduce energy intensity by 2.5% per year relative to 2015. E.O. 13693 directs agencies to reduce energy intensity by 2.5% per year relative to 2015, with progress reported starting from FY2016. The goal for potable water intensity reduction was changed to a 36% reduction from 2007 levels by 2025. Many agencies have already achieved the earlier goal and are making progress towards the new target. Some concerns have been raised about the approach to green building. Some critics have raised concerns about rating and certification systems for green buildings, pointing out inconsistencies in the certification process and the lack of caps on performance metrics like energy use. They argue that design criteria are not integrative enough and focus too much on incremental improvements. Additionally, some believe that simply mitigating environmental impacts is not enough for true sustainability. Some argue that new approaches, such as enhancing ecosystem services, are more sustainable than just mitigating environmental impacts. There is concern that inexperienced builders may not fully grasp the importance of an integrative approach to green building design, viewing green measures as add-ons rather than integral parts of a project. Limited scientific and technological knowledge base for green building since its recent inception makes it challenging to identify appropriate approaches. Substantial research is needed to improve the knowledge base, especially considering differences in goals and perspectives among proponents. Objective criteria for elements like siting, which are not easily quantifiable, can be difficult to establish. Congress may face questions regarding the effectiveness of current federal green building programs, coordination methods among agencies, extension of federal efforts to promote green building nationwide, prioritization of different elements of green building, and actions to support the growth of green building measures. Congress may need to consider actions to facilitate the growth of scientific and technical knowledge in green building, including through appropriations, new statutory requirements, and tax law. GAO reports have highlighted various federal efforts related to green building, but few initiatives focus on green building in an integrative sense. The GAO recommended that agencies coordinate to assess the performance of green building initiatives. Congress should examine how well federal agencies are implementing green building programs and their impact on adoption of green building practices nationwide. Coordination of agency efforts should also be evaluated. Some federal agencies support mortgages promoting energy efficiency, with lenders becoming Energy Star partners. Congress could consider stronger incentives and funding for green building adoption. Congress could consider specific appropriations and regulatory actions to speed up the adoption of green building, especially in areas like residential renovation. Efforts may be complicated by federalism issues and regional requirements. Congress could also enhance current green building efforts in federal agencies and ensure better integration and harmonization of activities across agencies like EPA and DOE. Among the elements of green building, energy has received the most attention due to concerns about fossil fuel imports, climate change, and inefficient energy use in buildings. Congress may need to ensure a balanced approach to green building efforts across federal agencies like EPA and DOE. The development of scientific and technological knowledge for green building is supported by R&D funded by federal and private-sector sources, but funding levels may be insufficient. Congress may need to consider strengthening existing programs or establishing new ones to ensure a balanced approach across federal agencies. According to studies, green building receives minimal federal funding for R&D, with the construction sector investing at a lower rate than the industry average. Funding for different elements of green building varies, with energy being a higher priority. Congress may need to consider increasing federal funding levels for green building research and development. Congress may need to consider modifying federal funding levels and priorities to support successful green building efforts. Creating incentives for increasing private-sector R&D funding and ensuring sufficient training and education for a knowledgeable workforce in relevant areas of expertise are also important considerations."
