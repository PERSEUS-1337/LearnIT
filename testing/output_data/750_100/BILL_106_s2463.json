    "content": "The Act titled \"National Death Penalty Moratorium Act of 2000\" establishes a moratorium on the death penalty. Congress finds that death sentences are disproportionately imposed on the poor and certain racial and ethnic groups, with most individuals facing capital charges unable to afford their own attorney and no state meeting ABA standards for indigent prisoners' legal representation. Since 1976, African-Americans have accounted for a disproportionate percentage of those executed and on death row in the American and Federal systems. In death penalty cases, the majority of victims are white, despite only half of murder victims being white. The Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights in 1994 found that 89% of defendants chosen for capital prosecution under the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 were African-American or Hispanic American. In 1990, the General Accounting Office reported racial disparities in charging, sentencing, and the death penalty. Prisoner appeals have been limited, increasing the risk of imprisoning and executing innocent individuals. The Supreme Court has restricted death row prisoners' rights to appeal convictions and sentences in Federal courts, even with compelling evidence of innocence. Legislation in 1996 limited Federal court review of death penalty appeals and reduced public funding for legal aid services for death row prisoners. The Federal Government and States are prohibited from carrying out the death penalty until Congress reviews the final findings of the National Commission on the Death Penalty and enacts legislation based on the Commission's recommendations. The National Commission on the Death Penalty is established with 15 members appointed by the President in consultation with relevant officials. Members include Federal or State prosecutors and experienced attorneys.

The National Commission on the Death Penalty consists of 15 members appointed by the President from various backgrounds. The appointments of the initial members should be made within 30 days of the Act's enactment.
