    "content": "Restoration of deduction for interest on educational loans. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 includes defining personal interest to now include interest on qualified educational loans. This expands the definition of qualified educational loan for tax deduction purposes. The term 'qualified educational loan' includes indebtedness provided by Federal, State, or State-based guarantee programs, organizations exempt from tax under section 501(c)(3), or financial institutions under a supplemental education program. The term 'qualified educational loan' includes indebtedness under a supplemental education program for qualified educational expenses incurred within a reasonable period before or after the loan is taken. The amount of interest for the taxable year is reduced based on the taxpayer's adjusted gross income over the applicable dollar amount for phaseout range. The applicable dollar amounts and phaseout ranges for different filing statuses are specified as follows: $40,000 with a $15,000 phaseout range for unmarried individuals, $60,000 with a $30,000 phaseout range for joint returns, and zero for any other case. The deduction for interest on student loans is only allowable for the first 48 months of repayment. Qualified educational expenses include tuition and related expenses. The taxpayer, spouse, or dependent can deduct qualified tuition and related expenses for attending an educational institution, including reasonable living expenses while away from home. The tax deduction for qualified tuition and related expenses can include living expenses while away from home, with adjustments for inflation after 1994. The tax deduction for qualified tuition and related expenses can include living expenses while away from home, with adjustments for inflation after 1994. The adjustment under section 1(f)(3) for the calendar year in which the taxable year begins is determined by substituting 'calendar year 1993' for 'calendar year 1989' in subparagraph (B) thereof, with rounding to the nearest multiple of $50 if necessary. The tax deduction for qualified tuition and related expenses can include living expenses while away from home, with adjustments for inflation after 1994. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1993, but only with respect to loans with the first required payment after that date."
