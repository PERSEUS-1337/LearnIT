    "title": "AB 1303",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 65961 of the Government Code is amended. Upon approval of a tentative map for a residential subdivision, a city or county cannot impose additional conditions for building permits within five years of the final map recordation, except as specified. The city or county cannot impose additional conditions for building permits within five years of the final map recordation. They also cannot withhold building permits for failure to meet previously approved conditions. The local agency can impose conditions on building permits if necessary for health and safety reasons or to comply with state or federal law. They can also withhold permits for compliance with state or federal law. The local agency can impose conditions on building permits for health and safety reasons or to comply with state or federal law. This section also applies to newly incorporated cities, including areas from a previous map, where conditions could have been imposed by the county if not for the incorporation. For a tentative subdivision map or parcel map extended under specific sections, the five-year period is reduced to three years. Section 66452.25 allows cities, counties, or city and counties to levy fees or conditions for tentative subdivision maps or parcel maps extended under specific sections. Section 66452.25 of the Government Code allows for a 24-month extension of tentative maps, vesting tentative maps, or parcel maps approved within certain counties. If a map was approved within a specific county, the expiration time can be extended by 24 months upon application of the subdivider, as long as it meets zoning and general plan requirements. The legislative body or advisory agency may deny or conditionally approve an extension for a period of 24 months if the map is not consistent with zoning and general plan requirements. An approved tentative map can be automatically extended for 60 days or until the extension application is approved, conditionally approved, or denied. If the advisory agency denies the extension, the subdivider can appeal. If the advisory agency denies a subdivider's extension application, the subdivider can appeal to the legislative body within 15 days. In a county, this section applies if the annual mean household income is less than 80% of the statewide annual mean income based on the American Community Survey. The community revitalization plan requires the annual nonseasonal unemployment rate to be at least 2.75 percent higher than the statewide rate and the poverty rate to be at least 4 percent higher than the statewide median. The extension of expiration dates for development projects is provided in addition to any existing extensions. Legislative, administrative, or other approvals by state agencies related to a development project will be extended by 24 months if not expired before the effective date of the act. The provisions of Section 65961 regarding conditions for building permits for residential subdivisions are modified for tentative maps extended under this section. No reimbursement is required for this act as local agencies can levy charges to cover mandated services. This act is an urgency statute to preserve development applications set to expire due to economic conditions in the construction industry."
