    "content": "The \"Adoption Equality Act of 2005\" may be cited as the official title of this Act. The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 prioritizes a child's health and safety, aiming to provide each child with a permanent home. This Act also offers incentives for adoptions, resulting in the placement of nearly 53,000 children from State care in fiscal year 2002. Additionally, the Adoption Promotion Act of 2003 reauthorized the incentive program, with a focus on moving older children into permanency. In 2003, over 118,000 children in foster care await adoption despite an increase in adoptions. These children have special needs and require financial support for healing from past abuse and neglect. SEC. 3. PROMOTION OF ADOPTION OF CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS. The amendment to Section 473(a) of the Social Security Act pertains to the requirements for a child to qualify under certain circumstances related to termination of parental rights and placement in care of a public or licensed private agency. The amendment to Section 473(a) of the Social Security Act outlines criteria for a child to qualify for placement in care of a public or licensed private agency, including safety concerns, medical eligibility for supplemental security income benefits, and placement with a minor parent in foster care or child care institution. The State determines if a child should be removed from their home for safety reasons and if they have special needs, which affects the amount of payments to adopting parents. Non-citizen or non-resident children are exceptions to certain laws. A child who meets certain requirements shall be treated as meeting adoption assistance eligibility criteria, even if not a citizen or resident of the United States. Additionally, a child previously eligible for adoption assistance whose prior adoption was dissolved may still be available for adoption. The eligibility criteria for adoption assistance include a provision where a child whose prior adoption has been dissolved or adoptive parents have died will still be considered eligible. Additionally, no payment can be made to parents for a child with special needs who is not a citizen or resident of the United States. The eligibility criteria for adoption assistance state that payments cannot be made for a child with special needs who is not a citizen or resident of the United States. Additionally, if a child described in the criteria is placed in foster care after a failed adoption, payments can still be made. The Adoption Equality Act of 2005 requires states to use any savings from reduced expenditures to provide services to children or families under this part or part B. Additionally, the definition of a child with special needs under the Social Security Act is clarified. The Adoption Equality Act of 2005 clarifies the definition of a child with special needs under the Social Security Act, stating that a child must meet specific criteria determined by the State to be unable to return home or meet medical/disability requirements for supplemental security income benefits. The Adoption Equality Act of 2005 defines a child with special needs as one who cannot be placed with adoptive parents without adoption and medical assistance, considering factors like medical conditions or emotional ties. The Adoption Equality Act of 2005 states that if a foster child has emotional ties with prospective adoptive parents, efforts must be made to place the child with appropriate adoptive parents without adoption or medical assistance. The amendments made by this section will be effective on October 1, 2005."
