REDUCTION OF FICA RATES RESULTING FROM PERSONAL SOCIAL SECURITY SAVINGS PROGRAM. Employee Contribution: Section 3101 of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to reduce the tax rate on employees for Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance in years following a reduction year where the OASDI rate ratio exceeds 125 percent. The reduction percentage is the difference between the rate in effect for the reduction year and the rounded-up rate for the same year. The OASDI rate ratio for the reduction year is calculated based on specific rates under different sections, with the numerator being the combined OASDI tax rates. The OASDI rate ratio for the reduction year is calculated using the combined balance in the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund as the numerator, and the amount paid from these Trust Funds for authorized purposes under the Social Security Act as the denominator. The reduction in Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance tax rate is limited to ensure it does not fall below 4.95 percent. Additionally, employers will make contributions based on this reduced rate in subsequent years. The tax rate imposed under subsection (a) is reduced by the reduction percentage in years following a reduction year. This reduction is limited to prevent the tax rate from falling below 4.95 percent. The tax rate under subsection (a) is reduced in years following a reduction year, with a limit to prevent it from dropping below 4.95 percent. Additionally, a new subsection is added to amend the tax on self-employment income. The tax rate under subsection (a) is reduced in years following a reduction year, with a limit to prevent it from dropping below 4.95 percent. A new subsection is added to amend the tax on self-employment income, with a limitation on reduction to maintain a tax rate of at least 9.9 percent."
