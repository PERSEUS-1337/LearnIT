    "content": "Congress's contempt power is used to respond to acts that obstruct the legislative process, such as a witness refusing to comply with a congressional subpoena. This power can be used to coerce compliance, punish the contemnor, or remove the obstruction. Congress has methods to combat noncompliance with subpoenas. The inherent contempt power allows Congress to detain and imprison a contemnor until compliance is met. The criminal contempt statute permits Congress to certify a contempt citation for prosecution. The criminal prosecution of a contemnor for noncompliance with a congressional subpoena does not necessarily lead to subsequent acquiescence. Congress may rely on the judicial branch to enforce a subpoena by seeking a civil judgment declaring compliance obligation, with continued noncompliance potentially resulting in contempt of court. The report examines Congress's contempt power and enforcement of subpoenas, including inherent contempt, criminal contempt, and civil enforcement. It discusses the challenges Congress faces in enforcing contempt actions against executive branch officials. For a more detailed version, refer to CRS Report RL34097. The power of Congress to punish for contempt is closely tied to its authority to investigate. Congress has broad authority to obtain information, including confidential details, essential for its legislative function. This power is not explicitly stated in the Constitution or specific statutes but has been firmly established by the Supreme Court. For more details, refer to CRS Report RL34097. The Supreme Court has firmly established that Congress has broad legislative authority to seek and enforce informational demands, which is essential for its legislative function. This power was unequivocally established in two Supreme Court rulings arising from the 1920s Teapot Dome scandal. In McGrain v. Daugherty, the Court described the power of inquiry as \"an essential and appropriate auxiliary to the legislative function.\" The power of inquiry with enforcing process is essential for Congress to legislate wisely, as it often lacks the necessary information. This power was established by the Supreme Court in rulings from the 1920s, emphasizing the need for accurate and complete information through means of compulsion. The power of inquiry with enforcing process is essential for Congress to legislate effectively, as it ensures access to necessary information. In Sinclair v. United States, a witness refused to provide answers during congressional hearings and was prosecuted for contempt of Congress. The witness cited an ongoing lawsuit between the government and Mammoth Oil Company as the reason for withholding evidence. The Supreme Court upheld a witness's conviction for contempt of Congress after the witness refused to answer questions, citing ongoing lawsuits as a reason. The Court rejected the argument that lawsuits prevented disclosure, stating that Congress had the authority to investigate regardless. The Supreme Court affirmed Congress's authority to compel disclosures for its own investigative purposes, even if the information may also be relevant to pending lawsuits. This broad investigative power of Congress has been consistently upheld in subsequent Supreme Court rulings. The Supreme Court affirmed Congress's broad investigative power, stating that it includes inquiries into existing laws and potential statutes, not limited to cases of wrongdoing. Congress's investigative power is strongest when addressing waste, fraud, abuse, or maladministration within a government department. The Supreme Court affirmed Congress's broad investigative power to probe corruption, inefficiency, or waste within the government. Congress has the authority to inquire into and publicize corruption, maladministration, or inefficiencies in government agencies. The inherent contempt power allows Congress to investigate and address corruption, maladministration, or inefficiencies in government agencies by bringing individuals before the House or Senate for trial and potential imprisonment. The House can impose punitive or coercive sanctions on witnesses, including imprisonment until compliance, following procedures similar to the case of Anderson v. Dunn in 1818 where a non-Member was arrested for bribery. The House adopted a resolution for the arrest of Anderson, who was brought before the House to answer charges. Anderson was granted counsel, defense witnesses, and a copy of the accusatory letter. After a guilty finding of contempt, the Speaker reprimanded him and discharged him from custody. The process of handling contempt charges involves attachment by the Sergeant-at-Arms, appearance before the bar, specification of charges, identification of the accuser, compulsory process, counsel, a hearing, determination of guilt, and imposition of penalty. Prompt judicial review through a writ of habeas corpus may be available to review whether the House or Senate acted within its jurisdiction and if due process standards were met. The process of handling contempt charges involves attachment by the Sergeant-at-Arms, appearance before the bar, specification of charges, identification of the accuser, compulsory process, counsel, a hearing, determination of guilt, and imposition of penalty. Congress must grant notice and an opportunity to be heard in contempt proceedings, and due process standards must be met. Inherent contempt proceedings may require some of the same requirements as statutory criminal contempt procedures. Monetary fines could be considered as an alternative to incarceration for contempt. The imposition of monetary fines as an alternative to incarceration for contempt charges could be supported by the inherent authority of courts. Congress may have the ability to impose fines instead of jail time, as seen in dicta from a 1821 Supreme Court decision. This approach could avoid habeas corpus issues and still hold contemnors accountable. The power of imprisonment is the least possible power adequate for self-preservation in deliberative assemblies of the Union. Other forms of punishment are merely substitutions for confinement, as seen in Kilbourn v. Thompson where Congress can compel testimony in certain cases. The Congress has the authority to compel testimony in the same manner as a court of justice in cases where it has jurisdiction to inquire. While there is a possibility of levying a fine as punishment for contempt of Congress, there is no precedent for Congress imposing a fine. In comparison to other contempt proceedings, inherent contempt allows the House or Senate to conduct summary proceedings and cite the offender without needing cooperation from the executive or judicial branches. The contemnor can seek limited judicial review through a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, unlike cases of conviction under the criminal contempt statute. The inherent contempt process allows Congress to conduct summary proceedings and cite offenders without external cooperation. However, it has limitations such as imprisonment only until the end of the current session and being described as cumbersome and ineffective. This process has not been used since 1935 due to its drawbacks. The inherent contempt power allows Congress to conduct summary proceedings and cite offenders without external cooperation. It may be facilitated by holding initial fact-finding and witness examinations before a special committee, with the final decision on guilt made by the full House or Senate. Proceedings in inherent contempt cases have been conducted at the bar of Congress, but in some cases, primarily before a committee. Between 1795 and 1857, 14 inherent contempt actions were initiated by the House. In 1857, a statutory criminal contempt procedure was enacted, largely due to a specific case in the House of Representatives that year. This statute allows for the judicial trial of the contemnor by a United States court. The 1857 statute allows for judicial trial of contemnors by a United States Attorney, serving as an alternative to the inherent contempt procedure. Despite a criminal contempt referral in 1858, most contempt proceedings continued at the bar of the house rather than through criminal contempt methods. Under 2 U.S.C. Sections 192 and 194, a witness summoned by a house or committee who fails to testify or produce documents can be fined up to $100,000 and imprisoned for up to one year. Section 194 outlines the procedure for referring a non-compliant witness to the courts for criminal prosecution. The procedure outlined in Section 194 allows for referring a non-compliant witness to the courts for criminal prosecution. Steps include committee approval, reading the committee report on the floor, House approval of a resolution authorizing the Speaker to certify the report to the U.S. Attorney, or an independent determination by the Speaker, and certification by the Speaker to the U.S. Attorney for prosecution. The criminal contempt statute is punitive and used to punish uncooperative witnesses, deterring others from similar behavior. Once voted in contempt, a witness lacks incentive to cooperate. In some cases, the House has certified to the U.S. Attorney for prosecution. Defendants who have purged themselves may not require further contempt proceedings if they comply with subpoenas before cases are referred to grand juries. It is uncertain if the U.S. Attorney is obligated to present contempt cases to grand juries, with conflicting guidance from relevant case law. In Ex parte Frankfeld, the District Court granted petitions for writs of habeas corpus sought by witnesses charged with violating 2 U.S.C. Section 192 before the House Committee on Un-American Activities. The court ordered the witnesses released due to procedural errors. The committee would report the fact to the House or Senate, and the Speaker or President would certify the facts to the district attorney. Congress intended to make the certification mandatory, leaving no discretion to the Speaker or President, and requiring the district attorney to act on the facts submitted. The Speaker or President is required to certify the facts to the district attorney, who must then bring the matter before the grand jury. The Speaker or President has discretionary power when certifying contempt citations to the U.S. Attorney during adjournments, as determined by statute and congressional practice. This review process is only required when Congress is not in session. The U.S. Attorney's function may be discretionary, as seen in Wilson where the Speaker's certification of contempt citations was deemed to lack discretion. Despite statutes using mandatory language, U.S. Attorneys are generally granted broad prosecutorial discretion. Congress can enforce a congressional subpoena through civil enforcement by filing suit in federal district court to compel compliance. Failure to comply may result in contempt of court. The Senate has the authority to pursue such actions, but there is no corresponding provision for the House. The House lacks statutory authority for civil enforcement like the Senate, but has pursued it before. In 1978, Congress enacted a civil enforcement procedure applicable only to the Senate, allowing the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to enforce subpoenas or orders issued by the Senate. The Senate has the authority to enforce subpoenas or orders through a two-step process, where they can seek a declaration of validity before directly ordering compliance through a court. This enforcement procedure is at the discretion of the Senate and is not available to the House, which lacks statutory authority for civil enforcement. The Senate can enforce subpoenas by seeking a court's declaration of validity before ordering compliance. The court's jurisdiction is limited to the matter Congress brings before it, and it cannot enjoin the congressional proceeding even if the subpoena does not meet legal standards for enforcement. The court can only refuse to issue an order instructing compliance with the subpoena. If the court orders compliance and the individual still refuses, they may face contempt of court proceedings. Civil enforcement has limitations, especially when it comes to subpoenas issued to federal government officers or employees. The House of Representatives cannot pursue actions under the statute granting jurisdiction to the courts in such cases. The House of Representatives may authorize a committee to seek civil enforcement action to force compliance with a subpoena, as seen in the 2008 case involving Harriet Miers. This marked the first attempt to seek civil enforcement solely through a resolution of a single house. In 2012, the House authorized a congressional committee to pursue civil action in federal court to enforce a subpoena issued to an executive branch official, following a previous court decision establishing jurisdiction for such claims. Attorney General Eric Holder was held in contempt of Congress for his failure to comply. The House authorized a civil lawsuit against Attorney General Eric Holder for failing to comply with subpoenas related to Operation Fast and Furious. The court rejected the Department of Justice's motion to dismiss the lawsuit. The court rejected the Department of Justice's motion to dismiss the civil lawsuit against Attorney General Eric Holder for failing to comply with subpoenas related to Operation Fast and Furious. The court addressed federal court jurisdiction, standing, causes of action, and separation-of-powers concerns, ordering the DOJ to provide a list of withheld documents. The court has yet to reach the merits of the executive privilege question. Authorization for House committees or House-retained counsel to seek civil enforcement of subpoenas requires resolution by the full House. Without this authorization, courts will not entertain civil motions on behalf of Congress. An authorizing resolution by the House may allow for civil enforcement in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The court may find no legal impediment to civil enforcement of subpoenas or committee orders. The DOJ acknowledges civil enforcement as the preferred method, but the executive branch argues Congress cannot use inherent contempt or criminal contempt procedures against executive officials invoking executive privilege. The Attorney General has directed U.S. Attorneys not to pursue criminal contempt prosecutions in response to congressional subpoenas, citing executive privilege. This stance is supported by DOJ opinions from the 1980s and past actions in contempt proceedings against government officials. The House approved a contempt citation against an official, but the DOJ declined to prosecute for criminal contempt. This may render criminal contempt ineffective when executive privilege is invoked, leading Congress to seek other enforcement avenues like civil enforcement through federal courts. The 2014 case involving IRS official Lois Lerner showed a broadening stance on criminal contempt against executive officials. The House held Ms. Lerner in contempt for refusing to testify about her role in the IRS targeting scandal. Despite invoking the Fifth Amendment, the committee rejected her assertion, leading to a criminal contempt citation. The House approved a contempt citation against Ms. Lerner for refusing to testify about her involvement in the IRS targeting scandal. The DOJ has not pursued a criminal case against her despite the citation. Unlike past cases, Lerner's refusal to comply with the subpoena was not based on executive privilege. Lerner's refusal to comply with the committee subpoena is based on her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The DOJ has not pursued criminal contempt charges against executive branch officials, even without the assertion of executive privilege. Congress faces obstacles in enforcing subpoenas against officials through the criminal contempt statute. Efforts to punish an executive branch official for noncompliance with a subpoena through criminal contempt will likely prove unavailing in many circumstances, especially if the President directs or endorses the noncompliance. The DOJ may not pursue prosecution for criminal contempt in such cases, relying on prosecutorial discretion. The DOJ may not pursue criminal contempt prosecution against an executive branch official if the President endorses the noncompliance, relying on prosecutorial discretion. However, in cases where the official's actions were not endorsed by the President, criminal contempt could still be used to punish them. The executive branch may choose not to prosecute the official to avoid setting a precedent for Congress. The contempt citation is seen as lacking merit or to prevent setting a precedent for Congress's authority to use criminal contempt against an executive branch officer. Congress may struggle to enforce its subpoenas through civil action against an executive official due to delays in obtaining a final ruling, as seen in the Miers case. The Miers case involved difficulties in enforcing a congressional subpoena against an executive branch officer, leading to delays and eventual dismissal after 19 months without a decision on the merits. Despite gaining access to withheld information, the committee's ability to utilize it effectively was diminished by the change in administrations and the passage of time. In many situations, Congress may not rely on the executive branch to enforce subpoenas against its officials effectively. Civil enforcement through the judicial branch may not always lead to a prompt resolution. Congress still has the authority to enforce subpoenas through inherent contempt."
