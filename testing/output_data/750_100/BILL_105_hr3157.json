Congress finds that enrollment in elementary and secondary schools is at record levels, with an expected increase of over a million students in 1998. The trend is projected to continue with an additional 3 million students over the next decade, particularly in secondary schools. The unprecedented increase in student enrollment will impact high poverty urban and rural areas, as well as States with rapid population growth. Schools will need to hire 150,000 additional teachers in the next decade to keep up with the growing number of students. Data from the State of Tennessee's Project STAR suggests that small class sizes have positive effects on student learning and development. Small class sizes have positive effects on student learning and development, with students in early grades benefiting the most. Adding more students to a classroom diminishes learning for the rest. It is crucial to adequately educate America's children for the future and improve the learning environment by hiring new teachers. Congress needs to fund positions to support this goal. Congress needs to fund positions for teachers to keep pace with growing enrollment and reduce classroom sizes without adding to the Federal bureaucracy, deficit, or debt. The grant program is established. The Secretary of Education can award grants to Governors for hiring teachers to reduce overcrowded classes. Governors must apply to be eligible for the grant, and the Secretary cannot disapprove eligible applications. To receive a grant from the Governor, a local educational agency must establish a trust fund, deposit funds received into the account, use the funds to hire new teachers or personnel within 2 years, follow accounting practices specified by the Governor, and allow auditing practices. The agency must ensure a net gain in teachers, review personnel performance annually, limit employment to one year, and repay the State within 27 months. The agency must repay any unspent funds to the State within 27 months, use the funds to supplement non-Federal sources for student education, and apply for funding annually. SEC. 4.
