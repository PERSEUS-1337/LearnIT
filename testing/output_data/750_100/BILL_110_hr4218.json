Congress finds that diabetes is a major public health threat in the United States, with 21 million people currently living with diabetes and 54 million with pre-diabetes. Diabetes is the 6th leading cause of death, causing 224,000 deaths annually, and its prevalence has tripled in the last 30 years. Diabetes self-management training, also known as diabetes education, provides crucial knowledge and skills to help patients effectively manage their diabetes and avoid complications. A certified diabetes educator, such as a nurse or dietitian, specializes in assisting individuals with diabetes in developing necessary self-management skills. Diabetes self-management training is effective in reducing risks and complications of diabetes. A study in 2002 showed lifestyle changes reduced the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 58 percent. Lifestyle intervention, especially effective for individuals aged 60 and older, can reduce the development of diabetes by 71 percent. Certified diabetes educators help patients better control their diabetes and improve their health status through lifestyle changes. The potential for preventing serious medical complications caused by diabetes is high with proper treatment and self-management. There are over 20,000 diabetes educators in the US, most of whom are certified by the National Certification Board for Diabetes Educators. Diabetes educators must have specific health care credentials, professional experience in diabetes self-management training, pass a national exam, and renew their credentials. They are uniquely qualified to provide diabetes self-management training under Medicare. Diabetes educators with specific credentials and experience can provide self-management training under Medicare. SEC. 3.

They must be certified by a recognized certifying body, such as the National Certification Board for Diabetes Educators.

The National Certification Board for Diabetes Educators or a certifying body in the United States requires individuals to have a qualifying credential, professional practice experience in diabetes self-management training, and pass a national certification examination to be certified as diabetes educators. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study to identify barriers for Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes in accessing self-management training services, including economic and geographic obstacles, availability of referrals, and access to qualified providers. The Comptroller General of the United States will submit a report to Congress on a study conducted to identify barriers for Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes in accessing self-management training services. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality will develop recommendations on effective outreach methods to educate individuals. The Director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality will submit a report to Congress on recommendations for outreach methods to promote diabetes self-management training. The amendments will apply to diabetes outpatient self-management training services from the first day of the first calendar year.
