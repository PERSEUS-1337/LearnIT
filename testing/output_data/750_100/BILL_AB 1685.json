    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 43016 of the Health and Safety Code is amended. A person violating provisions of Section 43016 of the Health and Safety Code may be subject to a civil penalty of up to $37,500 per action. Violations related to portable fuel containers or small off-road engines may incur a penalty of up to $500 per unit. Manufacturers or distributors who violate these provisions may also face penalties. The executive officer of the state board may require payment of penalties and product compliance with emission control laws for continued sale of regulated products in the state. The state board adjusts maximum penalties for inflation based on the California Consumer Price Index, exempt from the Administrative Procedure Act. Penalties collected are deposited in the Air Pollution Control Fund. Section 43151 of the Health and Safety Code is amended. Section 43151 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to require certification for new motor vehicles or engines before sale or use in California. This article exempts certain vehicles from regulations if acquired to replace a damaged or stolen vehicle, transferred by inheritance or court decree, or sold after a specific legislative session. Amendments were made to this subdivision during the 1979-80 Regular Session of the Legislature for vehicles registered in the state before that date. Amendments to Section 43154 of the Health and Safety Code exempt certain motor vehicles with a federal Clean Air Act certificate of conformity from state regulations, provided they were originally registered in another state by a resident who later moves to California. This exemption will be effective 180 days after regulations are adopted for certifying new direct import vehicles. Section 43154 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to allow for civil penalties up to $37,500 for violations of emission control laws. Manufacturers or distributors may also be required to pay the penalty and ensure vehicles comply with regulations to continue selling in the state. The state board can impose civil penalties of up to $10,000 on dealers who violate emission control laws, with adjustments for inflation based on the California Consumer Price Index. This penalty is separate from the one imposed on manufacturers or distributors under Section 43154 of the Health and Safety Code, which allows for penalties up to $37,500. Any action to recover a penalty under this section shall be brought in the name of the people of the State of California in the superior court of the county where the violation occurred, by the Attorney General on behalf of the state board, or by the district attorney, county attorney, or city attorney. Penalties adjudged by the court shall be deposited in the Air Pollution Control Fund or with the treasurer of the county or city. Section 43211 of the Health and Safety Code states that new motor vehicles in California must meet emission standards set by the state board. Manufacturers selling vehicles that do not meet these standards may face a civil penalty of up to $37,500 per violation. The civil penalty for failure to meet zero-emission vehicle credit requirements in California is capped at $5,000 per credit. The state board will adjust this penalty for inflation based on the California Consumer Price Index. Any penalty recovered under this section will be deposited into the General Fund. Section 43212 of the Health and Safety Code is amended. Section 43212 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to impose a civil penalty of up to $37,500 for each vehicle that does not comply with emission standards or test procedures. Non-compliant manufacturers or distributors may be required to pay penalties and make vehicles compliant before further sale in the state. The state board adjusts the maximum penalty for inflation based on the California Consumer Price Index, exempt from the Administrative Procedure Act. Any penalty recovered is deposited into the Air Pollution Control Fund. Section 43214 is added to the Health and Safety Code, imposing penalties for non-compliant vehicles. The state board may order a manufacturer of motor vehicles to comply with emissions standards for certified vehicles to continue selling them in the state."
