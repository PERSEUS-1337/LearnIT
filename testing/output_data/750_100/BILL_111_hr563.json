The \"SCHIP Expansion for Kids in Need Act of 2009\" prioritizes SCHIP coverage for children in families with income under 200 percent of the federal poverty level. Section 2108 of the Social Security Act is amended to include income-related data in annual reports on the success of states in providing health insurance coverage for children at various income levels. The Secretary will establish standards for data collection and statistical methodologies by September 30, 2009, to determine family income levels based on gross income relative to percentages of the poverty line for a family of the size involved. Additionally, a new subsection is added to include a plan for coverage of low-income children in the Act. The new subsection requires states to develop and submit a plan to ensure all low-income children have health coverage approved by the Secretary. The new subsection requires states to submit a plan approved by the Secretary to ensure health coverage for low-income children starting in fiscal year 2010. The Secretary will review and approve plans that meet the coverage requirements. The Secretary may disapprove a plan if it is not reasonably designed, allowing the State to resubmit a modified plan. The Secretary must notify the State of plan approval or disapproval promptly. This subsection pertains to qualified low-income children. In this subsection, the term 'qualified low-income child' refers to a child whose family gross income is within 200 percent of the poverty line for the family size and meets all eligibility requirements except those related to income. Additionally, there is a limitation on the use of SCHIP funds outlined in Section 2105(c) of the Act. The amendment (42 U.S.C. 1397ee(c)) adds a new paragraph limiting payments to states that increase income eligibility levels for their child health plans. Payment will not be made for individuals whose family income exceeds the new eligibility level. The amendment limits payments to states that raise income eligibility levels for child health plans, unless no more than 10% of low-income children are not covered. The amendment expands coverage for low-income children under State child health plans."
