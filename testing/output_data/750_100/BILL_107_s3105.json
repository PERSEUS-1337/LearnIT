Section 319 of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include a temporary program for West Nile Virus and related arboviral diseases, allowing the Secretary to make grants to States for prevention and control efforts. Grants under this subsection encourage collaboration with local health entities to develop prevention and control programs. Preference may be given to States with a substantial incidence of West Nile Virus or related diseases, or increased risk. Funds from grants are to be used for prevention and control efforts. Funds from grants under this subsection are to be used for developing comprehensive mosquito control plans and programs on vector-borne diseases, including training for a competent workforce. The grant under this subsection aims to develop a competent workforce for local mosquito and vector-borne disease control programs, with requirements for matching funds and limitations on supplanting. Non-Federal contributions must cover at least 50% of costs for the grant, which can be in cash or in kind. Federal funds or services subsidized by the Federal Government cannot be included in the contribution amount.

The Secretary can waive requirements for a State based on economic conditions. Local involvement is required. The State receiving funds must involve localities in mosquito control plans and ensure 85% of the grant is spent locally for public health improvement. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention can use funds to provide technical assistance to State and local health departments for mosquito control programs and containment of arboviral diseases. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention can allocate funds for technical assistance in developing mosquito abatement guidelines, with a limitation of 20 percent of the appropriated amount for this purpose. The plan will be created in collaboration with health and mosquito control organizations. The plan involves developing guidelines for sustainable mosquito control programs, focusing on identifying new cases of disease and monitoring disease spread in various species. The plan includes monitoring infection in various creatures, providing laboratory support, increasing participation in surveillance systems, conducting educational campaigns, and outlining procedures for mosquito control and health monitoring. The Secretary will evaluate the program established under the West Nile Virus and Arboviral Disease Act and submit a report to Congress within 18 months of enactment, including the results of the evaluation.
