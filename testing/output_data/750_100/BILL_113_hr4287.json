    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Independent Innovator and Repurposing Act\" and includes an extension of patent term for the method of using biological products. The \"Independent Innovator and Repurposing Act\" includes a provision for extending the term of a patent for a method of using biological products by 5 years from the original expiration date, subject to certain conditions. To extend the term of a patent for a method of using biological products, the owner must submit an application to the Director with specific information about the biological product and the patent being sought for extension. To extend the patent term for a method of using biological products, the owner must show that the patent was issued to an independent innovator or a qualified small business with ownership by the innovator, and that an application for commercial marketing of the product has been filed. The patent term extension for a method of using biological products requires proof of ownership by an independent innovator or qualified small business, along with the filing of a commercial marketing application. Additionally, a minimum of 10 years must pass between the submission of an exemption application under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the FDA approval of the application. The owner of the patent must also provide a brief description of the activities undertaken. The patent owner or agent must provide information on activities related to the biological product and relevant dates. The Director determines patent extension eligibility based on the application's representations and compliance with requirements. The Director issues a certificate of extension for 5 years if requirements are met. An interim extension may be granted if the patent would expire before a decision is made. The Director may extend the patent term for up to one year if eligible. Definitions include \"biological product\" and \"Director.\" An \"independent innovator\" is also defined. The term \"independent innovator\" refers to a person or entity who obtains a method of use patent for a biological product and is not affiliated with the holder of a marketing application approved for the commercial marketing of the product. The term \"affiliated\" includes relationships of employment, control, or common ownership, direct or indirect. A \"qualified small business\" has fewer than 500 employees, including affiliates, and is not affiliated with the holder of a marketing application for a biological product. The section specifies requirements for commercial marketing of biological products under 262(a) and the effective date of the section."
