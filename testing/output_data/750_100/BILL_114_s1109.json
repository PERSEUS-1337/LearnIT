The \"Truth in Settlements Act of 2015\" mandates that federal agencies disclose details of covered settlement agreements related to alleged violations of federal laws. The \"Truth in Settlements Act of 2015\" requires non-Federal persons to pay at least $1,000,000 or Executive agencies to pay at least $200,000 in attorney fees for settlement agreements related to rule making processes or alleged failures to engage in rule making processes. The term 'entity within the Federal Government' includes officers or employees acting in an official capacity, while 'non-Federal person' refers to those outside the government. 'Rule making' is defined under section 551(5). Information related to expenses must be posted online as per the \"Truth in Settlements Act of 2015\". The head of each Executive agency must publicly list covered settlement agreements on their website, including the date of agreement. The Executive agency must list covered settlement agreements on their website, including parties' names, description of claims, and payment obligations. The settlement agreement specifies the total amount each party must pay. The curr_chunk discusses the details of a settlement agreement, including the amount specified as not deductible for tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

The curr_chunk specifies that a payment of at least $50,000,000 must be made for a minimum of 5 years from the date of the covered settlement agreement. If confidentiality is deemed necessary to protect the public interest, the head of the Executive agency must issue a public statement explaining the need for confidentiality and the interests it protects. The curr_chunk explains the interests confidentiality protects and why they outweigh the public's interest in knowing about the Federal Government's conduct and expenditure of resources. Written public statements by Executive agencies must specify the amount to be paid by a non-Federal person under a covered settlement agreement.

The curr_chunk requires reporting on attorney fees, costs, and expenses paid to non-Federal persons under settlement agreements, as well as the number of settlement agreements involving regulatory action or changes. The new rules require Executive agencies to publicly share reports in a searchable format on their website. The Comptroller General of the United States will submit a report to Congress on how Executive agencies determine the confidentiality of settlement agreements, with recommendations for increasing transparency while protecting legitimate interests. The Senate passed the bill on September 21, 2015, as attested by Secretary JULIE E. ADAMS."
