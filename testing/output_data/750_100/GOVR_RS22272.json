    "content": "The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA), amended by the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), regulates \"federal election activity,\" including voter registration drives, voter identification, get-out-the-vote drives, and public communications that refer to a federal candidate. The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA), amended by the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), regulates \"federal election activity,\" including public communications made to the general public in connection with a federal election. Regulated federal funds, also known as \"hard money,\" are used to pay for such activities. The FEC exempted Internet communications from federal campaign finance regulation after the BCRA amendments in 2002. Representatives Shays and Meehan sued the FEC, arguing that not regulating Internet activities could lead to circumvention of campaign finance laws. In 2004, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia overturned FEC regulations on political communications on the Internet in Shays v. FEC, stating that excluding Internet communications from the definition of \"public communication\" in BCRA was inconsistent with Congress's intent. The court found that the FEC failed to provide legislative history to justify ignoring the statute. The U.S. District Court overturned FEC regulations on political communications on the Internet in Shays v. FEC in 2004. The court found that the FEC lacked legislative history to justify ignoring the statute and upheld the definition of \"generic campaign activity\" as a \"public communication.\" However, the court left it to the FEC to determine what constitutes \"general public political advertising\" online. The Shays court overturned FEC regulations on Internet political communications in 2004, stating that Internet communications were exempt from the definition of \"public communications.\" This meant that coordinated Internet communications with political parties or campaigns could not be considered \"coordinated communications\" subject to FECA regulation. The court emphasized the importance of preventing circumvention of campaign finance laws. The court overturned FEC regulations on Internet political communications in 2004, stating that coordinated Internet communications were exempt from FECA regulation to prevent circumvention of campaign finance laws. The court remanded the case to the FEC for further action consistent with its decision. In response, the FEC published an NPRM seeking comment on amending the definition of \"public communication\" to conform to the ruling. The FEC published an NPRM seeking comments on proposed rules to include paid Internet advertisements in the definition of \"public communication,\" along with related definitions and exceptions for certain Internet activities. The proposed rules aim to ensure proper financing and disclosure of political committee Internet communications without hindering individual citizens' use of the platform. In June 2005, a public hearing was held regarding proposed Internet regulations by the FEC. Despite the delay due to congressional action, the FEC unanimously approved the regulations in March 2006, citing the 2004 Shays v. FEC court decision as a driving factor. The regulations aim to allow individuals to freely use blogs without FECA restrictions. The FEC approved regulations in March 2006 to exempt blogs from FECA restrictions, recognizing the importance of preventing corruption and promoting free speech on the internet. The FEC approved regulations in March 2006 to exempt blogs from FECA restrictions, recognizing the importance of preventing corruption and promoting free speech on the internet. The Commission proposed treating paid Internet advertising as a \"public communication\" but sought to exclude all other Internet communications from this definition. Regulations apply when money is exchanged for Internet campaign ads, subjecting them to limitations, source restrictions, and reporting requirements. The FEC regulations include limitations, source restrictions, and reporting requirements for paid Internet ads classified as \"public communications.\" Advertisers must adhere to FECA contribution limits, source restrictions, and disclosure requirements for these ads. Disclaimer requirements for political ads are also mandatory. Disclaimer requirements for political committee websites and paid Internet ads are mandatory. Disclaimers are needed for ads advocating for or against federal candidates or soliciting contributions. Fees paid by candidates to bloggers must be disclosed on candidate disclosure statements. Coordinated internet advertisements for federal elections placed on another website for a fee are considered in-kind contributions subject to FECA regulations. Media exemptions apply to news stories and editorials under the definition of \"contribution.\" The exemption from FECA coverage for news stories, commentaries, and editorials distributed through traditional media also applies to those distributed over the Internet. Uncompensated individuals or groups using the Internet to influence federal elections are excluded from FECA regulation. The topic of Internet communications was not addressed during Congress's consideration of BCRA in 2001 and 2002. During the 109th Congress, there were proposals to exempt Internet communications from regulation under FECA, including the Online Freedom of Speech Act (H.R. 1606) which failed to pass with a vote of 225-182. During the 109th Congress, the Online Freedom of Speech Act (H.R. 1606) failed to pass with a vote of 225-182. Another bill, H.R. 4194 (Shays-Meehan), aimed to exclude Internet communications from FECA regulation but regulate communications placed on a website for a fee. During the 110th Congress, there was a delay in House floor action on H.R. 4900 (Allen-Bass) and H.R. 894 (Price, NC) which aimed to regulate political communications on the Internet. The new FEC regulations approved in March 2006 impacted the legislative action on online communications. H.R. 5699 (Hensarling) proposed exempting uncompensated Internet services from being considered contributions or expenditures, as long as they are primarily engaged in Internet activities and derive income mainly from those activities. H.R. 5699 aimed to exempt blogs and Internet publications from being treated as expenditures by political committees. It was referred to the Committee on House Administration. No similar legislation has been introduced in the 111th Congress."
