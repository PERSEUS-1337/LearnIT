    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Great Lakes Federal Effectiveness Act\" and establishes the Great Lakes Research Council. The Great Lakes Research Council is established to advise and coordinate Federal research activities for ecosystem protection of the Great Lakes. They are required to prepare an assessment of research activities needed within one year of the Act's enactment. The Great Lakes Research Council is tasked with assessing research activities required to meet the goals of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. This includes evaluating existing Federal expertise, capabilities, and research programs related to the Agreement, and providing recommendations for both long-term and short-term priorities in Federal research on the Great Lakes. The Great Lakes Research Council assesses Federal research priorities for the Great Lakes ecosystem, recommends data collection protocols, and collaborates on establishing a comprehensive data base. The Great Lakes Research Council ensures timely dissemination of research findings and information on Great Lakes research programs conducted by the Federal Government. The Council is comprised of research managers with expertise in the Great Lakes ecosystem from various agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency. The Great Lakes Research Council is made up of experts from agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Coast Guard, Fish and Wildlife Service, and other relevant federal departments. Non-Federal employees can also serve as ex officio members. The Chairperson is elected by the members for a two-year term, with a limit of two consecutive terms. The Council Chairperson can serve for more than two consecutive terms. Members are entitled to compensation for travel expenses. Departments must cooperate with the Council to implement recommendations. The Council is required to provide personnel, services, or facilities to assist in achieving the purposes of the Act. They must also furnish data or information upon written request from the Chairperson. The Council will invite the International Joint Commission to serve as the principal coordinating body and Secretariat for international cooperation. Agencies on the Council may reimburse costs for activities conducted by the International Joint Commission. This Act will not affect the authority of any Federal department to conduct Great Lakes research. The Great Lakes Research Council, established under this Act, defines the Great Lakes as Lake Erie, Lake Huron, Lake Michigan, Lake Ontario, and Lake Superior, along with their connecting waters. Great Lakes research involves applying scientific and engineering expertise to understand the lakes. The Great Lakes Research Council applies scientific and engineering expertise to study the Great Lakes ecosystem and water quality. The Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement is a bilateral agreement between the United States and Canada signed in 1978 and amended in 1987."
