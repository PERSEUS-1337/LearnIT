    "content": "The \"Independent Medical Review Act of 1999\" may be cited as the short title. Special rules apply to group health plans. Section 503 of ERISA is amended to include special rules for group health plans, requiring claims procedures to notify participants of their right to appeal adverse determinations to a utilization review agent. The amended Section 503 of ERISA includes rules for group health plans, such as notifying participants of their right to appeal adverse determinations to an independent review organization or for immediate review in life-threatening conditions. The amended Section 503 of ERISA outlines procedures for appealing adverse determinations to an independent review organization or for immediate review in life-threatening conditions. The appeal process must be fair and include a de novo determination of medical necessity by the independent review organization. Procedures for appeals must be reasonable and allow for oral or written appeals by participants, beneficiaries, or their representatives. The utilization review agent must acknowledge receipt of the appeal within 5 working days and provide a list of required documents. The appeal process includes submitting necessary documents to the utilization review agent. If an oral appeal is made, a one-page appeal form is sent to the appealing party. Appeal decisions are typically made by a physician, but a specialty provider can review the case if good cause is provided within 10 working days of a denial. The denial review process involves a health care provider in the same specialty as the condition being reviewed, to be completed within 15 working days. An expedited appeal procedure is in place for emergency care denials and life-threatening conditions, with a review by a different health care provider. The expedited appeal process for emergency care denials involves a review by a different healthcare provider of the same specialty, to be completed within one working day from receiving all necessary information. The utilization review agent must send a response letter to the patient, their representative, or healthcare provider explaining the appeal resolution, including specific reasons and clinical basis within 30 days of receiving the appeal. The review agent receives the appeal for independent review of adverse determinations denied by a utilization review agent. The independent review process ensures a timely response by an independent review organization. The independent review process guarantees timely responses, confidentiality of medical records, independence of healthcare providers, and prompt notification of review results to participants. The utilization review agent must provide relevant medical records to the independent review organization within 3 business days of receiving a request for review of an adverse determination. The utilization review agent must provide medical records, documents, written notification, documentation, and a list of physicians for review by the organization. The utilization review agent must provide a list of physicians or health care providers with relevant medical records for the appeal process. The independent review organization must make a determination within 15 days. The independent review organization must make a determination within 15 days, or within 20 days for a life-threatening condition. The independent review organization must make a determination within 5 days of receiving necessary information or within 8 days of receiving the request. To be certified as an independent review organization, an organization must submit an annual application to the Secretary including specific information. The applicant must provide details such as ownership stakes, business affiliations, bond holders exceeding $100,000, and biographical information of key personnel when applying for certification as an independent review organization. The applicant must provide details of ownership stakes, business affiliations, and biographical information of key personnel, including any relationships with health insurance providers, health maintenance organizations, utilization review agents, nonprofit health corporations, and payors. The applicant must provide details of ownership stakes, business affiliations, and biographical information of key personnel, including any relationships with health insurance providers, health maintenance organizations, utilization review agents, nonprofit health corporations, payors, and health care professionals' areas of expertise. Additionally, they should include the percentage of revenues anticipated from reviews conducted under this subsection. The independent review organization will use procedures to make determinations for the applicant, and their decision will be final for the plan. The independent review organization's decision on the plan can be vacated or modified by a court, similar to an arbitrator's decision under title 9, United States Code. The organization must be independent and not owned or controlled by a payor or association. An independent review organization conducting a review is not liable for damages. Adverse determination refers to a determination that health care services are not medically necessary. The term 'health care provider' is defined. The term 'health care provider' includes individuals and entities delivering health care services in a State, required to be licensed or certified by State law. The term 'payor' refers to insurers, preferred provider organizations, and self-insurance plans. A 'life-threatening condition' is a medical condition where death or serious bodily injury is likely without intervention. A utilization review agent conducts utilization review for employers with employees covered under a group health plan, payors, or administrators. The term 'working day' is defined as a weekday, excluding legal holidays, for employers, payors, or administrators."
