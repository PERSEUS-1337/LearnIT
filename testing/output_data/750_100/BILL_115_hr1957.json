    "content": "The \"Safe Schools Improvement Act of 2017\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. Congress recognizes that bullying and harassment in schools can harm students' physical and mental health, hinder learning, and lead to negative outcomes such as high dropout rates and academic underachievement. These behaviors create a climate of fear and disrespect that impairs students' ability to participate in educational opportunities. Schools offer educational opportunities and activities. Behaviors like hitting, name-calling, intimidation, and sending offensive messages through various electronic means contribute to bullying. Schools with anti-bullying policies see increased reporting and teacher intervention, reducing the frequency of such incidents. Students are targeted for bullying based on various factors like race, gender, and disability. Some experience relational aggression, damaging relationships and social acceptance. Interventions are needed to address bullying and harassment. Interventions like Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) can reduce exclusionary discipline policies and prevent students from being pushed out to the juvenile justice system. 85% of Americans support a Federal law to enforce rules against bullying in schools. Students, parents, educators, and policymakers are calling for leadership and action to address the national crisis of bullying and harassment by enforcing specific rules. The purpose of the Safe Schools Improvement Act is to address bullying and harassment in public elementary and secondary schools by implementing anti-bullying policies. The Safe Schools Improvement Act aims to address bullying, including cyberbullying, in schools by requiring states to establish policies that prevent and prohibit severe, persistent, or pervasive conduct that limits a student's participation or creates a hostile educational environment. The Safe Schools Improvement Act requires states to establish policies to prevent bullying and harassment in schools, including acts of aggression or intimidation based on a student's race, color, national origin, sex, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, or religion. The Safe Schools Improvement Act mandates policies to prevent bullying and harassment in schools based on various characteristics such as race, color, national origin, sex, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, and other defining traits recognized by the State or local educational agency. Annual notice must be provided to students, parents, and educational professionals regarding these protections. The Safe Schools Improvement Act requires educational professionals to describe prohibited conduct and grievance procedures in local educational agency discipline policies, including designated officials and timelines for complaints. The Safe Schools Improvement Act mandates local educational agencies to collect and report accurate data on incidents of prohibited conduct at the school building level while ensuring the confidentiality of victims and perpetrators. Positive and preventative approaches are encouraged to address such conduct. Encourage positive and preventative approaches to school discipline to minimize student removal from instruction and prevent disproportionate punishment. State reports must be submitted by the chief executive officer of a State receiving a grant under this title, in cooperation with the State educational agency. The report should include information reported by local educational agencies and describe the State's plans to support local educational agency efforts in addressing prohibited conduct. The Secretary will conduct a biennial evaluation of programs and policies to combat bullying and harassment in schools, including assessing the effectiveness of parent involvement and training programs. The Commissioner for Education Statistics will collect data from States to determine the incidence of prohibited conduct. The Secretary will submit a biennial report to the President and Congress on the evaluation of bullying and harassment policies, including data collected from States. \"SEC. 4705. EFFECT ON OTHER LAWS.\" The text states that federal and state nondiscrimination laws are not invalidated by the current part, including laws such as title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. The current part does not affect existing federal laws protecting freedom of speech and expression, including title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. The text states that nothing in the part prohibits states or local entities from enacting laws to prevent bullying or harassment of students, as long as they are not inconsistent with the part. It also includes a table of contents for the Safe Schools Improvement section, outlining the purpose, anti-bullying policies, state reports, evaluation, and the rule of construction."
