    "content": "Legislation to rewrite and reauthorize the Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA) may be considered in the 111th Congress. In the 110th Congress, various bills were introduced addressing penalties, enforcement, diversion of goods, and integration of export control data. The EAA controls sensitive dual-use goods with civilian and military applications, including items that can contribute to the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weaponry. The Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA) controls sensitive dual-use goods with civilian and military applications, including items that can contribute to the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weaponry. The EAA is the statutory authority for the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), which are administered by the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) located in the Department of Commerce. The Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA) regulates exports of dual-use items with military applications. Export controls are based on strategic relationships, threats to national security, and international business practices. Some stakeholders advocate for liberalizing export regulations to benefit American companies. The Export Administration Act of 1979 regulates exports of dual-use items with military applications. There is a need to liberalize U.S. export regulations to allow American companies to compete internationally for high-technology goods. Some argue that export controls should be tightened to address national security threats. The report discusses the evolution of the Export Administration Act, types of controls authorized, Commerce Control List, export licensing procedures, and issues related to maintaining export controls under IEEPA. Export controls have been a part of U.S. policy for almost a century, with the end of WWII marking a new era in export control policy. The discussion covers various controlled commodities, competing business and national security perspectives, and key themes in the export control debate. The end of WWII marked a new era in export control policy, with a focus on the Soviet-Bloc countries during the Cold War. The Export Control Act of 1949 recognized the security threat and established a peacetime export control system with three reasons for imposing controls: short-supply, national economic impact, and foreign policy promotion. The President used foreign policy controls to promote US interests, including regional stability, human rights, anti-terrorism, and non-proliferation. National security controls restricted exports that could enhance military capabilities of threatening countries. A multilateral export control regime was established with NATO allies post-WWII. The establishment of a multilateral control regime with NATO allies led to the creation of the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (CoCom) in 1949. CoCom controls reflected a high level of restrictions, and the Export Control Act was renewed multiple times without significant changes. In the late 1960s, the U.S. export control system was revised with the passage of the Export Administration Act of 1969, replacing the restrictive Export Control Act of 1949. Subsequent amendments in 1974, 1977, and a comprehensive rewrite in 1979 continued the trend towards less restrictive export controls. The Export Administration Act of 1969 was revised in 1979 and amended in 1985. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989 led to some changes in U.S. export control policy. Despite some streamlining, the basic structure of the law remains intact. There are calls for a revamp to enhance exports or focus on current national security threats. The dissolution of CoCom in 1994 and its replacement by the Wassenaar Arrangement in 1997 significantly changed the export control environment, raising questions about the effectiveness of U.S. export controls in achieving national security objectives and the fairness of unilateral controls to American industry. Congress has not reached an agreement on this issue. The Export Administration Act has not been reformed since the 101st Congress, with export controls being extended through temporary measures and Executive Orders. There are debates on whether to liberalize or tighten controls under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, with concerns about constraints on the export control process. Operating under IEEPA imposes constraints on the export control process, making it vulnerable to legal challenges. Legislation has temporarily extended the EAA of 1979, removing the need for IEEPA powers. Export control authority currently operates under Executive Order 13222. Legislation to rewrite the Export Administration Act has been introduced in recent Congresses. In the 104th Congress, the House passed the Omnibus Export Administration Act of 1996. In the 106th Congress, the Export Administration Act of 1999 was introduced by Senator Michael P. Enzi. In the 106th Congress, Senator Michael P. Enzi introduced the Export Administration Act of 1999. The Senate Banking Committee unanimously voted to report the legislation to the Senate floor, but action was not taken due to concerns about national security. In the 107th Congress, Senator Enzi introduced the Export Administration Act of 2001, which was favorably reported for consideration by the Senate. The Senate passed the Export Administration Act in 2001 by a vote of 19-1. It was debated in September and passed with amendments by a vote of 85-14. The House version, H.R. 2581, was introduced by Representative Benjamin Gilman in July 2001. It was similar to S. 149 with additional provisions related to oversight of nuclear transfers to North Korea. The House International Relations Committee passed H.R. 2581 with 35 amendments related to oversight of nuclear transfers to North Korea. In the 108th Congress, Representative Dreier introduced EAA legislation (H.R. 55). In the 108th Congress, Representative Dreier introduced EAA legislation (H.R. 55) identical to S. 149, but no action was taken. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) has been used to attempt to amend the export control regime, with the House version of NDAA 2005 (H.R. 4200) containing provisions affecting dual-use export controls. One provision would have required a license for dual-use goods controlled under the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) for technology and items on the Militarily Critical Technology List (MCTL). The Department of Defense compiled a list called MCTL in response to a 2004 study. A provision in the NDAA 2005 would require exporters to obtain licenses for items controlled under EAR or ITAR if they were previously exported to China. The House NDAA report expressed concern about this provision. The House NDAA report (H.Rept. 108-491) raised concerns about potential military embargoes on China being repealed, allowing transfer of U.S. goods or technology. A bill to revise the Export Administration Act was introduced in the 109th Congress by Representative Henry Hyde in 2005, focusing on penalties, enforcement, and relations with the United States. The 109th Congress introduced legislation to revise the Export Administration Act, focusing on penalties, enforcement, and relations with the United States. The bill aimed to extend the expired EAA for two years, provide authorization for export control activities, and make targeted changes that all sides could support. However, this bill did not receive consideration in the 109th Congress. The 109th Congress introduced legislation to revise the Export Administration Act, focusing on penalties, enforcement, and relations with the United States. The bill aimed to extend the expired EAA for two years, provide authorization for export control activities, and make targeted changes that all sides could support. In the 110th Congress, various bills were introduced to address enforcement, penalties, integration of export control information into electronic filing, and targeting countries of diversion concern. Only S. 3445 / H.R. 7112 was acted upon in the 110th Congress. On July 31, 2009, Representative Sherman introduced the Export Control Improvements Act (H.R. 3515) with provisions on export controls enforcement, integration of export control data in the AES, and diversion control. The title on export enforcement does not amend the enforcement section of the expired EAA (Sec.12) like H.R. 6828, but introduces new measures. The Export Control Improvements Act (H.R. 3515) introduced new enforcement measures, granting additional authority for Export Administration Regulations enforcement during the lapse of the EAA. It allows for investigative authority, search, detention, and seizure of goods by the Department of Commerce. The Export Control Improvements Act (H.R. 3515) grants additional enforcement authority for Export Administration Regulations during the lapse of the EAA. It authorizes search, detention, and seizure of goods by Commerce in the U.S. and at ports of entry or exit. The bill also includes guidelines for export control compliance programs, confidentiality provisions, and new provisions for undercover investigations and audit requirements. Title 1 of H.R. 3515 aims to streamline licensing requirements and data collection rules for exporters and shippers into the Automated Export System. It focuses on integrating export control data into the system to prevent improper shipments and address evasion of U.S. export controls through transhipment hubs. The 111th Congress is concerned about goods being diverted through transhipment hubs, particularly in the United Arab Emirates. In 2006, computer circuits exported to the UAE were used in bomb detonators in Iran and Iraq. This led to licensing requirements on Mayrow General Trading and others. The focus then shifted to the UAE's export control regime, prompting the proposal of a 'Country Category C' for countries of diversion concern. H.R. 3515 proposes the 'Category C' concept for countries of diversion concern, specifically targeting Iran. The bill requires the President to identify countries at risk of transhipment, reexportation, or diversion of items to Iran within 180 days. Countries could be designated as either possible diversion concerns or diversion concerns, triggering specific licensing requirements. The bill proposes identifying countries at risk of diverting items to Iran within 180 days. If cooperation is not received within 12 months, countries will be designated as a Destination of Diversion Concern, leading to additional licensing requirements and stricter controls. The legislation includes more stringent license review and increased end-user checks. President Obama initiated a review of the U.S. export control system, with Defense Secretary Gates outlining key reform elements in 2010. Defense Secretary Gates proposed a 4-pronged approach to reform the export control system in 2010, aiming to create a single licensing agency, adopt a unified control list, establish an integrated IT system, and set up a single enforcement coordination agency. The changes were planned to be implemented in three phases, with the final phase requiring legislative action. The reform of the export control system proposed by Defense Secretary Gates in 2010 aimed to harmonize the Commerce Control List (CCL) with the U.S. Munitions List (USML) in three phases, with the final phase requiring legislative action. The first phase involved preparatory work to establish a tiered control structure, standardized licensing processes, an \"Enforcement Fusion Center,\" and a single electronic gateway. Phase II would implement a harmonized licensing system with two identically structured tiered control lists. The White House fact sheet proposes harmonization and tiering of control lists to reduce license requirements. It includes moving items from munitions list to dual-use list, examining unilateral controls, and consulting with partners on multilateral controls. A new export control system with a single licensing agency would debut in Phase III. The 3-phase plan proposed merging harmonized control lists, establishing a Primary Enforcement Coordination Agency, and implementing a single IT system for licensing and enforcement. Secretary Gates predicted the plan would unfold over the next year, but many questions remain unanswered, especially regarding legislative actions needed for certain proposals. The Phase II of the plan involves potential changes to the structure of control lists, requiring legislative consent and multilateral consultations. The placement of the proposed licensing agency within existing departments or as an independent entity is still undecided, with differing opinions on each option. The EAA and efforts to renew legislation have common principles and concepts related to export controls. These controls include national security, foreign policy, and short supply controls, licensing procedures, license review process, and penalty enforcement procedures. U.S. dual-use export controls have restricted items based on national security, foreign policy, and domestic exports' impact on the economy since the 1949 Act. These categories form the basis for items on the Commerce Control List (CCL). The Commerce Control List (CCL) categorizes items controlled for national security and foreign policy reasons, with different standards determining licensing policies. The 1979 Act restricted exports that could enhance military capabilities detrimental to US national security. National security control items require National Security licensing under the Export Administration Regulations. The National Security licensing requirement of the Export Administration Regulations controls items for national security purposes. Licenses are reviewed case-by-case for items destined for civilian use or not contributing significantly to military potential. Goods and technology for national security control are identified by the Secretary of Defense and other agencies. The Secretary of Defense and Commerce periodically review and revise these controls. The Secretary of Defense maintains the Military Critical Technology List (MCTL) for national security purposes, which is consistent with the Wassenaar Arrangement control list. U.S. national security controls do not cover items under nuclear, chemical, biological, or missile proliferation regimes, or to countries under anti-terrorism controls. Items controlled for national security are subject to a foreign availability determination. Foreign availability determination is crucial for items subject to export control for national security reasons. The Secretary, along with the Secretary of Defense and other agencies, continuously assess whether controlled items are available in sufficient quantity and quality from sources outside the U.S. Requests for foreign availability determination can be initiated by license applicants or the Secretary. If a determination is made, the item's status is affected. The bill created an Office of Foreign Availability to assist the Secretary in making foreign availability determinations for decontrolling items. The Office of Technology Evaluation now fulfills this role. The Office of Foreign Availability no longer exists, with the Office of Technology Evaluation now responsible for foreign availability determinations. The Emerging Technology and Research Advisory Committee (ETRAC) was established in 2008 to involve university experts in determining technologies for the control list, particularly for deemed exports. BIS conducted a review of the Commerce Control List (CCL) in 2007-8 and plans to review 1/3 of the CCL to better reflect technologies essential for national security. BIS conducted a review of the Commerce Control List (CCL) in 2007-8 and plans to review 1/3 of the CCL each year. On May 22, 2009, BIS issued a final rule lifting certain licensing requirements on uncooled thermal imaging cameras to 36 U.S. allied countries. The rule decontrolled low to mid-market night vision cameras not incorporated into military commodities and tightened export controls on higher-end thermal imaging cameras. Exporters must report transactions to BIS semi-annually. Some exporters concerned about the time taken for BIS to resolve issues related to military commodity transactions. Industry source mentions it took six years for BIS to reach agreement with Defense Technology Security Administration. Mass market status concept proposed in EAA legislation, but current regulations do not provide for decontrol of items. The 107th Congress introduced legislation to define mass market status for items based on distribution, shipping, and usefulness criteria. This feature was controversial and a stumbling block in negotiations. The EAA in the 107th Congress sparked debate over potential wholesale decontrol of sensitive items. It authorizes the President to control exports for foreign policy objectives, anti-terrorism, regional stability, crime control, UN sanctions, embargoes, and non-proliferation goals. This includes adherence to multilateral agreements on chemical, biological, nuclear weapons, and missile technology. The EAA imposes limitations on foreign policy controls, requiring annual renewal and clear objectives from the President. It mandates negotiations to eliminate foreign availability of controlled items, compliance with international obligations, and licensing for exports to countries supporting terrorism. Medical sales are exempt from foreign policy controls. Controls on sales of medicine, medical supplies, food, medicines, seeds, and water resource equipment are not authorized under foreign policy controls if they are intended to meet basic human needs. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 further amended controls on sales of agricultural products and medicines. Catch-all controls, introduced under the Enhanced Proliferation Control Initiative of 1991, are also administered as foreign policy controls. The Export Administration Regulations (EAR) contain catch-all controls under the Enhanced Proliferation Control Initiative (EPCI) of 1991. These controls require a license for the export of any item if it will be used for nuclear, missile, chemical, or biological proliferation activities. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) maintains an end-user list of entities subject to EPCI. Certain entities in Russia, China, Pakistan, India, Israel, and foreign terrorist organizations face a presumption of denial for export licenses. The Export Administration Act (EAA) of 1979 authorizes restrictions on exports to protect domestic interests. The 1979 EAA authorized restrictions on exports to protect domestic industry from shortages and inflation. Short-supply controls remain for crude oil, petroleum derivatives, western red cedar, and horse exports by sea. The proposed EAA legislation in the 107th Congress did not include short-supply control authority. The Bureau of Industry and Security administers the license application process, reviewing 21,213 applications worth $72.1 billion in FY2008, including $50.2 billion in crude oil licenses. In FY2008, the Bureau of Industry and Security reviewed 21,213 license applications worth $72.1 billion. China was the largest destination for controlled goods with 1,990 licenses approved valued at $2.7 billion. The average processing time for referred license applications was 27 days. In FY2008, 1,990 licenses worth $2.7 billion were approved for exports to China, accounting for 3.7% of total exports to China that year. The highest number of approved licenses were for chemical manufacturing facilities and equipment, totaling 2,212 applications valued at $294 million. The 1979 EAA mandated the creation of the Commerce Control List (CCL) by the Secretary of Commerce, which includes items controlled for national security, foreign policy, and short-supply reasons. The Commerce Control List (CCL) includes specific goods, technology, and software controlled by the EAR, divided into ten categories such as nuclear materials, electronics, and propulsion systems. Each category is further divided into functional groups like equipment, materials, software, and technology. The Commerce Control List (CCL) categorizes controlled items into ten categories like nuclear materials, electronics, and propulsion systems. Each item has an export control classification number (ECCN) based on test, inspection, and production equipment, materials, software, and technology. There are about 500 ECCN listings, and all U.S.-origin commodities are \"subject to the EAR,\" meaning restrictions may apply based on end-use or end-user. Items on the Commerce Control List (CCL) may require a license for export, even to friendly nations, due to the risk of diversion or controversial nature. Commodity jurisdiction (CJ) determines if a product is dual-use or munition, dictating the regulatory regime. The regulatory regime for products is determined by commodity jurisdiction (CJ), which classifies items as dual-use or munition. Exporters can request a classification from BIS for items not listed on the Commerce Control List (CCL), with BIS referring requests to State and Defense if needed. The General Accounting Office criticized Commerce for low referral rates of commodity classification requests to State and Defense, highlighting a lack of criteria for referrals. Out of 5,370 requests in 2005, only 10 were referred, with no new referral criteria developed. Coordination issues between agencies were identified as a key factor in jurisdictional problems. The General Accounting Office criticized Commerce for low referral rates of commodity classification requests to State and Defense due to coordination issues between agencies. Disagreements and problems arise from minimal coordination and differing interpretations of regulations between departments, leading to unresolved jurisdictional disputes. Until resolved, exporters, not the government, will determine restrictions and review processes. The EAA and EAR establish policies for license application review and interagency resolution. The procedures for reviewing license applications and resolving interagency disputes were established by Executive Order 12981. The Secretary of Commerce has the authority to review and determine the disposition of export licenses, with other agencies having the ability to review licenses as well. Agencies may waive their right to review certain applications, and the Secretary must seek additional information within nine days of a license application's registration. Within 30 days of a license application's registration, the Secretary must seek additional information, refer the application to other agencies, assure correct security classification, return unnecessary applications, grant or deny the application. Reviewing agencies must request additional information within 10 days and recommend approval or denial within 30 days of receipt. The agency must recommend approval or denial of the application within 30 days, providing regulatory or statutory justification for a denial. If no recommendation is given, the agency is deemed to have no objection. The license application can be delayed by various actions. The 1995 Order established a three-level interagency dispute resolution mechanism, with the Export Administration Review Board (EARB) at the top tier, consisting of the Secretary and Secretaries of State, Defense, and Energy. The Export Administration Review Board (EARB) consists of the Secretary, Secretaries of State, Defense, and Energy, with non-voting members like the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Director of Central Intelligence. The Advisory Committee on Export Policy (ACEP) is under the EARB and includes the Assistant Secretary for Export Administration as Chair. The Operating Committee (OC) of the ACEP is made up of representatives from relevant departments. The Chair of the OC is selected by the Secretary of Commerce and serves as the Executive Secretary of ACEP. The Chair of the Operating Committee (OC) is selected by the Secretary of Commerce and serves as the Executive Secretary of ACEP. The dispute resolution process starts with the OC, with the Chair reviewing department recommendations and informing them of the decision within 14 days. Any department can appeal to the ACEP within five days, and a majority decision is made within 11 days. The ACEP allows for appeals within specific timeframes, with the EARB making decisions within 11 days. The interagency appeal process must be completed within 90 days, but there is no set timeframe for Presidential consideration of a license decision. BIS's denial of an export license must be supported by specific reasons for reconsideration. An appeal procedure is specified in the EAR for license denials, with one basis being foreign availability assessment. BIS reported 422 cases escalated to the OC in FY2008. President George H.W. Bush extended export regulations in 1990 when the EAA expired. President Clinton reimposed export regulations under the IEEPA after temporary extensions in 1993 and 1994. This led to a restructuring of export control regulations. During this period, export control regulations were restructured and reorganized, with President Clinton signing legislation to extend the authority of the 1979 Act until August 20, 2001. President George W. Bush renewed emergency controls under Executive Order 13222. Deficiencies in maintaining export controls under IEEPA authority were noted, including the lapse of police power for enforcement agents and the need for them to obtain Special Deputy U.S. Marshal status. The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not allow the President to limit federal court jurisdiction or extend the Export Administration Act's denial of judicial review. It also lacks a confidentiality provision for protecting export license information and does not explicitly authorize measures to discourage compliance with foreign boycotts. Critics argue that the US sends the wrong message by not enacting appropriate legislation. The United States has been urging countries like Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and China to strengthen their export control laws. Critics argue that US export control laws have expired, diminishing US credibility. The International Emergency Economic Powers Enhancement Act raised criminal penalties to $1 million or up to 20 years' imprisonment. The International Emergency Economic Powers Enhancement Act increased penalties for violations, with fines up to $1 million or 20 years in prison for individuals. Civil penalties were raised to $250,000. The Export Administration Act limits civil penalties to $10,000, or $100,000 for national security violations, and criminal penalties to $250,000 and 10 years' imprisonment for individuals, and $1 million or 5 times the export value for firms. Controversial exports include telecommunications, advanced electronic equipment, precision machine tools, guidance technology, aerospace, jet engine technology, and synthetic materials. The focus of congressional attention in recent years has been on technologically advanced computers, including supercomputers and a wide range of related technologies. These computers can perform complex digital operations within seconds. The benchmark for gauging HPC computing performance was previously measured in MTOPS, but a new standard called adjusted peak performance (APP) was approved in 2005. The new standard for measuring HPC computing performance, called adjusted peak performance (APP), was introduced in 2005. It is measured by a metric known as \"weighted teraflops\" (WT) with a control level set at 0.75 WT. This level replaces the previous benchmark of 190,000 MTOPS from January 2002. The APP standard is used for high-end proprietary HPCs, such as those used by the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy for advanced research, development, and simulation. During the Clinton and Bush Administrations, there were adjustments to HPC export thresholds, with the last change in January 2002 raising the threshold for exports to Tier 3 countries to 190,000 MTOPS. Some argue that due to rapid advancements in computing capabilities and the availability of comparable models from foreign countries, export restrictions on HPCs are not practical or enforceable. The Bush Administration raised the threshold for HPC exports to Tier 3 countries to 190,000 MTOPS from 2,000 MTOPS in 1995. This decontrol process had a significant regulatory impact on BIS, with a notable decrease in license applications for computer assemblies and hardware by 2003. Despite the change to the WT metric, control level adjustments are still subject to notification requirements under the National Defense Authorization Act of 1998. The National Defense Authorization Act of 1998 imposed special conditions on the export of high performance computers, including prior notification requirements, post-shipment verification, and notification to Congress of any adjustments in MTOPS threshold levels. Each version of the Export Administration Act in the 107th Congress aimed to repeal these provisions. Encryption is the process of encoding electronic messages for secure transfer of information. Keys are required to decode the message. It is crucial for e-commerce security and cryptography, impacting military code-breaking capabilities. Control authority over encryption technology was transferred from the Department of State to the Department of Commerce in 1996. Several decontrols of encryption items and technology have occurred since then. Since 1996, there have been multiple decontrols of encryption items and technology, leading to the progressive decontrol of retail encryption technology. Retail encryption products can now be exported to western countries and non-governmental end-users in other countries without a license, except for countries under anti-terrorism controls. Stealth technology incorporates materials and shapes to protect against electronic detection, falling into two categories. Stealth technology involves materials that can deflect or absorb radar signals to prevent detection. These materials are sensitive from an export control perspective due to their civil applications. Concerns over potential export led to reclassification of certain stealth-related technology as munitions in the 1990s. In the 1990s, there was a reclassification of certain stealth-related technology as munitions. Congress debated controlling exports of commercial communications satellites and the effectiveness of monitoring foreign launch operations to prevent disclosures of missile secrets. The Cox Committee found that U.S. satellite manufacturers provided missile design information to China through improper transfers. The Department of Commerce licensed satellite exports from late 1996 to March 1999, with Congress returning authority to the Department of State in March 1999. The transfer of licensing exports of commercial communications satellites from the Department of Commerce to the Department of State in March 1999 has caused licensing delays and lost sales for the satellite industry. Satellites used for commercial communication may contain sensitive technology controlled under the U.S. Munitions List. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 2010-11 (H.R. 2410) addressed this issue. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 2010-11 (H.R. 2410) allowed the President to transfer commercial satellite technology from the U.S. Munitions List to the Commerce Control List with congressional approval. This technology includes manufacturing equipment used for missiles, aircraft engines, and arms production, which has become more advanced with computer software and circuitry. The industry has expressed concerns about the lack of multilateral controls affecting its competitive position. The lack of multilateral controls over sales of advanced manufacturing equipment has affected the industry's competitive position. A critical technology assessment recommended decontrolling certain products to China and Taiwan. \"Hot section\" technology is crucial for jet aircraft development and production, controlled by the U.S. Munitions List. The U.S. Munitions List controls \"hot section\" technology crucial for jet aircraft development. Concerns were raised in the 106th Congress about possible decontrol of this technology, with the civilian aviation industry worried about the DDTC asserting jurisdiction over civilian aircraft. The EAA asserts jurisdiction over civilian aircraft parts and components, specifically those certified by the FAA and intended for export to non-controlled countries. This jurisdiction was highlighted in the QRS-11 case involving a non-FAA component of a commercial standby instrument system. Commerce suppliers have raised concerns about submitting commodity jurisdiction for items covered by 17(c) to comply with ITAR regulations. Representative Manzullo introduced legislation (H.R. 3633) to clarify that civil aircraft equipment eligible for export airworthiness approval under FAA regulations should only be subject to controls under the EAA. DDTC released a new rule clarifying the interpretation of Section 17(c) of the EAA, giving Commerce jurisdiction over certain items. Under the regulation, Commerce will have jurisdiction over parts and components of civil aircraft that are standard equipment and integral to the aircraft. Suppliers no longer need to submit these items for a commodity jurisdiction determination. Exports of technology and know-how are considered exported when released to a foreign national within the United States, regulated by the Export Administration. Deemed exports within the United States are regulated by the Export Administration Regulations, requiring a license for technology transfer to a foreign national. BIS reviewed 1,056 deemed export licenses in FY2007, representing 5.4% of total licenses submitted. In response to an Inspector General's report, BIS established a rule-making procedure in March 2005 to change the standard for foreign nationals subject to export controls. Currently based on citizenship or residency, the IG recommended using country of birth instead. Foreign nationals from controlled destinations could access technology without scrutiny if they establish residency in a third country. In December 2005, Under Secretary of Commerce David McCormick announced that deemed export controls would still be based on country of citizenship or permanent residency, not place of birth. In December 2007, BIS released the report of the Deemed Export Advisory Commission (DEAC), recommending a \"trusted entity\" program for academia and industrial entities to qualify for streamlined deemed export regulations. The Deemed Export Advisory Commission (DEAC) recommended a \"trusted entity\" program for academia and industrial entities to qualify for streamlined deemed export regulations. The evaluation process would consider an applicant's country of birth, prior residence, citizenship, and activities to determine eligibility. The Commission also suggested streamlining terminology in regulations and establishing an expert panel for an annual technology review. Industry representatives criticized the DEAC recommendations. The DEAC recommendations for a \"trusted entity\" program were criticized by industry representatives and the research community as unadministerable for the government and difficult-to-comply with for industry. BIS sought comments on technologies subject to deemed export controls and criteria for assessing country affiliation for foreign nationals. The Emerging Technologies and Research Advisory Committee (ETRAC) has started addressing these issues. The Emerging Technologies and Research Advisory Committee (ETRAC) is grappling with the tension between commercial and national security concerns in debates on export administration legislation. While many support reform of the current system to help U.S. businesses compete globally, others prioritize national security in the reform process. The debate on export administration legislation involves tensions between commercial interests and national security concerns. Some prioritize effective controls on potential exports to countries threatening U.S. security, terrorists, human rights violators, and weapons proliferators over the ability of U.S. industry to export. Controversies arise regarding technology control, multilateral regimes, licensing processes, and the impact of export controls on the U.S. economy. The EAA reauthorization legislation and the concept of technology controllability are key points of contention. The EAA reauthorization legislation and the concept of technology controllability have sparked controversy in the debate. Industry groups see these provisions as crucial in potential EAA legislation, arguing that unilateral controls won't prevent other countries from accessing advanced technology. They believe that U.S. dominance in cutting-edge technology is no longer guaranteed. Advocates argue that current multilateral controls on dual-use articles are ineffective, leading to American business suffering from unilateral U.S. export controls. Foreign businesses benefit by gaining new markets or incentives to enter new markets. Unilateral export controls are seen as increasingly unworkable in a globalized economy, as the current system is based on goods being manufactured in one country. Purchasing managers at Daimler Chrysler Aerospace are reducing dependence on American components for defense and space technology products due to delays in American licensing procedures. Critics are concerned about the mass market and foreign availability arguments made by industry proponents in the export control debate. Critics argue that the mass market standard could undermine U.S. control regulations by decontrolling items meeting certain criteria. They claim that almost any product, including dual-use items for proliferation, could qualify. The foreign availability criterion could allow the sale of items to controlled countries. Industry argues that robust export industries enhance national security. The current export control regime is influenced by changes in defense procurement and research. The military now relies more on commercial applications and off-the-shelf purchases, reversing the previous trend of conducting extensive technical research. Industry argues that selling current technology is crucial for national security, as it generates funds for future technology development and prevents foreign firms from gaining market share. Foreign firms gaining market share and increasing profits could potentially surpass our technological lead, impacting the quality of technology available for national security. Industry argues for a streamlined export process to not impede exports, while critics believe selling advanced technology to potentially hostile states could pose a threat to national security. Proponents argue that reliance on the civilian sector for R&D, due to declining defense budgets in the 1990s, has led to potential risks of advanced technology falling into the hands of hostile nations. They suggest that R&D for defense capabilities should be funded within the Defense Department to maintain control over technology exports. Observers highlight the challenge of controlling computing power due to rapid advancements, which the export control system struggles to regulate effectively. The increasing speed of computers and networking capabilities have blurred the line between super-computers and commodity computers, allowing for the creation of servers that surpass export thresholds by linking compliant microprocessors. The Defense Science Board noted that clustering commodity computers can breach export thresholds, creating a parallel processing system approaching super-computer capabilities. Some believe the US can restrict access to high computer technology by limiting exports, as American-made computers are perceived as superior. American-made computer products are seen as superior, offering better networking and service at a competitive price. Control advocates emphasize the importance of qualitative differences, especially in networking parallel processing systems. Post-shipment verification is one policy used to monitor the end-use of controlled goods like High-Performance Computers (HPCs). Post-shipment verification (PSV) is required for the export of High-Performance Computers (HPCs) to tier III destinations, including China, Russia, India, Pakistan, Israel, and other unstable regions. Lawmakers are particularly concerned about HPC exports to China, where access to U.S. HPC exports is restricted. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) has made limited efforts to monitor compliance with export license terms. Monitoring exports to China has been challenging. The export of High-Performance Computers (HPCs) to tier III destinations, including China, is subject to terms and conditions specified by the export license. Monitoring the end-use of HPC exports in China is difficult due to close ties between Chinese state-owned enterprises and the military. The United States participates in the Wassenaar Arrangement (WA) on Dual-Use Goods and Munitions for controlling dual-use goods and technology. The WA dual-use control list aligns with U.S. CCL items subject to national security controls. The United States participates in four proliferation-related control regimes: the Australia Group, the Missile Technology Control Regime, and the Nuclear Suppliers Group. These groups have a common control list and member nations control exports under their own national laws, known as national discretion. Unlike CoCom, these organizations do not perform a review function prior to granting a national export license. The Wassenaar Arrangement and other proliferation-related control regimes pledge disclosure and consultation on export licensing decisions. Some groups have a \"no undercut\" provision, but operate by consensus with limited institutional structures. Critics argue that reliance on consensus hampers effectiveness, as it results in minimal reporting requirements and a level of control acceptable to all. The Wassenaar Arrangement and other control regimes have minimal reporting requirements and a level of control acceptable to all. Industry representatives emphasize the need for effective multilateral controls, especially regarding exports to China. There is no consensus among Wassenaar Arrangement countries on technology transfer limits to China. The debate over technology transfer limits to China within the Wassenaar Arrangement is ongoing. Industry spokesmen criticize the US for strict licensing policies towards China, while proponents of tighter export restrictions argue for stronger controls in line with America's historical leadership in export controls and non-proliferation efforts. The debate over technology transfer limits within the Wassenaar Arrangement continues. Advocates argue that the US must lead in strengthening export controls to persuade other nations to follow suit, as relying solely on consensus-based policies is ineffective and harmful to national security. Both industry representatives and proponents of heightened export controls agree on the need to enhance multilateral controls. The debate over technology transfer limits within the Wassenaar Arrangement continues. Advocates argue that the US must lead in strengthening export controls to persuade other nations to follow suit. There is a need to enhance multilateral controls, with consensus on restricting dual-use items to certain 'countries of concern' but disagreement on states like China. The export control dilemma arises from the lack of consensus on target countries, leading to the question of whether the US should impose controls unilaterally. This decision hinges on balancing non-proliferation goals with potential harm to American business. The dilemma in U.S. export control policy towards China is balancing economic benefits with national security risks. Some argue that current controls are too stringent and hinder technology transfers to China. Some argue that U.S. export controls have hindered technology transfers to China, leading Chinese companies to avoid involving U.S. firms in bids due to delays in the licensing process. This has resulted in U.S. firms losing out on crucial market opportunities, raising concerns about China's acquisition of dual-use technology. The Cox Commission found that China evaded export controls to obtain missile and satellite technology illegally. China has also been involved in nuclear, missile, and chemical proliferation activities. BIS published a final rule on export controls for China on June 19, 2007. The final rule includes a new licensing requirement for certain products for military end-use in China, a validated end-user program, and a requirement for an end-user statement for licensed products. The rule aims to address concerns about the export of commercial technology to certain end-users in China undermining arms embargoes. The new controls have raised questions about their scope and effectiveness, with two main components: military end-use controls for the PRC and a revised License Review Policy for national security controlled items. The new rule establishes military end-use controls on 20 product categories for exports to China, requiring a license if the items are intended for military use. The final rule establishes military end-use controls on certain items intended for military end-uses in the PRC, with a presumption of denial for items contributing to key weapons systems. It also increases the exemption threshold for obtaining End-Use Statements from MOFCOM. The PRC requires MOFCOM to issue an EUS before BIS can conduct checks for exports. The rule increases the exemption threshold to $50,000 but expands the EUS requirement to all license applications to the PRC at this threshold. Previously, EUS were only required for items under national security controls. The VEU program under the China Rule allows trusted PRC civilian end-users to receive items without a license if approved by BIS. The program sets up an application process for nomination and approval, evaluating compliance with export controls and recordkeeping requirements. China's Minister of Foreign Commerce announced that companies seeking VEU status must have authorization before inspections. Not all items on the CCL qualify for export under this program, and items controlled for crime control or missile technology do not qualify. Approved VEU applications must adhere to specific conditions. The VEU program allows approved companies to export specific items to validated end-users, with the list of items subject to approval by the ERC. Once approved, VEUs can import from any exporter. The program aims to streamline licensing processes for certain companies, freeing up resources for more complex applications. The program was expanded to eligible companies in India in 2007, including General Electric India. The VEU program expanded to India in 2007, with General Electric India being the first eligible company. In 2007, BIS announced the first five VEU companies, including AVIC I and HHNEC, importing goods worth $54.3 million in 2006. AVIC I and HHNEC were flagged for diversion risks due to their affiliations with government-owned companies. The Wisconsin Project raised concerns about companies in the VEU program having affiliations with Chinese military-linked entities and violating U.S. sanctions. BIS Undersecretary defended the companies, stating they have a history of using U.S. technology. Controversy over the VEU program persists. The GAO recommended suspending the VEU program with China due to the lack of inspection agreements and criteria for on-site reviews. Commerce conducted checks under a pre-existing verification system but it contradicts the trade facilitation rationale. On January 13, 2009, BIS announced full implementation of the VEU program to China, with procedures in place for secure operation. Representative Markey raised concerns about Aviza Technology China sharing an address with a state-owned firm sanctioned for illicit sales to Iran and Syria. The State Department in December 2006 sanctioned illicit sales to Iran and Syria. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) regulates dual-use exports, consulting with other agencies for input. The Defense Technology Security Agency conducts national security reviews for license applications, and the Department of Energy reviews dual-use license applications for nuclear uses. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission license nuclear materials. The Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) at the State Department administers the International Traffic in Arms Regulations for weapons and military technology exports. Industry leaders cite issues with overlapping jurisdiction and lengthy license approval times. The licensing system in the U.S. for export controls poses challenges for suppliers and manufacturers due to lengthy approval times, lack of reflection of technological advancements, and limited judicial review opportunities. Export administration officials claim to conduct thorough reviews, but others prioritize national security over foreign availability and economic impact considerations. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) must thoroughly review proposed export items, end users, and end uses to prevent sensitive technologies from falling into the wrong hands. Some analysts question whether BIS, housed within the Department of Commerce, may have an institutional bias towards granting exports due to the Commerce Department's focus on promoting exports and commercial interests. Some analysts question if the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) may have an institutional bias towards granting exports, potentially compromising national security goals. However, others argue that the Department of Defense's involvement in the process ensures unbiased decision-making."
