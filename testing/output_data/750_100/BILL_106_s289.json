    "content": "The \"Faith-Based Drug Treatment Enhancement Act\" allows for substance abuse prevention and treatment services to be provided through religious organizations under Title V of the Public Health Service Act. This includes designated programs that offer services through religious organizations. This part of the Act applies to programs providing Federal financial assistance for substance abuse prevention or treatment. It excludes awards for other purposes. Definitions are provided for clarity. The term 'designated award recipient' refers to an entity that has received an award under a specific program, either directly from the Federal Government (designated direct award) or as a subaward. A financial assistance award from a non-Federal entity may include Federal financial assistance from a designated program. Financial assistance can be in the form of a grant, cooperative agreement, contract, or voucherized assistance. Program beneficiaries are individuals who receive program services, while program participants are individuals involved in the program. The term 'program participant' refers to individuals involved in a designated program, while 'program services' include treatment for substance abuse or preventive services. 'Religious organization' is defined as a nonprofit religious organization, and 'voucherized assistance' is a system of selecting and reimbursing program services. The curr_chunk describes a system where beneficiaries are given a document to pay for program services, choose an organization to provide services, and the organization is reimbursed by the designated award recipient. The curr_chunk explains how program beneficiaries can choose a service provider to allocate program funds for services provided. SEC. 582. RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS AS PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS. Religious organizations have the authority to be designated award recipients, make subawards to other entities, provide program services through voucherized assistance, and be service providers under designated programs. The term 'program participant' refers to entities that have received a direct award or subaward, including religious organizations providing services through voucherized assistance without impairing their status. The Congress finds that social-welfare programs should not discriminate against faith-based providers of services or require them to compromise their religious character to participate in Federal programs. Religious organizations should not have to abandon their religious character or censor their expression to participate in Federal programs. They are eligible to participate on the same basis as any other nonprofit organization, and discrimination based on their religious character is prohibited. Religious organizations participating in Federal programs must maintain their independence from government control over their religious beliefs. They are not required to change their internal governance or remove religious symbols to be program participants. Religious organizations in Federal programs can maintain independence in their beliefs and practices. They may require employees to adhere to their religious beliefs while providing program services. Religious organizations in Federal programs can maintain independence in their beliefs and practices, including rules on drug and alcohol use. Program beneficiaries have the right to object to receiving services from a religious organization and can request services through an alternative provider if needed. Individuals receiving program services through an organization may be directed to alternative providers if the organization received a designated subaward or is providing services through voucherized assistance. Individuals may receive program services through alternative providers, ensuring the monetary value is not less than what they would have received from the religious organization. Nondiscrimination is required for religious organizations participating in the program. Religious organizations participating in program services cannot discriminate against beneficiaries based on religion. They may require active participation in religious activities and adherence to behavioral rules. Religious organizations receiving federal financial assistance must adhere to fiscal accountability regulations, including auditing principles, similar to other recipients. Limited audits may be allowed in certain cases. Limited audit may apply to a religious organization if they keep Federal funds separate from non-Federal funds. Judicial review of agency action can be sought by the organization for compliance with this section. SEC. 583 limits funds from designated programs to be used for sectarian worship or instruction, except when the beneficiary can choose where the assistance is used. SEC. 584 addresses the administration of programs and treatment of funds. Federal financial assistance under a designated program is considered aid to the beneficiary, not the organization providing services. State laws cannot prohibit the use of Federal funds in religious facilities or by religious organizations participating in the program. Federal funds must be segregated from State or local public funds if laws prevent their expenditure in religious facilities or by religious organizations participating in a designated program. SEC. 585 outlines educational requirements for personnel in drug treatment programs. The Congress finds that formal educational qualifications for counselors in drug treatment programs may hinder the provision of services. If a program participant imposes educational requirements, religious education must be considered. State or local government must recognize the importance of religious education and training for personnel in program services, giving equivalent credit to secular coursework. Discrimination requirements are restricted in this regard. The State or local government, as a program participant, can set educational qualifications for personnel in organizations providing program services that help reduce drug use among beneficiaries. The Secretary can waive educational requirements for religious organizations if deemed necessary. The Secretary can waive educational qualifications for religious organizations with a successful drug treatment record of at least 3 years, if the organization applies for a waiver and the government fails to prove the need for qualifications. The government failed to prove that educational qualifications are necessary for the successful operation of a drug treatment program."
