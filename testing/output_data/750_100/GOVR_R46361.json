    "content": "The report provides an overview of the FY2020 Defense Appropriations Act (P.L. 116-93) and serves as a gateway to other CRS products offering additional context and analysis related to the legislation. It tracks the legislative history, budgetary context, and treatment of major components of the Trump Administration's budget request, including weapons acquisition programs. The Trump Administration requested $750.0 billion for FY2020 in discretionary budget authority. The Trump Administration requested $750.0 billion in discretionary budget authority for national defense-related activities in FY2020. This included $718.3 billion for the military activities of the Department of Defense (DOD), with the balance for defense-related activities of the Energy Department and other agencies. Of the amount requested for DOD, $689.5 billion fell within the scope of the annual defense appropriations bill, along with $1.1 billion for certain expenses of the intelligence community. Military construction and family housing funding is provided by a separate appropriations bill for the Department of Veterans Affairs. The FY2020 Defense Appropriations Act, part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2020, provides $687.8 billion for DOD, $2.86 billion less than requested by President Trump. Funding for TRICARE for Life program is not included in the defense bill. Since 2001, DOD has organized its budget requests to designate funding for activities related to the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks or distinct from regular costs to equip U.S. armed forces. Non-base budget funds have been designated as Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) since 2009. The OCO designation gained significance after the Budget Control Act of 2011 set annual caps on defense spending. The OCO designation for discretionary spending has become significant, exempting funds from spending caps. In FY2020, $97.9 billion was designated as OCO funding to avoid exceeding the defense spending cap. The OCO funding in FY2020 was designated to avoid exceeding the defense spending cap. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 raised the cap to $666.5 billion, rendering the issue moot. Separate versions of the FY2020 defense appropriations bill were reported by the House and Senate Committees. The House passed H.R. 2740 on June 19, 2019. The House passed H.R. 2740 on June 19, 2019 by a vote of 226-203. The Senate committee reported S. 2474 on September 12, 2019, but no action was taken. A compromise version of the defense bill was incorporated into H.R. 1158, which was passed by both chambers. The President's FY2020 budget request for DOD reflects a strategic emphasis shift based on the 2018 National Defense Strategy. The FY2020 budget request for DOD reflects a strategic shift in emphasis towards countering evolving threats from China and Russia, aligning with the 2018 National Defense Strategy. This marks a departure from the focus on containing communism during the Cold War era. After the Cold War, U.S. policies shifted towards countering regional aggressors like Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, while also recalibrating relations with China and Russia. Following 9/11, the focus turned to countering terrorism in the Middle East and addressing North Korean and Iranian nuclear programs. The U.S. and its allies maintained military superiority as a legacy of the Cold War. The 2014 Russian invasion of Crimea and China's militarization of islands in the South China Sea renewed concerns about aggressive regimes, highlighting national security priorities for the U.S. and Europe. The events in 2014, such as the Russian invasion of Crimea and China's militarization of islands in the South China Sea, emphasized the importance of competing with other great powers in the U.S. national security agenda. Challenges from the end of the Cold War, like fragile states, genocide, terrorism, and nuclear proliferation, continue to pose serious threats to U.S. interests. Adversaries may be collaborating to achieve shared objectives, using social and economic tools, and working with non-state proxies like militias, criminal networks, corporations, and hackers. The Trump Administration's National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy focus on great power competition with China and Russia, blurring the lines between conventional and irregular conflict, and managing numerous security challenges posed by proxies like militias, criminal networks, corporations, and hackers. The National Defense Strategy (NDS) emphasizes great power competition with China and Russia, highlighting the need to bolster the competitive advantage of U.S. forces. It acknowledges the erosion of this advantage in recent decades and the increased contestation of military objectives. The Trump Administration's strategic orientation aligns with the NDS and National Security Strategy, focusing on countering Chinese and Russian threats. The NDS identifies five significant external threats to U.S. interests: China, Russia, North Korea, Iran, and terrorist groups. The new strategy prioritizes maintaining a competitive edge over China and Russia, known as the \"2+3\" strategy. Since the end of U.S. military involvement in Vietnam, federal government spending has increased significantly, with mandatory spending for entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid growing the fastest. Congressional budgeting in the past decade has been influenced by the Budget Control Act of 2011, aimed at controlling federal spending through sequestration if discretionary spending budgets are not met. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established annual limits to reduce federal discretionary spending through FY2021 by $1.0 trillion, with sequestration allowing for automatic cancellation of appropriations to meet the caps on defense and nondefense discretionary budget authority. The caps on defense-related spending apply to DOD and defense-related activities, but not to funding designated by Congress and the president. The Budget Control Act of 2011 set annual limits to reduce federal discretionary spending through FY2021. The caps on defense spending do not apply to emergency or OCO funding. Despite repeated legislation to raise the caps, the defense cap for FY2020 remained at $576 billion, $71 billion lower than the revised cap for FY2019. To avoid an 11% reduction in defense spending, the Administration's FY2020 base budget request adhered to the binding defense cap. Additionally, $165 billion was designated as OCO funding in the FY2020 request, with $98 billion exempt from the cap. The FY2020 budget included $165 billion in OCO funding, with $98 billion intended for base budget purposes. The House and Senate Committees disregarded this tactic and considered all funding for base budget purposes. P.L. 116-93 funds a modest increase in active-duty military personnel but includes a reduction of 7,500 in the Army's end-strength due to not meeting goals in FY2018. The FY2020 budget included $165 billion in OCO funding, with $98 billion for base budget purposes. P.L. 116-93 funds a 3.1% increase in military basic pay effective January 1, 2020, and appropriates $61.7 million for DOD's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office. The SVC program provides legal counsel to alleged victims of sexual assault in the military justice system. Additionally, $3.0 million was allocated for a pilot program to treat military personnel for PTSD related to sexual trauma. P.L. 116-93 added $110 million to the DOD's childcare program, the largest in the US, serving 23,000 employees and nearly 200,000 children of service members and DOD civilians. The act P.L. 116-93 added $110 million to the DOD's childcare program, supporting nearly 200,000 children of service members and DOD civilians. It requires the Secretary of Defense to provide Congress with a detailed report on plans to increase childcare capacity and prioritize construction requirements. The budget also prioritizes modernization of nuclear and long-range strike weapons. The Trump Administration's FY2020 budget prioritizes modernizing the nuclear triad, focusing on ballistic missile-launching submarines, long-range bombers, and land-based ICBMs. The budget also supports developing hypersonic missiles with conventional warheads that can travel at speeds five times the speed of sound. These hypersonic weapons can maneuver throughout most of their flight path. Hypersonic weapons, funded by DOD since the early 2000s, are a priority due to China and Russia's development. Congress supports funding to accelerate the U.S. hypersonic program, including defenses against hypersonic missiles. These weapons are difficult to detect. The enacted FY2020 defense bill added $100 million to create a Joint Hypersonics Transition Office to coordinate hypersonic R&D programs across DOD. Concerns were raised about potential duplication of effort and increased costs in hypersonic weapons development. P.L. 116-93 supported the Administration's proposals to strengthen defenses against hypersonic missiles. The enacted FY2020 defense bill supported the Administration's proposals to strengthen defenses against ballistic missile attacks, reflecting recommendations from the Missile Defense Review. P.L. 116-93 shifted funds among components to defend U.S. territory against ICBMs. The FY2020 defense bill reallocates funds to develop an improved interceptor missile to replace the Ground-Based Interceptors (GBIs) and its kill vehicle. It also includes funding for additional GBI missiles, support equipment, and research to enhance GBI reliability. The bill supports the Administration's funding requests. The FY2020 defense bill supports the Administration's funding requests for military space satellites and satellite launches. Congress approved $40.0 million for the newly created Space Force, which was 44% less than requested due to insufficient justification provided by DOD. The Explanatory Statement directed the Secretary of the Air Force to provide a month-by-month spending plan. The FY2020 defense bill supported the Administration's funding requests for military space satellites and satellite launches. It directed the Secretary of the Air Force to provide a month-by-month spending plan for Space Force O&M funding. The act also backed the Army's plan to upgrade ground-combat vehicles, including increasing the firepower of the Stryker troop-carrier with a 30 mm cannon. The Army plans to develop new combat capabilities by reallocating funds from existing upgrade programs for legacy systems like Bradley fighting vehicles and CH-47 Chinook helicopters. This will delay upgrades to these systems to prioritize investments in new technologies. The enacted bill provides less funding than requested for Bradley upgrades. The enacted bill provides less funding than requested for Bradley upgrades, with $223.0 million cut labeled as \"excess to need.\" However, it nearly triples the amount requested for the Chinook upgrade, appropriating $46.2 million instead of $18.2 million. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees had challenged the amounts in their respective versions of the bill. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees challenged the Army's plan to forego upgrades to the CH-47 fleet. The enacted bill provided less funding for the Optionally-Manned Fighting Vehicle program, leading to its cancellation by the Army. The Army canceled the OMFV contracting plan and restarted it with new design parameters in January 2020. The budget request for major aviation programs was generally supported by P.L. 116-93, but there were potential disagreements between Congress and the Army regarding the planned upgrade of the CH-47 Chinook helicopter. The Army aims to curtail programs to free up funds for a modernization strategy announced in late 2019. The Army aims to free up funds for its modernization strategy by truncating the planned procurement of improved \"Block II\" CH-47s. The FY2020 defense bill provided $46.2 million for the program, while $985.5 million was allocated for eight F-15s to address Air Force fighter strength gaps. The FY2020 defense bill allocated $364.4 million for two F-15s to be used for testing, shifting funds from the Air Force's Research and Development account. The Secretary of the Air Force is directed to provide a review of options for reducing the Air Force's fighter shortfall. P.L. 116-93 also supports major elements of the Navy's shipbuilding budget request. The Navy's shipbuilding budget request aligns with a plan to increase the fleet to 355 ships. The request includes funds for large unmanned surface and subsurface ships. The budget act deviated by denying $3.2 billion for a Virginia-class submarine and reallocating $1.4 billion of those funds. The Navy's shipbuilding budget request includes funds for large unmanned surface and subsurface ships. The budget act denied $3.2 billion for a Virginia-class submarine, reallocating $1.4 billion to other funded ships for incorporating the Virginia Payload Module. Additionally, $1.2 billion was provided for specialized ships and a landing craft to support amphibious landings by Marine Corps units.
