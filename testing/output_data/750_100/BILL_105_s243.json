The Airport and Airway Trust Fund financing rate is set to zero for specific tax periods. Before certain dates, a floor stocks tax of 17.5 cents per gallon is imposed on aviation fuel held by any person on the tax-increase date. The liability for the tax and method of payment are outlined, with the tax to be paid as prescribed by the Secretary. The tax imposed on a tax-increase date must be paid by the first day of the 7th month after that date. Definitions include \"the Code\" referring to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, \"tax-increase date\" as 7 days after the enactment of the Act, and \"aviation fuel.\" The term \"aviation fuel\" is defined by section 4093 of the Code. Aviation fuel is considered held by a person if title has passed to that person. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate. The tax on aviation fuel does not apply to fuel held exclusively for certain uses on the tax-increase date. On the tax-increase date, no tax is imposed on aviation fuel held by a person if the amount does not exceed 2,000 gallons, and a credit or refund is allowable for aviation fuel purchased after the tax-increase date for that use.

Additionally, individuals must provide required information to the Secretary for tax purposes, and fuel exempt from tax is not considered for this provision. Controlled groups, specifically corporations, are subject to specific regulations under this paragraph. All persons in a controlled group are treated as one group, with the definition of a controlled group based on ownership of more than 50 percent instead of 80 percent as per tax regulations. Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, principles similar to those for a controlled group with ownership over 80 percent apply to a group of persons under common control where not all are corporations. All provisions of law, including penalties, apply to the taxes imposed. The penalties applicable to taxes imposed by section 4091 of the Code also apply to floor stock taxes imposed by paragraph (1) to the same extent. The amendments made by this section take effect 7 days after the date of enactment of this Act. Taxes imposed by sections 4261 and 4271 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 do not apply to amounts paid for transportation using tickets purchased during a lapse period. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 exemptions for taxable transportation payments do not apply after December 31, 1996, and before the effective date of the amendments. The amendment to Section 9502(b) of the Code states that any tax amount received in the Treasury after specific dates shall be treated as received the day before such date. This amendment applies to amounts received after December 31, 1995."
