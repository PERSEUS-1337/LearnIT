    "content": "The Financial Services and General Government (FSGG) appropriations bill funds independent agencies in Title V, which manage federal property, regulate financial institutions, and oversee mail delivery. The bill also covers general provisions in Title VII and Cuba sanctions in Title I, along with funding for the Department of the Treasury, Executive Office of the President, and judiciary. The Financial Services and General Government (FSGG) appropriations bill funds various agencies including the Executive Office of the President, judiciary, and District of Columbia. It focuses on mandatory retirement accounts and general provisions for FSGG agencies. The bill also addresses financial regulation issues in additional titles but does not fund many financial regulatory agencies. The current form of the FSGG bill has been in place since the 2007 reorganization of the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. The House and Senate FSGG bills fund various agencies, including the CFTC. President Trump's FY2018 budget requested approximately $3.1 billion for independent agencies, with $330 million allocated to the CFTC. The House Committee on Appropriations reported the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2018 (H.R. 3280, H.Rept. 115-234) on July 18, 2017. The bill included $253 million for FSGG independent agencies and $248 million for the CFTC in the Agriculture appropriations bill (H.R. 3268, H.Rept. 115-232). The total funding of $501 million was significantly lower than the President's FY2018 request, with most of the difference in GSA funding. Division D of H.R. 3354 included most of H.R. 3280 when considered by the House of Representatives on September 6, 2017. The House of Representatives considered H.R. 3354 on September 6, 2017, amending the bill multiple times. Funding for FSGG independent agencies totaled $488 million after amendments, with decreases in GSA funding and increases in SBA funding. The bill passed the House on September 14, 2017. The Senate Committee on Appropriations released a recommended FSGG draft bill on November 20, 2017, with funding totaling $593 million, $2.5 billion below the President's FY2018 request. The House of Representatives passed H.R. 3354 with amendments, resulting in $488 million funding for FSGG agencies. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended a draft bill with $593 million funding, $2.5 billion below the President's FY2018 request. Congress passed H.R. 601 / P.L. 115-56, providing continuing appropriations through December 8, 2017, with anomalies focusing on decreasing funding for the presidential transition.

Table 1 and Table 2 provide details on the status of FSGG appropriations measures and the amounts requested and enacted for FY2018. The FSGG appropriations bill provides funding for independent agencies overseeing various functions. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulates derivatives markets. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is responsible for overseeing derivatives markets, including futures exchanges and swaps markets. Its functions include registration and supervision of industry personnel, prevention of fraud and price manipulation, and investor protection. Congressional authorization jurisdiction remains with the House and Senate Agriculture Committees due to the market's historical origins. Following the financial crisis of 2008, reforms in the Dodd-Frank Act brought previously unregulated over-the-counter swaps markets under CFTC jurisdiction. This expanded the CFTC's oversight to include futures, options, and economically significant swaps. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded CFTC oversight to include swaps markets with a $240 trillion notional value in the US. The CFTC also oversees futures and options markets with a $34 trillion notional value. Funding for the CFTC in FY2018 was $249 million. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is a federal agency focused on reducing consumer harm from various products. It sets safety standards, collaborates with industries, bans unsafe products, monitors recalls, educates consumers, conducts research, and collects data on product hazards. It also works with state and local governments to establish uniform regulations. The Trump Administration requested $123 million in appropriations for the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) in FY2018, $3 million less than FY2017. The reduction included cuts to the Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa Safety Act's grant program and salaries/expenses due to a decrease in full-time employees. The CPSC's budget request would be allocated among four strategic goals. The Trump Administration requested $123 million for the CPSC in FY2018, with allocations for workforce development, product safety, hazard response, and communication. $1.3 million was designated for new VGBPSA grants against the Administration's wishes. The House Appropriations Committee expects the CPSC to maintain the FY2017 level of grant funding in FY2018 at $1.3 million. The committee advised against adopting two proposed rules, one on voluntary recalls for small firms and the other on public disclosure of product hazards. The bill included two administrative provisions, one of which would prevent the CPSC from finalizing a proposed rule on recreational off-highway vehicle safety until a study by the National Academy of Sciences is completed. The Senate draft bill allocated $123 million for the CPSC, while P.L. 115-141 provided $126 million for the CPSC. Section 502 aimed to halt the finalization of a rule on blade saw injuries.

The Department of Justice enforces HAVA, and the President's FY2018 budget requested $9.2 million for the EAC, with $1.5 million allocated to the National Institute of Standards and Technology for voting testing guidelines. The EAC received funding from H.R. 3354 and P.L. 115-141, with $1.5 million allocated to NIST for election reform activities. The Senate draft bill proposed $9.2 million for the EAC.

The FCC has the authority to review and adjust these fees annually. The FCC requested a budget of $322 million for FY2018, derived from regulatory fees. The House and Senate bills both appropriated $322 million, with a cap for spectrum auction administration. P.L. 115-141 also included $600 million for the TV broadcaster relocation fund. The FDIC is funded through deposit insurance funds.

Approximately 90% of the agency's budget is expected to fund salaries, benefits, IT, and facilities expenses. Other sections of the FSGG legislation contained provisions related to campaign finance policy. The House-passed version includes provisions prohibiting SEC rules on political contribution disclosure, enforcing a FECA provision on trade association solicitation, and reporting political contributions for government contracts. P.L. 115-141 allocated $71.25 million for the FEC. The enacted law included provisions from the House-passed version, allocating $71.25 million for the FEC. The Federal Trade Commission's primary responsibilities are to protect consumers and maintain competition by enforcing laws and educating stakeholders. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is responsible for issuing regulations, educating consumers and business owners, and ensuring competition in markets. The agency's funding comes from direct appropriations, premerger filing fees, and Do-Not-Call Registry fees. In FY2017, direct appropriations accounted for 53.3% of the FTC's budget. In FY2018, the FTC's budget request included $178.6 million in direct appropriations, $112.7 million in HSR filing fees, and $15 million in DNC registry fees, totaling $306.3 million. This was $6.7 million less than the FY2017 enacted amount, with a $5 million cut in salaries and expenses due to a projected decrease in full-time staff. H.R. 3354 as passed by the House would have appropriated $164.3 million in direct appropriations, $126 million from HSR filing fees, and $16 million from DNC registry fees for the FTC in FY2018.
