    "content": "Regulation is a fundamental government function, with federal agencies issuing thousands of rules annually on various topics. The costs of complying with these regulations are not included in the federal budget process, prompting some policymakers to consider measuring total regulatory costs and benefits. For example, the Congressional Office of Regulatory Analysis Creation and Sunset and Review Act of 2011 aims to require an annual report on regulatory costs and benefits. The Congressional Office of Regulatory Analysis Creation and Sunset and Review Act of 2011 would establish an office to issue an annual report on the total costs and benefits of existing Federal regulations. However, measuring these costs and benefits is challenging due to the need to determine baselines and aggregate results from studies conducted with different methodologies. The Office of Advocacy within the Small Business Administration released a report in September 2010 stating that the annual cost of federal regulations in 2008 was about $1.75 trillion. This was the fourth report prepared for the SBA Office of Advocacy in the previous 15 years. In the previous 15 years, estimates of annual federal regulatory costs ranged from $416 billion to $1.75 trillion. The $1.75 trillion estimate has been widely cited as evidence for regulatory reform legislation and oversight actions, although some critics argue it overstates the total cost of regulations. The $1.75 trillion estimate of federal regulatory costs in 2008 by Crain and Crain has been criticized for overstating the total cost. It includes economic regulations, environmental regulations, tax compliance, and regulations for safety and security. The estimated cost of economic regulations in 2008 was more than 70% of the total regulatory costs, according to the Crain and Crain report. Economic regulations impact businesses by affecting what products and services they produce, how they produce them, and how they are priced and marketed. These regulations also influence domestic and international business operations, including quotas and tariffs on foreign imports. The Crain and Crain report estimated that economic regulations in 2008 accounted for over 70% of total regulatory costs. These regulations impact businesses by affecting production, pricing, and marketing of products and services, as well as domestic and international operations, including quotas and tariffs on foreign imports. The report used the Worldwide Governance Index (WGI) of regulatory quality to measure governments' ability to implement policies that promote private sector development. In 2008, the WGI regulatory quality index score for the United States was +1.579. Crain and Crain used regression analysis to determine the impact of changes in the regulatory quality index on real GDP per capita, holding constant four other variables. Crain and Crain found that a one-unit change in the WGI regulatory quality index corresponded to a 9.4% change in real GDP per capita. The difference between the US regulatory quality index in 2008 and the maximum value of +2.5 resulted in an 8.7% reduction in GDP due to economic regulations. This reduction affected the real GDP per capita in the United States, which was approximately $14.2 trillion in 2008. The regulatory quality index in the United States in 2008, as determined by Kaufmann, Kraay, and Mastruzzi, was aggregated from six expert-based measures and two surveys. The Economist Intelligence Unit scored it at 0.70 based on 16 factors. This index reduction led to a $1.236 trillion decrease in real GDP per capita. Global Insight Business Conditions and Risk Indicators scored at 0.94, based on judgment of 16 factors including tax effectiveness and legislation. The score reflects experts' assessment on tax collection efficiency and presence of necessary business laws. The Global Insight Global Risk Service scored at 0.95, based on experts' judgment of factors like export and import regulations, business ownership restrictions. The Heritage Foundation Index of Economic Freedom scored at 0.73, described as a nongovernmental research institute in Washington, US. The Heritage Foundation is a conservative institute in Washington, US, advocating for public policies. It is scored based on factors like foreign investment and banking/finance. The Institutional Profiles Database and Political Risk Services International Country Risk Guide also provide scores based on various factors related to business competition and market regulations. Political Risk Services International Country Risk Guide (scored at 1.00) is a commercial business information provider based in Syracuse, New York. The score is determined by experts' judgment on the \"investment profile\" factor, summarizing the investment environment. The regulatory quality index is developed using two surveys: Institute for Management and Development World Competitiveness Yearbook (scored at 0.50) from Lausanne, Switzerland, based on a survey of business people. The World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report, with a score of 0.62, is based on a survey of business people in the United States. The survey assesses factors like protectionism, access to capital markets, corporate taxes, labor regulations, and ease of starting a business. The World Economic Forum is an international organization headquartered in Switzerland. The survey asked firms about their views on administrative regulations, tax system, import barriers, competition, ease of starting a company, anti-monopoly policy, and environmental regulations. Some question the accuracy of WGI indices, but the authors have addressed concerns. The World Bank Development Research Group published a detailed description of how the WGI indices were developed, noting their correlation with an OECD index of economic regulations. Crain and Crain used the WGI regulatory quality index in their study for its broader coverage and use of multiple sources and dimensions. The WGI authors stated that indices like the regulatory quality index are useful as a first tool. The authors highlighted the usefulness of indices like the regulatory quality index for broad cross-country comparisons and trends over time. However, they cautioned that these indices may not be precise enough for specific governance reforms in individual country contexts. They emphasized the need for more detailed and country-specific data to identify relevant constraints on governance. The accuracy of Crain and Crain's estimate of the cost of economic regulations depends on factors like the use of the WGI index of \"regulatory quality.\" The authors discussed the use of the WGI index of \"regulatory quality\" in measuring economic regulations. Aart Kraay from the World Bank provided his views on this matter, stating that while the exercise could make sense, he believed there were fundamental issues with its interpretation. Aart Kraay from the World Bank criticized the interpretation of the regulatory quality index, stating that it measures perceptions of the regulatory environment's overall quality, not just stringency. He pointed out that the United States ranks high on the index, with countries like Finland and Sweden ahead. Aart Kraay from the World Bank criticized the interpretation of the regulatory quality index, stating that it measures perceptions of the regulatory environment's overall quality. He noted that countries like Finland and Sweden rank higher than the United States on regulatory quality. Kraay also highlighted issues with the WGI indicators, mentioning imprecision in country rankings and potential misinterpretation of units by comparing scores. Aart Kraay from the World Bank criticized the interpretation of the regulatory quality index, stating that it measures perceptions of the regulatory environment's overall quality. He suggested comparing the US score on RQ with that of a country with a preferred regulatory environment to calibrate the costs of regulations. The highest numbers on WGI-RQ in 2009 are around 1.8 for countries like Singapore and Denmark, with the US at around 1.4. Aart Kraay suggested comparing the US score on RQ with a country like Denmark to calibrate the costs of regulations. Kraay mentioned minor revisions to WGI data, explaining discrepancies in values cited. Using 2008 data, Ireland had the highest regulatory quality index at +1.915, while the United States had a value of 1.579. The difference between the two suggests a 3.16% reduction in GDP based on regression analysis findings by Crain and Crain. The regulatory quality index suggests a 3.16% reduction in GDP in the United States compared to Ireland, with a monetary cost of about $448 billion. Kraay expressed concerns about the quality of the regression analysis by Crain and Crain. The high correlation between regulatory quality and GDP per capita makes it difficult to determine the true impact of the regulatory environment on economic output. Perfectly controlling for all other correlated factors is nearly impossible, leading to econometric estimates reflecting not just regulation effects but also other policies. Crain and Crain acknowledged this challenge when contacted by CRS for comment. Crain and Crain defended their regulatory quality index, stating that empirical evidence supports its ability to reflect changes in regulation stringency. They highlighted the index's capture of various stakeholders' perceptions and the nature of questions used to construct it. They also mentioned not comparing the US to other countries like Denmark. The Crain and Crain report defended their regulatory quality index, citing empirical evidence supporting its ability to reflect changes in regulation stringency. They explained their decision not to compare the US to other countries like Denmark and clarified their interpretation of the WGI measure. The report was peer-reviewed by economists before publication. The study was peer-reviewed by economists Bob Litan and Richard Williams. Litan found the study \"terrific\" with no additional comments, while Williams praised it as a \"great project\" but expressed concerns about the accuracy of the index of regulatory quality in estimating costs of economic regulations. Williams expressed concerns about the accuracy of the Regulatory Quality Index in estimating costs of economic regulations, suggesting that it may overstate or underestimate the total costs. He recommended a better explanation of the index to avoid overestimating costs. In February 2011, the Center for Progressive Reform criticized the Crain and Crain study on economic regulatory costs and requested that SBA's Office of Advocacy withdraw its sponsorship. CPR highlighted concerns about the lack of clarity in defining \"economic regulations\" and the misuse of the regulatory quality index. The Crain and Crain report analyzed data for 25 OECD countries to assess the impact of economic regulations on GDP per capita. The report raised concerns about the lack of a clear definition of \"economic regulations\" and the simplistic relationship assumed between regulatory \"stringency\" and GDP. It also falsely implied that the United States has a low index of regulatory quality, despite ranking 11th out of over 200 countries. Economists believe a country's standard of living is influenced by factors like natural resources, labor, capital, technology, and trade opportunities. Government interventions such as taxes and regulations can also impact the standard of living. The relationship between GDP per capita and regulatory quality index is analyzed, controlling for country population, foreign trade, primary education, and fixed broadband subscribers. The control variables may not capture all factors affecting GDP per capita, and alternative measures may be more suitable. The Crain and Crain report did not address these concerns. The Crain and Crain report analyzed the relationship between GDP per capita and regulatory quality index, using control variables like country population, foreign trade, primary education, and fixed broadband subscribers. They used a non-standard estimation strategy and examined cross-country panel data sets. The report did not discuss the selection of control variables or address concerns about their adequacy. The Crain and Crain report used a unique two-stage estimation strategy to analyze the relationship between GDP per capita and regulatory quality index. They omitted statistically insignificant control variables from their reported results. The sensitivity of their findings was tested by CRS, which found that the regulatory quality index had no significant impact. The regulatory quality index had no discernable independent effect on GDP per capita, suggesting sensitivity to control variables. Economists believe economic regulation can impact a country's standard of living, but effects may be subtle for a seven-year cross-country panel to detect due to slow regulatory evolution and interaction with other public policy instruments. The authors developed cost estimates for environmental regulations following OMB's approach. They used OMB's estimate of environmental costs from its 2001 report, converted into 2001 dollars. The authors estimated that environmental regulations cost between $175 billion and $280 billion in 2009 by converting cost estimates from 2001 dollars to 2009 dollars. They used OMB's approach and only considered the $280 billion estimate for the cumulative cost of all regulations. Crain and Crain estimated that environmental regulations cost between $175 billion and $280 billion in 2009. They used the upper-end estimate of $280 billion, citing a lack of cost estimates for important regulations and conservative government agencies. Their data included academic and agency estimates of costs for rules prior to 1988 and major rules issued from 1999 to 2008. The unit of analysis for regulations varies between years, with different methodologies used. OMB criticized the approach of summarizing total costs and benefits by combining individual studies due to varying quality, assumptions, and lack of analysis on interaction effects among regulations. The cost estimates used by Crain and Crain overlap in some years, potentially leading to double counting of regulatory costs. In two one-year periods, there were inaccuracies in recording environmental regulatory costs from the OMB. The authors inaccurately recorded OMB's estimates of environmental regulatory costs for certain periods, with discrepancies in the reported figures. Additionally, they failed to include OMB's estimates of the benefits of environmental regulations. The authors inaccurately recorded OMB's estimates of environmental regulatory costs for certain periods, with discrepancies in the reported figures. They also failed to include OMB's estimates of the benefits of environmental regulations. Overall, the estimated benefits of environmental rules were higher than the estimated costs in most time periods, with only one exception. The authors assumed OMB's coverage of environmental regulations was complete and used only the upper estimate of environmental costs due to a belief that cost estimates were lacking for some regulations. Regulatory experts have also noted OMB's conservative approach to estimating regulatory costs. Several regulatory experts have concluded that OMB environmental cost estimates are often overestimated, with a debate ongoing. Studies suggest that government agencies tend to overestimate benefits and underestimate costs. The Center for Progressive Reform criticized agencies for relying on industry-provided estimates, which may be inflated to overstate costs. The Center for Progressive Reform (CPR) criticized industry cost estimates for overestimating costs and not considering technological innovations that reduce compliance costs. CPR cited studies showing agencies' initial cost estimates are often too high and questioned the use of outdated studies by Crain and Crain to estimate environmental regulation costs. OMB responded to comments on its report to Congress on regulations, acknowledging the theory that agency estimates may understate costs and overstate benefits due to agency self-interest in regulation. While this view is supported theoretically, there is little documentation available to support it, possibly due to offsetting factors such as data sources from regulated entities. The regulated entities may overstate costs to deter regulations, while competitive firms often find cost-effective ways to comply. Agencies tend to overestimate program benefits due to technological progress. Technological progress has reduced the expected benefits of earlier regulations. Crain and Crain estimated that businesses, individuals, and nonprofits spent about 4.3 billion burden hours on tax paperwork in 2008. Crain and Crain estimated that businesses, individuals, and nonprofits spent about 4.3 billion burden hours on tax paperwork in 2008, costing a total of approximately $159.6 billion. They did not specify how they gathered data for this estimate. In 2008, the government-wide paperwork burden was about 9.71 billion burden hours, with the Department of the Treasury accounting for 7.78 billion burden hours. The IRS represented about 77.8% of the government-wide estimate, totaling about 7.5 billion burden hours. The Crain and Crain report on IRS burden hours is unclear in certain aspects, such as assumptions about who completes tax paperwork and where hourly rates were derived. Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows tax preparers earn an average of $17.34 per hour. The average salary for tax preparers is $17.34 per hour, with a median salary of $14.45 per hour. Assuming total compensation is one-third higher, the average compensation would be just over $23 per hour. Multiplying 7.5 billion burden hours by $23 per hour results in a total cost of about $172.5 billion, $12.9 billion higher than the Crain and Crain estimate. The inclusion of tax paperwork in regulatory cost estimates is a threshold issue. The debate revolves around whether tax paperwork should be considered in estimates of regulatory costs. OMB excludes tax paperwork from its reports to Congress, stating that filling out tax forms is a result of the tax code itself. John D. Graham from OIRA highlighted that IRS paperwork burden is largely driven by statute. The IRS paperwork burden is primarily driven by the complexities of the Tax Code, which requires collecting a significant amount of information for taxpayer compliance. Congress passing numerous tax laws has led to increased reporting and recordkeeping requirements, adding to taxpayer burden. The IRS had to adjust 1040 schedules to implement the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 increased taxpayer burden by 47 million hours. Factors like economic and population growth also contribute to IRS burden hours. The final category of regulatory costs includes workplace regulations on safety and health. The authors estimated the cost of occupational safety and health regulations, including homeland security regulations, using data from various studies and reports. The total cost was more than $64.3 billion in 2009 dollars, with additional costs from 2001 to 2008 totaling $471 million. The authors estimated the total cost for occupational safety and health regulations and homeland security costs in 2008 to be about $75.2 billion. They obtained the estimate for occupational safety and health regulatory costs between 2001 and 2008 from OMB's 2009 report to Congress. The authors estimated the total cost for occupational safety and health regulations in 2008 to be between $362 million and $389 million. The costs were obtained from OMB's 2009 report to Congress, with a possible issue of double counting. Converting the estimate to 2009 dollars yields a range of $440 million to $471 million. The authors estimated homeland security regulations cost between $5.1 billion to $10.4 billion annually, based on OMB's 2009 report. They may have used the upper-end of the estimated cost range. The authors used the upper-end of OMB's estimates for environmental rules, reflecting a judgment that cost estimates were absent for important regulations. The Center for Progressive Reform's analysis suggested that occupational safety and health cost estimates likely overstate true compliance costs. The Center for Progressive Reform (CPR) criticized the Johnson study for inflating OSHA's cost estimates and including fines for violations as regulatory costs. CPR argued that this logic allows opponents to argue for reducing regulations based on increased costs from fines. In 2005, W. Mark Crain estimated federal regulatory costs in 2004 at $1.11 trillion. By 2010, the costs in 2008 were estimated at $1.75 trillion, with a $639 billion increase. The main reason for the increase was a change in methodology. Excluding economic regulations, the total estimated cost of other regulations would have decreased by $6 billion between 2004 and 2008. Between 2004 and 2008, federal regulatory costs increased from $1.11 trillion to $1.75 trillion, with a $639 billion rise mainly due to a change in methodology. Excluding economic regulations, other regulatory costs would have decreased by about $6 billion. Congress has required OMB to submit annual reports on the costs and benefits of federal regulations for nearly 15 years. In 2001, the Regulatory Right-to-Know Act mandated OMB to report on regulatory costs and benefits in the President's budget, detailing costs and benefits of federal rules and paperwork by agency and major rule. The Regulatory Right-to-Know Act mandated OMB to report on regulatory costs and benefits in the President's budget, detailing costs and benefits of federal rules and paperwork by agency and major rule. The accounting statement must include an analysis of the impacts of federal regulation on state, local, and tribal governments, small businesses, wages, and economic growth. OMB provided varying estimates of total regulatory costs and benefits in its reports, with estimates ranging from $170 billion to $298 billion. The OMB estimated regulatory costs at $146 billion to $229 billion in 1996 dollars as of 1999, with benefits ranging from $254 billion to nearly $1.8 trillion. This marked a significant drop from previous estimates, largely due to the inclusion of EPA's Clean Air Act benefits, which raised the estimate by a factor of 12. Many questioned the accuracy of the EPA estimate, as it had a small probability of being correct. The OMB estimated regulatory costs at $146 billion to $229 billion in 1996 dollars as of 1999, with benefits ranging from $254 billion to nearly $1.8 trillion. The drop in the upper-bound benefits estimate was mainly due to a significant decrease in the EPA's Clean Air Act benefits estimate. OMB presented its cost and benefit estimates each year with strong caveats, acknowledging the difficulty in estimating the total costs and benefits of all federal regulations accurately. The OMB highlighted methodological problems in measuring total costs and benefits of Federal regulation, including unclear baselines and difficulty in attributing costs or benefits to regulations. Regulatory requirements becoming standard business practices further complicate accurate estimation. The OMB highlighted methodological challenges in measuring total costs and benefits of Federal regulations, including difficulties in attributing costs or benefits accurately. Aggregating results from different studies is problematic due to variations in quality and methodology. Uncertainty exists in determining which rules should be included in estimating regulatory costs and benefits. Transfer rules, such as crop subsidy payments, were not included in OMB's estimates of total regulatory costs. The OMB excluded transfer rules and costs associated with tax paperwork from its estimates of total regulatory costs. It also did not include rules published after 1987 without cost-benefit analyses. The OMB's \"Regulatory Right-to-Know Act\" reports have shown differences since 2001. OMB's \"Regulatory Right-to-Know Act\" reports since 2001 have not included cost or benefit estimates for all rules, only focusing on regulations with costs or benefits of at least $100 million annually that were reviewed within a specific time-frame. The total cost of these rules reviewed from April 1, 1995, to September 30, 2001, was approximately $50 billion. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provided cost and benefit estimates for regulations reviewed from October 1992 to September 2002. The total costs ranged from $37 billion to $43 billion, with benefits ranging from $146 billion to $230 billion. EPA rules accounted for a significant portion of the benefits. Each report since 2003 has included information on rules. In its 2002 report, OMB decided to present data for only certain rules during a limited time-frame due to the inconsistent and aged nature of many studies used for aggregate estimates. OMB stated that estimates of costs and benefits of regulations issued over ten years ago are unreliable for informing current policy decisions. Therefore, OMB chose not to reproduce aggregate estimates for all 107 rules. The report decided not to reproduce aggregate estimates from the draft report, stating that total costs and benefits of federal rules could be significantly larger. OMB emphasized the unreliability of estimates for rules adopted over ten years ago, as mentioned by John D. Graham in testimony before the House Committee on Government Reform in July 2003. The Crain and Hopkins estimate of $843 billion in regulatory impact is not considered accurate for regulatory accounting. It was produced in 2001 for the Small Business Administration and is based on earlier estimates dating back to the 1970s. The underlying studies on regulatory impact were mainly conducted by academics using various techniques, some peer-reviewed. The data collected for these estimates is outdated, ranging from ten to thirty years ago. The cost estimates combine different types of regulations, some imposing real costs and others causing income transfers. Agency and program information is incomplete, and benefit information is lacking. The estimates on regulatory impact lack transparency and may not meet information quality guidelines. Reports to Congress now focus on costs and benefits of major regulations reviewed by OMB in the last decade. Graham criticized the Improvements Act of 2004 for its requirement of agencies to submit annual estimates of the cost and benefits of rules, calling it \"not workable.\" OMB's 2009 report to Congress provided estimates of the total annual benefits and costs of 98 regulations reviewed from 1998 to 2008, focusing on rules generating approximately $100 million in benefits or costs. OMB's 2009 report to Congress quantified and monetized the costs and benefits of 98 regulations from 1998 to 2008. The estimated costs ranged from $51 billion to $60 billion, while benefits were between $126 billion and $663 billion. However, these estimates were not a complete account of all regulations issued during that period. OMB's 2009 report to Congress quantified and monetized the costs and benefits of 98 regulations from 1998 to 2008. OMB stated that aggregating benefit and cost estimates of individual regulations provides insight, but the resulting estimates are not precise or complete due to varying assumptions and methods used in regulatory impact analyses. Comparing OMB's estimates is challenging due to the aggregation of non-comparable analytical results. Crain and Crain's estimates of regulatory costs in 2008 were much larger than OMB's due to different methodologies and inclusion of all rules' costs. Crain and Crain's estimates of regulatory costs in 2008 were significantly higher than OMB's due to different methodologies and inclusion of all rules' costs, including economic regulations and tax paperwork. Decision makers should be cautious when using studies of aggregate regulatory costs and benefits for public policy guidance. The validity and reliability of Crain and Crain's $1.75 trillion estimate of total federal regulatory costs in 2008 relies heavily on the WGI index of regulatory quality for the United States, which accounts for over 70% of the overall estimate. However, one of the index authors has pointed out that Crain and Crain misinterpreted the index, stating that higher values on the index do not necessarily indicate \"less stringent regulations.\" The validity of Crain and Crain's estimate of total federal regulatory costs in 2008 relies heavily on the WGI index of regulatory quality for the United States. Concerns were raised about the index's use in measuring the cost of economic regulations, as well as the regression analysis used to produce the cost estimate. Comparing the US regulatory quality index to Ireland's index in 2008 would have significantly reduced the estimated cost of economic regulations. Crain and Crain defended their use of the regulatory quality index to estimate costs, stating it reflects a country's economic regulations' stringency. The World Bank cautions that such measures may not be precise for specific governance reforms. Their estimates cover environmental, occupational safety, and health regulations. Crain and Crain estimated regulatory costs by combining academic studies and outdated agency estimates. OMB criticized their approach as flawed, noting the use of old data. The estimates were based on OMB reports to Congress, presenting costs as ranges, but Crain and Crain only used the highest costs. Crain and Crain used only the highest cost estimates from OMB reports, stating that government agencies tend to underestimate regulatory costs. OMB has questioned this view and considers estimates over 10 years old as irrelevant. Since 2003, OMB's reports to Congress have focused on costs and benefits of regulations. The \"Regulatory Right-to-Know Act\" reports to Congress focus on the costs and benefits of major rules issued in the past 10 years. OMB acknowledges that this approach may underestimate total regulatory costs and benefits but believes older estimates are unreliable for informing policy decisions. OMB also notes that incremental costs of regulations tend to decrease over time as business practices and consumer expectations evolve. Consumer expectations have changed, leading to increased safety features in automobiles. Even if regulations were eliminated, companies are unlikely to remove these features due to consumer demand and product liability concerns. Similarly, environmentally responsible behavior has become profitable for businesses. This \"rising baseline\" phenomenon reduces the true costs and benefits of health, safety, and environmental regulations over time. Estimates of the costs and benefits of regulations may be overestimated due to outdated data. OMB suggests that compliance costs for regulations over ten years old may only save half if they were to disappear overnight. Crain and Crain's estimate for tax paperwork costs may be higher than actual data suggests. The authors suggest that the number of hours for tax paperwork may be higher than reported, while the cost assumptions for completing the paperwork may also be inflated. There is a question of whether tax paperwork should be considered in the same category as regulatory costs, as OMB does not include tax paperwork in its reports on regulatory costs and benefits. Crain and Crain's report did not account for all costs associated with federal regulations. The authors did not include regulatory benefits in their study, stating it was not required by the Office of Advocacy. The study by Crain and Crain focused on updating a previous study that examined costs and the disproportionality between small and large businesses, as required by Executive Order 12866. The order mandates agencies to assess both costs and benefits of regulations and select approaches that maximize net benefits. Agencies are urged to propose regulations only if benefits justify costs. OMB's reports to Congress show that estimated benefits of federal regulations generally exceed estimated costs. For example, in the 2010 report, aggregate costs were between $43 billion and $55 billion, while benefits ranged from $128 billion to $616 billion. In FY2009, costs for major rules were estimated at $3.7 billion to $9.5 billion, with benefits ranging from $8.6 billion to $28.9 billion. In the draft report for 2011, the aggregate costs of major rules reviewed by OMB were estimated to be between $44 billion and $62 billion, with benefits estimated between $136 billion and $651 billion. Costs for rules issued during FY2010 were estimated at between $6.5 billion and $12.5 billion, with benefits estimated at between $23.3 billion and $82.3 billion. The agencies often quantified or monetized only costs in rules, leading to a lack of balance in assessing benefits. Crain and Crain's 2008 estimate of $1.75 trillion in federal regulation costs has been used to push for regulatory reform, but they clarify that their report is not meant for decision-making by lawmakers or regulatory agencies. Crain and Crain emphasize the importance of considering both costs and benefits in assessing regulations for decision-making by policymakers. Regulatory costs alone do not provide a complete picture, as the monetized benefits need to be weighed against these costs to determine if regulations are justified. The importance of considering both costs and benefits in assessing regulations for decision-making by policymakers is emphasized. A valid policy decision can only be made after weighing the monetized benefits against the costs. To assess the sensitivity of results, CRS conducted a linear regression using data from 30 OECD countries over the period 2002-2008. The study conducted a linear regression analysis using GDP per capita and four independent variables from the OECD website. One variable, primary school enrollment, unexpectedly showed a negative impact on GDP per capita. The study conducted a linear regression analysis using GDP per capita and four independent variables from the OECD website. One variable, primary school enrollment, unexpectedly showed a negative impact on GDP per capita. Crain and Crain suggested that the negative coefficient may be due to \"aging pyramid\" demographic effects. CRS added two variables to account for demographic effects: the proportion of the population under 14 and over 65. These demographic measures may capture \"aging pyramid\" effects more directly than the primary education variable. Estimation results using panel estimator with year indicator variables and natural logarithms of variables. Coefficients on regulatory quality index and population are not statistically significant. Other coefficients show expected signs and are significant. The coefficient for regulatory quality index is statistically insignificant, while other coefficients are significant. Shifting the US regulatory quality index to Ireland's level could increase per capita GDP by $2.14. However, the estimate is imprecise. The quality index is imprecise, and estimating the effects of variables that change slowly over time, like the regulatory environment in economically advanced countries, may be challenging using panel estimation methods. Other econometric approaches focusing on specific changes in the regulatory environment may be more effective. Approaches focusing on specific changes in the regulatory environment may offer a better understanding of the effects of regulation on economic activity."
