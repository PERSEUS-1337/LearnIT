    "content": "The \"Protect and Preserve International Cultural Property Act\" defines cultural property as outlined in the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict. The appropriate congressional committees are specified as the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate. SEC. 3. FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF POLICY. Congress finds that protecting international cultural property is crucial for US cultural diplomacy, as it demonstrates respect for other cultures and the shared heritage of humanity. This protection is necessary due to the loss, damage, and destruction of cultural property caused by various threats such as political instability, armed conflict, and natural disasters. Recent political unrest in Egypt has resulted in the looting of museums and the irreversible destruction of ancient artifacts, creating gaps in the historical record of the Egyptian civilization. In Iraq, looting of the Iraq Museum in Baghdad led to the loss of 15,000 ancient items, including amulets, sculptures, and cylinder seals. In Syria, the civil war has caused damage to UNESCO World Heritage Sites, medieval cities, and looting of museums and archaeological sites dating back over six millennia. In Iraq and Syria, ISIS/ISIL has destroyed cultural sites and artifacts, while in Mali, Ansar Dine destroyed tombs and shrines in Timbuktu. In Timbuktu, a major center for trade, scholarship, and Islam in the 15th and 16th centuries, collections of ancient manuscripts were threatened. In Afghanistan, the Taliban destroyed the Bamiyan Buddhas, ancient statues carved into a cliff side, leading to worldwide condemnation. In Cambodia, the Khmer Rouge systematically destroyed many Buddhist temples and desecrated statues after seizing power in 1975. In Cambodia, the Khmer Rouge destroyed Buddhist temples, desecrated statues, and literature. In China, the Cultural Revolution led to the destruction of antiques and parts of old Beijing.

The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami also caused significant destruction. The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami caused massive loss of life and damage to cultural heritage sites in eleven countries, including Mahabalipuram in India, Sun Temple of Koranak, and Old Town of Galle in Sri Lanka. This destruction represents a loss of humanity's cultural heritage and the United States Armed Forces have played a role in preserving such properties. President Franklin D. Roosevelt established the American Commission for the Protection and Salvage of Artistic and Historic Monuments in War Areas in 1943 to provide expert advice to the military on protecting cultural property. The Commission formed Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives (MFAA) teams, known as the \"Monuments Men,\" who secured and catalogued cultural treasures during wartime. The U.S. Committee of the Blue Shield was founded in 2006 to support the implementation of the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict. It works with the U.S. military and other organizations to preserve international cultural property threatened by various disasters. The United States policy is to protect international cultural property at risk of destruction due to political instability, armed conflict, or natural disasters. This includes fulfilling obligations under the 1954 Hague Convention and preventing the importation of cultural property in accordance with existing laws. The United States aims to prevent the importation of cultural property pillaged, looted, or stolen during political instability, armed conflict, or disasters. This includes enforcing existing laws and regulations to stop the trafficking of stolen or looted cultural property.
