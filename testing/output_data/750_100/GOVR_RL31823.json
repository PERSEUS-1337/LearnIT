    "content": "In January 2004, federal white-collar employees received a 1.5% annual pay adjustment and a 0.5% locality-based comparability payment under Executive Order 13322. A larger pay adjustment of 4.1% for 2004 was included in the conference agreement for the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004 (H.R. 2673). H.R. 2989 was incorporated into H.R. 2673, which was signed into law as P.L. 108-199 on January 23, 2004. The law provided a 2.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees, with an additional pay adjustment issued through Executive Order 13332 on March 3, 2004. OPN published revised salary tables for 2004 on March 4, 2004. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) published the 2004 salary tables on March 4, 2004, available online. Federal white-collar employees receive annual pay adjustments and locality-based comparability payments under the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act (FEPCA) of 1990. The pay adjustments are not based on cost-of-living measures. The Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act (FEPCA) of 1990 provides annual pay adjustments and locality-based comparability payments for federal white-collar employees. However, the full adjustments specified by FEPCA have never been fully implemented. In 2003, employees received a 4.1% combined annual and locality pay adjustment, but the nationwide average net pay increase would have been 18.56% if all adjustments were granted. In 2004, a similar 4.1% adjustment was provided. The report discusses the January 2004 annual adjustment and locality payments for federal employees under the General Schedule, Foreign Service Schedule, and Veterans Health Administration Schedule. It does not cover salary adjustments for federal officials, federal judges, or Members of Congress. Annual adjustments for senior-level (SL) and scientific and professional (ST) positions are discretionary. Contract appeals board members' pay adjustments depend on Executive Schedule pay changes. The adjustment is based on the Employment Cost Index (ECI), with a 2.7% across-the-board pay increase expected in January. The ECI indicates a 2.7% annual pay adjustment in January 2004, based on private sector wage changes. FEPCA allows the President to propose a different plan in case of national emergency or economic issues. President Bush issued an alternative plan on August 27, 2003. President Bush issued an alternative plan on August 27, 2003, for a 1.5% annual pay adjustment in January 2004. Executive Order 13322, issued on December 30, 2003, implemented the plan for GS employees and extended locality-based comparability payments to certain non-General Schedule employees. The PayAgent determines pay cap levels for non-General Schedule employees with extended locality pay. OPM clarified regulations in December 2001. Blue-collar workers under the FWS have a prevailing rate adjustment capped at the average pay adjustment for white-collar employees. In 2004, blue-collar workers will receive a pay adjustment no less than GS employees in their location. Non-foreign areas will receive a pay adjustment equal to GS employees in the RUS pay area. Special rate employees get the higher of special rate or locality payment. Law enforcement officers under Section 403 of FEPCA receive both special rates and locality pay. Alaska, Hawaii, and non-continental US employees receive COLA allowance instead of locality pay. FEPCA established locality-based comparability payments for areas with a non-federal/federal pay disparity over 5%. FEPCA established locality-based comparability payments for areas with a non-federal/federal pay disparity greater than 5%. The adjustment aims to equalize pay rates between GS employees and non-federal workers in the same locality. The President can set alternative comparability payments in case of a national emergency or economic crisis. A report must be submitted to Congress at least one month before these payments are due. President Bush issued an alternative plan on August 27, 2003, to provide a 0.5% locality pay adjustment in January 2004, which was implemented by Executive Order 13322 on December 30, 2003. Bureau of Labor Statistics conducts surveys to document non-federal rates of pay in each of the 32 pay areas nationwide. The surveys were conducted under the Occupational Compensation Survey Program until October 1996, then under the National Compensation Survey program. Survey results are submitted to OPM for comparison of federal and non-federal salaries by grade in each pay area. The average salaries at each grade, federal and non-federal, are compared to determine the overall average percentage pay gap for each pay area. The target gap between GS and non-federal salaries is adjusted to 5% annually by OPM. FEPCA mandates closing a certain percentage of the target gap each year, with 20% closed in 1994. In 1994, 20% of the pay gap between GS and non-federal salaries was closed as authorized by FEPCA. Subsequent years were supposed to close 10% more each year, but the actual closures were lower, with 44% closed by 2003. FEPCA specified that locality payments must reduce pay disparity to 5%. The Pay Agent recommends rates based on pay gaps from 22 months prior. NCS surveys were not used for locality payments in 2000-2003. The Pay Agent recommended rates for locality payments based on pay gaps from 22 months prior. Gaps for March 2002 were determined using OCSP and NCS survey data, with some data being at least seven years old for certain pay areas. The Federal Salary Council explained how pay gaps were determined for locality payments in 2004, aging survey data to a common reference date before comparing it to GS pay data. The council reported results from this methodology as of March 2002. The Federal Salary Council reported in March 2002 that the gap between GS average salaries and non-federal average salaries was 32.02%. To reduce this disparity to 5% as mandated by FEPCA, recommended locality pay raises ranging from 19.45% to 47.64% in different pay areas, with Washington, DC at 28.78%. The Federal Salary Council recommended locality pay raises ranging from 11.90% to 25.23% in different pay areas for 2004. The nationwide average net pay increase would have been 15.15% if ECI and locality-based comparability payments were granted as required by law. Areas with pay gaps below the RUS pay area would receive the same adjustment as RUS. The methodology for implementing locality pay since 1994 involved dropping areas with low publishability and pay gaps below RUS for three surveys. The Federal Salary Council recommended including these areas with RUS in 2004 due to incomplete improvements in NCS data. The Council recommends not dropping Indianapolis, Kansas City, Orlando, and St. Louis as separate pay areas at this time. Basic criteria for determining pay areas were established in 1993 and remain unchanged. The Council plans to review and potentially adjust locality pay area definitions in the future. The Council recommends no changes in locality pay area definitions until reviewing new commuting pattern and population data from the 2000 census and new metropolitan area definitions in 2003. Criteria for pay areas include county contiguity, 2,000 GS employees, and economic linkage. An exception is recommended for Barnstable County, MA, seeking inclusion in the Boston pay area. Barnstable County is the only county on the eastern seaboard from southern Maine to Delaware not in a separate locality. The Council recommends an exception for Barnstable County, MA, to be included in the Boston locality pay area in 2004 due to not meeting criteria but being cut off from the rest of the country. The Council recommended including St. Mary's County, MD, in the Washington, DC-Baltimore pay area for 2004. Santa Barbara County, CA, and New London, CT, have fallen below the employee threshold for their respective pay areas. The council recommended that New London and Santa Barbara continue to be areas of application for their respective pay areas for 2004, as new census data will soon be available that will affect locality pay area definitions in the future. The Office of Management and Budget and the Census Bureau are revamping how metropolitan areas are defined, and a major review of the locality pay program is planned for 2003. In 2003, a major review of the locality pay program is planned. Monterey County, CA is recommended to be included in the San Francisco pay area in 2004. Rhode Island is designated as an area of application to the Boston pay area, but due to small county sizes, \"Full State\" criteria are recommended. The council recommended adopting \"Full State\" criteria for Rhode Island to be included in the Boston pay area in 2004. The state meets the criteria and is recommended for continued inclusion. Installation criteria include having at least 1,000 GS employees within 10 miles of the prime-critical survey boundary. The majority of GS employees must be within 10 miles of the prime-critical survey boundary area. Edwards Air Force Base was included in the Los Angeles pay area since 1994, but no longer meets the employment criteria. The council recommended its continued inclusion in 2004. The council recommended improvements in the BLS National Compensation Survey program. The council recommended improvements in the BLS National Compensation Survey program, including using a three-factor system for federal grade levels and developing a model to estimate missing data. BLS has implemented a new four-factor evaluation system successfully in field tests and will phase it into surveys starting in December 2003. The BLS has developed an econometric model to estimate salaries for jobs not randomly selected in surveys. OPM formed an interagency working group to improve the matching of federal survey jobs with non-federal survey jobs. Additional improvements are anticipated in the crosswalk between Federal job classifications and the new Standard Occupational Classification System. \"BLS and Pay Agent staffs have designed a new approach for grading supervisory occupations based on the highest level of work supervised. Final tests of the new approach are scheduled for this fall, with implementation expected in December 2003. Criteria are being developed to exclude jobs classified above GS-15 in government.\" The BLS has methods to exclude non-Federal jobs classified above GS-15. The council recommended caution in using NCS data for locality payments and suggested BLS implement improvements before further reliance on NCS data. The Council recommended additional resources for BLS to increase sample size in surveys, especially in areas with significant pay gaps. Locality pay areas are determined using OMB definitions of metropolitan areas, which automatically change when OMB revises definitions. Final regulations state that locality pay areas no longer change automatically with new definitions of metropolitan areas. OPM modified GS locality pay regulations to align with former OMB statistical area definitions based on recommendations from the Federal Salary Council. The Federal Salary Council and the President's Pay Agent reviewed new statistical area definitions in 2003, including changes like the introduction of 'Micropolitan Statistical Areas' and 'Combined Statistical Areas [CSAs]' replacing 'Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Areas' for locality pay areas. The Federal Salary Council and the President's Pay Agent reviewed new statistical area definitions in 2003, including changes like the introduction of 'Micropolitan Statistical Areas' and 'Combined Statistical Areas [CSAs]' for locality pay areas. Population density is no longer a criterion for evaluating outlying counties, and commuting thresholds have been adjusted. A Federal Salary Council working group recommended considering the new MSA definitions for the locality pay program. The Federal Salary Council and the President's Pay Agent reviewed new statistical area definitions in 2003 for the locality pay program. The report recommended additional study before making decisions on using new CSAs and MSAs for locality pay areas. At a second council meeting, the working group suggested considering the new MSA definitions. In a council meeting on October 7, 2003, the working group recommended adopting new MSA definitions for locality pay areas. They acknowledged that changes in MSAs are due to demographic and criteria changes. For the January 2005 pay adjustments, the group suggested using Combined Statistical Areas (CSAs) for the largest defined areas, revising pay area definitions, and merging three pay areas with pay gaps below RUS into RUS to save resources. The working group recommended merging pay areas with pay gaps below RUS into RUS to save resources. The council's recommendations were tentatively approved by the Pay Agent and the President for the January 2005 pay adjustments. An amendment to H.R. 2989 was agreed to by the House of Representatives on September 4, 2003. The House of Representatives approved an amendment on September 4, 2003, stating that funds in the Transportation/Treasury bill could not be used to disestablish any pay locality. Representative Sam Farr withdrew a similar amendment during the bill markup, but later testified about the potential pay reduction for federal employees in Monterey County, California. Senator Jack Reed offered an amendment (S.Amdt. 1944) to prevent the removal of Monterey County, California from the San Francisco locality pay area. The Senate approved the amendment during the consideration of the Transportation and Treasury appropriations bill on October 23, 2003. The amendment ensured that no funds could be used to remove any area from coverage under a locality pay area. The amendment by Senator Jack Reed prevented the removal of Monterey County, California from the San Francisco locality pay area. It was incorporated into the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004 and enacted as Section 644 of P.L. 108-199 on January 23, 2004. This provision prohibited the use of funds to enforce regulations inconsistent with the Federal Salary Council's recommendations for locality pay areas in FY2004. The Pay Agent submitted its annual report on 2004 locality payments to the President, recommending adjustments for January 2004. Due to the national emergency and economic slowdown, they advised against implementing the recommended pay increases. They suggested exploring alternative approaches to federal employee compensation. The Pay Agent expressed concerns about the uniformity of pay adjustments for federal employees in different labor markets. The cost of implementing the recommended pay increases in January 2004 to reduce pay disparity was estimated at $8.830 billion. The Pay Agent did not adopt the council's recommendation to include Barnstable County, Massachusetts, as part of the Boston locality pay area. They believe changes in locality pay area boundaries should be made after reviewing new commuting patterns data and metropolitan area definitions. The Pay Agent also mentioned recommended improvements in the BLS National Compensation Survey Program focused on problems with random selection. The Pay Agent implemented improvements in the BLS National Compensation Survey Program, focusing on issues with random selection of survey jobs and GS grades. They look forward to reviewing NCS data next year and expect the last two improvements to impact data in 2005. The Pay Agent implemented improvements in the BLS National Compensation Survey Program in 2005, encouraging expedited completion of the remaining two improvements. Pay rates are calculated based on annual and locality adjustments, with a comparison to 2003 rates to determine the net increase in pay for 2004. President George W. Bush proposed a 2.0% federal civilian pay adjustment in the FY2004 budget. The FY2004 budget proposed a 2.0% federal civilian pay adjustment, with details on how the increase would be allocated between annual and locality adjustments required by FEPCA in January 2004. The President must submit alternative plans for annual and locality adjustments by September 1, 2003, and November 30, 2003, respectively. The President issued an alternative plan on August 27, 2003, for a 2.0% pay adjustment in January 2004, costing about $2 billion. The plan aimed to change the annual adjustment and locality-based comparability payments, saving about $11 billion compared to the original plan required by FEPCA. Executive Order 13322 implemented the alternative plan on December 30, 2003. The President's plan for a 2.0% pay adjustment in January 2004 includes a $500 million Human Capital Performance Fund to reward high-performing employees. The fund is authorized by Section 1129 of P.L. 108-136, enacted on November 24, 2003. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $2.5 million for the fund in H.R. 2989. The Human Capital Performance Fund in H.R. 2989 is contingent upon the enactment of legislation authorizing its creation within OPM. No funds will be available until the OPM Director notifies relevant subcommittees and obtains prior approval. OPM is directed to report annually to the Committees on Appropriations on approved performance pay plans. The Senate Committee on Appropriations did not recommend funding for the Human Capital Performance Fund in H.R. 2989, stating that such initiatives should be budgeted and administered within individual agencies. Funding was not provided in the Transportation and Treasury appropriations bill, and H.R. 2989 was later incorporated into H.R. 2673. The 108th Congress was closing, with H.R. 2989 being included in H.R. 2673, the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004. The conference agreement for H.R. 2673 allocated $1 million for the Human Capital Performance Fund, with funding contingent on the establishment of the fund within OPM. Approval from OPM and relevant subcommittees is required before funds can be transferred to any federal agency for performance pay plans. The 108th Congress approved the Human Capital Performance Fund with $1 million allocated in the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004. The OPM Director can transfer determined amounts to federal agencies for performance pay plans. President's alternative plan included a 2% pay raise proposal, causing concern among federal employee union representatives. The National Commission on the Public Service recommended abolishing the General Schedule classification system due to the resources needed to maintain it and the challenges in defining equal work for equal pay. They proposed a broad-band system with fewer pay grades and wider salary ranges, allowing managers to set pay based on competence and performance. The commission recommended abolishing the General Schedule classification system and implementing pay banding systems at various agencies. Pay parity provisions were included in P.L. 107-123 to raise salaries for certain employees. New HRM systems are being introduced for civilian employees of the Departments of Homeland Security. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 and the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2004 authorized HRM systems for civilian employees of the Departments of Homeland Security and Defense, including changes to pay setting systems with broad pay bands. Congress annually considers federal white-collar pay adjustments, which may differ from the President's recommendation. In January 1999, 2000, 2002, and 2003, Congress set overall pay adjustment amounts. Resolutions in Congress aimed for parity between military and civilian pay increases, expressing nonbinding opinions on policies. The FY2004 budget proposes a 4.1% pay increase for the military and 2.0% for civilian employees. Members of Congress urged support for equal pay raises for federal civilian employees and the military. The FY2004 budget, approved by the House of Representatives, included a provision for adjusting civilian employee compensation in line with military pay raises. The Senate version also supported this measure. The Concurrent Budget Resolution sets the framework for Congress to consider spending legislation. Congressional recommendations on federal pay adjustments are typically included in the Transportation, Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations bill. The House Subcommittee on Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies approved a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees in the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security in the Treasury and Independent Agencies Appropriations Bill, 2004 (H.R. 2989). The bill did not specify how the increase should be divided between annual and locality pay adjustments. The House Committee on Appropriations then ordered the bill to be reported favorably to the House of Representatives. The House Subcommittee approved a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees in the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security. An amendment was added to provide the pay adjustment, and the bill was reported to the House. The bill passed the House with a 381-39 vote, despite opposition from the Bush Administration. The Bush Administration opposes the 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees, proposing a 2.0% raise instead and a Human Capital Performance Fund for high-performing employees. The Administration is concerned about unfunded civilian pay raises for federal employees, costing DOD $660 million and Government-wide $2.1 billion. The Statement of Administration Policy expresses disappointment that the bill does not fund the President's request for a $500 million Human Capital Performance Fund. The 4.1% pay adjustment in the bill exceeds inflation, statutory base pay increase, and private-sector pay increase. Despite this, it does not address Federal employee turnover issues. Federal employees are generally satisfied with their pay rate, with a low quit rate of 1.7% per year. The Senate version of the Transportation/Treasury appropriations bill, S. 1589, includes a 4.1% pay adjustment for civilian employees in the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security. This adjustment was approved by the full committee and would limit agency flexibility in designing new personnel and pay systems. Section 636 of the Senate Transportation/Treasury appropriations bill provides a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees, including those in the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security. Section 502 ensures that the pay increase is absorbed within appropriated levels. Senator Richard Shelby and Senator Patty Murray's amendment to the bill was agreed to, incorporating these provisions. The Senate passed H.R. 2989, amended, on a 91 to 3 vote on October 23, 2003, providing a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees. The Federal Salary Council recommended allocating the pay adjustment as a 2.7% annual pay adjustment and a 1.4% locality pay adjustment. The net pay adjustment in the Washington, DC, area would be 4.42%. The House of Representatives and the Senate agreed to a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees, effective from January 1, 2004, as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004. President Bush signed H.R. 2673 on January 23, 2004, which included a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees effective from the first pay period beginning on or after January 1, 2004. The pay raises were required to be funded within appropriated levels. Additionally, the Consolidated Appropriations Act provided an extra 2.1% pay adjustment, and President Bush issued Executive Order 13332 on March 3, 2004, allocating the additional funds. President Bush's Executive Order 13332 on March 3, 2004, allocated a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees, with 1.2% annual and 0.9% locality increases. The cost of the adjustment was approximately $4.1 billion. OPM issued revised salary tables for 2004 the next day, available on their website. The Federal Salary Council and Pay Agent recommendations for the January 2005 pay adjustments are discussed in CRS Report RL32355. White-Collar Pay: FY2005 Salary Adjustments. Congress could examine ways to amend FEPCA to reduce the disparity between non-federal and federal salaries to 5%. The law provided for closing the pay gaps each year, with 100% closure targeted by January 2002. The Federal Salary Council and the Pay Agent report that the pay disparity between non-federal and federal salaries averages 25.73% for 2004, much higher than the targeted 5% closure of pay gaps each year as mandated by FEPCA. The methodology for setting federal pay adjustments has been questioned since FEPCA's enactment due to flawed data completeness and credibility of gaps. Despite concerns about data credibility and methodology, no proposals were made to change FEPCA. Survey data from previous years had to be aged for use in determining locality payments. Congress addressed this issue in P.L. 106-554, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2001. In response to concerns about data credibility and methodology, Congress directed the President's Pay Agent to prepare a report on methodological concerns. The Pay Agent reported to Congress in May 2001, highlighting the need for improvements to the survey methodology. The Office of Personnel Management issued a white paper in April 2002, discussing the review of current policies and the importance of flexibility in setting General Schedule pay. The Congressional Budget Office compared federal General Schedule employee salaries with nonfederal employees in similar jobs. The comparison showed that federal employees in professional and administrative occupations tended to earn less than private firms, with about 85 percent lagging behind by more than 20 percent. Federal employees in technical and clerical occupations had salaries above those in private firms, with smaller pay differences. About three-quarters of federal employees in these occupations had salaries within 10 percent of private levels. The Congressional Budget Office noted concerns about the federal pay system's lack of variation in pay raises by occupation. The Congressional Budget Office highlighted concerns about the lack of variation in pay raises by occupation in the federal pay system. This could lead to disparities where employees in professional and administrative occupations receive smaller raises than needed to match private sector salaries, while those in technical and clerical occupations may receive higher raises than necessary. As a result, the current system, even if fully implemented as envisioned in FEPCA, would not achieve its goal of providing federal pay comparable to nonfederal jobs. The jobs with the greatest pay disadvantage for federal workers are increasing in the federal workforce. From 1985 to 2000, federal employment in professional and administrative occupations grew from 41% to 56%. The cost of fully implementing FEPCA is a concern, with estimated locality-based comparability payments in January 2004 totaling $8.830 billion to reduce the pay disparity as required by FEPCA. The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) and the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) endorse pay parity between federal civilian employees and the uniformed military. They criticize the President's proposal on federal pay as inadequate and disregarding of FEPCA. AFGE questions the Department of Labor's methodology in determining federal pay comparability with the private sector. The methodology problems in implementing FEPCA have shifted from the locality component to the Employment Cost Index (ECI) component. Bush has been trying to eliminate the locality component for the past two years. The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) and the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) criticize the President's proposal on federal pay as inadequate and disregarding of FEPCA. AFGE questions the Department of Labor's methodology in determining federal pay comparability with the private sector. The Pay Agent recommended adjustments for January 2004, but due to the national emergency and economic slowdown, locality pay increases were not implemented. Executive Order 13322 by President Bush adjusted certain rates of pay. Executive Order 13322, issued by President Bush in January 2004, provides a 1.5% annual pay adjustment and a 0.5% locality-based comparability payment. Another Executive Order, 13332, issued in March 2004, includes an additional 2.1% pay adjustment, with 1.2% as an annual adjustment and 0.9% as a locality-based comparability payment. Pay rates are calculated by increasing the basic General Schedule (GS) by the annual adjustment percentage and then adding the locality payment. The new GS schedule rates for 2004 are determined by increasing the basic GS rates and adding the locality payment. The resulting pay rates are compared with 2003 pay rates to calculate the net increase in pay. Salary tables for 2004 can be found on the OPM website. MSA and CMSA are defined as Metropolitan Statistical Area and Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area, respectively."
