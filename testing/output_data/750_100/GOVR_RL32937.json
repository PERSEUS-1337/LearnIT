    "content": "The Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources have approved legislation to reauthorize and revise the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Block Grant, including changes to the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program. S. 667 and H.R. 240 were reported in 2005. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program, Part D of Title IV of the Social Security Act, was enacted in January 1975. It is administered by the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and funded by general revenues. All 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands operate CSE programs and are entitled to federal matching funds. Families receiving TANF benefits, foster care payments, or Medicaid coverage automatically qualify for CSE services free of charge. Between FY1978 and FY2003, child support payments collected by CSE agencies increased from $1 billion to $21.2 billion. The number of children with established paternity also rose significantly. The program collects 18% of child support obligations. The CSE program collects 18% of child support obligations and handles at least 50% of all child support cases. Paternity has been established for 77% of children without legally identified fathers. The program provides services such as parent location, paternity establishment, and child support order establishment. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program handles various tasks including paternity establishment, child support order establishment, support payment collection, and medical support enforcement. Collection methods involve income withholding, tax refund intercepts, liens, and reporting to credit bureaus. Additionally, there are civil and criminal procedures for enforcement. Federal legislation such as the Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act of 1998 has strengthened enforcement measures. The Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act of 1998 established federal criminal offenses for noncustodial parents who fail to financially support their children, allowing states to intercept assets to satisfy arrearages. The Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act of 1998 allowed states to withhold licenses and seize financial resources of noncustodial parents who owe past-due support. It also authorized the denial, revocation, or restriction of passports for debtor parents. The Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act of 1998 authorized the Secretary of State to deny, revoke, or restrict passports of debtor parents and required states to enact the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act. The federal government reimburses states for administering their child support enforcement programs and pays incentives for effective programs. The Child Support Performance and Incentive Act of 1998 established a cost-neutral incentive payment system for states. The statutory limit for incentive payments in FY2005 is $446 million. The CSE program focuses on service delivery, promoting self-sufficiency, and parental responsibility to secure financial support for children from noncustodial parents. Child support payments are crucial for single-parent families, with it constituting 17% of family income on average and 30% for poor families. Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 aim to enhance the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program to increase economic independence for former welfare families and provide a stable income source for single-parent households. Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 aim to enhance the Child Support Enforcement program to increase economic independence for former welfare families and provide a stable income source for single-parent households. The bills share identical objectives in simplifying CSE assignment and distribution rules, but differ in their approaches. The Senate Finance Committee-reported bill includes a larger list of CSE provisions compared to the House Subcommittee bill. The CSE provisions in S.667 and H.R. 240 require families receiving TANF benefits to assign their child support rights to the state. This includes child support accrued before and during TANF receipt. Assigned child support collections are not given to families. The assignment process for child support rights under TANF benefits involves families assigning their rights to the state. Child support collections are kept by the state and federal government as reimbursement for welfare benefits. The date of the assignment determines which arrearages are permanently assigned to the state. If the assignment was entered on or after October 1, 1997, only arrearages accumulating while the family receives assistance are \"permanently assigned.\" Pre-assistance arrearages are \"temporarily assigned\" and revert to the family upon leaving TANF, unless collected through the federal income tax refund offset program. Child support assignment under S. 667 as reported by the Senate Finance Committee would only cover support accruing during TANF benefits, excluding arrearages before TANF receipt. H.R. 240 does not change child support assignment rules, while distribution rules determine the order of payment for child support collections. This is crucial as it affects past-due child support payments. The importance of child support collection lies in the fact that past-due child support may not be fully paid. TANF families may have their current support and arrearages collected by the state while receiving benefits. States have the discretion to decide how much of the child support payments collected on behalf of TANF families to send to the family and whether to treat these payments as income. States have discretion over child support collections, but P.L. 104-193 requires them to pay the federal government's share collected for TANF families. 18 states still follow the pre-1996 policy of passing through and disregarding $50 (or more in one state) of child support. Both bills aim to incentivize states to allocate more child support to TANF families. The bills aim to direct more child support to TANF families, with differing approaches on federal cost-sharing and encouraging states to implement pass-through and disregard policies. S. 667 proposes federal cost-sharing for the entire amount of pass-through and disregard. S. 667 proposes federal cost-sharing for pass-through and disregard policies used by states, allowing states to pay child support collected on behalf of TANF families without reimbursing the federal government. The House bill, H.R. 240, aims to incentivize states to increase pass-through and disregard policies for TANF benefits. It allows states to pay more child support to TANF families without reimbursing the federal government, with a limit on federal cost-sharing. The federal government can share in the cost of an increase in child support pass-through for TANF families, with a limit of $100 per month or $50 more than the state previously shared. States must distribute child support collections to former TANF families before being reimbursed, following the \"family-first\" policy. The 1996 welfare reform law prioritizes child support distribution to families once they leave TANF, including current child support, never-assigned arrearages, and arrearages before TANF benefits. Child support accrued during TANF belongs to the government. Child support accrued before and after a family receives TANF goes to the family, while child support accrued during TANF goes to the state. S. 667 would allow states to distribute the full amount of child support collected on behalf of former TANF families, simplifying the distribution process and eliminating special treatment of child support. S. 667 aims to simplify the distribution process of child support and eliminate special treatment of arrearages collected through the federal income tax refund offset program. The federal government would share costs with states for paying child support arrearages to families, while H.R. 240 gives states the option to distribute full child support amounts to former TANF families. The bills aim to streamline child support distribution and remove special treatment for arrearages collected through the federal income tax refund offset program. They include provisions for lowering passport denial threshold, collecting child support from Social Security and veterans' benefits, using tax refund offset program for past-due child support, and allowing HHS Secretary to compare information of noncustodial parents with past-due child support. The Senate Finance Committee's S. 667 bill aims to enhance states' ability to collect child support payments by allowing for the comparison of noncustodial parents' information with insurers' records, facilitating the establishment of interstate child support cases, and expanding collection methods. The Senate Finance Committee's S. 667 bill includes provisions such as authorizing the HHS Secretary to seize financial assets of noncustodial parents who owe child support, requiring medical support from parents, and notifying health care plan administrators when a child loses coverage. Additionally, the bill mandates states to review and adjust child support orders for TANF families every three years. The proposed bills aim to improve child support enforcement by establishing funding levels for technical assistance and the Federal Parent Locator Service, designating Indian tribes as authorized entities for information access, and implementing a $25 annual fee for individuals receiving CSE services. Additionally, S. 667 includes provisions for increased funding for CSE access and visitation programs. The proposed bills aim to improve child support enforcement by increasing funding for CSE access and visitation programs, requiring states to adopt a later version of UIFSA, and allowing Texas to continue its CSE program without a federal waiver.
