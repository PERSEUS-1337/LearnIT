The judiciary uses non-appropriated funds from court filing fees to offset expenses in Courts of Appeals, District Courts, and Other Judicial Services. These funds are considered \"unencumbered\" and result from savings in areas where budgeted costs did not materialize. The judiciary has limited control over these savings, such as the confirmation rate of judges and budgeting for judgeships, rent costs, and technology funding. The budget request and appropriations figures reflect the net resources for the judiciary. The judiciary's budget includes net resources and \"encumbered\" funds for specific purposes like office space and technology projects. Cost-containment efforts focus on office space rental, personnel expenses, information technology, and operating costs. Judge Julia S. Gibbons emphasizes these efforts in the FY2017 budget submission. In the FY2017 budget, Judge Julia S. Gibbons highlights the judiciary's cost-containment initiatives, focusing on shared administrative services and reducing space footprint.

Judge Gibbons reported achieving a nearly $1.5 billion cost reduction over 10 years. The Judicial Conference set a goal of a 3% reduction in total space, with 30% already achieved by March 2015, resulting in $5.8 million in rent savings. The judiciary is on track to accomplish the full three percent reduction by the end of fiscal year 2018. Efforts to improve judicial security have been spurred by recent incidents, including the double homicide of a federal judge's family members in Chicago in 2005, Atlanta courthouse killings in 2005, a state judge shot in his Reno office in 2006, and a shooting at the Lloyd D. George U.S. Courthouse in Las Vegas in 2010. Measures such as providing intrusion detection systems for judges' homes have been implemented. The Court Security Improvement Act of 2007 aimed to enhance security for judges and court personnel, as well as courtroom safety for the public. The judiciary has been working closely with the U.S. Marshals Service to ensure protective policies are in place, including a pilot program for perimeter security at selected courthouses previously under the Federal Protective Service. The US Marshals Service implemented a pilot program in FY2009 to improve perimeter security at selected courthouses previously under the Federal Protective Service. The program, in place at courthouses in Chicago, Detroit, Phoenix, New York, Tucson, and Baton Rouge, is evaluated for enhancements.
