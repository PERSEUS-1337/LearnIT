    "content": "The federal government has been collecting educational statistics for over 150 years. The National Institute of Education (NIE) and the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) were established in the mid-1970s to centralize research efforts. In 1985, the NIE was replaced by the Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI). The Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI) replaced the National Institute of Education (NIE) in 1985. The Institute of Education Sciences (IES) took over in 2002 through the Education Sciences Reform Act, establishing IES as an independent research institute within the Department of Education. The National Board of Educational Sciences (NBES) advises the Director on institute policies, approves research priorities, and assesses progress for improvement. ESRA established three National Education Centers: NCER, NCES, and NCEE. P.L. 108-446 amended ESRA. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) was reauthorized, amending ESRA to include the National Center for Special Education Research (NCSER). P.L. 107-279 also enacted the Educational Technical Assistance Act (ETAA) and the National Assessment of Educational Progress Authorization Act (NAEPAA). ETAA provides grants for technical assistance activities, while NAEPAA authorizes a national assessment. The Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA) authorizes national assessments in reading and mathematics for grades 4, 8, and 12. It led to the creation of an independent research institute and set standards for research. The Institute of Education Sciences (IES) operates independently with more freedom from the Department of Education. ESRA establishes oversight of IES through a technical panel and sets standards for educational research, including scientifically based research and valid evaluations. The House of Representatives and the Senate passed bills to reauthorize ESRA, ETAA, and NAEPAA, emphasizing methodological rigor in IES-supported research. Funding for these programs has continued through annual appropriations legislation. The Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA), ETAA, and NAEPAA aimed to amend provisions related to IES independence, research standards, technical assistance, evaluation, privacy protection, student assessment oversight, and IES accountability. ESRA, ETAA, and NAEPAA established programs and authorities aligned with P.L. 107-279. Title I of P.L. 107-279 is the Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA), which includes provisions authorizing IES, the NBES, and National Education Centers.
