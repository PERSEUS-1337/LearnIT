The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 authorizes funding for Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Sciences (PALS) to enhance access to laboratory science. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 authorizes grants to high-need local educational agencies for partnerships to improve laboratory science access at the secondary school level. Grants are awarded based on competitive merit criteria. Grants are awarded to high-need local educational agencies for partnerships to improve laboratory science access at the secondary school level. Eligibility requires partnerships with institutions of higher education, businesses, and other organizations. The Federal government covers a portion of the costs. The Federal government covers up to 33% of the cost for activities in grants awarded to high-need local educational agencies. Approved agencies can receive grants for 3 fiscal years by submitting a plan to the Director. The Director requires a plan for the program, developed with input from various experts, to describe how laboratory improvements align with academic standards and enhance science education quality. The Director requires a comprehensive program to enhance mathematics, science, engineering, and technology instruction through laboratory experiences designed for clear learning outcomes, complementing classroom instruction, integrating science content, and incorporating student reflection and discussion. The grant proposal must include professional development for teachers, safety assurances, maintenance plans, and assessment methods for the laboratory facilities. The grant proposal must include assessment methods to expand research on the effect of laboratory science on student understanding and achievement. Grants awarded should supplement existing programs and improve secondary science education through laboratory enhancements. The grant proposal aims to enhance science education at the secondary school level by improving laboratories and providing instrumentation in line with State academic standards. The grant proposal aims to enhance science education at the secondary school level by improving laboratories, providing instrumentation, and supporting professional development for teachers. The grant proposal includes training in laboratory safety for school personnel and hands-on laboratory experiences to encourage interest in mathematics, science, engineering, and technology among individuals identified in the Science and Engineering Equal Opportunities Act. The grant proposal includes training in laboratory safety for school personnel and hands-on laboratory experiences to encourage interest in mathematics, science, engineering, and technology among individuals identified in the Science and Engineering Equal Opportunities Act. Grants awarded under this section shall not be used for construction of new facilities. A high-need local educational agency seeking a grant under this section shall submit an application. Applicants seeking a grant must submit an application to the Director with a description of the partnership, the plan, and activities to be carried out using the grant funds. Applicants seeking a grant must submit an application to the Director with a description of how activities will be aligned with academic standards, based on research, and promote student achievement in mathematics and science. The grant application must include a description of how activities will improve student performance in mathematics and science, as well as encourage interest in STEM fields among underrepresented individuals. The grant application must include a description of how activities will prepare individuals for postsecondary studies in STEM fields, assess changes in student achievement, evaluate partnership success, and make programmatic assessments available to the research community. The grant application must consider the partnership's ability to effectively carry out proposed programs based on research and best practices, aligned with state standards, and likely to increase student achievement. The partnership should also demonstrate activities that can be widely implemented. The Director shall evaluate the accountability and dissemination of the activities to encourage interest in mathematics, science, engineering, and technology among individuals identified in the Science and Engineering Equal Opportunities Act. The Director shall evaluate the program established under this section, using benchmarks and assessment tools to identify best practices and compare effectiveness with other partnerships. The Director will disseminate evaluation results to the public and specific committees in the House of Representatives and Senate. The Director will widely disseminate effective materials developed under the program. Technical assistance will be provided to high-need local educational agencies upon request, including guidance on developing quality grant applications. The Director will convene an annual meeting for high-need local educational agencies receiving grants to promote collaboration. A report on coordination will be provided to relevant committees. The annual report will describe how the program authorized under this section is coordinated with the program authorized under part B of title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The report must be submitted with the President's annual budget request. The President's annual budget request includes definitions for \"high-need local educational agency\" and \"National Laboratory\" as per specific legislation."
