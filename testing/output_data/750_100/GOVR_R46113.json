    "content": "This report analyzes annual appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for FY2020, comparing enacted FY2019 appropriations, the Trump Administration's FY2020 budget request, and the enacted appropriations measures. It also provides additional informational resources on DHS appropriations and a list of CRS policy experts for consultation. The suite of CRS reports on homeland security appropriations tracks legislative action and congressional issues related to DHS appropriations, focusing on discretionary funding amounts. These reports do not analyze specific issues related to mandatory funding or follow other legislation related to DHS programs. The Appendix explains budgetary concepts such as budget authority, obligations, outlays, discretionary and mandatory spending, and offsetting collections. The curr_chunk discusses terms related to appropriations process, including authority, obligations, discretionary and mandatory spending, and adjustments to spending caps under the Budget Control Act. All amounts in CRS reports on homeland security appropriations represent budget authority. Calculations use unrounded data for precision. The curr_chunk provides unrounded data from FY2019 annual appropriations and supplemental appropriations, sourced from specific legislative acts. The curr_chunk provides data from FY2019 annual appropriations and supplemental appropriations, including funding for natural disasters and security/humanitarian needs at the U.S.-Mexico border. Data sources include specific legislative acts for FY2020 requested, House Appropriations Committee-recommended, Senate Appropriations Committee-recommended, and FY2020 enacted levels. The curr_chunk provides data from FY2019 annual appropriations and supplemental appropriations, including funding for natural disasters and security/humanitarian needs at the U.S.-Mexico border. Data for the FY2020 enacted levels are drawn from the explanatory statement accompanying P.L. 116-93, Division D of which is the FY2020 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act. Scoring methodology is consistent across this report, relying on data provided by the Appropriations Committees that has been developed with Congressional Budget Office (CBO) methodology. Previous CRS reports on DHS appropriations at times used OMB data on mandatory spending for the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the U.S. Secret Service that was not listed in. The Trump Administration released its detailed budget request for FY2020 on March 18, 2019, following a lapse in FY2019 annual appropriations. The legislative process for appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security for FY2020 is outlined, from the initial request to the enactment of annual appropriations in Division D of P.L. 116-93. The Trump Administration's budget proposal for FY2020 was delayed past the deadline outlined in the Budget Act of 1974. The request for the Department of Homeland Security was $51.68 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority, a 4.6% increase from the previous year. The Trump Administration requested additional funding for FEMA and the Coast Guard in FY2019 through the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2019. This included $14.08 billion for FEMA in disaster relief funding and $190 million in Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terror designated funding for the Coast Guard. The House Appropriations Committee marked up H.R. 3931, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2020, which included $52.80 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority. This was $1.12 billion above the Administration's request and $3.39 billion above the enacted level of annual appropriations for FY2019. The bill also included $14.08 billion in disaster relief-designated funding. The House Appropriations Committee-reported Defense Appropriations bill included OCO funding to be transferred to the Coast Guard. Amendments adopted in full committee markup resulted in the initial CBO scoring exceeding the subcommittee allocation by over $3 billion, later revised to $1.9 billion. The Senate Appropriations Committee marked up S. 2582, its version of the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2020, with $53.18 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority, $1.50 billion above the requested level. The Senate Appropriations Committee marked up S. 2582 with $53.18 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority, $1.50 billion above the requested level. The increase in funding was mainly due to additional funding for border barrier construction and more discretionary funding for agencies like the Coast Guard, Transportation Security Administration, and FEMA. The bill also included $17.35 billion for disaster relief and $190 million in OCO-designated funding. Congress passed a continuing resolution (CR) (P.L. 116-59) on September 27, 2019, temporarily extending funding at the FY2019 rate for operations through November 21, subsequently extended through December 20. The CR included provisions addressing needs of DHS under a CR, such as special apportionment of funds for Secret Service expenses related to the FY2020 presidential campaign. Section 133 accelerates apportionment for the Disaster Relief Fund, Section 134 extends National Flood Insurance Program authorization, and Section 135 reallocates funds for DHS management. Immigration provisions are extended by reference. For more details on FY2020 continuing resolutions, refer to CRS Report R45982. On December 16, 2019, the House Rules Committee released the text and explanatory statements for two consolidated appropriations bills. One bill, using H.R. 1158 as a legislative shell, included the FY2020 DHS annual appropriations measure with $50.47 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority. This amount was $1.22 billion below the Administration's request and $1.06 billion above the FY2019 enacted level. The bill also allocated $17.35 billion for FEMA in disaster relief funding and $190 million in additional funds. The homeland security appropriations bill, signed into law as P.L. 116-93, allocated $190 million in Overseas Contingency Operations designated funding to the Coast Guard. The bill passed the House by a vote of 280-138 and the Senate by a vote of 81-11. Discretionary appropriations provide the majority of funding for DHS operations. The DHS budget consists of a mix of funding sources, including disaster relief spending and OCO funding. Appropriations for DHS are typically organized into five titles, with the first four grouping components thematically and the fifth providing general direction. When DHS was established in 2003, components from other agencies were brought together over a few months within ongoing budget cycles. Congress and the Administration continued to provide funding without developing a new appropriations structure for the entire department. In 2014, DHS began working on a new Common Appropriations Structure (CAS) to standardize appropriations format across components. Operating with over 70 different appropriations and 100 Programs, Projects, and Activities hindered transparency and decision-making. After negotiations with Congress, DHS made its first budget request in the CAS. DHS implemented its first budget request in the Common Appropriations Structure for FY2017, converting legacy appropriations to a four-category structure covering Operations and Support, Procurement, Construction, and Improvements, Research and Development, and Federal Assistance for grant funding. The DHS implemented a budget request in FY2017 with a four-category structure covering Operations and Support, Procurement, Construction, and Improvements, Research and Development, and Federal Assistance for grant funding. Some appropriations, like the Federal Protective Service, are not included in these categories. The Federal Protective Service within DHS does not have a specific appropriation amount but can use funds credited to its account. This has a net-zero impact on total discretionary spending. The Coast Guard's Retired Pay appropriation covers retired personnel entitlements, including pensions and medical care, categorized as appropriated mandatory spending. The Retired Pay appropriation covers retired personnel entitlements, including pensions and medical care, categorized as appropriated mandatory spending. The U.S. government has a legal obligation to make these payments, but there is no permanent statutory mechanism in place to provide the funds. FEMA receives a separate appropriation for its disaster relief activities, allowing for more consistent tracking of spending over time. FEMA's disaster assistance spending is tracked consistently over time for transparency. The National Flood Insurance Program has mandatory and discretionary spending for various functions. Operating expenses and salaries are covered by fees collected by the government. In the FY2017 act, appropriations included directions on how budget authority could be used, including operating expenses, salaries, flood insurance operations, commissions, taxes, interest on borrowings, and flood mitigation actions. General provisions provided directions to components. The report tracks changes in administrative and general provisions compared to the prior year's enacted measure, noting dropped, added, and modified provisions due to various reasons such as time passage, enactment of permanent legislation, or member priorities. The report discusses the appropriations provided for the Department of Homeland Security, categorizing its components into Law Enforcement Operational Components, Incident Response and Recovery Operational Components, and Support Components. The Federal Emergency Management Agency and other components of the Department of Homeland Security are discussed in terms of their appropriations and roles. Funding for law enforcement is also mentioned. Funding for law enforcement operational components, including U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), is provided in Title II of the annual DHS appropriations act. CBP secures borders and ports, while ICE focuses on preventing terrorism and illegal movement of people and goods. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) provides security for the U.S. transportation system, the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) is responsible for maritime safety and security, and the U.S. Secret Service (USSS) protects high-profile individuals and their residences. The USSS is responsible for protecting high-profile individuals, their families, residences, and visiting national and world leaders. They also investigate counterfeiting and financial crimes. Budgetary resources for these components are detailed in Table 1. H.R. 3931 reported by the House Appropriations Committee had 31 administrative provisions for Title II, with 21 unchanged from FY2019. The House committee bill dropped eight provisions from the FY2019 act, including Section 208 for ICE funding reprogramming, Section 214 for TSA airport exit lane monitoring, Section 223 for USCG OCO funding allocation, Section 225 for TSA screening pilot program, Section 227 for USCG Operations Systems Center maintenance, and Section 228 for USCG privatization competitions. The Senate Appropriations Committee modified three previously carried administrative provisions and added seven new provisions in S. 2582. One provision was dropped from the FY2019 act, and one was modified, with three new provisions added. P.L. 116-93, Div. D, includes 36 administrative provisions in Title II. Sections 225 and 232 from the FY2019 act were dropped, four provisions were modified, and six new administrative provisions were included. Funding for operational components focused on incident response and recovery is generally found in Title III of the annual DHS appropriations act, including funding for FEMA. The DHS appropriations act includes funding for FEMA, the largest budget of any DHS component, driven by disaster programs authorized under the Stafford Act. Title III also includes funding for the newly restructured Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), with a shift of the Federal Protective Service to the Management Directorate. CISA, formerly NPPD, promotes information sharing for cybersecurity and infrastructure resilience. FEMA leads efforts to protect the US from disasters. Budget breakdown for these agencies is in Table 4. Table 4 provides a breakdown of budgetary resources for response, recovery, and mitigation efforts controlled through appropriations legislation, including separate funding for FEMA within Title III and non-Title III sources. H.R. 3931 had eight administrative provisions in Title III, with five unchanged from FY2019. Administrative provisions in Title III of S. 2582 were modified and added, allowing governors to resubmit requests for individual assistance for certain disasters. Two provisions were dropped, including one requiring a report on cost assessment methods for countermeasures and another raising the federal share of costs for wildfire disasters. The Senate Appropriations Committee dropped three administrative provisions from Title III of S. 2582, including waivers for SAFER Act grants. P.L. 116-93, Div. D, included seven administrative provisions in Title III, with modifications and new provisions compared to the FY2019 act. The House Appropriations Committee bill did not include a new provision, and modified administrative provisions are tracked in Table 5. Funding for support components is typically in Title IV of the annual DHS appropriations bill. Changes in funding for some appropriations may seem more significant when expressed as a percentage. USCIS administers U.S. immigration laws, while FLETC provides technical training for law enforcement professionals. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) provides training for law enforcement professionals from federal, state, and local agencies. The Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) leads research and development for DHS, while the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office (CWMD) focuses on defending against weapons of mass destruction. Budgetary resources for these components are detailed in Table 6. H.R. 3931 and S. 2582 included administrative provisions for budgetary resources provided to components controlled through appropriations legislation. H.R. 3931 dropped two provisions and added two new ones, while S. 2582 had nine provisions. The Senate Appropriations Committee dropped one provision from Title IV in S. 2582, while adding two new provisions. P.L. 116-93 included seven administrative provisions in Title IV, dropping Sections 402 and 408 from the FY2019 act and adding one new provision. New administrative provisions proposed by the appropriations committees are outlined in Table 7. Funding for headquarters components in the annual DHS appropriations act is typically in Title I, with some initiatives funded through general provisions. The Office of the Secretary and Executive Management (OSEM) provides central leadership, while the Departmental Management Directorate (DM) offers DHS-wide mission support services. Analysis and Operations (A&O) includes the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) and the Office of Operations Coordination, which share intelligence to identify and respond to threats. The Office of Inspector General (OIG) is an independent body that reports on DHS efficiency and effectiveness, working to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. Table 8 breaks down budgetary resources for DHS components controlled through appropriations legislation. The Management Directorate's budget includes funding from Title I and outside sources, with separate lines for each component. Changes in administrative provisions for DHS headquarters components in H.R. 3931 include dropping two requirements. The budget and staffing report, Section 106 reporting requirement on visa overstay data, and modifications to administrative provisions were discussed. A new provision to create an Immigration Detention Ombudsman was added in the House bill. The Senate Appropriations Committee retained all six previously enacted provisions without changes in S. 2582. P.L. 116-93, Div. D, includes seven administrative provisions with no dropped provisions. The House Appropriations Committee bill included a new provision to create an Immigration Detention Ombudsman with minor modifications. The annual DHS appropriations act contains general provisions that provide guidance or structure to DHS appropriations, with little more than updates to effective dates or amounts. The FY2019 DHS appropriations act included 40 general provisions. The DHS appropriations act included 36 general provisions in H.R. 3931, with four new additions and modifications to existing provisions. Six provisions from the FY2019 act were not retained in the House committee version, including restrictions on Guantanamo Bay detainee transfers and funds for financial systems modernization. The Senate Appropriations Committee's report on S. 2582 included provisions such as funding for financial systems modernization, reductions in administrative spending, and restrictions on implementing the Arms Trade Treaty. There were 36 general provisions in Title V, with one added and one modified from the previous year. The Senate committee's bill modified provisions from the FY2019 act for DHS, including reductions in Operations and Support appropriations and rescissions of prior-year appropriations. Three provisions were dropped, including funding for financial systems modernization and grants for local law enforcement costs for Presidential protection. P.L. 116-93, Div. D, included 40 general provisions in Title V, with two provisions dropped from the FY2019 DHS Appropriations Act. The last four provisions provided rescissions totaling over $750 million in various balances across DHS. In FY2019, P.L. 116-93, Div. D included rescissions of almost $19 million in lapsed balances and $300 million from the Disaster Relief Fund. New policy-related general provisions were outlined in Tables 9 and 10. Funding for Financial Systems Modernization and Presidential Residence Protection costs were included in Title V, managed by DHS Office of the Chief Information Officer and FEMA respectively. In FY2019, P.L. 116-93, Div. D included $41 million for Presidential Residence Protection Cost Grants in Title V, managed by FEMA. H.R. 3931 did not include separate funding for Financial Systems Modernization. S. 2582 did not provide additional appropriations for any DHS activities in Title V. Rescissions of prior-year appropriations reducing the net funding level were also included in the bill. For FY2019, P.L. 116-6 included $303 million in rescissions and directed $300 million of DRF unobligated balances to offset new DRF appropriations. The Administration proposed rescinding $250 million in prior-year funding from the DRF not dedicated to major disasters. H.R. 3931 included $657 million in rescissions from other appropriations, with the largest cut coming from CBP's PC&I appropriation for FY2019. S. 2582 included $62 million in provisions to reduce the bill's score, with the largest cut being $33 million in administrative costs by DHS. P.L. 116-93, Div. D, included $754 million in rescissions, including $300 million from unobligated balances in the DRF and $233 million from CBP appropriations for humanitarian care and facility improvements. Perspectives on FY2020 DHS appropriations can be found in CRS reports such as R45972, R44604, and R44052. Congressional clients can consult CRS experts directly for more information. The federal government spending process involves budget authority enactment by Congress, fund obligation by agencies, and payments for activities. Budget authority is established through appropriations acts or direct spending legislation and determines the amounts available for federal agencies to spend. The Antideficiency Act prohibits agencies from obligating more funds than enacted by Congress. Budget authority may be indefinite in amount and available on a one-year, multiyear, or no-year basis. Budget authority can be one-year, multiyear, or no-year. One-year authority is for a specific fiscal year, multiyear specifies a time range for spending, and no-year authority is indefinite. Obligations are incurred when agencies spend on personnel, contracts, services, creating a legal payment requirement. Outlays are the actual funds spent during the fiscal year. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and authorize payments from the Treasury. Outlays represent the funds actually spent during the fiscal year, which may not always match the budget authority enacted. Discretionary funded agencies and programs, as well as appropriated entitlement programs, are funded annually through appropriations acts. Gross budget authority encompasses both discretionary and mandatory spending. Gross budget authority includes discretionary and mandatory spending. Discretionary spending is annually appropriated by Congress, while mandatory spending is provided in laws outside of appropriations acts. Within DHS, Coast Guard retirement pay is an example of appropriated mandatory spending. Offsetting Collections are funds collected by the federal government as part of business-type transactions, not considered federal revenue but counted as negative outlays. DHS net discretionary budget authority is composed of discretionary spending minus any fees or funds collected. The DHS budget includes mandatory entitlement programs like the Secret Service and Coast Guard retired pay accounts. Some entitlements are funded by permanent appropriations. The DHS budget includes mandatory entitlement programs like Secret Service and Coast Guard retirement pay accounts, funded by permanent or annual appropriations. Additionally, the budget contains offsetting Trust and Public Enterprise Funds, not appropriated by Congress, used to calculate gross budget authority. The congressional budget process determines annual appropriations, including for DHS, through a two-stage process. Congress sets spending totals in the annual budget resolution, which are then allocated among committees as 302(a) allocations for enactment in annual appropriations bills. Appropriations committees further allocate these discretionary funds among subcommittees for bill development. The appropriations committees allocate 302(a) discretionary funds among subcommittees for appropriations bills, known as 302(b) allocations. These allocations must not exceed the 302(a) allocation to enforce budget discipline. Adjustments can be made during the year by the appropriations committee. Table A-1 shows the 302(b) allocation for FY2020. Table A-1 displays the 302(b) allocation for FY2020, based on various budget figures. Amendments in the House markup of the FY2020 DHS appropriations bill initially exceeded the allocation by $3.066 billion, later revised to $1.9 billion. These provisions were not included in the final FY2020 DHS appropriations act. The Budget Control Act established discretionary spending caps for defense and nondefense spending from FY2012 through FY2021. Subsequent legislation amended these caps, including adjustments for overseas contingency operations, emergency spending, and disaster relief. Most of the DHS budget is considered nondefense spending. The Budget Control Act established discretionary spending caps for defense and nondefense spending from FY2012 through FY2021, with adjustments for overseas contingency operations, emergency spending, and disaster relief. DHS's appropriations process has been influenced by three justifications outlined in the Act, including relief and appropriations for continuing disability reviews and control of health care fraud and abuse. The allowable adjustment for disaster relief was determined by the Office of Management and Budget using a specific formula until FY2019. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 amended the formula for cap adjustment for the fiscal year, increasing the allowable size by adding 5% of emergency-designated funding for major disasters under the Stafford Act. Unused adjustment capacity now carries over indefinitely, rather than for just one year. OMB released a sequestration preview report for FY2020 in August 2019. The OMB released a sequestration preview report for FY2020, estimating an allowable adjustment of $17.5 billion, the second-largest for disaster relief. The estimate includes the 10-year average, 5% of Stafford Act spending since 2012, and carryover from the previous year. The final adjustment for FY2020 may vary from this estimate."
