    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Telecommuting and Air Quality Act\" and includes a grant program for designing a pilot program to improve air quality through telecommuting. The Secretary of Transportation will grant a nonprofit entity to design a pilot program for improving air quality through telecommuting. The National Environmental Policy Institute may receive the grant if they apply. The Secretary will collaborate with the EPA and Energy Secretary to implement a program for ozone precursor credit-trading. Participating employers who allow telecommuting will be part of the pilot program. The term \"regulated entities\" refers to entities regulated under the Clean Air Act for emissions of ozone precursors, which are air pollutants that contribute to ground-level ozone. VMTs stands for vehicle-miles-traveled. The program involves implementing a credit-trading program for ozone precursors in collaboration with the EPA and Energy Secretary, with participating employers offering telecommuting options. The proposed pilot program aims to evaluate methods for calculating reductions in ozone precursor emissions through reduced vehicle-miles-traveled by telecommuting employees. Participating employers can transfer estimated emission reductions as credits. The pilot program allows employers to transfer emission credits achieved through reduced vehicle-miles-traveled by telecommuting employees. A commercial trading forum is available for public trading and exchanging of these credits with regulated entities. Regulated entities can obtain emission credits and present them to the Federal Government or State for compliance under the Clean Air Act. The Federal Government will explore ways to facilitate the transfer of emission credits between entities. The Secretary will ensure recommendations for a pilot program in specific geographic areas, including the greater metropolitan regions of Washington D.C. and Los Angeles. The Secretary will select three additional areas in consultation with the grantee in Los Angeles, California. The grantee must consult with local governments and business organizations in the selected geographic areas. The Secretary will require the grantee to study and report on the design under subsection (a). The grantee must study and report on the potential significance of the proposed pilot program for expanding telecommuting and reducing VMTs in selected geographic areas. The program's positive effects on transportation policies, energy conservation, air quality, and quality of life should be evaluated. Authorization of Appropriations: $250,000 authorized for fiscal year 2000 for grants to improve quality of life."
