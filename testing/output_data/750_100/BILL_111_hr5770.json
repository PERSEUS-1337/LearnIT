    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment Implementation Act of 2010\". It includes findings related to Arctic marine shipping. The Congress finds that the Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas are becoming more accessible to shipping due to various factors, and it is in the interests of the United States to work with Alaska and neighboring countries to ensure safe shipping in the region. The United States aims to ensure safe and secure shipping in the Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas, protecting the environment and respecting the rights of longstanding users of Arctic resources. The United States aims to establish international cooperation for reliable shipping in the Arctic, including aids to navigation, ports of refuge, communication, mapping, and search and rescue capabilities. The United States seeks international cooperation for safe shipping in the Arctic, including navigation aids, ports of refuge, communication, mapping, and search and rescue capabilities. Coordinated shipping regulations are necessary to protect U.S. interests in the region, similar to existing models like joint administration of the St. Lawrence Seaway with Canada. The United States has interests in the Arctic and Bering Sea regions, including joint administration with Canada and cooperation with Russia for fisheries enforcement. The Coast Guard's icebreaker platforms are crucial for research, security, and commercial activities in the Arctic, but the aging Polar Class icebreakers need replacement. US sovereign interests in the Arctic Ocean may increase with the submission of a proposal. The United States may grow its interests in the Arctic and Bering Sea regions by submitting a claim for an extended continental shelf. Initiatives such as building new icebreakers, coordinating shipping regulations, and enhancing oil spill response capabilities through international cooperation are essential. Starting these efforts now, following the completion of an Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment by the Arctic Council, is crucial. The Arctic Council's assessment is crucial to protect US interests in the Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas, where many nations currently operate vessels. SEC. 3. ARCTIC MARINE SHIPPING ASSESSMENT IMPLEMENTATION. The purpose of this section is to ensure safe and secure maritime shipping in the Arctic, including aids to navigation, vessel escorts, spill response capability, and maritime search and rescue. The Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard operates is encouraged to enter into agreements with other Arctic nations through the International Maritime Organization to promote coordinated action. Arctic nations must ensure aids to navigation, marine safety, oil spill response, vessel tracking, and search and rescue capabilities in the Arctic. The Committee on the Maritime Transportation System will coordinate domestic transportation policies in the Arctic to support these efforts. The Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating may enter agreements or contracts to promote safe maritime navigation through icebreaking in the Arctic. The Secretary of Transportation may conduct demonstration projects to reduce emissions from vessels in the Arctic and train mariners for ice navigation and Arctic operations. Authorization of Appropriations:\n- $5,000,000 annually for Arctic seasonal operations from 2011 to 2015\n- $10,000,000 annually from 2012 to 2015 for agreements under subsection (d)\n- $5,000,000 annually from 2011 to 2015 for demonstration projects under subsection (f) conducted by the Secretary of Transportation. The Commandant of the Coast Guard will conduct a cost-benefit analysis of extending the service life of existing icebreakers or constructing new ones for Arctic polar ice-breaking missions. The Coast Guard will analyze the impact of extending the service life of existing icebreakers or building new ones for Arctic missions through 2020. The Coast Guard will analyze the impact of extending the service life of existing icebreakers or building new ones for Arctic missions through 2020, with a focus on recapitalization of the icebreaker fleet if not fully funded. Reports to Congress are required within 90 days of the completion of the ongoing High Latitude Study. The Commandant will submit reports to Congress containing study results and recommendations on icebreaker fleet recapitalization within 1 year of this Act's enactment. The Commandant will submit reports to Congress with recommendations on icebreaker fleet recapitalization to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the House of Representatives Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. SEC. 4. ASSESSMENT OF NEEDS FOR ADDITIONAL COAST GUARD PRESENCE IN HIGH LATITUDE REGIONS. The Secretary of the department overseeing the Coast Guard must submit a report within 270 days to assess the need for more Coast Guard capabilities in high latitude regions, covering various mission areas like search and rescue, marine pollution response, fisheries enforcement, and maritime commerce. The report must assess the high latitude operating capabilities of current Coast Guard assets, projected needs for forward operating bases, shore infrastructure requirements, and the need for icebreaking capability in high latitude regions. The report will evaluate the Coast Guard's high latitude icebreaking fleet's performance, capability to meet future goals, and the condition of assets affecting mission performance. It will also include acquisition cost estimates for necessary assets and shore infrastructure. The report will include detailed cost estimates for high latitude icebreaking capability to meet mission performance goals, including renovating and modernizing the Coast Guard's existing fleet. The report will include cost estimates to renovate and modernize the Coast Guard's existing high latitude icebreaking fleet and replace it. The term \"Arctic\" in this Act is defined the same as in the Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984."
