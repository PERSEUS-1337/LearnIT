    "content": "Significant amounts of technically recoverable oil and gas resources are projected to be on federal public lands, but energy development on some restricted areas is limited due to environmental concerns. These areas may still contain substantial oil and gas reserves. The conflict between environmental protection and the need for increased domestic energy production from public lands is a major policy issue addressed in legislation such as the omnibus energy bill (H.R. 6) and Senate substitute S. 2095. The Senate substitute, S. 2095, includes provisions to examine restrictions on oil and gas development on public lands, including the permitting process. The Bush Administration also has initiatives to expedite oil and gas permitting on federal lands. Debate over oil and gas development practices on public lands has been ongoing since the 1872 Mining Law allowed for the transfer of resources to private ownership. In 1909, President Taft withdrew 3 million acres of lands prospective for oil in Wyoming and California from availability under the Mining Law of 1872. This led to the Pickett Act of 1910, which recognized executive branch authority to make public land withdrawals. The Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920 removed defense-related minerals, including oil and gas, from private ownership. The Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920 removed oil and gas from the patenting process, placing it under a leasing system. This system has generated billions in revenues for the federal government through royalties, rents, and bonus bids. Split-estate situations arise when minerals are owned by the federal government under privately held lands, creating various scenarios such as different private interests holding surface and mineral rights, or state-owned mineral rights with privately held surface rights. Federal statutes allow the government to issue patents for land while reserving mineral rights. Under federal statutes, patents for land can be issued while reserving mineral rights, making the mineral estate dominant over the surface use. Specific policies must be followed by mineral estate holders to develop minerals, such as obtaining surface agreements, consent from surface owners, payment for damages, or posting a bond. Approximately 11% of public lands are split-estate, with higher percentages in Wyoming and Montana. Environmentalists have shown support for these policies. Environmentalists and ranchers in Montana have expressed concerns about the impact of development on water and land, while development supporters argue that existing environmental laws regulate oil and gas development on public lands. The federal government must comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) in leasing oil and gas, and the industry must meet applicable requirements. The oil and gas industry must comply with environmental laws such as the Clean Water and Clean Air Acts, Safe Drinking Water Act, and state and federal reclamation standards. The industry faces delays in drilling due to environmental and other reviews. The proposed energy bill addresses concerns over increasing domestic oil and natural gas supplies by establishing a White House Office of Federal Project Coordination. The proposed energy bill aims to establish a White House Office of Federal Project Coordination to expedite permitting on public lands for resource development. Environmentalists and public land users are concerned about potential harm to the environment. The Senate's substitute bill, S. 2095, is awaiting action. The curr_chunk provides an overview of the oil and gas leasing system on U.S. public lands, covering permitting, production, and reserves. It discusses the contribution of onshore oil and gas to U.S. energy demand and estimates reserves in restricted areas. The Appendix includes historical background on lands withdrawn from mineral development, the role of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and the application of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) in oil and gas development. For information on U.S. offshore oil and gas development, refer to CRS Report RL31521. In FY2002, the federal government issued 1,765 new oil and gas leases on public lands totaling about 1.4 million acres, based on Resource Management Plans developed by the Bureau of Land Management. Industry has complained about the lengthy process of obtaining drilling permits for exploratory or production wells. In FY2002, 1,765 new oil and gas leases were issued on public lands totaling 1.4 million acres. The Bureau of Land Management develops Resource Management Plans for tracts of public lands prior to development, considering environmental impacts. RMPs cover large areas and must reflect diverse uses such as timber, grazing, wildlife conservation, recreation, and energy. The Bureau of Land Management develops Resource Management Plans for public lands, considering various uses such as timber, grazing, wildlife conservation, recreation, and energy. The plans weigh the impacts of different uses and aim to serve the community's best interests while complying with environmental regulations and allowing public participation. The BLM determines which lands with oil and gas potential will be available for leasing through the planning process. The Bureau of Land Management offers public lands for lease through competitive bidding to ensure a fair market value return to the government. If no bids meet the minimum acceptable bid of $2/acre, noncompetitive leasing is offered within 30 days. Tracts are available for noncompetitive leasing for two years, with a nonrefundable application fee of at least $75. Payment of a nonrefundable application fee of at least $75 is required for lease applications. Simultaneous noncompetitive applications are prioritized through a lottery system. Geophysical exploration permits on unleased public lands may be issued by BLM, with specific compliance requirements. Once a lease is obtained, the lessee is given exclusive rights. Once a lease is obtained from the surface managing agency, the lessee is granted exclusive rights to explore, develop, and produce on the land. An Application for a Permit to Drill (APD) must be approved for each oil and gas well, including a drilling plan, surface use plan, and bond/surety coverage. The Secretary must analyze and approve a plan of operations for proposed surface-disturbing activities within the lease area. The APD for each oil and gas well must include a drilling plan, surface use plan, and bond/surety coverage. The surface use plan details drillpad location, construction, waste disposal, and reclamation plans. The BLM reviews the APD for 30 days, consults with the surface managing agency, and processes the application within 35 days, with possible outcomes of approval, approval with stipulations, rejection, or delay for additional information. The applicant is notified of the final action expected. The Independent Petroleum Association of Mountain States (IPAMS) found that in its region, it took an average of 137 days to approve an Application for Permit to Drill (APD) in 2002, up from 84 days in 2001. Delays in APD approval are often due to the need to update outdated Resource Management Plans (RMPs) to accommodate increased natural gas leasing and development activities. Oil and gas leases awarded under old RMPs may need to be revised. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is currently revising several old Resource Management Plans (RMPs) to accommodate increased natural gas leasing and development activities. According to the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA), the Secretary of the Interior must develop, maintain, and revise land use plans with public involvement. This process includes preparing an environmental impact statement (EIS) under the National Environmental Policy Act before approving an RMP. The Bureau of Land Management is revising Resource Management Plans to accommodate natural gas leasing. The process includes issuing a draft EIS for public comment, approving the RMP, and filing it with the EPA. IPAMS testified that rewriting RMPs now takes up to three years, compared to less than a year in the past. The usefulness of an RMP is now seven years, down from potentially 20 years. Rapid coalbed methane development has raised new land use concerns not previously addressed in RMPs. Environmentalists argue that the 20-year-old Resource Management Plans (RMPs) are outdated for land management decisions, causing delays in site-specific analysis for drilling permits by the BLM. In response, the BLM announced strategies in April 2003 to expedite the permit process by processing multiple applications simultaneously. The BLM is implementing strategies to expedite the permit process for oil and gas leasing on public lands, including conducting environmental analyses, developing area development plans, and revising relevant manuals. Public lands are categorized as open under standard lease terms, open with restrictions, or closed to leasing. Areas closed to leasing are due to land withdrawals or other mechanisms. Some federal lands are closed to oil and gas leasing due to land withdrawals or other mechanisms, including wilderness areas, national parks, monuments, and environmentally sensitive areas. Other areas are closed for land use planning, NEPA compliance, endangered species habitat, or historical sites. Future administrative decisions may open some of these restricted areas. Approximately 165 million acres of federal subsurface minerals were withdrawn from mineral entry, leasing, and sale in 2000. Lands in the National Park System, Wilderness Preservation System, and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge are among those statutorily withdrawn. Another 182 million acres of mineral development required approval from the surface management agency and must not conflict with land designations and plans. Wildlife refuges, wilderness study areas, and roadless areas are examples of lands subject to these restrictions. Public lands open to leasing may have restrictions imposed by the Department of the Interior, such as no surface occupancy, timing limitations to protect wildlife, and controlled surface use with mitigation plans. Industry sources argue that these restrictions can effectively close off areas to oil drilling. Some lease stipulations act as de facto closures to oil and gas development, but development has still proceeded under them. Industry representatives argue that federal withdrawals hinder exploration and limit reserves, while environmental groups believe withdrawals are necessary to protect non-mineral values of public lands. The Rocky Mountain region contributes significantly to natural gas and crude oil production. The Rocky Mountain region is a focal point for U.S. oil and gas policy due to its significant contribution to natural gas and crude oil production on public lands. About 60% of the undiscovered resource base in the region is on public lands, with 40% of that amount not accessible or subject to lease stipulations and restrictions. Three recent reports have studied restrictions on natural gas in the Rocky Mountain region: Natural Gas, Volume 1 Summary Report by the National Petroleum Council (NPC); 1999. Energy Policy and Conservation Act Amendments (EPCA) study, 2003; U.S. Natural Gas Markets: Mid-term Prospects for Natural Gas Supply, 2001, by the EIA. The EIA and NPC studies include data for total domestic natural gas supplies, while the EPCA Report focuses on five major geologic basins within the region. The most direct comparison of data on the Rocky Mountain region would be between the EIA and NPC studies. The natural gas resource base in the Rocky Mountain region is estimated to be around 335 trillion cubic feet (tcf) according to the 1999 NPC study and 293.6 tcf according to more recent EIA data. The EPCA study found 138.5 tcf in the five major geologic basins in the region. The relative amounts of natural gas closed and restricted are similar across the studies. The EIA report and NPC studies show similar amounts of natural gas closed and restricted, with differences in the open leasing percentages. The EIA data indicates 11.5% closed, 37% restricted, and 51.5% open for leasing, while the NPC reports 9% closed, 32% restricted, and 60% open. The discrepancy in open leasing may be due to excluded proven reserves available for leasing. The EIA report and NPC studies show similar amounts of natural gas closed and restricted, with differences in the open leasing percentages. About 26 tcf of proven reserves are on federal lands out of 43 tcf total in the five major geologic basins, with 63% open under standard lease terms. The Rocky Mountain reserves could increase the open leasing percentage and decrease restrictions. Oil resources in the Rocky Mountains have less significance for U.S. oil supply, with 600 million barrels falling under \"no access\" and 3.2 billion barrels available for leasing. The EPCA study estimates that about 2.5 billion barrels of oil are available on non-federal lands in the studied basins, representing 7% of all technically recoverable oil in the United States. The study also shows that 11.6% have no access, 26% have restrictions, and the amount of natural gas under standard lease is less. The NPC and EIA studies suggest that developing natural gas in restricted land use areas would likely face costly delays. The EIA report indicates that with greater flexibility in federal regulations, 29 tcf of gas could become immediately available, and removing certain lease stipulations could make 51 tcf easier to develop, totaling 80 tcf. Environmental groups argue that most restrictions are ecologically justified. Environmental groups argue that there is an ecological basis for most restrictions on natural gas development in the Rocky Mountain region, with 41% of gas resources either closed or restricted. Policy disagreements exist regarding the importance of these reserves in meeting U.S. energy needs. The Rocky Mountain region holds an estimated 37% of the unproved technically recoverable natural gas in the US, with an estimated 108 tcf currently restricted. If produced, it could last 20-30 years meeting 15% of US demand. US natural gas demand is currently met by OCS (25%), imports (15%), Rocky Mountain region (15%), and other onshore (45%). The Wilderness Society (TWS) testified that the US has enough natural gas supply to meet domestic needs for the next 40 years, with 1,351 tcf of natural gas potentially available for future development. The NPC report estimates that 16% of the 1,351 tcf of natural gas cited by TWS is subject to restrictions. The NPC argues that 70 tcf of Rocky Mountain natural gas could be brought into production in the near term by resolving impediments and relaxing land-use constraints. The RAND Corporation suggests relaxing land-use constraints to allow for more drilling on federal lands in the intermountain west, focusing on the reserve category of the resource base. They argue that access restrictions should only be considered for the most viable resource category. The RAND Corporation suggests relaxing land-use constraints for more drilling on federal lands in the intermountain west, focusing on the most viable resource category. Total U.S. oil production is forecast to decline annually, with oil imports estimated to make up 65% of total supply in 2025. Total natural gas production increased from 17.8 tcf in 1993 to 19.4 tcf in 2002. In 2002, oil production from federal onshore leases was estimated at 5.4% of all U.S. oil production, with Wyoming, New Mexico, and California being the top three states for onshore federal oil production. Oil production from onshore federal leases has generally been in decline over the past 10 years. U.S. production of natural gas varied between 18-20 tcf annually between 1993-2002. U.S. natural gas production is projected to reach 20-24.3 tcf by 2025, with imports from Canada expected to decrease due to declining production and increased domestic use. LNG imports are forecasted to rise significantly by 2025. U.S. Oil Production in 2002 saw an increase in gas production on public lands, with New Mexico and Wyoming being the top two states contributing 85% of the total. The federal onshore share of total U.S. domestic oil and gas production is expected to remain stable in the near term. The FY2003 estimate from the Mineral Revenues Report shows that U.S. oil reserves were 22.7 billion barrels as of December 31, 2002, with Texas leading in both oil and natural gas reserves. U.S. oil reserves have declined by 1.2 billion barrels over the past 10 years, while production declined by 500 million barrels. In 2001, 2.5 billion barrels of recoverable oil were discovered, three times greater than the average annual discovery since 1976. In 2002, oil discoveries in the United States were about 950 million barrels, which was 6% over the annual average since 1976. The technically recoverable onshore and state offshore oil resources are estimated at 92 billion barrels, but not all of it is likely to be recoverable. The rate of oil production is expected to continue declining over the long term. The United States has seen an increase in gas reserves by 16.5 tcf since 1991, with production also rising. Gas imports have risen to 17% from 9% in 1991. Annual discoveries were 70% above the average since 1976. Technically recoverable gas resources are estimated to be about 1,000 tcf, over five times the current proved reserves. Over two-thirds of onshore natural gas is on nonfederal land for exploration. The 2002 assessment shows 1.9 billion barrels of oil, 183 tcf of gas, and 3.1 billion barrels of gas liquids as undiscovered resources in Rocky Mountain basins. 90% of undiscovered gas is unconventional, with 25% being coalbed methane. Public lands in the Rocky Mountain region hold 53.6% of oil and gas liquids reserves and 60.1% of natural gas reserves. Recent estimates by the EIA indicate that federal onshore oil accounts for 12.5% of all technically recoverable oil, while natural gas on public lands makes up 22.3% of all technically recoverable gas. Undiscovered conventional oil is estimated at 30.1 billion barrels and conventional natural gas at 319.7 trillion cubic feet. Additionally, undiscovered unconventional natural gas resources are estimated at 358.7 trillion cubic feet. Coalbed methane gas is also mentioned in the data. Coalbed methane gas, a natural gas trapped in coalbeds, can be extracted by removing water through pumping, allowing the gas to flow. Concerns about groundwater contamination have been raised due to varying water quality in coal beds. Water pumped out of coal beds can vary in quality and can be discharged for reuse if sufficiently fresh. If the water does not meet reuse standards, it can be disposed of through subsurface injection or surface discharge into wetlands, streams, or impoundments. Water quality and disposal are significant concerns in coalbed methane (CBM) production. A tax credit in 1980 incentivized CBM development, leading to a four-fold increase in production since 1991. In 2002, coalbed gas accounted for 8% of natural gas production in the United States. In 2002, 10,000 CBM wells in the United States produced 1.65 million barrels of water per day. The leading producers are in New Mexico, Colorado, and Wyoming. DOE estimates that out of the 39,000 new wells anticipated by 2010, 23,900 will be on federal lands. CBM reserves are largely undeveloped, with only about 100 tcf of coalbed methane classified as economically recoverable out of an estimated 700 tcf in the United States. The Rocky Mountain region has 293 tcf of unproved technically recoverable unconventional fuels, with 46 tcf being coalbed methane. Coalbed methane proved reserves were 18.5 tcf in 2001, doubling since 1991. Colorado and New Mexico hold over half of U.S. CBM reserves, with Wyoming, Utah, and Alabama also having significant reserves. The San Juan Basin is the most productive, while the Warrior Basin in Alabama is the second most productive. The Powder River Basin (PRB) in the Rocky Mountain region has 39 tcf of coalbed methane (CBM) resources, with most production occurring on private lands. Surface owners in Wyoming have concerns about fair compensation and agreements with mineral lessees. In Wyoming, the Wyoming Split-Estate Initiative was established in 2002 to address conflicts between surface owners and mineral owners or lessees, focusing on compensation for damages from CBM production. Environmental concerns include land disturbance, water issues, and infrastructure related to CBM production. The process of hydraulic fracturing for CBM production has raised concerns about the impact of injected fluids on underground drinking water. A draft EPA report found no evidence of contamination from CBM hydraulic fracturing, but expressed concern over the use of diesel fuel as an injection fluid. Major issues include surface infrastructure, water removal, effects on the water table, salinity levels, and disposal of water that may affect wildlife and surface water resources. The EPA expressed concern over the use of diesel fuel as an injection fluid for hydraulic fracturing due to its harmful chemicals. An agreement was made in 2003 to end this practice. Proposed energy legislation may prevent the EPA from regulating underground injection of fluids. Dennis Hemmer stated that most water from CBM production does not contaminate surface supplies. CBM production results in water discharges of 602 million barrels annually, with concerns about pollution of drinking water and groundwater contamination. Holding ponds used for wastewater treatment are unlined and may leak into groundwater, impacting the water table and wildlife water sources. The Wildlife Management Institute of Washington D.C. raises concerns about the impact of CBM production on wildlife habitats and water sources. BLM requires CBM producers to drill monitoring wells at a cost of $50,000 each to monitor groundwater quality and quantity. After BLM review, it was established that one set of wells (one shallow and one deep) is required per four townships with CBM leases to monitor water quality and levels. On private lands, monitoring wells are not required. The Interior Board of Land Appeals invalidated three leases in April 2002 due to insufficient evaluation of environmental issues related to CBM production. Supplemental environmental assessments were prepared for the Powder River Basin to guide CBM development in approved leasing areas, allowing more drilling to occur. The Wyoming Outdoor Council sued BLM to withdraw leases in the Powder River Basin due to a violation of an IBLA ruling. BLM halted lease sales on public lands with high CBM content while the ruling was being interpreted. The IBLA ruling was interpreted by Bureau attorneys and dismissed on December 18, 2003. The Wyoming BLM office finalized a new EA and RMP, anticipating approving 39,000 permits for new wells over a 10-year period. The DOI made a decision to begin issuing permits in July 2003. Demand for oil is forecasted to rise 1.6% annually to 28 mbd by 2025, with imports projected to reach nearly 65%. U.S. demand for natural gas is expected to rise 1.4% annually, reaching 31.4 tcf by 2025. The outlook for increased oil and natural gas production from leases on U.S. public lands is mixed. The Bush Administration has initiated actions to ease restrictions on domestic natural gas production from public lands. Opposition to these initiatives is uncertain, with challenges based on alleged violations of BLM's multiple-use mandate. Areas statutorily removed would require congressional action to change their status. Production of conventional natural gas is expected to increase on available lands. The Bush Administration has initiated actions to ease restrictions on domestic natural gas production from public lands. Production of conventional natural gas is expected to remain steady on available lands, with more wells and deeper wells being drilled. Onshore unconventional natural gas is forecasted to increase its share by 2025. The industry is concerned about access to federal lands and expediting the permitting process, while environmental groups are worried about potential damage to sensitive lands and wildlife habitats. The United States is expected to meet energy demand through a combination of increased domestic output and higher imports, with the Rocky Mountain region potentially contributing 40% of natural gas production by 2025. There may be a greater reliance on natural gas imports, including LNG from stable countries and deepwater OCS production. Exploration and development efforts by oil and gas firms worldwide are ongoing, considering factors such as resource base, political stability, and financing. The United States considers factors like political stability and resource base when making investment decisions. Public land use decisions must also consider environmental and societal impacts. Competitive lease terms include maximum acreage limits, minimum bonus bids, and bond requirements. Noncompetitive leases have different terms with no minimum bid and a longer term. The onshore leasing program in the United States requires a $75 application filing fee and a $10,000 bond requirement. Rents and royalties for competitive and noncompetitive leases are specified, with royalties not less than 12.5% of production value. Revenues from the program, including bonus bids, rents, and royalties, are collected by the Minerals Management Service and distributed to states. Revenues from federal oil and gas leases are collected by the Minerals Management Service and distributed to states. States receive a percentage of the revenues, with Alaska receiving 90%. The number of federal oil and gas leases in 2001 was 23,000 covering over 17 million acres of federal public lands. The National Park System (NPS) was established in 1916 to conserve natural and historic objects for future generations. Initially, the NPS philosophy differed from the Forest Service (FS) philosophy, which focused on resource use. Early tension arose between conservationists promoting National Parks and utilitarians promoting National Forests in the early 1900s. The debate focused on the President's authority to make land withdrawal orders based on national security, changing land designation from available to unavailable for various activities. The President acted as the chief custodian of public lands, resolving conflicts based on the greatest good for the greatest number of people in the long run. The President, with tacit approval of Congress, has the authority to withdraw public lands from private sector entry. This power has been exercised through various acts such as the Antiquities Act of 1906, the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934, and the Wilderness Act of 1964. The President can create national monuments under the Antiquities Act, reserving the smallest area necessary for protection. The Taylor Grazing Act withdrew 140 million acres from homesteading laws, while the Organic Act regulated recreation areas. FLPMA allows withdrawals by the executive branch or Congress. The Wilderness Act requires the Forest Service to study designated primitive areas for wilderness suitability, defining wilderness as off-limits to development to preserve nature's pristine characteristics. Congressional designations as \"wilderness\" are crucial as they cannot be revoked administratively, unlike administrative designations. The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act withdrew large areas of Alaska from resource use pending congressional disposition. The Wilderness Act prohibits federal lands from being designated as wilderness areas without Congressional approval. Withdrawal of public lands can be done by Congress, the executive branch under certain acts, or for specific resources like oil and gas. Congress may withdraw specific resources such as oil, gas, coal, and minerals under the General Mining Law of 1872. There is also a \"general congressional\" withdrawal that allows lands to be removed from development pending final disposition. Modern executive withdrawals are governed by FLPMA, which established a federal land use management policy with public and congressional input. FLPMA details procedures for sales, acquisitions, withdrawals, and exchanges of public lands. Under FLPMA, withdrawals of public lands can be temporary or permanent and require congressional approval for parcels exceeding 5,000 acres. Proposed withdrawals must be submitted to Congress with detailed reports on reasons, economic and environmental impacts, alternatives, consultations with other agencies, and geological/mineral potential. The Secretary of the Interior has the authority to make withdrawals. Under FLPMA, the Secretary of the Interior can make emergency withdrawals of any size for up to three years, with a report due three months after the withdrawal. The law mandates a review of public land withdrawals in 11 Western states to assess the continuation of existing withdrawals. The Secretary can determine if the continuation of withdrawals aligns with the statutory objectives of the programs under which the lands were dedicated. BLM is currently reviewing around 70 million withdrawn acres. BLM is reviewing approximately 70 million withdrawn acres, prioritizing 26 million acres for potential return or multiple use. As of November 2000, 7 million acres have been reviewed, with withdrawals on over 6 million acres revoked. Retention of a withdrawal requires a compelling show of need and approval from the BLM Director and Secretary. The BLM is reviewing millions of withdrawn acres, prioritizing some for potential return or multiple use. The review process involves convincing key stakeholders of the need for continued withdrawal or classification, supported by documentation under NEPA. Some lands may be developed for oil and gas resources, while others deemed unsuitable for mineral development will likely remain closed or restricted."
