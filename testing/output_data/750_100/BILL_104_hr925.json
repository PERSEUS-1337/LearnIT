    "content": "The \"Private Property Protection Act of 1995\" ensures that no law or agency action should diminish the value of privately owned property. Federal agencies must exercise authority to prevent such limitations and property owners have the right to compensation. The Federal Government must compensate property owners if an agency action limits property use, reducing its value by 20% or more. Compensation equals the value decrease caused by the action. If the value decreases by over 50%, the owner can choose to sell that portion at fair market value. Compensation paid under this Act cannot be used against agency limitations, even if the action is later rescinded. If the action is rescinded, the owner can choose to refund the compensation to the Treasury and use the property. The Act specifies that no compensation will be provided if a use is considered a nuisance under state law or already prohibited by a local zoning ordinance. There are exceptions outlined in the Act as well. SEC. 5 of the Act outlines exceptions where no compensation shall be made for agency actions aimed at preventing hazards to health or safety, or damage to specific property. Additionally, compensation is not provided for agency actions related to the Federal navigation servitude, except for wetlands. SEC. 6 details the procedure to be followed. An owner must request compensation from the agency within 180 days of receiving notice of the agency action. Negotiations can take place to determine the compensation amount, and if no agreement is reached within 180 days, the owner can choose their remedy. An owner may choose arbitration or civil action for compensation if not received promptly after agency negotiations. Arbitration procedures follow title 9, US Code, with awarded fees and costs to be paid promptly by the agency. An owner who does not receive prompt payment from the agency may seek relief through a civil action. If successful, the agency is liable for attorney's fees, litigation costs, and interest on the compensation. Payments to owners and judgments from civil actions are funded by the agency's annual appropriation. The agency responsible for a payment or judgment can seek reimbursement from another agency's appropriation. The head of the agency can transfer funds if needed, and if there are insufficient funds, they must seek an appropriation for the next fiscal year. SEC. 7. LIMITATION. Any payment under this Act by the United States is subject to the availability of appropriations. SEC. 8. DUTY OF NOTICE TO OWNERS. Agencies must notify property owners affected by limitations on property use, explaining their rights and compensation procedures under this Act. SEC. 9. RULES OF CONSTRUCTION. SEC. 9. RULES OF CONSTRUCTION. This Act does not limit any right to compensation under the Constitution or other US laws. Payment of compensation does not grant the Federal Government any rights except for use limitations resulting from agency action. The term \"property\" in this Act refers to land and includes the right to use or receive water. A use of property is considered limited by an agency action if a legal right to use the property no longer exists due to the action. The term \"agency action\" includes the making of a grant to a public authority conditioned upon an action by the recipient that would constitute a limitation if done directly by the agency. The term \"agency\" is defined in section 551 of title 5, United States Code. The term \"specified regulatory law\" includes various environmental laws such as the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the Food Security Act. The term \"fair market value\" is defined as the most probable price at which property would change hands in a competitive market. This definition is relevant in various Acts such as the Reclamation Acts, the Federal Land Policy Management Act, and the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act. The term \"fair market value\" is the price at which property would change hands in a competitive market between a willing buyer and seller, with reasonable knowledge of relevant facts. The term \"State\" includes the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and other territories of the United States. The term \"law of the State\" includes the law of a political subdivision of a State. The House of Representatives passed the bill on March 3, 1995. Attest: ROBIN H. CARLE, Clerk."
