    "content": "The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is a federal statute that provides funding for special education and related services. It requires states and school districts to offer a free appropriate public education (FAPE) to children with disabilities aged 3 to 21, and to identify, locate, and evaluate all children with disabilities. States and school districts must identify, locate, and evaluate all children with disabilities to determine eligibility for special education services. Each child with a disability must have an individual education program (IEP) outlining specific services. Parents are essential partners in planning and overseeing their child's education. Children with disabilities should be educated alongside non-disabled peers whenever possible, and procedural safeguards are provided to protect their rights. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) ensures procedural safeguards for children with disabilities and their parents, including the right to a due process hearing and appeal to federal court. IDEA was enacted in 1975 to provide education for children with disabilities. The most recent reauthorization was in 2004 under P.L. 108-446, with specific authorizations for appropriations through 2011. Congress is currently starting the process of identifying further updates. The report examines Supreme Court decisions and lower court decisions since July 1, 2005, under P.L. 108-446 of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The IDEA definition of a child with a disability is categorical and requires special education and related services. The term 'child with a disability' under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act includes various conditions like mental retardation, autism, and ADHD, requiring special education services. In Hansen v. Republic R-III School District, the court assessed a child diagnosed with conduct disorder, bipolar disorder, and ADHD. In Hansen v. Republic R-III School District, a child with conduct disorder, bipolar disorder, and ADHD was considered a child with a disability under IDEA. The court found that the child met the IDEA categories of serious emotional disturbance and other health impairments, affecting his educational performance. The need for special education and related services was emphasized in court decisions. In L.I. v. Maine School Administrative District No. 55, a child with Asperger's Syndrome and an adjustment disorder with depressed mood was considered a child with a disability under IDEA, despite high grades and non-disruptive behavior. The court rejected the argument that IDEA is limited to children whose disabilities significantly impact educational performance. In Board of Education of Montgomery County v. S.G., the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the argument that a child with schizophrenia was not a child with a disability because it did not adversely affect her school performance. The Ninth Circuit in R.B. v. Napa Valley Unified School District held that a child with ADHD, depression, reactive attachment disorder, and post traumatic experiences was considered a child with a disability under IDEA. In Alvin Independent School District v. AD, the Fifth Circuit found that a child with ADHD did not show adverse educational effects. In Mr. and Mrs. N.C. v. Bedford Central School District, a child with dysthymic disorder did not meet the requirements for seriously emotionally disturbed under IDEA regulations. The Second Circuit found that a child's behavior did not meet the criteria for seriously emotionally disturbed under IDEA regulations. Additionally, there was insufficient evidence that the child's educational performance was adversely affected. IDEA requires states to have policies in place for identifying, locating, and evaluating children with disabilities in need of special education, known as child find. The Ninth Circuit ruled in Compton Unified School District v. Addison that failing to evaluate a ninth grader who struggled in school and exhibited concerning behavior violated IDEA's child find requirement. The Supreme Court is considering whether parents of children with disabilities have the right to a due process hearing. The Court is determining if parents of children with disabilities have the right to a due process hearing for negligence in providing an educational program. IDEA requires states to offer free appropriate public education for children with disabilities. The Supreme Court decision in Board of Education of the Hendrick Hudson Central School District v. Rowley in 1982 clarified the requirements of FAPE under IDEA, emphasizing the need for a free appropriate public education for children with disabilities. The Supreme Court clarified in 1982 that the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act requires providing personalized instruction and support services at public expense to confer educational benefit upon handicapped children. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act mandates personalized instruction and support services at public expense to benefit handicapped children. The instruction must meet state educational standards, approximate grade levels, and align with the child's IEP. The grading and advancement system is crucial for determining educational benefit, especially for mainstreamed children. The IEP should be formulated to enable the child to achieve passing marks and advance in regular classrooms. The FAPE requirement under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ensures that children with disabilities receive personalized instruction and support services to help them achieve passing marks and advance from grade to grade. The Supreme Court clarified that states are not required to maximize each child's potential, but as long as the child is making measurable and adequate gains, the FAPE requirement is met. The responsibility for formulating education is left to state and local educational agencies, and courts must avoid imposing their views on educational methods. Determining if children with disabilities are receiving sufficient educational benefits under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act is more challenging than ensuring access to education. The Supreme Court did not establish a specific test for evaluating educational benefits in the Rowley case, leaving it to be determined based on individual circumstances. Lower courts have interpreted Rowley differently, with some supporting schools' Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) based on procedural compliance. Some courts interpret Rowley to support schools' IEPs if procedural requirements are met, even with minimal educational progress. In Fort Zumwalt School District v. Clynes, the court emphasized access to education and deemed the IEP adequate despite low reading scores. Dissenting opinion argued that the child's progress was trivial and not in line with IDEA's goals. Some courts have interpreted IDEA to require more than minimal educational benefit in IEPs. For example, the Third Circuit in Polk v. Cent. Susquehanna Intermediate Unit 16 held that an IEP must provide more than de minimis benefit. Similarly, the Fifth Circuit in Cypress-Fairbanks Indep. School District v. Michael F. stated that the educational benefit from an IEP must be meaningful. The Cypress-Fairbanks court identified four factors to determine if an IEP is meaningful: individualized program, least restrictive environment, coordinated services, and demonstrated academic and nonacademic benefits. Other courts consider academic achievement testing and grades for measuring educational benefit. For example, in Falzett v. Pocono Mountain School District, a student's improved SAT scores and excellent grades were deemed beneficial despite missed days and limited curriculum. In Ringwood Board of Education v. K.H.J., the Third Circuit ruled that children with above-average intelligence must receive more than a negligible benefit under IDEA. Procedural violations must impact the child's substantive rights to constitute a violation of FAPE. For instance, services mandated by an IEP should be implemented promptly. FAPE requires prompt implementation of IEP services, not necessarily immediately or within 30 days. Inaccessible facilities may not violate FAPE if there is general program accessibility. A resolution session improperly convened may not violate FAPE if it does not substantially affect the child's educational opportunities. Procedural violations can be significant enough to deny FAPE, as seen in N.B. and C.B. v. Hellgate Elementary School District. The failure to evaluate a child in all areas of suspected disability was a procedural error that denied FAPE. Another denial of FAPE occurred when the LEA unilaterally scheduled an IEP meeting without attempting to reach a mutually agreed-upon time with the parents. The application of the Supreme Court's analysis in Rowley to current controversies is somewhat confused by the change in the usage of the term \"educational standards.\" The term \"educational standards\" now refers to specific content-based standards outlining what a child should know and be able to do in their education. The 1997 Amendments to IDEA emphasized standards-based education, leading to significant changes in IEP requirements. This included the need for measurable annual goals to help children progress in the general curriculum. The 2004 reauthorization of P.L. 108-446 emphasizes high expectations for children with disabilities and their access to the general curriculum. Concerns have been raised about the current application of standards-based education under IDEA and the No Child Left Behind Act. The 2004 Amendments to IDEA require specially designed instruction and related services to be based on peer-reviewed research. There have been arguments about the impact of NCLBA on FAPE requirements for students with disabilities, but these have not been successful. The 2004 Amendments to IDEA mandate that instruction for students with disabilities must be based on peer-reviewed research. In a court case, it was determined that an eclectic approach by a school was sufficient, even if not solely based on peer-reviewed research. The court emphasized that the decision under IDEA must meet requirements without imposing preferred educational methods. After identifying a child with a disability, an Individualized Education Team creates an IEP with specific criteria. The IEP is a key component of IDEA, outlining measurable goals, services, and educational placement for children with disabilities. Judicial decisions focus on whether IDEA procedures are followed and if the IEP provides educational benefits. The IEP must be \"reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits\" to comply with IDEA. Court decisions have found that minor flaws in an IEP do not violate IDEA as long as they do not compromise the child's right to an appropriate education or deprive them of educational benefits. The court found that the evidence supported the adequacy of the IEP, including the child's social progress, indicating likely educational progress without violating IDEA. A lack of a functional behavioral assessment in an IEP does not invalidate it. Procedural violations that do not harm the student substantively are not considered violations of IDEA. Lack of progress in one school year does not necessarily indicate an IDEA violation as success is not guaranteed, but specialized services must be provided. Courts have found that an IEP must provide educational benefits to comply with IDEA. In cases like A.K. v. Alexandria City School Board and M.L. v. Federal Way School District, inadequate IEPs were deemed violations of IDEA, leading to a loss of educational opportunity. In R.B. v. Napa Valley Unified School District, the Ninth Circuit ruled that IDEA did not require the child's current special education teacher to participate in the IEP meeting as long as a teacher who had taught the child was present. Courts have limited parents' control over the IEP content, as seen in Shelby S. v. Conroe Independent School District where a school could conduct an independent medical evaluation for developing an appropriate IEP. In Lessard and Lessard v. Wilton-Lyndeborough Cooperative School District, courts have found that an IEP was not procedurally deficient due to incompleteness. Despite limited parental control over the IEP, courts have ruled in favor of parents in some cases. For example, in County School Board of York County v. A.L., the Fourth Circuit sided with the parents. In County School Board of York County v. A.L., the Fourth Circuit found violations of IDEA due to lack of prior notice, failure to inform parents of due process rights, and determining placement before an IEP meeting. Scheduling an IEP meeting without considering parents' availability and denying a request to reschedule was also found to deny the student FAPE. IDEA's cornerstone is providing a free appropriate public education. FAPE is defined as requiring special education and related services, including transportation, speech-language pathology, audiology services, psychological services, physical and occupational therapy, and counseling services. These services are designed to enable a child with a disability to receive a free appropriate public education as described in their individualized education program. The IDEA mandates related services such as rehabilitation counseling, orientation and mobility services, and medical services for diagnostic and evaluation purposes to assist children with disabilities in benefiting from special education. Two Supreme Court cases have addressed the provision of medical services, including the case of a girl with spina bifida requiring clean intermittent catheterization. The Supreme Court ruled in the case of Tatro that schools must provide medical services like clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) if necessary for a child with a disability to benefit from special education under IDEA. The service can be provided by a qualified person who is not a physician, but services that can be done outside of school hours are not required to be provided. After the Tatro case, some courts did not strictly apply the requirement for medical services to be provided by a physician. This led to the 1999 Supreme Court case of Cedar Rapids Community School District v. Garret F., involving a paralyzed child who required extensive services due to being ventilator dependent. The school denied the parents' request for services, leading to a proposed test for related services. The Court rejected a proposed test for related services in the Cedar Rapids Community School District v. Garret F. case, stating that the medical services exclusion from the definition was limited to physician or hospital services. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA addressed this issue by establishing risk pools for high-need children with disabilities. States can reserve 10% of funds for this purpose. The IDEA allows states to reserve funds to establish risk pools for high-need children with disabilities. Recent IDEA cases have focused on defining required services for children with disabilities to benefit from special education. The law emphasizes educating disabled children with non-disabled peers whenever possible. Recent courts of appeal decisions have followed a two-pronged approach to determine if an IEP places a student in the least restrictive environment, considering if education in regular classes with supplementary aids can be achieved satisfactorily and if mainstreaming has been implemented by the school. In determining if an IEP places a student in the least restrictive environment, courts consider if mainstreaming has been implemented by the school. Factors include efforts to accommodate the child in the regular classroom, educational benefits compared to special education, and potential negative effects on other students. In A.G. v. Durtan, the Third Circuit examined the impact of a child with a disability on other students. The court upheld the decision that the student could not be educated full time in a regular classroom due to disruptive behavior. P.L. 94-142 provided grants to states for education of children with disabilities and outlined requirements for receiving federal funds. The IDEA law includes a \"stay put\" provision to prevent children with disabilities from being expelled during disputes. The Honig v. Doe case in 1988 questioned exceptions to this rule for emotionally disturbed children. In Honig v. Doe, emotionally disturbed children were involved in serious incidents at school. The Supreme Court ruled that schools cannot unilaterally expel disabled students, emphasizing the need to provide education for emotionally disturbed students. The Supreme Court's ruling in Honig v. Doe emphasized that schools cannot unilaterally expel disabled students. The Court also stated that in cases where a student poses a threat to others, officials can temporarily suspend them for up to 10 school days, allowing for judicial relief under section 1415(e)(2) if necessary. This provision, known as a Honig injunction, addresses concerns about discipline for children with disabilities under IDEA. In 1994, Congress amended IDEA's \"stay put\" provision to allow schools to remove a child with a disability to an interim alternative educational setting if they brought a firearm, weapons, or drugs to school. This provision was further expanded in 2004 to include situations where a student inflicts serious bodily injury on another person at school. Several courts have addressed issues related to the stay put provisions. The stay put provisions involve disciplinary actions. Courts have addressed whether the stay put requirement applies during a child's transition from Part C to Part B of IDEA. Part B applies to school-aged children and requires FAPE in an IEP, while Part C applies to infants and toddlers and requires early intervention services in an IFSP. The Third Circuit in Pardini v. Allegheny Intermediate Unit held that the stay put provision requires the child to continue receiving services. The Eleventh Circuit in D.P. v. School Board of Broward County disagreed with the stay put provision, stating that children applying for initial admission to a public school program are not entitled to continue receiving services from their IFSPs. Other issues related to the stay put provision include mediation, private school placement, transitions from resource rooms to classrooms, and the appeals process in the courts. Sammons v. Polk County School Board raised questions about whether a mediation request triggers the stay put provision. The Eleventh Circuit clarified that the stay put provision does not apply to mediation requests. In L.M. v. Capistrano Unified School District, the Ninth Circuit ruled that a child unilaterally placed in a private school by parents cannot use the stay put provision to continue private school placement. In E.Y. v. Elysian Charter School of Hoboken, the court held that the stay put provision applied to the previous school year's placement, not a recommended private school placement. The Ninth Circuit in Joshua A. v. Rocklin Unified School District affirmed that the stay put provision remains in effect during the appeals process. However, a novel application of the stay put provision was unsuccessful in N.D. v. State of Hawaii. In N.D. v. State of Hawaii, the state's decision to furlough teachers and close public schools for 17 Fridays in the 2009-2010 school year led to a lawsuit alleging a violation of the stay put provision of IDEA. The Ninth Circuit ruled that the provision does not cover system-wide changes affecting all students, with or without disabilities. The House passed H.R. 4247, the \"Keeping all Students Safe Act,\" on March 3, 2010, with increased congressional interest. A similar bill, S. 2860, was introduced in the Senate. IDEA requires the IEP team to consider positive behavioral interventions and supports for children with disabilities whose behavior hinders learning. The use of seclusion and restraints is not specifically addressed in IDEA, and while it emphasizes positive interventions, it does not outright prohibit mechanical restraints. The Department allows for the use of mechanical restraints or aversive techniques for children with disabilities, as long as they align with the child's IEP and positive behavioral interventions. The Supreme Court has not directly addressed the use of seclusion or restraints under IDEA. In Honig v. Doe, the Court ruled that a suspension longer than ten days violated IDEA's \"stay-put\" provision. Educators can use normal procedures like study carrels, timeouts, detention, or a ten-day suspension. Despite no specific language in IDEA, cases have challenged the use of restraints and seclusion, alleging violations of a child's right to education. Courts have not consistently found in favor of these challenges. Courts have examined violations of IDEA regarding the use of seclusion and restraint in cases like C.N. v. Willmar Public Schools, where procedures were allowed when a child posed a danger, but parents alleged misuse. The parents alleged that seclusion and restraint procedures were used improperly and excessively, leading them to withdraw their daughter from the school and place her elsewhere. They requested a due process hearing to challenge the adequacy of educational services, but the court dismissed the case, stating that the hearing should have been requested while the child was still in the school district. The IDEA has been used by parents to challenge a New York State regulation banning aversive interventions. The Second Circuit vacated an injunction against the regulation, finding it to be a rational choice between opposing views on aversives. The district court upheld the regulations as neither arbitrary nor capricious. The regulations on the use of aversives in the context of IDEA are considered rational and consistent with the law. Disability harassment may lead to a denial of FAPE, violating IDEA. Courts have differing views on how harassment claims should be tied to IDEA and the exhaustion of requirements for retaliation claims. The court held that retaliation claims must follow IDEA's administrative exhaustion requirements. ADA and Section 504 can also lead to retaliation claims for advocating IDEA violations. Protecting special education rights is considered a protected activity under the Rehabilitation Act. IDEA's Section 615 outlines procedural safeguards for children with disabilities and their parents, ensuring rights to a free appropriate public education. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) provides procedural safeguards for children with disabilities, including the right to a free appropriate public education (FAPE). Parents or schools can file a due process complaint within two years of knowing about a violation. Schools can also file complaints, and parties can appeal administrative decisions in district court within 90 days. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA added a resolution session requirement before due process hearings, involving parents, IEP team members, and an LEA representative. Mediation provisions were added in the 1997 reauthorization and retained in current law. aggrieved parties can file suit in district court within 90 days. The 2004 IDEA reauthorization added a resolution session requirement before due process hearings, involving parents, IEP team members, and an LEA representative. Judicial enforcement of agreements reached through a resolution session or mediation was also provided for. Court decisions have addressed issues regarding the resolution session, including confidentiality and the presence of attorneys during the process. An attorney is only present for the preliminary meeting, not for writing a settlement decision. Procedural violations in a resolution session do not violate FAPE unless they substantially affect the child's educational opportunities. Courts have limited judicial enforcement to agreements reached through dispute resolution or mediation. In Amy S. v. Danbury, the Sixth Circuit held that mediation agreements signed by parents are enforceable. In S. v. Danbury, the Sixth Circuit upheld mediation agreements signed by parents represented by counsel, rejecting a claim that the school breached the agreement due to a change in tutoring transportation. Similarly, in Ballard v. Philadelphia School District, a parent's argument against a settlement agreement was dismissed. IDEA mandates that due process complaints include a description of the problem, relevant facts, and a proposed resolution. In Knight v. Washington School District, a district court addressed issues regarding the review of a hearing officer's determination on a due process complaint not meeting IDEA's pleading requirements. The court quoted Senate report language stating that the determination should be made solely based on the complaint, with no further hearing or appeal. The court found it lacked jurisdiction to assess the complaint's adequacy, leading to an unsatisfying outcome. The court found the complaint notice inadequate, leading to an unsatisfying outcome for Plaintiffs. It was troubling that a state official's dismissal of a complaint based on federal law was unreviewable in federal court. The Eighth Circuit affirmed the dismissal without prejudice. Some courts ruled that an LEA cannot sue an SEA for IDEA non-compliance. In Traverse Bay Area Intermediate School District v. Michigan Department of Education, the Sixth Circuit held that LEAs cannot challenge state agency noncompliance with IDEA procedural safeguards. The Ninth Circuit in Lake Washington School District No. 414 v. Washington State Office of Administrative Hearings also ruled that LEAs have no private right of action under IDEA. In Winkelman v. Parma City School District, the Supreme Court ruled that parents can bring pro se suits under IDEA for their own rights, including their child's entitlement to a free appropriate public education. Justice Kennedy emphasized that parents have independent, enforceable rights beyond procedural or reimbursement issues. In Winkelman v. Parma City School District, the Supreme Court ruled that parents can bring pro se suits under IDEA for their own rights, including their child's entitlement to a free appropriate public education. Justice Kennedy emphasized that parents have independent, enforceable rights beyond procedural or reimbursement issues. The Court examined IDEA's statutory language to ensure the rights of children with disabilities and parents are protected. The Supreme Court ruled in Winkelman v. Parma City School District that parents have independent rights under IDEA, including both procedural and substantive rights. Justice Kennedy highlighted that IDEA does not differentiate between the rights of children and parents. Granting these rights could potentially lead to increased lawsuits by parents, impacting state costs. The Supreme Court emphasized parents' independent rights under IDEA, including the ability to bring lawsuits without financial constraints. The Court found that concerns about increased lawsuits were not sufficient to challenge IDEA under the Constitution's Spending Clause. Additionally, IDEA allows courts to award attorneys' fees to educational agencies if a parent's lawsuit is deemed to have been brought for an improper purpose. The court's focus on a parent's rights allows them to amend complaints to assert their own claims, even if they cannot do so on behalf of their child. Parents have personal rights to enforce FAPE but cannot circumvent consent decrees. In Woodruff v. Hamilton Township Public Schools, parents filed claims only for themselves. The court's focus on parental rights allows them to amend complaints to assert their own claims, even if not on behalf of their child. In some cases, parental rights have been extended to cases under Section 504 and the ADA, but not all courts agree. The Winkelman decision emphasized parental involvement in IDEA cases, leading to differing interpretations in other contexts like Section 504 and the ADA. The Blanchard v. Morton School District case raised the issue of a parent recovering damages under IDEA for lost earnings while pursuing their child's claim. The Ninth Circuit stated that money damages were not available for a child with a disability under IDEA. In Fuentes v. Board of Education of New York City, the Second Circuit addressed the rights of a noncustodial parent under IDEA. The IDEA regulations presume a parent to have legal authority for educational decisions unless proven otherwise. In Fuentes v. Board of Education of New York City, it was found that a noncustodial biological parent lacked legal authority in educational decisions. IDEA, along with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA, address the education rights of individuals with disabilities. Each statute has its own provisions, with some overlap between Section 504 and the ADA. The IDEA, Section 504, and the ADA are statutes that address the education rights of individuals with disabilities. IDEA, enacted in 1975, provides additional programs for children with disabilities. Section 504 and the ADA, civil rights statutes enacted in 1973 and 1990 respectively, prohibit discrimination against individuals with disabilities. The ADA has broader coverage compared to Section 504. The ADA has broader coverage compared to Section 504, not tied to federal funds. Courts have noted differences in coverage and due process requirements under IDEA for FAPE provision. The Supreme Court's decision in Schaffer v. Weast clarified that the burden of proof in an IDEA due process hearing rests with the party seeking relief regarding an allegedly inadequate IEP. In Schaffer v. Weast, the Supreme Court clarified that the burden of proof in an IDEA due process hearing lies with the party seeking relief. Justice O'Connor rejected arguments that the burden should be on the school system, stating that fairness does not dictate placing the burden on a party with more information. The Supreme Court in Schaffer v. Weast clarified that the burden of proof in an IDEA due process hearing lies with the party seeking relief. Justice O'Connor emphasized that schools must safeguard parents' procedural rights and share information with them, ensuring no unique informational advantage. IDEA provides parents with rights such as record review, independent evaluations, disclosure of options considered, and attorneys' fees if they prevail. Issues regarding services for children with disabilities in private schools under IDEA have been controversial. The cost of placement in a private school is covered by the LEA or SEA if done by them, but not if parents unilaterally place the child unless certain findings are made by a hearing officer or court. IDEA requires services for children in private schools, even if parents unilaterally place them there. Reimbursement for private school placement may be required if the agency did not provide free services. The IDEA requires services for children in private schools, even if parents unilaterally place them there. Reimbursement for private school placement may be required if the agency did not provide a free appropriate public education in a timely manner. Recent Supreme Court cases have addressed the question of tuition reimbursement for parents who placed their child in a private school without receiving special education from the public school. In the 2007 case Board of Education of the City School District of the City of New York v. Tom F., the Supreme Court allowed an appeals court ruling on private school reimbursement to stand. The court held that parents of a child with a disability are entitled to reimbursement for private school tuition even if the student never received special education services from the school district. This decision did not set a precedent for lower courts, leaving the issue unresolved. The Supreme Court denied certiorari in a case on October 15, 2007, but in Forest Grove School District v. T.A. on June 22, 2009, they ruled that IDEA allows reimbursement for private special-education services when a public school fails to provide a FAPE. Recent lower court decisions have stated that as long as the child is making educational progress with an IEP from the public school, they are not entitled to private school reimbursement. In cases where a child is making educational progress with an IEP from a public school, they are not entitled to private school reimbursement if the FAPE requirements are met. Private school tuition reimbursement may not be required if the private school does not adequately address the child's educational needs. Courts have ruled that reimbursement for private school tuition may be denied if parents do not notify the LEA of issues with their child's IDEA services or if they act unreasonably with the school. Reimbursement is also not required if the private school does not meet the child's educational needs. If a school district fails to provide a child with a disability a Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE), the child may be eligible for private school reimbursement or compensatory education. Compensatory education aims to make up for past inadequate services, based on the Supreme Court's ruling in School Committee of the Town of Burlington v. Department of Education of Massachusetts in 1985. In Burlington v. Department of Education, parents can get reimbursement for private school tuition if public school program violates FAPE. Courts differ on awarding compensatory education, some for same time services were withheld, others for an \"equitable focus.\" The IDEA emphasizes the need for students to be appropriately educated, with compensatory education requiring more services than a general IEP. Section 1983 allows suits against state officials for deprivation of rights under the Constitution and laws. IDEA procedural remedies must be exhausted before legal action. Courts in the United States have differing views on applying section 1983 for damages under IDEA. Some allow damages while others do not. Initially, IDEA did not provide for attorneys' fees, but prevailing parties sought fees through other acts. The Supreme Court ruled in Smith v. Robinson that prevailing parties under IDEA could only seek remedies within the IDEA framework. The Supreme Court's decision in Smith v. Robinson held that prevailing parties under IDEA could only seek remedies within the IDEA framework. Congress later enacted the Handicapped Children's Protection Act in 1986 to provide for attorneys' fees under IDEA, with amendments in 1997. The 1997 amendments to IDEA allowed for the reduction of attorneys' fees for lack of timely information. The 2004 reauthorization added provisions for attorneys' fees for SEA or LEA against parents or their attorneys in certain situations. The ADA allows courts to award attorneys' fees to a prevailing party, rejecting the \"catalyst theory\" for fees. Buckhannon Board and Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Department of Human Resources established that fees are only available with a judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship. This ruling has been consistently applied to attorneys' fees provision in IDEA cases. Attorneys' fees provision in IDEA allows for fees to be awarded to the prevailing party in administrative and judicial proceedings, even without a finding of a denial of FAPE. However, fees have not been awarded when a child has not yet been determined to be a child with a disability under IDEA. Attorneys' fees are not awarded for failure to refer for assessments or failure to identify a child as disabled. Fees are only awarded for relief obtained through a judicially approved settlement agreement. In Drennan v. Pulaski County Special School District, fees were not awarded for not fulfilling court-ordered duties. Attorneys' fees may be awarded to parties for representation by relatives other than parents, such as a grandparent, based on the court's discretion. The amount awarded can be less than requested based on the party's success. Fees may be denied or reduced if a party rejects a settlement offer but achieves little more in court. The Fifth Circuit ruled that rejecting a settlement offer and achieving little more in court does not necessarily result in reduced awards for attorneys' fees. Congress implemented a fee cap on IDEA cases in the District of Columbia starting in FY1999, which has been included in subsequent D.C. appropriations acts. The 2004 IDEA reauthorization included a provision regarding court actions under this section. The Fifth Circuit ruled that attorneys' fees can be awarded to a prevailing State or local educational agency against a parent's attorney if the complaint is found to be frivolous or without foundation. In El Paso Independent School District v. Berry, the court allowed fees to be awarded against a lawyer who refused settlement offers and continued to litigate a frivolous case. The Sixth Circuit found that fee-shifting provision did not apply to private schools, and winning in court does not determine frivolousness of parents' actions. The Ninth Circuit emphasized the importance of not discouraging lawyers from taking on potentially meritorious IDEA cases. Several cases have examined whether the LEA was permissible in awarding fees against a lawyer who refused to accept relief and stonewalled the evaluation of the student. In El Paso Independent School District v. Richard R, the Fifth Circuit ruled that the school district, despite prevailing in reducing attorneys' fees, was not entitled to fees as they did not prevail on educational issues. Similarly, in District of Columbia v. Straus, the D.C. Court of Appeals denied fees to the school district as they were not considered a prevailing party. The case was dismissed after the school district agreed to pay for the evaluation. The court noted that the school district, if considered a prevailing party, could potentially avoid legal obligations until parents sue, comply quickly, and then recover attorney's fees. Some lower courts have interpreted IDEA's language to possibly allow for expert witness fees for prevailing parents. The Supreme Court, in Arlington Central School District v. Murphy, ruled that IDEA does not authorize the payment of expert witness fees as part of attorneys' fees for prevailing parents in disability cases. The Supreme Court, led by Justice Alito, determined that IDEA does not allow parents to recover fees paid to experts. The decision was influenced by Congress enacting IDEA under the Spending Clause, requiring clear conditions for funding acceptance. The majority found IDEA's language lacking clarity and the legislative history unconvincing. Bills were introduced in Congress to amend IDEA regarding fees. H.R. 1208 and S. 613 in the 112th Congress aimed to amend IDEA to include expert witness fees in attorneys' fees. IDEA has two dispute resolution methods, and the Department of Education oversees its implementation. At least one court of appeals decision is relevant to this issue. The Ninth Circuit in Lake Washington School District No. 414 v. Washington State Office of Administrative Hearings rejected an LEA's suit against the SEA for systematic violation of IDEA. Congress established a protection and advocacy system (P & A's) in 1975 to advocate for individuals with developmental disabilities through class action lawsuits. Special education students have been involved in class action lawsuits aimed at systemic violations of their rights, often concerning access to student records by protection and advocacy systems."
