    "content": "The \"National Center for Transportation Solutions Act of 2004\" establishes the National Center for Transportation Solutions and outlines its duties, organization, powers, and personnel matters. It also authorizes the creation of regional centers for transportation solutions and provides for the appointment of a Director of National Transportation Research. Congress finds that research and development are crucial for a transportation system that meets safety, mobility, economic vitality, efficiency, equity, and environmental protection goals. Federal investment in transportation research is only about 1% of overall government spending on transportation programs, despite a 40% increase in funding for transportation programs in the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century. Funding for transportation research and development has remained relatively flat, with inadequate resources devoted to long-term goals. Competitive, peer-reviewed awards are best for addressing strategic research needs, but the diversity of research programs poses challenges for effective centers. To ensure the United States transportation system meets safety, mobility, economic vitality, equity, and environmental protection goals, increasing Federal investment in long-range planning and supporting competitive research into systemic transportation issues is crucial. The Department of Transportation aims to better coordinate research and development programs, foster data interchange, and establish nationwide priorities in transportation research. The National Center for Transportation Solutions is established as an independent agency in the executive branch of government. It consists of the National Center for Transportation Solutions Board and the Director of National Transportation Research. The Board will exercise the authorities of the Center.
