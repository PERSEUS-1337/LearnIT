The Congress acknowledges that while expanded access to credit has increased homeownership rates, there is evidence of predatory lending practices that make it costly for low-income families. Borrowers with fair to good credit can access loans in the prime mortgage market with the lowest rates and costs. Predatory lending in the subprime mortgage market involves high interest rates, excessive fees, balloon payments, and other unreasonable terms. Predatory loans in minority neighborhoods strip away wealth accumulated over decades, victimizing communities with high-interest home equity loans and inadequate disclosures. The joint report by the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of the Treasury urged Congress to adopt legislation to restrict abusive terms on high-cost loans and improve consumer disclosures. The joint report recommended legislation to address predatory lending practices, including improving consumer literacy and disclosures by requiring lenders to provide home mortgage counseling, disclose credit scores, and give timely and accurate loan information. Government agencies are addressing predatory lending to reduce high-pressure sales techniques and misleading borrowers about loan terms. Nonprofit organizations are at risk due to predatory lending, and more assistance is needed for borrowers with predatory loans. To address predatory lending, efforts are being made to assist borrowers with existing predatory loans, educate consumers about the risks of home loans, and provide referrals to government agencies or consumer protection organizations for help.
