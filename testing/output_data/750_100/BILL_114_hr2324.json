    "content": "The \"Small Lands Tracts Conveyance Act\" allows for special conveyance authority regarding small parcels of national forest system land and public lands. The \"Small Lands Tracts Conveyance Act\" defines terms like adjacent landholder, Director concerned, and eligible Federal lands parcel for the conveyance of small parcels of national forest system land and public lands. The \"Small Lands Tracts Conveyance Act\" defines a Federal lands parcel as National Forest System land or public lands that share boundaries with non-Federal land, are located within populated areas, do not have existing rights held by non-Federal entities, do not contain exceptional resources, and are not habitat for endangered or threatened species. The \"Small Lands Tracts Conveyance Act\" defines a Federal lands parcel as National Forest System land or public lands that share boundaries with non-Federal land, are located within populated areas, do not have existing rights held by non-Federal entities, do not contain exceptional resources, and are not habitat for endangered or threatened species. An exceptional resource is a resource of scientific, historic, cultural, or recreational value on public lands that requires extraordinary conservation and protection for the benefit of the public. The \"Small Lands Tracts Conveyance Act\" defines National Forest System land as land within the National Forest System, including National Grasslands, for the benefit of the public. The term \"National Forest System land\" includes National Grasslands and excludes land managed by the Forest Service in certain designated areas. The term \"public lands\" refers to areas designated as national outstanding natural areas, national natural landmarks, wilderness areas, wilderness study areas, national wild and scenic rivers, national trails, or land held in trust for Indian tribes, as defined in the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. The term \"public lands\" excludes land managed by the Bureau of Land Management included in various designated areas such as national monuments, wilderness areas, and national scenic areas. The term \"Regional Forester concerned\" refers to the Regional Forester with jurisdiction over National Forest System land in a specific Forest Service Region. The Director or Regional Forester selects eligible Federal lands parcels for conveyance in response to a request. The Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior will create a process for adjacent landholders to request to purchase eligible Federal lands parcels. The process for adjacent landholders to request to purchase eligible Federal lands parcels will be consistent with other public purchase request processes, open to the public, and available online within 90 days of the enactment of this Act. Adjacent landholders can request to purchase National Forest System land or public lands, with the Director or Regional Forester reviewing the parcel within 30 days to determine eligibility for conveyance. If the request is rejected, a portion may still be eligible for conveyance. If a parcel of National Forest System land or public lands requested by an adjacent landholder is found to be ineligible, the Director or Regional Forester must provide a written explanation detailing the reasons for the rejection. This includes specifying which elements of the definition of eligible Federal lands parcel the parcel fails to satisfy. The Director or Regional Forester must provide a written explanation for the rejection of an ineligible parcel, detailing why it fails to satisfy the criteria and how continued administration by the Bureau of Land Management or Forest Service would impact the economy. The appeal process is also outlined. An eligible Federal lands parcel conveyed under this section may not exceed 160 acres unless approved by the Director or Regional Forester. An adjacent landholder can acquire one parcel per year, with the option for additional parcels if each is less than 160 acres in size. Federal lands parcels can be acquired up to 160 acres unless approved by the Director or Regional Forester. Public notice must be provided for the availability of eligible parcels, even if they share a boundary with non-Federal land or multiple parcels owned by the same adjacent landholder. The Director or Regional Forester shall provide public notice for eligible Federal lands parcels, stating their eligibility for conveyance. If the parcel shares a boundary with a single non-Federal land parcel or multiple parcels owned by the same adjacent landholder, a negotiated sale will be carried out. If the eligible parcel shares a boundary with multiple non-Federal land parcels owned by different adjacent landholders, a different process will be followed. When eligible public lands parcels share a boundary with non-Federal land owned by different adjacent landholders, the sale will be conducted through competitive bidding. The Director or Regional Forester can reject offers that do not meet the minimum consideration required, with the adjacent landholder having the opportunity to appeal the rejection. When an eligible public lands parcel is sold, the purchaser must comply with local land use ordinances and zoning plans. When a parcel is sold under this section, the Director or Regional Forester shall convey all rights, including mineral estate, to the United States. An appeals process is available if a request for selection or purchase of federal lands is rejected. When a parcel is sold under this section, the Director or Regional Forester shall convey all rights, including mineral estate, to the United States. An appeals process is available for reconsideration of rejected requests for the purchase of eligible Federal lands. The expedited Forest Service appeals process under section 322(d) of Public Law 102-381 (16 U.S.C. 1612 note) will be used for this purpose. References to the Chief of the Forest Service or the Secretary of Agriculture in the appeals process shall be deemed to mean the Director concerned or the Regional Forester concerned. As consideration for the sale of eligible Federal lands, the Director or Regional Forester must require a cash payment equal to the fair market value of the parcel, including the mineral estate. The fair market value is determined by an appraisal submitted by the adjacent landholder. The Director or Regional Forester must approve the appraisal submitted by the adjacent landholder for the purchase of the parcel within 45 days. If rejected, a new appraisal must be conducted within 30 days. Proceeds are to be established in a fund by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary of the Treasury will establish a special fund in the Treasury of the United States for collecting and distributing funds from the conveyance of eligible Federal lands parcels. The funds collected will be distributed annually to States where the Federal Government owns more than 33 percent of the land area. The distribution of funds from the conveyance of eligible Federal lands parcels is outlined in paragraph (4), with 50 percent going to the State where the conveyance took place and the remaining 50 percent divided equally among other States. States receiving funds must agree to limitations on use. States receiving funds from the conveyance of eligible Federal lands parcels must agree to use the funds for specific purposes, including purchasing additional eligible Federal lands parcels and complying with federal requirements such as the Endangered Species Act and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. The Director or Regional Forester must ensure the purchaser covers all costs related to the conveyance, including survey, appraisal, environmental documentation, and administrative costs. The Director or Regional Forester must ensure the purchaser covers all costs related to the conveyance, including survey, appraisal, environmental documentation, and administrative costs. If the amount collected exceeds the actual costs incurred, the excess must be refunded to the purchaser. Amounts received as reimbursement shall be credited to the fund. Reimbursement for conveyance costs shall be credited to the fund used for covering those costs. The process of conveying eligible Federal lands should not exceed 18 months. The conveyance of eligible Federal lands parcels under this section is categorically excluded from environmental assessment requirements. This conveyance authority is in addition to existing sale authority under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act."
