    "content": "This report, General Management Laws: Major Themes and Management Policy Options, is a companion to CRS Report RL30795, General Management Laws: A Compendium. The reports aim to identify and describe major general management laws for the executive branch, assist Congress in overseeing management, and help in considering potential changes to management laws and legislation. The compendium contains profiles of selected general management laws. The compendium profiles general management laws that regulate executive branch activities and administration, crucial for accountability to Congress, the President, and the public. These laws impact federal agencies' effectiveness in implementing and evaluating public policies. The companion report focuses on major themes and management policy options for Congress related to the general management laws. The compendium includes over 90 entries describing general management laws for the executive branch, organized into seven functional categories. It reflects the status of these laws at the end of the first session of the 108th Congress and will be updated to include actions taken through the close of the Congress. The compendium includes over 90 entries describing general management laws for the executive branch, organized into seven functional categories: Evaluation; Financial Management, Budget, and Accounting; Organization; Procurement and Real Property Management; Intergovernmental Relations Management; and Human Resources Management and Ethics. These functions refer to specific business areas requiring related skills and tasks. The report will focus on the functional orientation, with most entries profiling specific laws, except for the \"Human Resources Management and Ethics\" section. The \"Human Resources Management and Ethics\" section of the compendium presents civil service laws according to Title 5 of the United States Code. Each entry includes a brief history, major provisions, key developments, and source readings. This report also provides historical background on Congress and the President's roles in managing the executive branch. The report discusses the roles of Congress and the President in managing the executive branch, comparing public and private sector management, and analyzing major themes in general management laws. Scholars debate the constitutional roles of both branches and their control over federal agencies. The U.S. Constitution established a system of separated powers with checks and balances between Congress and the President in managing the executive branch. Scholars discuss how power is shared between the branches, emphasizing separateness but also interdependence and reciprocity. This report and compendium explore this conversation. The Constitution grants Congress the power to establish administrative agencies and make laws necessary for executing their powers. It also gives the President significant authority to manage the executive branch. The Constitution grants Congress the power to establish administrative agencies and make laws necessary for executing their powers. The President has considerable power to manage the executive branch, but this power is limited to ensuring officials obey Congress's instructions. Article II makes only two explicit references to executive departments. In September 1789, Congress enacted laws to establish the Treasury Department and set salaries for Secretaries of the Departments of the Treasury, State, and War. The President can require written opinions from department heads on matters related to their duties. In 1789, Congress set salaries for Secretaries of the Departments of the Treasury, State, and War, and imposed a salary cap for clerk positions in these departments. The Federalists, led by Alexander Hamilton, established an administrative system with an independent chief executive and effective delegation of authority. After Thomas Jefferson took office in 1801, the Democratic-Republicans largely maintained the Federalist framework for government administration. Congress became more involved in the administrative system, which was struggling to keep up with the country's growth in size and population by the late 1820s. Both Presidents and department heads were overwhelmed with official work, but solutions like delegation or provision were not implemented. The federal government administration was overburdened with official work, leading to a significant increase in federal employment from 1816 to 1861. The structure of executive departments also became more complex during this time, with departments in 1860 consisting of the Secretary and a group of bureaus handling routine business, compared to a simpler structure in 1800. The rise of the administrative state after the Civil War led to challenges in managing the executive branch, with Congress delegating much of its legislative authority to administrative bodies by 1946. The rise of the administrative state led to Congress delegating legislative authority to administrative agencies, shifting policy-making and budgeting to the executive branch. Observers noted agencies sometimes exercised legislative powers, prompting Congress to expand general management laws to improve executive branch practices. The CRS compendium highlights laws passed by Congress to increase transparency and oversight of the executive branch, including the Administrative Procedure Act, Freedom of Information Act, Federal Advisory Committee Act, establishment of inspectors general, Congressional Review of Regulations Act, and Government Performance and Results Act. These laws aimed to improve accountability and congressional oversight of the executive branch. The Government Performance and Results Act (1993) and the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act (1974) were passed by Congress to improve oversight and influence over the budget process. The Chief Financial Officers Act (1990) and other laws were also enacted to enhance agencies' financial management capacities. These laws, among more than 90 entries, aimed to bring disciplined management to executive branch agencies through legislative action and congressional oversight. The text discusses the debate over whether laws aimed at improving oversight and management in executive branch agencies are necessary or if they hinder flexibility. History can provide insight into this issue, with various controversial issues for Congress to consider. Management practices in the public and private sectors are often compared, with scholars cautioning against applying private-sector principles to government agencies due to key differences that should be recognized and respected. Public administration scholar Wallace Sayre's aphorism highlights the key difference between public and private management. Government agencies and private companies operate under different laws, with the government having coercive power to regulate private activity and collect taxes. This distinction is crucial in understanding the unique challenges and responsibilities of public-sector management. The framers of the Constitution established checks and balances to prevent the arbitrary exercise of coercive power by the federal government agencies. These agencies can only act under authority provided by public law, formulated by Congress, the President, and the courts. Public laws authorize an agency's mission and how it operates, in contrast to private companies which operate under laws regulating the market economy. Private company laws do not prescribe what the company must do. Under the framework of law, a company is primarily accountable to its owners or shareholders. Government agencies differ from private sector organizations as they cannot retain earnings for private benefit, allocate resources based on administrator preferences, and must serve specific goals. The management of government agencies is influenced by external entities such as legislatures, courts, politicians, and interest groups. This leads to challenges in measuring agency performance and differences in management practices between the public and private sectors. The compendium of general management laws in public and private sectors raises public policy issues and themes for Congress to consider regarding the discretion of the executive branch in determining priorities and scope. The executive branch's authority to determine agency actions has been a topic of debate. Granting discretion can offer flexibility for agencies to adapt laws to specific circumstances. This flexibility allows for quicker responses to changing situations and more efficient regulation implementation. Many argue that executive discretion in agency responsibilities allows for better scientific standard-setting. However, this discretion can also lead to decisions that may not have support from Congress. The President or agency may have differing views on what is the \"right thing to do,\" potentially leading to actions unnoticed by Congress. Granting discretion to the executive branch can lead to key decisions being made by unelected agency officials, potentially reducing transparency and political accountability. Congress faced this tension in 2002 and 2003 when considering granting discretion to DHS and DOD for their HRM systems. Similar situations arose in 1993 during the Clinton Administration's National Performance Review. In 1993, the Clinton Administration's National Performance Review recommended ways to streamline procurement policy, leading to the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994. Scholars have identified four options for Congress to address delegation situations and balance flexibility with accountability. Congress can set conditions for delegating authority to ensure its intentions are carried out by the executive branch and reduce risks. This can be done by establishing goals, sanctions, probation periods, or sunsets, requiring the use of pilot projects, or creating \"profit-sharing relationships\" to incentivize agencies to act in ways that benefit both the agency and the government. To ensure effective delegation of authority, Congress can implement screening and selection mechanisms to assess an agency's capability and performance. This can involve convening hearings to evaluate problem analysis and organizational capacity. Additionally, monitoring and reporting requirements can be enforced to enhance accountability and transparency in program activities. Congress can require agencies to report their actions taken, milestones reached, and obtained information for accountability and transparency. Information technology allows for real-time and frequent updates, but some argue that excessive reporting can be burdensome. Institutional checks by Congress ensure oversight of agency actions, including involving additional agencies to veto or block decisions, requiring notice and comment, and conducting independent studies. The tension between standardization and customization in management laws for agencies is a frequent issue for Congress. Should laws be standardized for all agencies or customized for each agency's specific needs? This question arises in the oversight of agency actions by Congress. The tension between standardization and customization in management laws for agencies is a frequent issue for Congress. Standardization can improve executive branch transparency and accountability, as seen in the Administrative Procedure Act of 1946. The Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990 introduced standardization in financial management for 24 major executive departments and agencies. The CFO Act of 1990 mandated audited financial statements for 24 major executive departments and agencies. In 2002, the Accountability of Tax Dollars Act extended similar requirements to other executive agencies. Standardization promotes accountability by requiring agencies to justify exceptions, while customization can aid effective management alignment. The CFO Act of 1990 mandated audited financial statements for major executive departments and agencies. Congress uses statutes and reports to direct agency actions and customization is built into general management laws. For example, small agencies were not required to prepare audited financial statements until recently. The Department of Homeland Security's CFO position was not initially subject to certain requirements. The Security Act of 2002 exempted the new agency's CFO position from CFO Act requirements. DHS and DOD were granted authority to customize aspects of their HRM systems. A mixed approach of standardization and customization is also possible. The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) required executive branch agencies to develop strategic plans, but allowed flexibility in compliance. Different approaches like standardization, customization, and mixed methods have advantages and disadvantages. Customization can sometimes reduce transparency or accountability if agencies do not report in real-time on the nature and status of their efforts. Oversight and analytical resources are crucial for monitoring the effectiveness of customized laws. Mixed approaches can lead to agencies working at cross-purposes and budget pressures. Congress has policy options for avoiding problems with mixed approaches in general management laws. The decision depends on the problem's nature, history, stakeholders, and other factors. Regularly assessing the need for customization or standardization can improve transparency, accountability, efficiency, and effectiveness. Analytical support is essential for evidence-based decision-making. Analytical support from various sources like agency management, program evaluations, and outside evaluators can aid in decision-making for Congress and stakeholders. One option is to reduce the analytical burden by requiring the executive branch to maintain real-time descriptions and comparisons across agencies. The compendium highlights the challenges of monitoring civil service laws across agencies, suggesting the establishment of reporting requirements to reduce the analytical burden for Congress and the public. This could help in examining customization and standardization in areas like pay, performance management, and adverse actions. Possible changes in reporting requirements for customization of management policies could be implemented to facilitate government-wide analysis and comparisons. Central management agencies like OMB, OPM, GSA, and FMS could report on how management policies are customized in areas such as financial management, human resources, and procurement. However, implementing such requirements may involve costs for the reporting agencies. Most organizations in the private and public sectors manage themselves with a functional orientation or structures, such as financial management, human resources, and procurement. A functional perspective is important for efficiency and centralized control over strategic decisions, but too much focus on it can hinder organization-wide coordination. When organizations have a too inward-looking functional orientation, it can lead to coordination and decision-making issues, hindering the development of general managers. This can result in functional silos operating in isolation, causing missed opportunities. Management literature emphasizes the importance of integrating functional perspectives into a broader general management perspective. The business school's website explains that individuals approach problems, opportunities, or decisions with assumptions based on their backgrounds and experiences. This leads to a limited view of the whole story, with each person defining a problem based on their expertise, such as finance or marketing. The solution is to develop a general management perspective that integrates multiple functional perspectives to understand problems or opportunities. An example is using information technology to improve human resources and financial management. This approach, combined with focusing on individual functions, offers a toolbox of options for executive branch management. The integration of general management laws offers a toolbox of options for addressing executive branch management problems, providing mutual support to each other through various means such as changes to laws, agency statutes, and appropriations. Congress can make changes to general management laws, agency authorizing statutes, and appropriations to integrate functional perspectives, such as leveraging the E-Government Act of 2002 for more timely financial and performance reporting using the Federal Enterprise Architecture. This would support congressional oversight, reauthorization, and appropriations activities. Congress can integrate functional perspectives by directing appropriations to hire, train, and retain contract oversight specialists, restructuring budget accounts, and leveraging the Chief Human Capital Officers Act of 2002 for better agency management. OPM is required to develop metrics for assessing agencies' staff resources for contract management and oversight. Options for integrating functional perspectives into general management could include various combinations of laws in the compendium, such as information policy, regulation, strategic planning, performance measurement, program evaluation, auditing, investigation, financial management, budgeting, and accounting. The federal government management reform history includes efforts to improve agencies' performance, organization, and management practices in areas such as program evaluation, auditing, financial management, budgeting, and human resources management. Despite these efforts, progress has been challenging, with Congress facing difficulties in overseeing executive branch management. Congress has struggled with overseeing executive branch management, particularly in ensuring agencies comply with general management laws and measuring their progress. Management literature emphasizes the importance of measurement in driving action and quotes industrial psychologist Mason Haire: \"What gets measured gets done.\" However, measurement systems can also create perverse incentives. Measurement systems are crucial for driving action, but they can also lead to perverse incentives. For example, in the private sector, focusing only on short-term profits can deter long-term research and development. Similarly, achieving clean financial audits in government agencies may not indicate good fiscal management if achieved through manual workarounds. In the last 25 years, agency inspectors general and the GAO have reported major management problems in executive branch agencies in areas like financial management, acquisition, information technology, human resources, and program implementation. GAO has identified high-risk areas and management challenges affecting specific agencies or government-wide. During the last 25 years, agency inspectors general and the GAO have reported significant management issues in executive branch agencies. Progress was made by the executive branch and Congress to address these issues, but much work remains. Various management reform initiatives were pursued by presidential administrations, including President Reagan's Reform '88, President Bush's efforts in financial and information management, and President Clinton's NPR. Concerns about government management were frequently expressed by members of Congress and their committee staff. In 1992, the House Committee on Government Operations recommended actions to improve government management in areas such as procurement, information resources, financial management, and human resources. In June 2001, Senator Fred Thompson highlighted urgent management problems faced by the administration of President George W. Bush, including issues with the federal workforce, financial management, information technology, and duplication. President George W. Bush's Office of Management and Budget released the President's Management Agenda (PMA) in August 2001, which includes five government-wide initiatives: Strategic Management of Human Capital, Competitive Sourcing, Improved Financial Performance, Expanded Electronic Government, and Budget and Performance Integration. OMB leads quarterly evaluations of agencies under the PMA to assess progress with red, yellow, or green \"stoplight scores\" based on published standards for success. The Bush Administration's President's Management Agenda (PMA) outlines standards for solving federal government management problems. Agencies are rated green, yellow, or red based on their progress towards meeting the criteria. OMB evaluates agencies on a case-by-case basis against established deliverables and timelines for the five initiatives. Green indicates implementation is on track, yellow suggests some delays or issues. The five government-wide PMA initiatives are evaluated based on progress towards meeting criteria, with green indicating on-track implementation, yellow suggesting delays, and red signifying serious jeopardy. The initiatives are expected to be mutually reinforcing and utilize general management laws to achieve goals. The PMA initiatives utilize various general management laws to achieve their goals, such as the Competitive Sourcing initiative leveraging the FAIR Act of 1998, the Improved Financial Performance initiative leveraging multiple acts including the Antideficiency Act and FFMIA, the Expanded Electronic Government initiative leveraging acts like the Clinger-Cohen Act and FISMA, and the Strategic Management of Human Capital and Budget and Performance Integration. The PMA initiatives utilize general management laws to achieve goals, with agencies making significant progress. However, PMA evaluation practices lack transparency outside the executive branch, hindering congressional oversight. Detailed rationales and worksheets behind grades are not publicly available. The OMB assessments of agency programs using the Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) were more transparent than the PMA evaluations. OMB published overall PART assessments in the President's FY2004 budget proposal and released detailed worksheets showing the evidence used for assessments. The stoplight scoring criteria may introduce subjectivity in evaluating initiatives. The Electronic Government initiative requires agencies to have \"acceptable\" IT business cases, while the Strategic Management of Human Capital initiative mandates succession strategies for leadership talent pool. Independent evaluation organizations have not verified agency stoplight scores. The PMA may not cover all aspects of general management laws, such as contract oversight and small business contracting concerns in the Competitive Sourcing initiative. The PMA does not address contract oversight or small business contracting concerns, despite long-standing concerns raised by GAO and outside observers. Real property management issues are also not explicitly covered. The PMA is part of ongoing efforts by the executive branch, NGOs, and Congress to improve agency management practices. Agency IGs and GAO have historically focused on specific agency problems, with OMB and GAO creating \"high risk\" programs for troublesome management areas. Some in Congress have implemented measurement efforts to assess agency management, such as issuing letter grades for financial management and information security performance. Representative Stephen Horn and Adam Putnam graded agency compliance with laws like the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002. Senator Fred Thompson also issued grades for agency performance reports required by the Government Performance and Results Act. Congress has implemented measurement efforts to assess agency management, including issuing letter grades for financial management and information security performance. Senator Fred Thompson also issued grades for agency annual performance reports required by the Government Performance and Results Act. In light of this, Congress could maintain current oversight tools to ensure agencies comply with general management laws and improve their practices. Congress could maintain current oversight tools, such as GAO and agency IGs, to monitor executive branch efforts in improving agency management practices. Critics argue that Congress does not use these tools effectively. Option to increase congressional confidence in executive branch measurements and determinations by verifying PMA stoplight scores and agency actions-taken. Congress could also secure access to final PMA stoplight worksheets for transparency, but this may be perceived as micromanagement by the executive branch. Congress could direct GAO or IGs to develop measures to systematically measure agency progress in improving management practices, making measurement more systematic across agencies. This could increase workload and costs but ensure management improvement measurement survives presidential transitions. Congress could potentially amend GPRA to require agencies to address major management problems and high-risk areas in their strategic plans, annual performance plans, and annual performance reports. This could involve establishing milestones and timelines for improvement and building agency management capacity. Additionally, Congress could require the President to address these issues in the government-wide performance plan. The compendium of general management laws includes the expansion of agency \"chief officer\" positions and interagency councils, which could increase workload for agencies and OMB personnel. These chief officers, also known as \"CXOs,\" head various functions within executive branch agencies. The expansion of agency \"chief officer\" positions includes inspectors general, chief financial officers, chief information officers, chief human capital officers, and chief acquisition officers. Table 1 summarizes key information about each officer position. The table summarizes key details about agency \"chief officer\" positions, including statutory provisions, rules for appointments, and reporting relationships. Some officers are presidentially appointed with Senate confirmation, while others may be appointed by an agency head. Certain positions require political appointees, and reporting relationships vary among different chief officers. The creation of chief officer positions in executive branch agencies aimed to address the lack of attention to functional perspectives like financial management. These positions were established to elevate each functional perspective within agency management ranks to ensure long-standing problems were addressed. The creation of chief officer positions in executive branch agencies aimed to address long-standing problems. Each group of chief officers was placed into an interagency council by statute or executive order, with varying memberships and establishment methods. President Ronald Reagan established the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE) in 1981 through executive order, with the Office of Management and Budget's deputy director for management as the chair or vice chair. The council was tasked with coordinating government-wide efforts to combat fraud and waste in government programs. The PCIE, established in 1981 by President Reagan, became a source of leverage for Inspectors General (IGs) seeking independence and resources. It was endorsed for enhancing IGs' lobbying power and building informal networks for organizational learning. Standing committees were formed to facilitate idea-sharing and collaboration among IGs. In a 1988 hearing, an IG praised the PCIE as a positive innovation that allowed them to work together effectively. The PCIE, established in 1981 by President Reagan, has been praised as a positive innovation that allows Inspectors General to work together effectively. It provides a mechanism for collaboration and networking among IGs, leading to closer relationships and the ability to address fraud, waste, and abuse issues across the Government. However, it was also criticized in the late 1980s as a \"trade union\" for IGs. In 1992, President George H. W. Bush issued a new executive order establishing two IG councils, including the PCIE for presidentially appointed IGs. The new executive order establishes two IG councils: the PCIE for presidentially appointed IGs and the ECIE for IGs typically appointed by agency heads. The CFO Council, created by the CFO Act of 1990, also established the DDM position in the President's Office of Management and Budget with chairperson status over the CFO Council. The DDM is responsible for establishing general management policies in the executive branch. The CFO Council, established by the CFO Act of 1990, oversees financial management, procurement policy, information policy, property management, human resources, and program evaluation. Initially passive, the council became more active in 1994 by broadening membership, electing officers, and setting its agenda. OMB supported these actions. The CFO Council, established by the CFO Act of 1990, oversees financial management, procurement policy, information policy, property management, human resources, and program evaluation. The council formed various committees for special emphasis. The OMB's deputy director for management has leveraging opportunities through interagency councils. The CFO Council served as a model for other interagency efforts. Congress established the CIO Council in 2002, the CHCO Council in 2002, and the CAO Council in 2003. The establishment of IGs, CFOs, and CIOs has been met with little criticism. The CFO Council, established by the CFO Act of 1990, oversees financial management, procurement policy, information policy, property management, human resources, and program evaluation. The council formed various committees for special emphasis. The OMB's deputy director for management has leveraging opportunities through interagency councils. The CFO Council served as a model for other interagency efforts. Observers generally agree that CFOs, CIOs, and CHCOs have been successful in bringing focus to their functional perspectives. However, challenges such as high turnover among CIOs, change management difficulties, and performance measurement issues have been identified. Some commentators argue that agencies faced management difficulties due to budget pressures and lack of attention from short-serving political appointees. Management scholars are cautious of functional silos hindering a more integrated management perspective. Interagency councils of chief officers have shown varying levels of effectiveness. Interagency councils have been beneficial for improving federal management by setting up networks of people to share knowledge and best practices. Sharing best practices and information among human capital officers in different parts of the Federal Government is crucial for organizational performance. Regular meetings and communication can facilitate valuable knowledge exchange. The management literature emphasizes the importance of knowledge management, but warns against solely focusing on one function to avoid narrow perspectives and potential risks. Some scholars and practitioners suggest re-thinking the structure and role of OMB within the Executive Office of the President to improve federal executive branch management. Questions arise about the need for additional chief officers in executive branch agencies and how to preserve institutional memory for these positions. To improve federal executive branch management, questions arise about the need for additional chief officers in agencies. Should agency \"chief security officers\" be established to ensure government services are available in emergencies? Establishing agency \"chief security officers\" (CSOs) is a topic of debate. A 2002 news report found that many corporate CEOs had designated CSOs, who often focus on information technology. However, in some large enterprises, CSOs handle all security responsibilities. While creating statutory CSO positions could lead to conflicts with CIOs, it may also bring a more integrated approach to security and risk management at the federal level. Establishing agency \"chief security officers\" (CSOs) is a topic of debate as it may bring a more integrated approach to security and risk management at federal agencies. Some observers argue that adding more chief officers could be excessive. Many agencies lack capacity, management attention, and resources for program evaluation. Congress could establish \"chief program evaluation officers\" to address this issue. Establishing \"chief program evaluation officer\" (CPEO) positions in major agencies could bring more attention to program evaluation, helping improve performance and coordination. Critics argue that adding another chief officer may be excessive. Establishing new chief officer positions or altering existing ones could lead to various appointment options, with some positions mandated to be political, others career-based, and some left to agency heads' discretion. Recent discussions have highlighted differing opinions on this matter, with political appointees potentially gaining more influence. In enacting the CFO Act, Congress reflected both perspectives on chief officer appointments. CFOs are political, while deputies are career officials. CFOs and CIOs must report directly to the agency head, while IGs report to the agency head or the official \"next in rank.\" The reporting relationships of CHCOs and CAOs are at the discretion of agency heads. One argument for a direct reporting relationship to the agency head is to ensure personal access to senior leadership, but this could lead to too large a span of control. An additional direct report could cause too large a span of control for agency heads. Congress may consider making IG councils statutory to improve training and efficiency. The codification of IG councils would require modest appropriations but improve training, strengthen the IG-Congress relationship, and enhance coordination between federal IG offices. This change may reduce presidential control. Funding for interagency councils like PCIE and ECIE is self-financed through MOUs instead of appropriations or transfers. Funding for IG councils like PCIE and ECIE is self-financed through MOUs instead of appropriations or transfers. The CHCO Council is funded out of the Office of Personnel Management budget, while other councils have been funded through interagency transfers or reimbursements. The funding for IG councils like PCIE and ECIE is self-financed through MOUs instead of appropriations or transfers. Congress could consider making a separate appropriation for each council or all combined, potentially giving them more control and leverage over the councils' activities. Congress could consider altering the reporting and strategic planning requirements for interagency councils to improve institutional memory and continuity. Some councils have no reporting or strategic planning requirements, while others only report to the President or Congress without articulating strategic plans. For example, the PCIE and ECIE are required to report to the President only, and the CFO, CIO, and CAO Councils lack statutory requirements to report to Congress. Congress could consider requiring interagency councils to report to the President or Congress and prepare strategic plans to increase transparency and accountability. This could be included in the government-wide performance plan required by GPRA, although it may limit the President's discretion and increase costs. Requiring interagency councils to report to the President or Congress and prepare strategic plans may limit the President's discretion and increase costs."
