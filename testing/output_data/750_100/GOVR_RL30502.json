    "content": "P.L. 106-554, signed in December 2000, enacted H.R. 5658 for Treasury and General Government Appropriations. Funding was provided for the General Services Administration and Executive Residence for White House transition. P.L. 106-346 (H.R. 4475) partially funded transportation appropriations. Title V of H.R. 4475, the Transportation appropriations bill, partially funds select accounts from the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government primary funding measure. Prior to P.L. 106-554, which enacted FY2001 Treasury and General Government appropriations, various measures were considered to fund affected accounts. Key measures include House bill H.R. 4871, Senate bill S. 2900, and the Legislative Branch Appropriation conference report. The Legislative Branch Appropriation conference report or H.R. 4516 / H.R. 4985 was vetoed on October 30. Transportation Appropriations under P.L. 106-346 (H.R. 4475) provided partial funding and general provisions. FY2001 Continuing Funding Resolution under P.L. 106-275, as amended, and P.L. 106-426 funded the presidential transition. P.L. 106-554 enacted H.R. 5658 for Treasury and General Government funding. The President submits the Budget of the United States Government annually to Congress. Congress passes a concurrent resolution establishing the congressional budget and setting budgetary levels for future years. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees then allocate discretionary funding levels. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees allocate discretionary funding levels to subcommittees. This includes funding for the Department of the Treasury, law enforcement organizations, and the Internal Revenue Service. The Treasury appropriations cover various agencies including the Internal Revenue Service, Financial Management Service, and Bureau of the Public Debt. The U.S. Postal Service is mostly self-supporting, with limited federal contributions for specific purposes like free postal service for the blind. Appropriations for the Executive Office of the President fund salaries, expenses, and operations of various agencies within the EOP. The Treasury appropriations fund various agencies including the Internal Revenue Service, Financial Management Service, and Bureau of the Public Debt. The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) distributes funding for drug control initiatives to other entities. Independent agencies like the Federal Election Commission and the National Archives are also financed through this appropriation. The general titles in addition to the specific agency funding cover governmentwide restrictions and actions. For example, there are standard language provisions prohibiting the use of funds for non-U.S. citizens, requiring drug-free workplaces, and authorizing travel expenses for federal employees' immediate family members serving overseas. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2001 includes a .22% rescission of FY2001 discretionary budget authority and obligation limitations funds affecting all Treasury and General Government appropriations. The Office of Management and Budget must report on the implementation of the rescission when the FY2002 budget is submitted. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2001 includes a .22% rescission of FY2001 discretionary budget authority and obligation limitations funds affecting all Treasury and General Government appropriations. The Office of Management Budget issued guidelines for agencies to implement the rescission, applying it equally to all programs, projects, and activities subject to the reduction. Advance appropriations for FY 2001 provided in FY 2000 or earlier years are included in the rescission, while advance appropriations for FY 2002 and beyond are exempt. Discretionary emergency appropriations are also subject to the rescission. The .22% rescission of FY2001 discretionary budget authority and obligation limitations funds affects all Treasury and General Government appropriations. Agencies will receive their rescission amounts by account from their OMB representative. The FY2000 Consolidated Appropriations Act mandated a 0.38% across-the-board rescission, with specific reductions reported by OMB in the FY2001 budget submission. The FY2000 Consolidated Appropriations Act mandated a 0.38% across-the-board rescission, with specific reductions reported by OMB in the FY2001 budget submission. OMB issued a fact sheet stating that each department must achieve 0.38% in savings, with some flexibility to protect high-priority programs. The FY2001 rescission provisions exempt certain programs but are otherwise universally applied. The FY2001 Military Construction Appropriations Act includes the FY2000 Supplemental funding provisions. The FY2000 Supplemental funding provisions impact accounts covered by the Treasury/Postal Service measure. For example, it reverts the pay date for federal civilian personnel to the original scheduled date in FY2000, altering the funding levels. The term \"net\" in this report refers to FY2000 appropriated levels reduced by the rescinded amount. Table 4 summarizes FY2000 enacted funding, House and Senate reported or passed funding, and FY2001 enacted funding. The FY2000 Supplemental funding provisions impact accounts covered by the Treasury/Postal Service measure, reverting the pay date for federal civilian personnel to the original scheduled date in FY2000. Table 4 summarizes FY2000 enacted funding, House and Senate reported or passed funding, and FY2001 enacted funding. H.R. 4871 passed the House, S. 2900 was reported by the Senate Committee on Appropriations, and H.R. 4985 was included in Division B of the Legislative Branch appropriations. H.R. 4985 was included in Division B of the Legislative Branch appropriations conference agreement, which was vetoed on October 30. P.L. 106-346 (H.R. 4475) partially funds selected Treasury and General Government accounts. The House Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government held hearings in March and April 2000. The House passed H.R. 4871 on July 20, 2000, by a vote of 216-202. The Senate Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government held hearings and sent the bill to the full Appropriations Committee. On July 24, 2000, the Senate Majority Leader requested a cloture motion against H.R. 4871. On July 24, 2000, the Senate Majority Leader requested a cloture motion for H.R. 4871, Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government appropriations bill. Cloture was invoked on July 26 by a vote of 97-0, and debate on the measure began. On July 26, 2000, Treasury Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman introduced H.R. 4985 for fiscal year ending September 30, 2001. On July 27, 2000, the House agreed to the conference report for H.R. 4516 (FY2001) after waiving points of order. On September 14, 2000, the House approved funding for the Treasury and General Government accounts in the FY2001 legislative branch funding bill. The Senate initially rejected the conference report on September 20 but later agreed to it on October 12. The bill was vetoed by the President on October 30, leading to the House recommitting the bill and veto message to the House Committee on Appropriations on October 31. The House Committee on Appropriations received the FY2001 Continuing Funding Resolution on October 31. Most accounts were funded at FY2000 levels through continuing resolutions, except for new accounts which had no funding until December 21, 2000. The General Services Administration account for presidential transition was funded through a further resolution (P.L. 106-426, November 3, 2000) allowing the White House to use funds for transition preparations. The authorization for the transfer of families during the transition was granted through the 16th continuing funding resolution, P.L. 106-520. The Transportation FY2001 appropriation, H.R. 4475, reached agreement on October 5, with partial funding provisions for accounts usually funded within the Treasury and General Government appropriation. Both the House and Senate agreed to the conference language on October 6, and P.L. 106-346 was signed by the President on October 23, 2000. P.L. 106-554 enacted H.R. 5658 through reference. P.L. 106-554 enacted H.R. 5658, the Treasury and General Government Appropriations, FY 2001, through reference. H.R. 5658 was introduced as a new bill with funding levels identical to H.R. 4985. The conference report for H.R. 4577 contains the legislative text and explanatory remarks for H.R. 5658. Table 1 shows the status of FY2001 Appropriations for various government entities. The Department of the Treasury has financial and law enforcement functions carried out by various agencies including the Financial Management Service, the Mint, the Bureau of Public Debt, the Customs Service, the Secret Service, ATF, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, and the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. The Internal Revenue Service handles tax obligations and enforcement. The Department of Treasury's largest account is for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), with FY2000 funding at $12.352 billion. In FY2001, the total funding is $13.89 billion, with $8.86 billion allocated to the IRS. A .22% rescission may result in a $30 million reduction. The FY2001 budget request is $14.520 billion for the department. The FY2001 budget request for the Department of Treasury is $14.520 billion, with key priorities including supporting IRS reform, fighting drugs and crime, enhancing financial reporting, and investing in community development. Funding would more than double for department-wide systems and capital investments, increase interagency crime and drug enforcement by 40%, eliminate funding for the Violent Crime Reduction Program, and increase funding for the Secret Service, ATF, and Customs Service. The increase for the IRS would be just under 10%. The House Appropriations committee reported H.R. 4871, providing $13.225 billion for the Department of Treasury. H.R. 4871 would reduce funding for the Office of the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration and offset additional funding for the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas program. The SenateCommittee on Appropriations reported S. 2900, providing $13.161 billion for the Department of Treasury. The IRS would receive $8.639 billion, or 63% of the total funding. Additional funding for certain Treasury accounts was included in the Department of Transportation funding bill (P.L. 106-346), including funds for a new National Terrorist Asset Tracking Center and staff increases in the Office of Foreign Assets Control. The Department of Treasury is directed to fund detailees to the Center and increase staff in the Office of Foreign Assets Control. They must establish a centralized vehicle acquisition program before receiving further funding. Additional funding is allocated for various programs including Integrated Treasury, Expanded Access to Financial Services, and Federal Law Enforcement. $5 million is designated to establish a metropolitan area law enforcement training center accessible by multiple agencies. The curr_chunk discusses funding for various law enforcement agencies including the United States Capitol Police, Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, U.S. Customs Service, Internal Revenue Service, and U.S. Secret Service. $25 million is allocated for the design and construction of a metropolitan area law enforcement training center. The ATF is highlighted as a law enforcement agency that regulates. The ATF is a law enforcement agency that regulates alcohol, tobacco, firearms, and explosives, with a focus on reducing crime, collecting revenue, and protecting the public. In FY1999, ATF collected over $12 billion in taxes and other revenues. Congress has increased ATF's funding significantly from FY1992 to FY2001. In FY2001, Congress provided a 28% increase in funding for ATF, totaling $768,695,000 for salaries and expenses. Additionally, $4,148,000 was allocated for counter-terrorism efforts. The administration's FY2001 request for ATF was mostly fully funded, with the exception of $5,521,000 for the tobacco compliance initiative. The vetoed Legislative Branch conference agreement would have also provided $768,695,000 for ATF. In FY2001, Congress provided increased funding for ATF, with the House version allocating $731,325,000 and the Senate version $724,937,000. The administration's request included budget increases for various initiatives, such as the Integrated Violence Reduction Strategy, Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative, gun tracing, ballistic imaging, tobacco compliance, and ATF headquarters relocation. Congress also allocated additional funds for the Integrated Violence Reduction Strategy. In FY2001, Congress provided additional funding of $41,322,000 for the Integrated Violence Reduction Strategy (IVRS), which will fund 224 agents, 112 inspectors, and 59 support staff. This brings the total funding for IVRS to $62,200,000. ATF plans to intensify local firearm initiatives and investigate cases of prohibited persons attempting to purchase firearms. The ATF aims to prevent prohibited persons with violent histories from acquiring firearms through legal or illegal means by conducting investigations and ensuring proper record-keeping by federal firearm licensees. Congress has allocated $19,078,000 to expand the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative to 12 more cities, hiring 72 agents and 98 inspectors. This will bring the total funding for the program to $76,400,000 and extend its reach to 50 cities, with the goal of reducing youth firearm violence. The Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative (YCGII) aims to reduce youth firearm violence and trafficking by providing federal resources to state and local law enforcement agencies. Congress allocated $16 million for the Gang Resistance Education and Training (GREAT) program, and $9,990,000 for the Comprehensive Crime Gun Tracing Initiative in FY2001. This brings the total funding for the initiative to $76,400,000 and extends its presence to 50 cities. The funding for the Comprehensive Crime Gun Tracing Initiative has been increased to $25,000,000 with 20 additional positions. The Expanded Ballistics Identification Initiative has received $23,361,000 and 20 more positions, bringing the total funding to $26,400,000. ATF and FBI signed a memorandum of understanding for the development of the Integrated Ballistics Identification System. The ATF and FBI operated two parallel, incompatible systems for ballistics evidence comparison until the development of the Integrated Ballistics Identification System (IBIS). Congress provided funding for the national laboratory transition and ATF headquarters relocation but did not fund the Administration's request for the Tobacco Compliance/Diversion initiative. This increase was needed to monitor new permit and revenue requirements for importers of tobacco products. The ATF's regulation and enforcement of firearms laws have been controversial, with proposed legislation aiming to prevent preferences for manufacturers or vendors who agree to additional requirements beyond federal statutes. Smith & Wesson Corporation entered into such an agreement. The Smith & Wesson Corporation entered into an agreement with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) under federal statute. HUD announced that 411 governments had joined the Communities for Safer Guns Coalition, pledging preferences for manufacturers in similar agreements. However, this language was not included in the enacted Labor-HHS appropriations act. The U.S. Customs Service, a key revenue collecting agency, collected $22.4 billion in trade-related duties in FY1999. Congress increased direct appropriations for Customs from $1.45 billion in FY1992 to $1.93 billion in FY2000, a 33% increase. Additionally, Customs collected $299 million in COBRA fee receipts in FY2000. For FY2001, Congress appropriated $2.28 billion for the Customs Service. In FY2001, Congress appropriated $2,281,327,000 for Customs, an 18% increase from FY2000. This includes funding for salaries, expenses, counter-terrorism, air, and marine interdiction. The total amount falls $5,167,000 short of the Administration's request. Congress provided $7,000,000 for air and marine interdiction, totaling $16,647,000 less than the Administration's request. Additionally, $258,400,000 was allocated for Customs' automated systems modernization, $80,000,000 less than projected fee receipts. $3,000,000 in offsetting fee receipts for harbor maintenance was also appropriated. The appropriations conference agreement allocated $1,863,725,000 to Customs, with specific amounts for air and marine interdiction. The House bill proposed $1,822,365,000, while the Senate bill suggested $1,804,687,000. The Administration's budget request included $41,517,000 for program enhancements, such as $25,000,000 for drug investigations. The appropriations conference agreement allocated $1,863,725,000 to Customs, with specific amounts for air and marine interdiction. This included $25,000,000 for drug investigations, $10,000,000 for narcotics/illicit proceeds strategy, $5,000,000 for forced child labor, and $1,517,000 for Customs' airborne support for the United States Secret Service. Additional funding was requested for various budget adjustments to maintain current service levels. The vetoed conference agreement included earmarks for the Southwest border initiative and other initiatives. The appropriations conference agreement allocated $1,863,725,000 to Customs, with specific amounts for various initiatives including drug investigations, narcotics/illicit proceeds strategy, forced child labor, and airborne support for the Secret Service. The House bill earmarked increases for drug investigations and forced child labor initiatives. Customs' Automated Commercial System has faced challenges and \"brownouts\" affecting its operations. The Automated Commercial System in the United States has faced challenges with \"brownouts\" hindering international commerce. Congress has provided funding for Customs to upgrade ACS and develop its replacement, the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE), but Customs has struggled with maintenance and development. Congress directed Customs to provide a revised blueprint, schedule, and budget for ACE in the FY2000 conference report. The Administration requested $338 million for a new Customs budget account for automation modernization in FY2001. This included $123 million for ACS operation and maintenance, $5 million for ITDS, and $210 million for ACE development. Congress rejected the fee proposal for ACE developmental costs. The Administration requested $338 million for Customs automation modernization in FY2001, including $123 million for ACS operation and maintenance, $5 million for ITDS, and $210 million for ACE development. Congress rejected the fee proposal and provided over $258 million in direct appropriation, with at least $130 million for ACE development. The cost of developing, operating, and maintaining ACE over 7 years is estimated to be between $1.4 and $1.8 billion. Customs would begin taking bids to develop the new system in FY2001. GAO testified that Customs had implemented recommendations to reduce duplication of effort and improve systems architecture. The development of ACE is a complex and high-risk endeavor that supports Customs' ability to collect billions of dollars in revenue generated by imports. Customs generates offsetting receipts from two user fee programs related to conveyance, passengers, and bulk cargo from Mexico and Canada. The second fee program, the commerce-related merchandise processing fee (MPF), was established by the 1986 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA). Customs has limited control over the allocation of MPF fee receipts. COBRA fee receipts, not appropriated by Congress, provide a significant portion of Customs funding. From FY1992 to FY2000, COBRA fee receipts increased from $176,000,000 to $299,000,000. There are restrictions on the use of COBRA fee receipts, initially used for overtime costs for inspectors and canine enforcement officers. Surplus revenues could be used for other purposes. In recent months, there have been reports of a drop-off in air passenger processing fee receipts, leading to concerns about Customs' reliance on COBRA fee receipts to fund base positions. This may result in insufficient funds to pay overtime for Customs officers in the coming year. The FY2001 request for IRS was $8,986,084,000, a 9.36% increase over FY2000 funding. The budget focuses on maintaining operations and modernization, with a higher request for the IRS Processing, Assistance, and Management account. IRS Commissioner Charles O. Rossotti emphasized the need for maintenance. IRS Commissioner Charles O. Rossotti testified that additional staffing is needed for enforcement and customer service, particularly for a new computer system. H.R. 4871 would fund IRS programs at $8.453 billion, with a net increase of $236.5 million. Amendments reduced funding for the IRS Processing Assistance and Management account by $25 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee (S. 2900) reported that IRS funding would total $8.535 billion, with higher levels of funding for IRS accounts compared to the House. P.L. 106-554 funds the IRS accounts at even higher levels, except for the Earned Income Tax Credit Compliance Initiative account. Amendments reduced funding for the IRS Processing Assistance and Management account by $25 million and funding for the Office of Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration by $950,000 for a pilot project to check for radioactive materials in scrap metal imported into the United States. The IRS accounts received $8.639 million in total funding, with Processing, Assistance, and Management getting $3,567.0 million, Tax Law Enforcement funded at $3,382.4 million, and Information Systems at $1,545 million. The vetoed conference agreement (H.R. 4516/H.R. 4985) was the same as the final version, with objections raised over FY2001 IRS funding in the Legislative Branch Appropriations. The White House did not issue a Statement of Policy, but there were warnings of a veto if certain accounts were not adjusted. The President signed P.L. 106-346 with partial funding for selected accounts in the Treasury/General Government bill, despite warnings of a veto if certain accounts were not funded at a higher level. The IRS supplemental provisions include delaying the implementation of a no-cost Internet tax filing service until concerns are addressed, and allocating $7.974 million for Tax Law Enforcement, including support for the money laundering strategy. The IRS supplemental provisions include funding for Tax Law Enforcement, with $7.974 million allocated for support of the money laundering strategy and $4.839 million for agents to participate in Joint Terrorism Task Forces. Additionally, $71.751 million is designated for Information Technology Investments and $141 million for Staff Tax Administration for Balance and Equity, pending approval of a staffing plan. The STABLE initiative aims to enhance service to taxpayers and meet statutory mandates through staff increases. The IRS is requesting an increase in staffing for Tax Law Enforcement by 158 full-time equivalent positions. This initiative aims to place new hires where they are most needed, such as in auditing, enforcement, and customer relations. H.R. 4985 does not provide funding for the STABLE initiative, but the Tax Law Enforcement account will be fully funded to maintain current levels of service and operational support. The President requested $829.5 million for the Secret Service in FY2001, with $824.5 million for salaries, expenses, research, and vehicles, and $5 million for acquisition and construction. FY2000 net funding was $691.5 million, with a rescission of $738,000. P.L. 106-554 funds the Secret Service at $823.8 million for salaries and expenses. The Secret Service's salaries and expenses account is funded at $823.8 million, with additional funding of $8.941 million for acquisitions, construction, and related expenses. This includes $3.920 million for security enhancements at the Vice President's residence. P.L. 106-346 provides supplemental funding of $2.9 million for 21 agents to participate in Joint Terrorism Task Forces. Section 506 allocates $2 million for forensic support of investigations of missing and exploited children until September 30, 2001. The House Appropriations Committee funded the Secret Service's salaries and expenses account at $823.8 million, which is $156.5 million above the amount appropriated in FY2000. Additionally, $36.2 million would fund activities previously funded elsewhere, including $1.8 million for the National Threat Assessment Center. H.R. 4871 also included $24.2 million for additional protective requirements of the Secret Service during the Presidential election and transition period. The vetoed conference agreement on funding the Secret Service's salaries and expenses account at $778.3 million was rejected. The President's request and H.R. 4871 aimed to fund the account at $5 million, while the Senate-reported version proposed $4.3 million. However, H.R. 4516 / H.R. 4985 sought to allocate $8.9 million, including $3.9 million for security enhancements at the Vice President's residence. The U.S. Postal Service generates most of the funding for the Secret Service through the sale of products and services. The USPS generates funding through product sales and services, with additional federal government appropriations for revenue foregone on free and reduced rate mail. The President requested $96.1 million for FY2001, with $67.1 million delayed until October 1, 2001. The FY2000 appropriation for revenue foregone was $93.4 million, reduced by .38% due to across-the-board cuts mandated by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of FY2000. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of FY2000 mandated an across-the-board cut of $380,000. The FY2001 funding was set at $93.1 million, with an advance appropriation of $67.1 million for FY2002. The rescission of .22% only applies to FY2001 funding, affecting funds appropriated in FY2000 for use in FY2001. H.R. 4871 and S. 2900 differed in their funding allocations for the Postal Service, with the vetoed measure providing $96.1 million. The vetoed measure would have provided $96.1 million in funding for the Postal Service, with $67.1 million allocated for advance appropriations for free and reduced-rate mail and $29 million for reimbursement in FY2001 for prior year losses. Guards for Postal Service properties would have the same powers as special policemen. The Act of June 1, 1948 granted special policemen with penal consequences under that authority. The Treasury and General Government appropriations act funds most offices in the Executive Office of the President, except for three offices funded under different appropriations acts. The Executive Office of the President is funded under the Commerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary appropriations act. The President's FY2001 budget proposed $702,245,000 for the EOP, with 70% allocated to the Office of National Drug Control Policy and Federal Drug Control Programs. $474,900,000 would be transferred to agencies outside the EOP and state/local entities. The enacted funding levels for specific accounts are discussed below, with a 56% increase in compensation for the President in FY2001. The White House Office received an appropriation in accord with the FY2001 budget proposal. The White House Office received an appropriation of $53,288,000 for salaries and expenses in FY2001, a 2% increase from FY2000. H.R. 4871 proposed $52,135,000, $1,153,000 below the President's request. The House denied requests to restore previous rescinded funds and allocated $500,000 for web page upgrades in the Office of Administration. The White House Office received $10,900,000 for operating expenses in FY2001, a 17.7% increase from the previous year. The request for repairs and restoration was $968,000, a 581.2% increase from FY2000. H.R. 4871 would have allocated $10,286,470 for operating expenses and denied several requests. The House Appropriation Committee recommended denying $4,542,000 for renovation and replacement of the concrete raceway containing communication lines, expressing concern over the total estimated costs of the project. S. 2900 and H.R. 4516/H.R. 4985 would have funded the accounts at the requested level, with the latter limiting the repairs and restoration account to $968,000. Funding for repairs and restoration includes $458,000 for design and replacement of the existing concrete raceway containing voice. $458,000 allocated for design and replacement of the concrete raceway with voice and communications lines at the East Wing and Executive Residence. A completed design with total construction cost estimate must be submitted to the Appropriations Committees. The FY2001 funding resolution authorizes expenditures for transition and moving expenses after the 2000 election. House Appropriations Committee Chairman C.W. Bill Young mentioned an additional $200,000 from the vetoed Treasury, Postal budget. The curr_chunk discusses funding for maintenance and repair costs for the White House, entertainment costs for state functions, and reimbursable political events in the Executive Residence. It also mentions the requirement for the President's political party to deposit $25,000 for expenses related to reimbursable political events. The Act requires separate accounting for reimbursable political event expenses and billing sponsoring organizations. The Executive Residence staff must report to the Committees on Appropriations annually and track reimbursable expenses. The budget proposes $3,673,000 for salaries and expenses, a 1.5% increase from FY2000, and $354,000 for the Official Residence of the Vice President, a 2.6% increase. The budget for the Official Residence of the Vice President saw a 2.6% increase to $354,000 from the previous year's $345,000.

P.L. 106-554 appropriated $4,032,000 for the same office, with $15,000 rescinded from the previous year. The National Security Council also saw funding at the requested level in FY2001. The FY2001 budget proposed an increase in funding for the National Security Council and the Office of Administration. The House approved appropriations for both offices, with slight adjustments from the requested levels. The House approved an appropriation of $41,185,000 for the Office of Management and Budget in FY2000, denying several funding requests. The Act fully funded the FY2001 budget request at $68,786,000, an increase of 8.3% over the previous year.

The House denied additional funding requests for nine FTE positions and information technology enhancements. S. 2900 proposed funding OMB at $67,935,000, while H.R. 4516/H.R. 4985 would have funded it at the requested level. Section 624 of the Act made permanent the provision for OMB to provide yearly accounting statements on Federal regulatory programs. The Act appropriates $24,759,000 for the salaries and expenses account of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. The FY2001 budget requested $25,400,000, a 10.7% increase over the previous year. The House approved $24,759,000, denying a request for $641,000 for communications equipment and services.

Locality-based payments are calculated based on surveys of occupations in specific localities within the continental United States, with an average of 16% needed to meet FEPCA expectations. President Clinton vetoed a bill funding Congress and the White House, prioritizing classrooms, schools, and workers. President Clinton sent an alternative plan to Congress on December 1, 2000, proposing locality payments equal to 1% of payroll to meet FEPCA expectations. The Federal Wage System (FWS) compensates federal blue-collar workers based on local wage rates for similar occupations, with adjustments varying in over 130 wage areas based on private sector labor costs. Congress has limited adjustments in recent years based on General Schedule rates. The FY2001 appropriations continue to limit wage increases for Federal Wage System (FWS) workers in high-cost areas, based on General Schedule rates. Pay adjustments for federal officials, including Members of Congress and judges, are also tied to ECI calculations. The ECI calculations dictate a 3% pay adjustment in January 2001, limited to the General Schedule base pay adjustment rate of 2.7% for federal officials. Despite reports of a veto to prevent a pay raise for Members of Congress, the raise would still take effect as neither bill contains a provision for it. The pay increase for judges is specifically authorized and outlined in the Commerce, State, Justice and Judiciary appropriation (P.L. 106-554, section 309), unlike for Members of Congress and executive branch officials. The vetoed bill and P.L. 106-554 do not address the pay increase issue, which is automatic unless explicitly denied in legislation. The Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 2000 (P.L. 106-58) increased the President's salary to $400,000 per year from $200,000 since 1969. Section 630 of H.R. 5658, under P.L. 106-554, mandates health insurance plans in the FEHBP to cover prescription contraceptives, with exemptions for certain health organizations for religious reasons. The FY2001 act prohibits discrimination against individuals who refuse to provide contraceptives due to religious beliefs. It exempts certain health plans from covering prescription contraceptives in the FEHBP. Section 509 of H.R. 5658 prohibits funds from being used for abortions or administrative expenses in health plans under FEHB, except in cases of endangerment to the mother's health or rape. Section 513 exempts FEHBP contracts from cost accounting standards. Repeal of Temporary Increase in Retirement Contributions mandated by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 is also addressed. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 mandated a temporary increase in employee contributions to retirement systems, phased in over 3 years. Contributions increased by 0.25% in 1999, 0.15% in 2000, and were scheduled to rise by another 0.1% in 2001. The higher contributions did not increase benefit accruals and were set to revert to previous levels in 2003. The President's proposed budget for FY2001 included a legislative initiative to repeal the increase in employee contributions. The FY2001 budget included a legislative initiative to repeal the increase in employee contributions mandated by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Two bills were introduced in Congress for this purpose (H.R. 2631 / S. 1472). The higher contribution rates were repealed for all federal employees except Members of Congress by P.L. 106-346. Additionally, qualified members of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority were designated as eligible to be treated as law enforcement officers under CSRS or FERS by H.R. 5658. Federal law enforcement officers under CSRS and FERS can retire at age 50 with 20 years of service. They earn a larger retirement benefit and contribute an additional 0.5% of pay. Retirement age is 57 or after 20 years of service. There is an increase in maximum allowable contributions to the Thrift Savings Plan. The Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) allows federal employees to contribute a percentage of their pay, with different limits based on their retirement system. The maximum allowable employee contribution to the TSP was increased by P.L. 106-554. Beginning with the open season starting May 15, 2001, employees covered by FERS can contribute up to 11% of pay to the TSP, and those under CSRS can contribute up to 6%. These limits will increase by 1% each year until reaching 15% for FERS and 10% for CSRS in fiscal year. In fiscal year 2006, the percent-of-pay limits on TSP contributions will be abolished, and employees will be subject only to the contribution limits prevailing under IRC \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd 402(g). Section 633 of H.R. 5658 continues provisions for child care in federal facilities, while Section 643 requires criminal background checks for employees at federally-provided day care facilities. The House version of the FY2000 Treasury, Postal, and General Government appropriations bill (H.R. 2490) included provisions for federal child care services, which were ultimately enacted into law (P.L. 106-58). H.R. 4871, passed by the House in July 2000, allowed executive branch agencies to use agency funds for child care services for civilian employees to improve affordability for lower-income federal employees. The bill allowed federal agencies to use funds for child care services for lower-income employees, with payments made in advance to licensed providers. An amendment required background checks for workers in federally-owned child care centers. The Senate's bill included similar language. The Senate Appropriations Committee on July 20, 2000, included language from H.R. 4871 for improving child care affordability for lower income federal employees. However, it did not include provisions for timing of payments to child care providers or background checks for child care workers in federal centers. The vetoed Legislative Branch Appropriations conference report also had similar child care provisions as H.R. 4871 for improving federal child care affordability and requiring criminal background checks. The conference version (H.R. 4516/H.R. 4985) did not include advance payment of salaries to providers, unlike H.R. 4871. P.L. 106-554 enacted the language from the conference version. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees approved allocations for various appropriations, with the House approving discretionary budget authority at $14.088 billion and the Senate reporting a revised allocation of $14.402 billion in budget authority. The House approved $14.088 billion in discretionary budget authority, while the Senate allocated $14.402 billion. The administration's request was for $14.678 billion in budget authority. H.R. 5658, enacted through P.L. 106-554, funded Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government accounts at $30.31 billion. Mandatory accounts received $14.68 billion, and discretionary accounts received $15.63 billion. The House approved $14.088 billion in discretionary budget authority, while the Senate allocated $14.402 billion. The administration's request was for $14.678 billion. P.L. 106-554 funded Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government accounts at $30.31 billion. The sum of mandatory and discretionary funding requested is $30.8 billion, with CBO calculating it at $31.2 billion. The CBO scorekeeping process includes guidelines found in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. The Treasury, Postal Service, Executive Office of the President, and General Government Appropriations for FY2001 were detailed in a conference report. The Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2001 and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2001 were detailed in Congressional Record vol. 146. Funding information for H.R. 4475 and H.R. 5658 was provided by the House Committee on Appropriations. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2001 is also known as P.L. 106-554. Government Appropriation (H.R. 5658) details can be found on pages H12230-H12258, including a chart showing Treasury and General Government accounts. Funding information for H.R. 4475 was provided by the House Committee on Appropriations. The House Committee on Appropriations provided funding details for H.R. 5658, as enacted through P.L. 106-554. A chart showing Treasury and General Government accounts is included on pages H12230-H12258. The totals provided include funding reductions due to a rescission required by P.L. 106-113. Some individual accounts reflect reduced appropriations. The Department of Transportation Appropriation, 2001 (H.R. 4475) under P.L. 106-346 provides partial funding for selected accounts. A further continuing funding resolution under P.L. 106-520 authorizes funds for moving families to and from the White House, estimated at about $200,000. Selected definitions from the \"Glossary of Budgetary Terms\" are included in the Manual on the Federal Budget Process. The Manual on the Federal Budget Process defines key terms related to budgeting and accounting, including Account, Appropriation, Authorization, and Budget Authority. These terms are crucial for understanding the federal budget process. Budget authority includes appropriations, borrowing authority, and contract authority. A budget resolution is a concurrent resolution passed by Congress setting forth the budget for at least the next five fiscal years. A continuing resolution provides budget authority to agencies or programs when regular appropriations have not been enacted. Continuing resolutions are temporary measures that provide budget authority to programs when regular appropriations have not been enacted. Direct spending, also known as mandatory spending, is budget authority provided in laws other than annual appropriations acts. It is subject to the PAGO rules and is distinguished from discretionary spending. Mandatory spending, also known as direct spending, is subject to PAGO rules. Discretionary spending is budget authority provided in annual appropriations acts. Federal funds encompass all government monies except trust funds. Outlays are payments made to fulfill obligations. The PAGO process, established by the Budget Enforcement Act, ensures that revenue and direct spending legislation does not increase the deficit or reduce the surplus. It requires any deficit increase or surplus reduction to be offset by other legislation or sequestration. The reconciliation process allows Congress to change existing laws to align with tax and spending policies. The reconciliation process in the Congressional Budget Act allows Congress to align tax and spending levels with a budget resolution. Changes recommended by committees are included in a reconciliation bill. A revolving fund is an account where all income is used to finance operations without fiscal year limitation. Scorekeeping tracks congressional budget actions, and supplemental appropriations provide additional budget authority. Supplemental appropriations provide budget authority in addition to regular appropriations. Trust funds are designated for specific purposes, and user fees are charged for government services. Congress decides whether the revenue goes to the Treasury or the agency.
