    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Crime Victim Restitution and Court Fee Intercept Act\" and allows for the offset of state judicial debts against income tax refunds. The \"Crime Victim Restitution and Court Fee Intercept Act\" amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow for the collection of past-due state judicial debts through income tax refund offsets. The Act allows for the reduction of overpayments to pay state judicial debts, with the amount being paid to the state judicial branch or agency. The person making the overpayment is notified of the reduction. The reduction of overpayments to satisfy state judicial debts includes notifying the person making the overpayment and providing details for joint returns. The reduction of overpayments can be applied to various types of debts, including internal revenue tax, past-due support, debts to Federal agencies, and State income tax obligations. The Secretary can apply overpayments by a person against multiple debts owed to State agencies or the State judicial branch, before crediting it towards future Federal internal revenue tax liabilities. The overpayment by a person can be applied against debts in the order they accrued, with rules similar to subsection (e)(4) applying. A past-due, legally enforceable State judicial debt refers to a debt resulting from a court judgment or sentence. State judicial debt refers to debts determined by a competent jurisdiction in the state, past-due but not collected, including court costs, fees, fines, assessments, and restitution. The Secretary will issue regulations for submitting notices of past-due State judicial debts, including court costs, fees, fines, assessments, and restitution, to ensure compliance by State judicial branches and agencies. The regulations will specify types of State judicial monies and the minimum debt amount for the reduction procedure. State judicial branches and agencies may need to pay a fee to reimburse the Secretary for applying the procedure, with the fee used to reimburse appropriations for the cost. Any State judicial branch or agency receiving notice from the Secretary about an erroneous payment must take action. State judicial branches or State agencies must promptly repay the Secretary for any erroneous payments received, as specified in regulations. Additionally, there are procedures for disclosing return information under the Internal Revenue Code. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include subsection (g) in addition to subsections (c), (d), (e), and (f) for disclosure of information to agencies. Various sections of the Code are also amended to reflect this change. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include subsection (g) for disclosure of information to agencies. Section 6402(f) is amended to specify the process before overpayment is reduced or credited for State judicial debts and Federal internal revenue tax liabilities. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include subsection (g) for disclosure of information to agencies regarding past-due State judicial debts and Federal internal revenue tax liabilities. Amendments are made to sections 6402(h) and 6402(j) to include subsection (g) in the process of reducing or crediting overpayments. These amendments apply to future liabilities for Federal internal revenue tax. The amendments made by this Act apply to refunds for taxable years starting after December 31, 2008."
