    "content": "In 1976, President Gerald Ford signed the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) into law, authorizing the EPA to regulate toxic chemicals in U.S. commerce to prevent harm to human health or the environment. The EPA evaluates risks throughout the chemical life-cycle and has various regulatory options. Congress has added five titles to TSCA and made amendments since its inception. Since 1976, Congress has added five titles to TSCA and made amendments to target specific chemical concerns. Bills introduced since 2005 to revise the chemical evaluation process have not been enacted due to legislative debate. More chemicals have entered the U.S. market since TSCA was enacted in 1976. Since the enactment of TSCA in 1976, more chemicals have entered the U.S. market, leading to an increase in studies on chemical risks. Proponents argue that the current regulatory framework is not sufficiently protective, as few chemicals have been evaluated and regulated under TSCA's risk management provisions. States have enacted statutes to address specific chemical concerns not covered by EPA under TSCA. EPA's evaluation of risks is dependent on available resources. Manufacturers and processors argue that different state regulations for the same chemical are inefficient due to interstate commerce. Proponents of state regulations believe states should lead in alternative approaches to protect citizens. Non-governmental programs like labeling products as \"sustainable\" or \"non-toxic\" have also emerged. In the 114th Congress, bills have been introduced to amend Title I of TSCA, including the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act (S. 697). This report tracks the legislative status of these bills and discusses selected issues related to regulation. The Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act (S. 697) and the Alan Reinstein and Trevor Schaefer Toxic Chemical Protection Act (S. 725) were introduced in the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. Senate EPW held a hearing on S. 697 and marked up an amendment for Senate floor consideration. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce also addressed related issues. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce introduced the TSCA Modernization Act of 2015, which was later ordered to be forwarded to the full committee for consideration. H.R. 2576, also known as the TSCA Modernization Act of 2015, was introduced on May 26, 2015. The TSCA Modernization Act of 2015, H.R. 2576, was introduced and approved by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce with technical amendments. The House later passed the bill on a 398-1 vote. Key debated issues include the federal role in regulating chemical substances under Title I of TSCA. The TSCA Modernization Act of 2015, H.R. 2576, addresses key debated issues such as prioritizing existing chemical substances for risk evaluation, regulatory thresholds for restricting substances, EPA's authority to require new information, preemption of state laws, disclosure of information, and EPA resources. Comparisons are made with S. 697 and S. 725. The report compares approaches in S. 697, S. 725, and H.R. 2576 in amending TSCA to address key issues. EPA has discretion in evaluating chemical risks under current TSCA. Limited resources impact the selection of chemicals for evaluation. EPA may evaluate chemicals on the initial inventory reported under TSCA Section 8(a). In 2012, EPA identified over 1,200 substances for evaluation under TSCA Work Plan, screening them based on hazard, exposure, and bioaccumulation potential. 90 substances were prioritized for risk evaluation. EPA has assessed five out of 90 prioritized chemical substances for risks to human health or the environment. Section 5 of TSCA requires manufacturers to submit a PMN to EPA 90 days before manufacturing a new chemical substance. EPA has received over 36,000 PMNs and 13,000 PMN exemption applications from July 1979 to September 2010. The EPA has received over 36,000 PMNs and 13,000 PMN exemption applications. S. 697 and S. 725 would prioritize existing chemical substances for risk evaluation, while H.R. 2576 would evaluate chemicals based on specific criteria. H.R. 2576 would allow EPA to assess chemicals with potential unreasonable risks, while S. 697 and S. 725 differ in prioritization factors. Both Senate bills aim to establish a process for evaluating existing chemical substances. The bills aim to establish a process for evaluating existing chemical substances by prioritizing them based on various factors, conducting risk-based safety evaluations, and taking regulatory action. They also address the prioritization of persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic substances. Under S. 697 and S. 725, EPA would prioritize substances for evaluation upon payment of a fee, with varying deadlines for evaluation and regulatory actions. H.R. 2576 would require EPA to evaluate risks for substances requested by manufacturers who have paid evaluation costs. EPA would make efforts to designate all active substances under S. 697. EPA must designate at least 25 chemicals as high priority and start safety assessments within five years of S. 697 enactment. Safety assessments must be completed within three years of designation, with a rule issued within two years of a negative safety determination. The procedures for prioritization and safety assessment in S. 725 are similar to those in S. 697. H.R. 2576 sets tighter deadlines for risk evaluations compared to S. 725 and S. 697. It requires EPA to initiate at least 10 risk evaluations per year and does not limit manufacturer requests, as long as they pay for the evaluation. H.R. 2576 sets deadlines for risk evaluations and allows unlimited manufacturer requests if they pay for the evaluation. S. 697 and S. 725 propose amending TSCA Section 5 for EPA to review new chemical substances and uses, while H.R. 2576 maintains the current process for EPA to evaluate risks based on when a notice is submitted. EPA would be required to determine if regulatory action is needed for new chemicals under the Senate bills. The Senate bills would require the EPA to review new chemicals within 90 days to determine if they meet safety standards. Once a new chemical is added to the TSCA Inventory, it would undergo the same safety assessment procedures as existing chemicals. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) sets a standard for regulating chemical substances based on the risk of harm to human health or the environment. This criteria is used to determine regulatory actions for new and existing chemicals under Sections 5 and 6 of TSCA. There are concerns about the difficulty of proving that a chemical poses unreasonable risks, leading to debates on amending the regulations. The TSCA debate focuses on amending the regulatory threshold for determining if substances warrant control. The \"unreasonable risk\" standard in TSCA is interpreted as a multi-factor balancing test, as seen in the Corrosion Proof Fittings v. EPA case. The Fifth Circuit ruled that the EPA's asbestos ban did not consider costs adequately, stating that the agency must balance costs and benefits in a reasonable manner. The Fifth Circuit ruled that the EPA's asbestos ban did not consider costs adequately, stating that the agency must balance costs and benefits in a reasonable manner. S. 697 would establish a statutory definition for the term \"safety standard\" that uses the regulatory threshold of \"unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment\" in current TSCA and adds some qualifiers. S. 697 would set a regulatory threshold based on the \"conditions of use\" of a chemical substance to meet a safety standard. It would also include \"potentially exposed or susceptible populations\" in risk evaluations and prohibit the consideration of \"cost and other nonrisk factors.\" S. 725, similar to S. 697, defines a safety standard without considering cost or other factors. H.R. 2576 does not define a safety standard but retains the regulatory threshold based on \"unreasonable risk\" in current TSCA, adding requirements for EPA's evaluations. H.R. 2576 retains the regulatory threshold based on \"unreasonable risk\" in current TSCA but adds requirements for EPA's risk evaluation process, including assessing risks to potentially exposed populations and prohibiting consideration of costs or non-risk factors in decision-making. Title I of TSCA emphasizes the need to balance costs and benefits when determining the risk of a chemical substance. If EPA identifies an \"unreasonable risk\" to health or the environment, Section 6 directs the agency to implement the least burdensome requirement to mitigate the risk, considering factors like cost and availability of alternatives. EPA's regulatory options range from a complete ban to notification requirements for manufacturers. Some argue that EPA's requirement to choose the least burdensome regulatory option for mitigating unreasonable risks may lead to lengthy analyses. In a court case, it was found that EPA's total ban on asbestos uses may not always be the least burdensome adequate alternative. This additional standard goes beyond just conducting a cost-benefit analysis. The Fifth Circuit required EPA to show that each less burdensome requirement would not adequately protect against unreasonable risk when choosing a regulatory option for restricting a chemical substance. S. 697, S. 725, and H.R. 2576 aim to eliminate the least burdensome regulatory option requirement and instead direct EPA to choose a regulatory option that is \"necessary\" for ensuring safety. H.R. 2576 would amend factors for EPA to consider in promulgating restrictions on chemical substances, requiring rules to be \"cost-effective\" unless impractical to protect against identified risks. EPA would need to ensure adequate protection for potentially exposed subpopulations. The bills authorize EPA to exempt certain chemical uses if restrictions would harm national security, disrupt the economy, or have no feasible alternative. EPA can grant \"critical use exemptions\" if a requirement is not cost-effective for specific uses. The EPA can grant \"critical use exemptions\" if a requirement is not cost-effective and would disrupt the national economy, security, or critical infrastructure. Exemptions are initially valid for five years and can be renewed if the criteria are still met. EPA relies on scientific information to assess risks related to chemical substances. Section 8 of TSCA allows EPA to require reporting and record-keeping on chemical substances to evaluate risks. Section 4 mandates testing if risks are unknown, based on threshold findings of unreasonable risks. The EPA can require additional testing for chemical substances if they may present unreasonable risks or if substantial quantities are produced in a way that may enter the environment or lead to significant human exposures. Some argue that limits on EPA's authority under TSCA have hindered its ability to assess chemical risks. The EPA can require additional testing for chemical substances that may pose risks to health or the environment. However, the process of developing new information to determine these risks can be time-consuming and costly. Proposed legislation would give the EPA discretion in requiring such testing. The proposed legislation, including S. 697, S. 725, and H.R. 2576, would give the EPA discretion to require testing for chemical substances if deemed necessary for specific purposes. EPA could also require testing if it is necessary for conducting a risk evaluation. All three bills authorize EPA to develop new information through rules, orders, or testing consent agreements. The proposed legislation aims to amend procedures for developing new information, emphasizing minimizing animal testing. TSCA preemption in the context of state chemical regulations is a long-standing issue, with Congress having the power to preempt state actions to varying degrees. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) gives EPA a primary role in managing chemicals while allowing states some ability to set their own requirements. States are generally preempted from managing risk if EPA has taken similar action, but exceptions exist for non-duplicative requirements. States can co-enforce federal requirements by adopting them. In the context of TSCA amendments, advocates argue that federal preemption can establish a uniform national regulatory framework for chemicals, preventing conflicting state regulations and reducing compliance costs. States can still enforce federal requirements and regulate disposal, establish chemical requirements, and restrict chemical use within their borders. S. 697 proposes changes to TSCA preemption and the state-federal relationship in chemical management, allowing states to implement more stringent regulations to protect citizens. S. 697 would modify EPA actions triggering preemption of states' chemical-specific requirements, the scope of state laws preempted or excepted, and waiver provisions. States would be prohibited from restricting chemicals EPA found safe or restricted, and from establishing new restrictions on chemicals. S. 697 would prohibit states from establishing new restrictions on chemical substances listed by EPA as high priority for safety assessment if they fall within EPA's planned safety assessment scope. Preemption of state restrictions would depend on EPA's safety assessment outcome. S. 697 would retain preemption exceptions under current TSCA, except for states prohibiting chemical use. It would refine exceptions for states enforcing identical requirements and add new exceptions for states to establish or enforce certain requirements under state environmental laws. S. 697 would add savings clauses to clarify that state actions under existing laws would not be preempted. States could apply for waivers based on scientific concerns about a chemical, which EPA would have to grant if requirements are met. H.R. 2576 would make smaller changes to TSCA preemption compared to S. 725 and S. 697. It would allow states to impose different regulations on chemicals if EPA has not taken any action. H.R. 2576 would maintain TSCA's preemption of state laws regarding chemicals, aligning preemption with EPA's risk evaluation process under amended Section 6. State prohibitions on chemical use would not be exempt from preemption. H.R. 2576 aligns TSCA's preemption of state laws with EPA's risk evaluation process, including penalties for enforcing state requirements identical to EPA's. It also includes savings clauses for common law causes of action. TSCA requires chemical manufacturers to submit information to EPA, balancing public access with protection of competitive information. Section 14 prohibits disclosure of exempt information under FOIA. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) protects information obtained by EPA as \"trade secrets and commercial or financial information\" exempt from disclosure under FOIA. Wrongful disclosure is a criminal act. CBI protection does not prevent disclosure of health and safety studies but safeguards manufacturing processes and proprietary compositions. EPA has safeguarded chemical identities and other information as CBI on the TSCA Inventory. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) protects information as CBI on the TSCA Inventory, with exceptions for disclosure if necessary to protect health or the environment. EPA must notify the submitter before disclosing CBI information. Since 2010, EPA has increased its review of confidentiality claims, especially regarding chemical identities in health and safety studies. The agency has initiated a \"CBI Declassification Challenge\" for industry to voluntarily withdraw CBI claims and has taken other steps to enhance public access to non-confidential information. The three proposed bills aim to increase public access to non-confidential information under TSCA by requiring or authorizing EPA to disclose CBI in additional circumstances. The Senate bills would make more extensive revisions and additions to Section 14 of TSCA than H.R. 2576. The bills propose revisions to TSCA, with detailed procedural requirements for information submitters and more review requirements for EPA. They outline categories of protected information, including chemical identity before commercial distribution. H.R. 2576 would protect chemical identities in health and safety studies. The bills propose revisions to TSCA, requiring submitters to substantiate confidentiality claims every 10 years. H.R. 2576 limits substantiation to claims made after enactment and mandates EPA to notify submitters before claim expiration. EPA's evaluation of chemical risks under TSCA depends on available resources, raising the issue of funding sources. The EPA's implementation of TSCA is funded through annual appropriations and fees assessed on chemical manufacturers, importers, or processors. The authorization for funding under TSCA does not have a sunset date, ensuring continued financial support for the program. EPA's authority to collect fees under TSCA is limited to a maximum of $2,500 for certain actions required by the statute, with an exception for small businesses capped at $100. Fees can be assessed for evaluating testing data on chemical substances. Under TSCA, fees collected for testing data are treated as miscellaneous receipts and deposited into the U.S. Treasury. The availability of these fees for EPA use is subject to annual appropriations. Proposed bills would repeal the expired authorization of appropriations under TSCA Section 29, with differences in how they address fee collection under Section 26(b). S. 697 would revise the authority to collect fees under Section 26(b) of TSCA, directing EPA to set fees to partially cover costs of activities, with a cap at $18 million. The bill S. 697 would cap the total amount collected at $18 million, with fees deposited in a dedicated fund for evaluating submissions of information to the EPA. H.R. 2576 would authorize EPA to collect fees from manufacturers for risk evaluations of chemical substances, eliminating the current statutory limit. The bill would eliminate the current statutory limit for EPA fees per notice submission, allowing the agency to collect fees sufficient to cover costs. Receipts would be deposited into a dedicated fund, with fees available to EPA without fiscal year limitation. S. 725 also authorizes EPA to collect fees from chemical manufacturers for various purposes. S. 725 would eliminate the current statutory limit on EPA fees per notice submission, ensuring fees are sufficient for agency responsibilities. Fees collected would be deposited into the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury, available subject to discretionary appropriations. The cost estimates for S. 697 and H.R. 2576 have been published in S.Rept. 114-67 and H.Rept. 114-176, respectively."
