    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Montana Mineral Conveyance Act\" and includes findings. Congress finds that the Secretary of the Interior has conveyed mineral rights in large coal tracts near the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation, leading to significant public revenues from energy developments in the surrounding areas. The Northern Cheyenne Tribe does not benefit from the substantial public revenues generated by energy development near their reservation, leading to economic hardships and deficits in public services. The tribe lacks revenue sources to address the impacts of development. In 2002, the Northern Cheyenne Tribe sued the Secretary over proposed conveyances of Federal coal tracts to the State, citing violations of Federal laws and the trust responsibility to the Tribe. The suit was later withdrawn with prejudice. The Northern Cheyenne Tribe withdrew a lawsuit with prejudice in 2002 over proposed conveyances of Federal coal tracts to the State. The Tribe retains claims against the United States for failing to acquire mineral rights on Reservation land. The Northern Cheyenne Tribe will waive legal claims against the United States for the loss of mineral rights on Reservation land if mineral rights conveyances are carried out under this Act. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Cheyenne tracts\" refers to a 5,000-acre land located in the eastern portion of the State within the boundaries of the Reservation, as depicted on a map dated April 7, 2010. The Cheyenne tracts consist of various sections of land in T. 3 S., R. 44 E., with different lot configurations in each section. The Federal tracts are unleased land outside the Reservation, totaling 5,000 acres in T. 3 S., R. 44 E., sec. 26 and sec. 34. The Federal tracts in T. 3 S., R. 44 E., sec. 34 are part of the unleased land outside the Reservation. The term \"Great Northern Properties\" refers to a Delaware limited partnership and any successor to its ownership interest in coal or iron under the Cheyenne tracts. The term \"Reservation\" refers to the Northern Cheyenne Reservation. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior, and the term \"State\" refers to the State of Montana. The term \"State\" refers to the State of Montana, and the term \"Tribe\" refers to the Northern Cheyenne Tribe. SEC. 4. MINERAL RIGHTS CONVEYANCES. Great Northern Properties will convey mineral interests to the Tribe, and in return, the Secretary will convey coal rights to Great Northern Properties. The mineral interests conveyed to the Tribe will be immune from state taxation. SEC. 5. TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF MINERAL CONVEYANCES. (a) In exchange for mineral conveyances, the Tribe must waive any claims related to the United States' failure to acquire private mineral interests on the Reservation. \n(b) The Tribe and Great Northern Properties must agree on a revenue-sharing formula for coal produced from Federal tracts as a condition for mineral conveyances. \n(c) Mineral conveyances must be completed regardless of any other factors. After meeting the conditions in subsection (b), mineral conveyances under section 4(a) must be completed within 90 days. If any conveyances are invalidated by a Federal district court, they may be rescinded. If a Federal district court judgment is not overturned on appeal, the Secretary or Great Northern Properties can rescind all mineral conveyances under section 4(a), leading to the Tribe's waiver being considered rescinded. SEC. 6. ELIGIBILITY FOR OTHER FEDERAL BENEFITS.\n\nNo benefits provided to the Tribe under this Act shall affect their eligibility for any Federal services or programs due to their status as a federally recognized Indian tribe or as members of the Tribe.\n\nSEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\nAppropriations are authorized as necessary to carry out this Act."
