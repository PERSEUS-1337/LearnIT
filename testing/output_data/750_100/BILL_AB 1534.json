    "content": "The people of California enact the following. The Legislature declares that county assessors must follow complex state laws to ensure consistent and accurate assessment practices statewide, with decisions on property exemptions and ownership changes made by certified staff to protect taxpayers' interests. The Legislature mandates efficient implementation of education and certification requirements for county assessors, utilizing existing resources. Contracts for appraisal work must be competitively bid and based on fixed fees or hourly rates with a maximum amount. A contractor must maintain confidentiality of assessee information as required by specific sections of the law. Requests for information from an assessee must be made by the assessor, who may authorize the contractor to request additional information with written permission. A contractor must not share appraisal data with assessors from other counties. They must return and purge any confidential information obtained from an assessee within 90 days of contract conclusion. Article 8.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code requires contractors performing appraisal work for assessors to provide a written declaration of compliance. Contracts must include provisions outlined by the State Board of Equalization, and contractors are defined as non-employee individuals. Assessment analysts must hold a valid certificate issued by the board to make decisions on changes in ownership or property tax exemptions, excluding homeowners' exemption claims. The board administers examinations for assessment analyst certification, in collaboration with the Department of Human Resources. Exams are prepared by the board with input from a committee of assessors. A passing grade is required for certification, demonstrating competency in making ownership change or exemption decisions as defined by board regulations. Any applicant denied a certificate has the right to a review in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act. The board does not charge for examinations or training. Certified assessment analysts must complete 24 hours of board-approved training annually to maintain their certificate. Certified assessment analysts must complete 24 hours of board-approved training annually. Any excess training time can be carried over for up to three years. Failure to complete training may result in certificate revocation. Training covers new developments in case law, statutory law, and administrative rules. The board issues an advanced assessment analyst certificate to applicants with at least three years of experience who have completed an advanced course of study or passed an advanced level examination. The board prescribes the course of study and prepares the examination with the advice of five assessors selected by the California Assessors\u2019 Association. To maintain an advanced assessment analyst certificate, holders must complete 12 hours of training annually. Any excess training hours can be carried over for up to two years. To maintain an advanced assessment analyst certificate, holders must complete annual training including updates on case law, statutory law, and administrative rules. Failure to complete training may result in certificate revocation, with proceedings conducted according to the Administrative Procedure Act. Applicants must disclose financial interests in legal entities at the time of certification and annually thereafter. Applicants required to file annually with the Fair Political Practices Commission can use a duplicate of that filing to meet the requirements for maintaining an advanced assessment analyst certificate. The board may issue a temporary certificate to newly elected or appointed assessors or newly employed individuals in the county assessor's office for up to one year to allow them to take an examination. Temporary certificates will not be renewed. The board may issue an interim certificate to current assessors or employees of the county assessor's office to allow them to apply for an examination. The interim certificate cannot exceed four years unless the person is elected or appointed as assessor, and it cannot be renewed. This article allows assessors to efficiently manage staff resources for noncertificated staff to assist with exemption applications and change in ownership documents, as long as they do not make decisions on exemptions or ownership changes. It applies only in counties that have passed a resolution requiring certification."
