    "content": "The report highlights DOD's alternative fuel initiatives, including testing, evaluation, and certification of alternative fuels for service fleets. The Navy aims to promote domestic advanced biofuel production with the Defense Production Act. Approximately $48 million has been spent by the Army, Navy, and Air Force on these efforts. The Defense Production Act has led to significant investments in alternative fuels by the Army, Navy, and Air Force, totaling $48 million. The Navy is proposing a $170 million investment in biofuel production capacity. DOD's purchases of petroleum fuels in FY2011 were approximately $17.3 billion. The report provides an overview of DOD's alternative fuels policy, purchases, testing platforms, and certification for fleet-wide use. The report discusses the Navy's biofuel production initiative under the Defense Production Act, funding, and legislative actions related to alternative fuels efforts. It also mentions previous defense-related fuel programs and the statutory authority of the DPA for energy initiatives. The Defense Production Act authorized the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Operational Energy Plans and Programs to oversee the Department of Defense's alternative fuels initiatives. This responsibility was established in Section 314 of the FY2012 National Defense Authorization Act. The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Operational Plans and Programs leads DOD's alternative fuel activities, oversees investments, makes recommendations for fuel development, issues guidelines, and encourages collaboration with other federal agencies. Sharon Burke issued a memorandum outlining DOD's goals on July 5, 2012. Energy Plans and Programs Sharon Burke issued a memorandum outlining the DOD's goals for alternative fuels policy, focusing on operational military readiness, battlespace effectiveness, and the ability to use multiple fuel sources. DOD investments aim to increase resilience against supply disruptions, mitigate petroleum price volatility, provide more fuel options for commanders, and enhance expeditionary effectiveness. Alternative fuels for DOD use must be \"drop-in,\" requiring no engine modifications. The DOD's goals for alternative fuels policy focus on operational military readiness, battlespace effectiveness, and the ability to use multiple fuel sources. Alternative fuels for DOD use must be \"drop-in,\" cost-competitive, and available in sufficient quantities. Investments in alternative fuel activities must be certified as part of the annual operational energy budget certification process. The DOD's alternative fuels policy aims to ensure operational readiness and battlespace effectiveness. The annual operational energy report now includes alternative fuels initiatives with funding details. Future investments in alternative fuels will undergo a rigorous evaluation process. The DOD's alternative fuels development follows three phases: Certification, Field Demonstration, and Implementation. Field Demonstration: Proposals for new fuel field demonstrations will be reviewed by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Operational Energy Plans and Programs or jointly by other defense offices. Alternative fuels will compete with petroleum products for operational purchases based on meeting requirements at best value to the government. The Army aims to increase the use of renewable/alternative energy, with goals set in the Army Energy Security Implementation Strategy. By 2028, they aim to have at least 25% of energy for tactical power generation and 50% of fuel in the training base derived from alternative and renewable sources. The Air Force aims to acquire 50% of its domestic aviation fuel requirements from alternative fuel blends by 2016. They also plan to test and certify all aircraft on a 50:50 alternative fuel blend by 2012 to be prepared for cost-competitive alternatives. The Navy aims to deploy a \"Great Green Fleet\" strike group of ships and aircraft running on alternative fuel blends by 2016. They also plan to meet 50% of their total energy consumption from alternative sources by 2020. The Navy aims to meet 50% of its total energy consumption from alternative sources by 2020, with a goal to reduce liquid fuel usage afloat to 38 million barrels of oil equivalent per year. Nuclear power is expected to provide 11 million barrels of oil equivalent in 2020, leaving approximately 8 million barrels of petroleum to be replaced by unblended alternative fuels. DLA Energy has procured around 1.9 million gallons of alternative fuels for the Army, Navy, and Air Force since 2007. The Department of Defense (DOD) has purchased alternative fuels for the Army, Navy, and Air Force totaling about $48 million to test engine performance and certify them for use in service fleets. Various types of alternative fuels, including Fischer-Tropsch fuels and biofuels, have been purchased by the services. The Air Force has also bought hydrotreated jet and diesel biofuels. The DOD purchased various types of alternative fuels for the Army, Navy, and Air Force, including hydrotreated jet and diesel biofuels, alcohol-to-jet fuels, direct-sugar-to-hydrocarbons fuel, and fuels from the Fischer-Tropsch process. The purchases are in compliance with Section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The DOD's alternative fuel purchases for the Army, Navy, and Air Force comply with Section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The provision excludes coal-to-liquid fuels due to higher greenhouse gas emissions. DOD's position is that EISA section 526 does not apply to fuel purchases where the source is unspecified in the contract. The Army, Navy, and Air Force are testing alternative fuel blends for fleet-wide use. The Army is testing 50:50 blends of synthetic kerosene and renewable jet with JP-8 for ground systems and generators. They aim to certify these fuels by 2014 and obtain Air Force certification for H-60 Black Hawk helicopters. The Army, Navy, and Air Force are testing alternative fuel blends for fleet-wide use. The Air Force has certified Fischer-Tropsch fuel blends for its manned and unmanned fleets, completed testing on biofuels like HEFA fuels, and started testing alcohol-to-jet fuels with an A-10 Thunderbolt II jet flight. The Air Force has tested alcohol-to-jet fuels, including the inaugural flight of an A-10 Thunderbolt II jet on an ATJ-conventional fuel blend in June 2012. The Navy has also tested HEFA 50:50 biofuel blends for aircraft and ships, with certification expected in early 2013. The Navy is expected to certify all HEFA fuels by early 2013 and Fischer-Tropsch fuels by the end of 2013. Testing of other alternative fuels like alcohol-to-jet, pyrolysis oils, and direct sugar to hydrocarbon will continue. In June 2011, the Navy, Energy, and Agriculture signed an MOU to support the development of a sustainable biofuels industry. The MOU signed by the Navy, Energy, and Agriculture aims to support advanced drop-in biofuel plants and refineries to produce biofuels meeting military specifications, being price competitive with petroleum, and having no significant impact on the food supply. The initiative will be funded with $340 million in federal funds for capital investment and production. The Department of Agriculture will provide an additional $171 million through the Commodity Credit Corporation to support biofuel feedstocks. Total government funding for this project is anticipated at $510 million over a period of three years, with $170 million each from the Navy, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Agriculture. The Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA-12-15-PKM) for a biofuels production initiative was released on June 27, 2012, with a government funding amount of $210 million. Awards for biofuels production facilities will be given in two phases: Phase 1 includes five awards of up to $6 million each for planning and preliminary designs, expected to be announced in March 2013. Phase 2 will have up to three awards of up to $70 million each for construction, commissioning, and performance testing. Successful proposals require at least a 50% cost share for both phases. Requirements for a successful proposal include 50% cost share for both Phase 1 and Phase 2; domestic production of advanced biofuels with domestic feedstocks; compliance with Section 526 of the Energy Security and Independence Act of 2007; use of acceptable renewable feedstock; production of drop-in fuel; cost-competitiveness with petroleum-based fuels; and a production capacity of at least 10 million gallons a year. FOA funding level is $210 million, with $100 million from DOD and $70 million for Navy's drop-in fuel. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act includes $70 million for the Navy's drop-in biofuels production initiative as part of the $89 million request for the DPA fund in the DOD's FY2013 budget. Additionally, $40 million from DOE is allocated to support the MOU between the Navy, DOE, and USDA. This funding does not include $171 million of USDA funding via the Commodity Credit Corporation for bio-based jet fuel production. The Commodity Credit Corporation has the authority to borrow up to $30 billion for agricultural commodities without specific congressional appropriations. Legislative activity in 2012 focused on DOD's alternative fuels efforts, including proposals to expand or limit DOD's ability to purchase alternative fuels and appropriations for the Navy's biofuel production efforts under the DPA. The House passed H.R. 4310 with provisions exempting DOD from EISA Section 526 and limiting purchases of expensive alternative fuels. The Senate's S. 3254 did not include restrictions on DOD's ability to purchase alternative fuels or invest in biofuels production. The Senate removed restrictive provisions on biofuels production from the FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act. Amounts for biofuels production under the Defense Production Act cannot be used for refinery construction without matching contributions. The Department of Defense requires matching contributions from the Department of Energy and Department of Agriculture for a biofuels production initiative. The Navy, Department of Energy, and Department of Agriculture are seeking appropriations for a joint biofuels production project under the Defense Production Act. Funding would come from appropriated funds, including from the Commodity Credit Corporation. The Navy requested $70 million for advanced drop-in biofuels production in FY2013, part of the total $89 million requested for the Defense Production Act Fund. The House Appropriations Committee declined to fund the $70 million request, but approved $63.5 million in DPA funding. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends funding the overall DPA Fund. The Senate Appropriations Committee report recommends funding the Defense Production Act Fund at $100 million over the budget request, totaling $189 million. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act allocates $223,531,000 for the Fund, an increase of $134.3 million. Both the House and Senate explanatory statements reduced the funding. The House and Senate reduced funding for advanced drop-in biofuels by $10 million, allocating $60 million. $20 million was included for research on lowering coal emissions in the Air Force. The conferees did not include a provision from the House on the Energy Independence and Security Act, but provided $20 million for Air Force research. The conferees allocated $20 million for research in the Air Force to improve emissions of coal to liquid fuel, aiming to make it a competitive alternative energy resource. The Secretary of the Air Force must notify congressional defense committees before using these funds. The House-passed FY2013 Energy and Water Development Act does not allow the Department of Energy to transfer funds to the Defense Production Act Fund, while the Senate version permits up to $100 million transfer. In the Department of Energy funding under H.R. 933 / P.L. 113-6, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy received approximately $1.8 billion. Congress faces oversight questions regarding DOD and services' alternative fuels initiatives and their benefits over conventional petroleum fuels. The funding under H.R. 933 / P.L. 113-6 allocated approximately $1.8 billion to Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. Congress is questioning the benefits of DOD and services' alternative fuels initiatives over conventional petroleum fuels, including coordination efforts and potential impacts on the domestic advanced biofuel industry. The DOD's efforts to jumpstart a domestic advanced biofuels industry are being led by the Navy. Questions arise about the coordination of alternative fuel goals among military services and the oversight of investments in alternative fuels testing and certification by the ASD(OEPP). The effectiveness of ASD(OEPP)'s coordination activities and alternative fuels guidance on military initiatives is also being evaluated. The military services are evaluating how DOD's alternative fuel goals and policies have impacted their initiatives. They are also looking into potential overlap with other federal agencies and the coordination process for alternative fuel and energy initiatives. The FY2012 Department of Defense Appropriations Act included $150 million for DPA Title III funding, with support for DOD biofuels initiatives and longer contract terms for biofuels procurement. The House Appropriations Committee report in 2011 highlighted the Department of Defense's lack of long-term contracting ability for biofuels production. They suggested funding multi-year contracts with purchase periods up to 15 years to maximize efficiencies and secure the best purchase price. The conferees support the Department of Defense's investment in biofuels and alternative energy, aiming to benefit the armed forces and the nation. They encourage pursuing extended multi-year contracts for biofuel products to maximize efficiencies and secure the best purchase price. The Department of Energy requested authority to transfer funds to the DPA Fund to support MOU with technical expertise for pilot-scale demonstration projects. The House-passed Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act did not authorize this transfer, as stated in the House Appropriations Committee report. The Committee recommends $203,000,000 for Biomass and Biorefinery Systems R&D, directing the Department of Energy to focus on research and development activities for producing fuels and electricity from biomass and non-food crops. The budget request includes funding for a joint initiative with the Navy and Department of Agriculture to develop biofuels production capacity for defense purposes. The Department of Energy is directed to focus on research and development for producing fuels from biomass and non-food crops. The recommendation does not support funding for a Defense initiative to develop biofuels production capacity, questioning the justification for federal support. The Agencies Appropriations Act (S. 2465) allows the Secretary to transfer funds for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy to the Defense Production Act Fund. The accompanying report (S.Rept. 112-164) supports a joint biofuel production initiative by the DOD, DOE, and USDA. The Committee supports collaboration between the Navy, Department of Agriculture, and DOE to develop biofuels for military use. The Department of Defense's early adoption of alternative fuels will encourage wider market acceptance. H.R. 4310 includes provisions affecting DOD's procurement and production of biofuels. The Department of Defense is exempt from alternative fuel procurement requirements and there is a limitation on funds for the procurement of alternative fuel in fiscal year 2013. The Department of Defense is exempt from alternative fuel procurement requirements in fiscal year 2013. The Secretary of Defense may purchase limited quantities of alternative fuels for fleet certification, using competitive procedures to ensure the best purchase price. S. 3254 passed by the Senate on December 4, 2012, does not restrict the Department's ability to purchase alternative fuels. S. 3254 passed by the Senate on December 4, 2012, does not restrict the Department of Defense's ability to procure or produce biofuels. Two provisions in S. 3254 that would have affected biofuel procurement were removed via floor amendments, including Section 313. The Senate passed S. 3254 on December 4, 2012, without restrictions on the Department of Defense's ability to procure biofuels. An amendment sponsored by Senator Hagan removed Section 313, which would have limited the Department of Defense's purchase of alternative fuels exceeding the cost of traditional fossil fuels. Another amendment, passed 54-41, removed Section 2823, which would have prohibited the Department of Defense from entering into contracts for biofuels refinery projects. The Senate Armed Services Committee adopted amendments sponsored by Senator Inhofe and Senator McCain, respectively, to restrict the Department of Defense from entering into contracts for biofuels refinery projects without specific authorization by law. Another amendment by Senator Inhofe, which would have exempted the Department of Defense from certain restrictions on purchasing alternative fuels, failed in a tie vote. The Senate Armed Services Committee adopted amendments to restrict the Department of Defense from purchasing alternative fuels with high greenhouse gas emissions. This was similar to a previous amendment in H.R. 4310 and included in S. 3254. During fiscal year 2013, the Department of Defense is prohibited from using funds for alternative fuels if their cost exceeds that of traditional fossil fuels. However, the Secretary of Defense can purchase limited quantities of alternative fuels for engine or fleet certification for 50/50 blends using authorized research funds and competitive procedures. The Department of Defense is prohibited from funding biofuel refinery construction without specific authorization by law. Additionally, there are limitations on the procurement of alternative fuels to ensure the best purchase price. The committee recommends prohibiting the use of funds for alternative fuel procurement if the cost exceeds traditional fossil fuels, except for testing purposes. The Department of the Navy made the largest biofuel purchase in government history for $12.0 million. The Navy made the single largest purchase of biofuel in government history to demonstrate the capability of a Carrier Strike Group to burn alternative fuels. Despite using operation and maintenance funds, the purchase is considered a research initiative. The Vice Chief of Naval Operations testified about the impact of increased fuel prices on readiness accounts. The committee supports DoD initiatives to reduce fuel demand through new technologies but is concerned about using operation and maintenance funds for higher biofuel costs in RDTE efforts due to increased fuel prices impacting readiness accounts. The committee directs the Secretary of Defense to develop guidance on the difference between operational use of alternative fuels and RDTE initiatives. H.R. 4310 / P.L. 113-6 Section 315 limits Department of Defense funds for biofuel refinery construction. The Defense Production Act of 1950 restricts funds for biofuels production in fiscal year 2013 until matching contributions are received from the Department of Energy and Department of Agriculture. The Defense Production Act of 1950 restricts funds for biofuels production in fiscal year 2013 until matching contributions are received from the Department of Energy and Department of Agriculture. The request for Defense Production Act purchases includes $70,000,000 for the construction or retrofit of domestic advanced drop-in biofuel plants and refineries. The Committee questions the allocation of $100,000,000 for this effort, considering the budget constraints and the delayed execution of funds. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends no funding for the Defense Production Act (DPA) fund in fiscal year 2013 due to budget constraints. They urge the Secretary of Defense to request funding in future years when it can be executed in a timely manner. Additionally, the Committee provides an additional $100 million for the DPA fund in the FY2013 budget request. The Committee increases funding for the Defense Production Act (DPA) by $100,000,000 over the budget request, with priority given to new initiatives and completion of previous projects. The Under Secretary of Defense must notify congressional defense committees 30 days before using these funds. The Department of Defense appropriations in the H.R. 933 / P.L. 113-6 Act include $223.5 million for the Defense Production Act Fund, with an increase of $134.3 million. Funding for advanced drop-in biofuels was reduced by $10 million to $60 million. Additionally, $20 million was allocated for research on reducing coal emissions. The Department of Defense appropriations in P.L. 113-6 allocated $20 million for research on reducing coal emissions in the Air Force, aiming to improve coal to liquid fuel technology for energy security. The Department of Energy's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy received approximately $1.8 billion in funding under the Department of Defense, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013. The Secretary of the Air Force, in consultation with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Operational Energy Plans and Programs, must inform congressional defense committees 30 days before using these funds."
