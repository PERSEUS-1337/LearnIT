    "content": "The Bush tax cuts, enacted in 2001 and 2003, were set to expire in 2010. This included lower rates for long-term capital gains and dividends. Without action, rates would have reverted to pre-2003 levels. President Obama proposed retaining lower rates for lower- and middle-income taxpayers. The tax rates for dividends and capital gains were extended through 2012 for lower- and middle-income taxpayers, but increased to 20% for higher-income individuals. In 2013, the rates were set at $480,050 for married couples and $453,350 for singles, higher than proposed by President Obama. In 2018, capital gains taxes for singles were considerably higher than proposed by President Obama. The potential revenue gain from increasing capital gains taxes is influenced by behavioral responses assumed by the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Department of the Treasury. The Obama Administration estimated that allowing the Bush tax cuts for capital gains to expire would have raised $16 billion in FY2019. The current effective capital gains tax was 13.3% in 2008 and would have increased to 17.9% in 2019 according to Congressional Budget Office projections. The differential in capital gains tax rates would have produced a revenue difference of $40 billion in 2019. Proposed solutions include applying mark-to-market rules to tax capital gains as accrued to eliminate the realization response for affected assets. The proposed solutions for addressing the differential in capital gains tax rates include applying mark-to-market rules to tax capital gains as accrued, which could eliminate the realization response for affected assets. This approach may increase taxes to achieve the same after-tax earnings as if the tax were imposed on an accrual basis, but it comes with complexities and limitations in behavioral assumptions. The empirical basis for estimated effects on revenue projections by revenue-estimating agencies (JCT and Treasury) was publicly discussed in the late 1980s. The late 1980s saw a contentious debate on responses affecting revenues, particularly on capital gains tax rates. Concerns were raised about potential revenue losses due to reduced realizations. The analysis suggests that current projections may underestimate revenue gains if lower capital gains tax rates expire. The potential revenue from capital gains taxes can be affected by tax increases, as they may lead to reduced realizations. There is an incentive to delay selling assets to avoid taxes, and responses are typically measured by elasticities. The elasticity of realizations in response to changes in tax rates determines the revenue gain or loss from capital gains tax adjustments. A higher elasticity value indicates a smaller revenue impact. If elasticity is less than one, a tax increase generates revenue; if greater than one, it results in revenue loss. The ratio of revenue gain projected to static gain is one minus the elasticity for small tax rate increases. The elasticity of realizations in response to tax rate changes determines the revenue impact from capital gains tax adjustments. Different types of elasticities are relevant, including permanent, short-run, and transitory elasticities, which measure realizations response to tax rate changes over different time frames. The transitory elasticity measures the response to temporary tax changes, such as shifting realizations to take advantage of lower tax rates. This discussion focuses on permanent elasticities, while short-term and transitory effects also play a role in tax adjustments. The short-term realizations elasticity is often discussed in the context of a capital gains tax cut, with the idea that taxpayers may realize more gains in the first year or two due to lower tax rates. However, this response may be muted if there has been recent increases in realizations. The short-term response to a tax cut may be limited if there has been a recent surge in realizations, as seen in the late 1980s due to pre-announced changes in capital gains taxes. There is no guarantee of a significant short-term reaction to a tax increase that is not pre-announced. The short-term response to a tax cut may be limited if there has been a recent surge in realizations, as seen in the late 1980s due to pre-announced changes in capital gains taxes. A tax increase that is not pre-announced may not guarantee a significant short-term reaction. In 2012, there was a significant increase in capital gains due to fluctuations in income and taxes among higher-income taxpayers. Transitory responses can occur even when the law does not change, especially prior to 1987 when capital gains were subject to graduated rates. Statistical estimates show that the elasticity of gains in response to tax rate changes rises. The elasticity of capital gains is expected to rise proportionally with the tax rate. Elasticities should be reported with reference to the assumed tax rate, such as the 22% rate discussed in the 1990 debate. Capital gains realizations elasticities are expected to be negative, but in this report, they will be stated in absolute value. This formulation also helps determine the revenue-maximizing tax rate. The revenue-maximizing tax rate for capital gains is crucial for maximizing tax revenue. The current law includes tax rates of 0%, 15%, and 20%, with an additional 3.8% net investment income tax for high-income taxpayers. The overall marginal tax rate for long-term capital gains is estimated to be 21.2%. The Department of the Treasury estimates a marginal tax rate of 21.3% for long-term capital gains. In 1990, the George H. W. Bush Administration proposed to reduce the capital gains tax rate from 20% to 28%. In 1990, the Administration and the Joint Tax Committee (JTC) used different elasticities to estimate realizations response to tax rate changes for capital gains. Data from aggregate time series and micro-data studies were utilized for this analysis. Estimates of realizations response to tax rate changes for capital gains varied dramatically, ranging from 0.3 to almost 4. An elasticity of 0.3 would imply that a small increase in the tax rate would result in a 70% revenue gain. Estimates of realizations response to tax rate changes for capital gains varied from 0.3 to 4. An elasticity of 0.3 would result in a 70% revenue gain, while an elasticity of 4 would lead to a loss three times the projected revenue. Estimates based on aggregate time series ranged from 0.3 to 0.9, while individual taxpayer data estimates ranged from 0.55 to 3.8. The wide range of estimated responses raised concerns about the reliability of estimation methods, with the JCT favoring the time series results. The JCT favored time series results for estimating realizations response to tax rate changes for capital gains. The Treasury did not provide a specific methodology for their number, reporting it as a conservative choice. Researchers faced challenges in estimating the response, with individual data preferred over aggregation to avoid bias and loss of information. Distinguishing between permanent and transitory factors was a key issue when using individual data. The problem of distinguishing between permanent and transitory responses when using individual data for estimating tax rate changes for capital gains led to concerns about individuals timing realizations to coincide with low tax rates. Panel data following individuals over several years was suggested as a more reliable approach. Arguments were made against relying on larger elasticities from micro-data studies for revenue estimation. Panel data studies suggested using individual tax rates over several years to separate elasticities, reporting smaller but still significant results. The Treasury may have chosen a larger elasticity due to these panel results, influencing revenue estimation. The last panel study also showed a large elasticity, indicating that panel studies may not fully correct for transitory effects. Panel studies only cover a few years, so if individuals experience prolonged periods of higher or lower income, estimates may still reflect some transitory elements. Panel studies may reduce the transitory element in income estimates, but biases in time-series estimates remain uncertain. Proposed tax cuts were not enacted at that time, leading researchers to focus on producing more precise estimates for evaluating capital gains taxes. Between 1985 and 1986, realizations spiked from $170.6 billion to $324.4 billion, dropping to $144.2 billion in 1987. This increase, occurring alongside a tax increase, raised concerns about transitory responses in econometric studies. Between 1985 and 1986, realizations spiked from $170.6 billion to $324.4 billion, dropping to $144.2 billion in 1987. This increase, occurring alongside a tax increase, raised concerns about transitory responses in econometric studies. Eleven additional academic econometric studies of realizations response have been identified starting in 1990, with estimates provided by CBO, JCT, and Treasury in Table 1. CBO's realizations estimate is not for revenue estimation but part of a statistical study projecting capital gains realizations. Table 1 reports coefficients for elasticity calculation, with studies arranged by elasticity magnitude. The studies in Table 1 are arranged by elasticity, with Gravelle's study providing data on the ratio of realizations to accruals and tax rates. It noted a limit to realizations response, stating that realizations cannot exceed accruals in the long run. The study analyzed the ratio of realizations to accruals and tax rates over a long period, estimating an upper limit of the realizations elasticity at 0.5. This limit is lower than estimates from other studies and suggests that individuals would sell every asset every year in the absence of taxes and transaction costs. However, the actual elasticity is likely to be lower due to investors being satisfied with their investments. The study, conducted in 1991 and covering data from 1954 to 1989, estimated the realizations to accruals level at 46% and the tax rate at 18.4%. Recent evidence from 1989-2013 found a similar ratio of 48% and a tax rate of 17.3%, supporting the limits to realizations elasticities found in the initial study. Individuals with controlling shares in corporations or investments in family businesses are unlikely to sell their assets, indicating a lower actual elasticity due to investor satisfaction. The Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen panel study supports the limits to realizations elasticities found in the initial Gravelle study. It suggests that if all income and transactions taxes were eliminated, realizations could increase by 4.25 times their current value, while accruals indicate they could only double. The study also corrected the elasticity for the 1980s panel study, showing an elasticity of 3.2, similar to cross-section results. This highlights the challenge of addressing transitory issues in studies. The Burman and Randolph study, along with Auerbach and Siegel's replication, used state tax rates to estimate elasticities. They found a small permanent elasticity and a large transitory elasticity. These findings were consistent with previous studies on the limits to realizations elasticities. Most subsequent studies on tax elasticities incorporated state tax rates. The Auten and Joulfaian study and the Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen study had the highest elasticities among individual panel studies, likely due to adding state tax rates and having a longer panel. They continued the approach of using adjacent years to capture permanent tax effects. The Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen study used adjacent years to capture permanent tax rates, but this period may be too short, leading to estimates reflecting transitory responses. Their sensitivity analysis produced a wide range of estimates, with coefficients ranging from 1.8 to 8.0. The Gillingham and Greenlees study, along with other time series studies, added more years of data to analyze tax rate elasticity. Adding more years led to lower elasticities, but all results fell within the range of studies from the 1980s. The third time series study, based on Australian data, and two state studies by Bogart and Gentry and Bakija and Gentry, all showed results slightly above the upper limit estimated by Gravelle. Bakija and Gentry emphasized the importance of controlling for state fixed effects in their analysis. The elasticities in Table 1 are lower than those in studies from the 1980s. Both JCT and Treasury estimates appear high and likely understate the true effects. The JCT and Treasury estimates for raising the tax rate on capital gains by five percentage points in 2019 appear high and likely understate the potential revenue gains. The estimates are based on CBO's projections and adjusted down to reflect short-term gains taxed at ordinary rates. The revenue gain from a five-percentage-point tax rate increase on capital gains ranges from $31.4 billion to $1 billion per year, showing a potential range of $30.4 billion. Measures like accrual-based taxation with a look-back method could increase capital gains revenues without the realizations response. The Auten and Joulfaian panel study suggests that taxing unrealized gains could result in collecting $222 billion in a steady state, exceeding previous estimates. The Dowd, McClellan, and Muthitacharoen study produced varying elasticity estimates across subperiods, indicating fragility in the results. Eichner and Sinai's time series analysis, along with CBO's inclusion of more years, suggest an elasticity below 0.5. These findings imply that revenue-estimating assumptions from the 1990 debate may underestimate revenue. The 1990 debate's revenue-estimating assumptions may underestimate revenue gains from increasing the tax rate by five percentage points. Post-1980s econometric studies and the limits study suggest that revenue gains would be three times higher than projected by the JCT, with a potential increase of 45% using the upper limit. The JCT's projections may therefore be understating the revenue gains from increasing the capital gains tax. The appendix details the method of calculating taxes under the look-back method and modeling realizations and revenues based on a semi-log function. It discusses the elasticity of realizations with respect to taxes and how it can be estimated using different functional forms. The appendix explains the calculation of taxes using the look-back method and modeling realizations and revenues with a semi-log function. It discusses estimating the elasticity of realizations with respect to taxes using different functional forms, such as the relationship between gains, tax rate, and tax rate coefficient. The revenue equation is R = tAe -bt, with the revenue maximizing tax rate at 1/b. The look-back method adjusts basis to achieve the same net gain. The look-back method adjusts basis to decrease taxable gain and achieve the same net on a sale as if tax had been paid on an accrual basis. The formula for determining the growth rate is g = (S/B) (1/T) -1. The formula for finding the new basis B* is [B(1+ ((S/B) 1/T -1)(1-t)) T -S(1-t)]/t. The elasticities of realizations in the 1980s are reported in Table B-1, categorized based on the approach used in econometric studies. These studies relate capital gains realizations to tax rates and are discussed in more detail in subsequent subsections. Citations for all studies can be found in Appendix C. Statistical studies on capital gains realizations and tax rates face challenges, with debate over using aggregate time series or individual taxpayer data. Aggregate results range from 0.3 to 0.9, while individual data estimates vary from 0.55 to almost 4. The pooled time-series, cross-section regression estimate reflects a mix of results. It is more desirable to use individual data due to loss of information with aggregate data. Changes in transactions costs and asset prices could overstate estimates. It is unclear if time series estimates capture only permanent effects. The problems with using individual data sets were severe, leading many researchers to believe that aggregate time series results were more reliable. The effective capital gains tax rate, used as an exogenous variable in regressions, is actually endogenous and influenced by realizations. Various techniques could be used to address this econometric issue. Various techniques can be used to address the endogeneity of the explanatory variable in econometric problems, such as using different tax rate measures or instrumental variables methods. Individual cross-section data poses more severe endogeneity issues compared to aggregate time series data. Individual data poses challenges in distinguishing between permanent and transitory responses due to fluctuating income and tax rates over time. Attempts to address this issue with panel studies may not fully correct for the transitory effect. Since the 1980s, studies have been conducted to analyze the impact of fluctuating income and tax rates on individual responses. One study by Slemrod and Shobe in 1990 used a six-year small panel to replicate previous studies and found varying elasticities. The authors found large elasticities exceeding 1, with some cases exceeding 5. Their study confirmed issues with previous studies and highlighted problems with short panels. The elasticity for their full sample was 5.84, similar to findings from studies in the 1980s. Results varied over time periods, with some not statistically significant. Slemrod and Shobe also estimated a regression linking current year realizations and tax rates, obtaining large but statistically insignificant results. The study by Gillingham and Greenlees (1992) extends a previous time series analysis from 1954-1985 to 1989, making changes in the approach used by CBO to replicate results. They use an instrumental variables technique with taxes on predicted gains as an instrument. The study by Gillingham and Greenlees (1992) extended a previous time series analysis by using an instrumental variables technique with taxes on predicted gains as an instrument. They found that using the maximum tax rate as an instrument increased the coefficient and elasticity significantly. Differencing the data also resulted in higher elasticities. The study by Gillingham and Greenlees (1992) extended a previous time series analysis using instrumental variables with taxes on predicted gains. Higher elasticities were found with the maximum tax rate as an instrument, but they were not statistically significant. Differencing the data also captured short-term effects. Excluding 1986, estimates ranged from 3.4 to 5.4, corresponding to elasticities of 0.75 to 1.18. The study by Gillingham and Greenlees (1992) extended a previous time series analysis using instrumental variables with taxes on predicted gains. Higher elasticities were found with the maximum tax rate as an instrument, but they were not statistically significant. Excluding 1986, estimates ranged from 3.4 to 5.4, corresponding to elasticities of 0.75 to 1.18. The crucial issue is whether to use the predicted gains rate or the maximum rate as an instrument, with difficulties arising from the changing law over time. The Burman and Randolph study from 1994 innovatively separated permanent and transitory effects in a short panel using state tax rates. They included the first dollar current tax rate as an instrument for the transitory element. Taxpayers with low current income would have transitory tax rates below their permanent rates, while those with high income would have higher rates. Permanent rates varied across taxpayers in different states due to state tax rates. The authors estimated an elasticity of 0.18 at an 18% tax rate and 0.22 at a 22% tax rate, with a transitory elasticity of 6.45. Subsequent studies have used state tax rates in their analysis. Subsequent studies incorporate state tax rates into the analysis to identify permanent responses. Bogart and Gentry (1995) used aggregate state level gains from 1979 to 1990 and year dummies to control for fixed-year effects. They reported an elasticity of 0.65, leading to a coefficient of 2.5 at a 22% tax rate. Auerbach and Siegel (2000) used panel data from 1985. Auerbach and Siegel (2000) replicated Burman and Randolph's results using panel data from 1985 to 1994. They found an elasticity of 0.33 at the mean tax rate, estimated to be around 25%. With this tax rate, the coefficient was 1.126, indicating an elasticity of 0.25 at a 22% rate, similar to Burman and Randolph's findings. They also reported a transitory elasticity of 4.9 (4.1% at a 22% rate) and explored an alternative specification including additional instruments for the permanent tax rate. Auerbach and Siegel added instruments to the permanent tax rate, including the first dollar tax rate for the current year and the maximum statutory rate for the following year. They found a much higher permanent elasticity of 1.75 compared to 0.33. The problem with their approach is that the addition of the current first dollar rate likely introduces a transitory element to the permanent tax rate, leading to a significantly larger elasticity. The coefficient of 1.126 is reported in Table 1. They also conducted separate regressions for the very wealthy and \"sophisticated\" taxpayers. The study by Eichner and Sinai (2000) extends time series analysis through 1997, finding it important to exclude 1986 from the estimates. Excluding both 1986 and 1997, the coefficient in a semi-log specification is 2.18, implying an elasticity of 0.48 at a 22% tax rate. There is essentially no response for very wealthy and \"sophisticated\" taxpayers in their findings. The study by Eichner and Sinai (2000) found that excluding both 1986 and 1997, the coefficient in a semi-log specification is 2.18, with an elasticity of 0.48 at a 22% tax rate. Different specifications were tried, including using instrumental variables method based on the top marginal tax rate, resulting in estimates of 3.8 and 5.13 with elasticities of 0.84 and 1.13 respectively. The authors also considered the differences between top marginal and average tax rates before 1986, as well as changes in tax rates. The authors experimented with changes in tax rates, resulting in elasticities ranging from 0.83 to 1.46. However, most tax rate coefficients were not statistically significant. The 2.28 coefficient is reported in Table 1, reflecting more transitory elements. Auten and Joulfaian (2004) used a longer micro-data panel to estimate permanent and transitory effects, including state tax rates but not using state tax variation for identification. The study by Evans (2009) uses a basic cross-section regression to estimate the elasticity of tax rates. They find an elasticity of 0.72 at a 20% tax rate and 0.79 at a 22% tax rate. The estimate is lower than most estimates from the 1980s, possibly due to time series elements. However, it is likely that the permanent estimate includes transitory elements. The study by Evans (2009) estimates tax rate elasticity through cross-section regression, with results ranging from 0.72 to 0.79. In contrast, Bakija and Gentry (2014) use a 50-year state panel data to analyze combined federal and state tax rates. The public use file data has limitations due to confidentiality issues for high-income taxpayers, leading to elasticities between 2 and 5. However, the study's cross-section nature limits the interpretation of permanent elasticity realizations. The study by Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen (2015) analyzes changes in combined federal and state tax rates at the state level using fixed effects to control for unobserved differences. They find that omitting state and year fixed effects significantly raises elasticities. The study by Minas, Lim, and Evans (2018) analyzes Australian data from 1988 to 2015, focusing on transitory effects and year-fixed effects to control for law changes.
