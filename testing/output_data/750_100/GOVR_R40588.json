    "content": "In April 2009, a novel influenza virus, initially called \"swine flu,\" emerged and spread globally. The World Health Organization (WHO) later explained that pigs can be infected by various flu viruses from birds, humans, and pigs, leading to gene swapping and the emergence of new virus strains. This reassortment process has already occurred in pigs in the United States. The currently circulating influenza A (H1N1) virus is a reassortment of genes from swine, avian, and human origin. This combination had not been previously seen in humans or swine. The origin of this reassortment is unknown, but it is now being transmitted from human to human. The role of swine in the emergence of this virus is under investigation. WHO refers to the virus as Influenza A(H1N1) and the CDC calls it 2009 H1N1 flu. The H1N1 virus, also known as 2009 H1N1 flu, is slightly more lethal than seasonal flu but not as deadly as H5N1 avian influenza. It has spread enough to be classified as a pandemic, with cases reported in California and Texas. The virus contains gene segments from swine flu viruses and is now being transmitted from human to human. On April 24, 2009, Mexico reported a new strain of influenza with over 1,000 suspected cases, leading to school closures and event cancellations. By April 27, WHO confirmed cases in Canada and Spain with no deaths. Two days later, the pandemic alert level was raised to Phase 5. On June 11, 2009, WHO Director-General Margaret Chan raised the pandemic alert level to Phase 6, the highest level. In 2009, WHO Director-General Margaret Chan raised the pandemic alert level to Phase 6, the highest level, characterizing the virus as \"moderately severe.\" By June 22, 2009, more than 50,000 human cases of H1N1 had been confirmed in over 80 countries, with 231 deaths reported. It is important to note that the actual number of cases may be higher than officially reported. The number of H1N1 cases reported to WHO by foreign health authorities only reflect laboratory-confirmed cases. WHO, FAO, and OIE state that there is no risk of contracting the virus from well-cooked pork. WHO advises against travel restrictions as they would have little effect on stopping the virus spread. However, ill individuals should delay international travel. Symptoms of H1N1 are similar to influenza. Most people with H1N1 experience flu-like symptoms and recover without antiviral treatment. Antiviral drugs can help reduce symptoms and prevent severe illness and death. Older antiviral drugs have shown limited effectiveness against the new H1N1 virus strain. WHO has a global stockpile of oseltamivir and zanamivir to treat H1N1. They are distributing 3 million treatment courses to developing countries. Vaccine development is ongoing for the current strain of H1N1. Currently available seasonal influenza vaccines will offer no protection against H1N1. WHO and CDC are preparing vaccine candidate viruses, estimating it could take 5-6 months to mass-produce a vaccine. Once developed, WHO estimates 1-2 billion vaccine doses annually. Sanofi-Aventis will donate 100 million doses, and GlaxoSmithKline plans to donate 50 million doses to WHO. China is the exception in adhering to WHO guidelines. China has quarantined Mexican nationals, leading Mexico to ban flights to China. Some countries have warned against nonessential travel to the United States and Mexico. EU Health Commissioner urged caution. On April 27, 2009, the EU Health Commissioner advised Europeans to delay nonessential travel to the US and Mexico. The CDC also recommended avoiding nonessential travel to Mexico. On May 15, 2009, the CDC changed the recommendation to a \"travel health precaution.\" Homeland Security Secretary Napolitano argued against closing the US-Mexico border, citing minimal benefits and high costs. The virus strain from Mexico was already circulating. The strain of the virus from Mexico is widespread in the US, making border closures ineffective. Focus is now on mitigating the virus. Some countries use thermal scanners in airports to screen travelers for high body temperatures. Actions are taken to prevent H1N1 spread among animals. Egypt ordered the slaughter of pigs as a preventive measure against H1N1, despite pigs not being confirmed as a source of human transmission. Several countries banned pork imports from the US, Canada, and Mexico. USAID established a Pandemic Influenza Response Management Team to coordinate humanitarian aid for H1N1 outbreaks, providing over $16 million to Latin America and the Caribbean. The US provided over $16 million in aid to Latin America and the Caribbean to respond to H1N1 outbreaks. The aid focuses on influenza pandemic preparedness efforts following the 2003 SARS outbreak. CDC, USAID, and DOD are involved in global H1N1 response efforts, focusing on commodity delivery and disease surveillance. USAID also donated 4,000 PPE kits to Vietnam. The CDC donated 4,000 PPE kits and 100 boxes of biodegradable powder to Vietnam to help animal health workers respond to potential outbreaks of avian or H1N1 influenza. The kits, valued at over $57,000, can be used for H5N1 bird flu or H1N1 outbreaks. CDC has been actively involved in responding to H1N1 outbreaks and collaborates with WHO on influenza surveillance and research. The CDC provides testing kits for identifying influenza subtypes and sends experts to help strengthen laboratory capacity during outbreaks. HHS Secretary announced the distribution of 400,000 treatment courses to Mexico, with plans to distribute 2 million courses in Latin America and the Caribbean. The Administration plans to distribute 2 million courses of treatment in Latin America and the Caribbean. CDC has deployed staff to Mexico and Guatemala, including experts in influenza epidemiology, laboratory, health communications, and emergency operations. Teams aim to understand H1N1 severity and transmission patterns, improve laboratory capacity, and work under WHO/Pan American Health Organization Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network. CDC's Emergency Operations Center coordinates with ECDC and China CDC to improve laboratory capacity in Mexico and support pandemic influenza preparedness efforts in over 50 countries. USAID announced additional funding for WHO and PAHO in April 2009. USAID provided $5 million to WHO and PAHO for H1N1 response in Latin America and the Caribbean, focusing on disease surveillance and control measures. This is part of the $6.1 million international assistance for H1N1, with $0.9 million for Mexico, $0.2 million for Panama, and $5 million for the region. Assistance includes support for animal surveillance in Mexico and the distribution of over 100,000 PPE kits valued at more than $1 million in May 2009. USAID distributed over 100,000 PPE kits worth $1 million from its stockpile to protect first responders in the region. They also pre-positioned 400,000 PPE kits in 82 countries for pandemic preparedness. Additionally, USAID conducted a pandemic preparedness exercise in Ethiopia with stakeholders from nine East African countries. During a regional event in East Africa, participants from Djibouti, Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda met to develop a pandemic response action plan and test existing ones through simulation exercises. This helps governments prepare for potential pandemics and address cross-border population movements. USAID is conducting exercises in South Africa and Asia to address potential issues with influenza outbreaks. They are working with the Department of Defense to provide military assistance in 30 countries across Africa and Asia to ensure preparedness during a pandemic. In May 2009, USAID conducted a joint pandemic preparedness exercise with PACOM, AFRICOM, and the World Food Program involving 27 African and Asian countries. Congress has funded U.S. efforts to train health workers in foreign countries for global pandemic influenza preparedness and response. The United States has pledged $949 million for global avian and pandemic influenza efforts since FY2005, making up 30.9% of international donor pledges. This funding has supported preparedness, surveillance, and response efforts in over 100 nations and jurisdictions. The United States has allocated $319 million for bilateral activities, $196 million for support to international organizations, $123 million for regional programs, $83 million for a global contingency fund, $77 million for technical and humanitarian assistance, and $71 million for international coordination in global avian and pandemic influenza efforts. The United States has allocated $71 million for international influenza research, including vaccines and modeling of influenza outbreaks, and wild bird surveillance. This includes the launch of the Global Avian Influenza Network for Surveillance (GAINS) for wild birds. Additionally, $67 million is designated for stockpiles of non-pharmaceutical supplies, and $13 million for global communications and outreach efforts. The United States has allocated $949 million for pandemic preparedness and response activities, with contributions from various agencies. President Obama has requested an additional $1.5 billion for domestic and international efforts. The 2009 Supplemental Appropriations bill allocated $50 million for USAID pandemic preparedness and $200 million to CDC for H1N1 activities, with no specified amount for international efforts. Infectious diseases cause over 25% of global deaths, raising concerns about their threat. The emergence of infectious diseases like SARS and H1N1 has raised global security concerns. 75% of recent diseases originated from animals, emphasizing the need for a multidisciplinary approach involving various sectors. Investments have been made by the US and other international players to prepare for pandemics and monitor infectious disease spread. Health experts have made progress in combating H1N1 by developing specific tests, effective treatments, and a global surveillance system. Concerns remain about poorer countries' capacity to monitor and respond to the disease, and caution is advised as influenza transmission tends to increase in winter months. In May 2009, there was debate about whether WHO should maintain its pandemic influenza phase system, reflecting virus spread and transmission patterns, not severity. Questions arise about potential gene changes in H1N1, especially in countries also dealing with H5N1 bird flu outbreaks like Egypt, Vietnam, and Indonesia. Some argued that WHO should develop an alert system based on severity, not just virus spread. Supporters believed widespread death may not occur at the highest pandemic phase level. Critics warned of panic and economic disruptions if WHO raised the pandemic threat level to Phase 6. Health experts cited sustained human-to-human transmission of H1N1 in Japan as justification for raising the pandemic threat level. WHO raised the pandemic phase level from 5 to 6 on June 11, 2009. On June 11, 2009, WHO raised the pandemic phase level from 5 to 6, emphasizing that it did not indicate a change in severity. Director General Margaret Chan announced the update, which included a new pandemic influenza preparedness and response guide. This updated guide maintained the six-phase structure but redefined the phases to better reflect pandemic risk and the current epidemiological situation. It also outlined steps for governments to plan and prepare for an epidemic. USAID announced in April 2009 the launch of a new five-year program in collaboration with CDC and USDA to develop a global early warning system for zoonotic diseases. The program aims to establish a network of laboratories in Africa to improve diagnosis of new pathogens in both animal and human populations. USAID, in collaboration with CDC and USDA, launched a five-year program to develop a global early warning system for zoonotic diseases. Concerns arise as South Africa is the only sub-Saharan country with confirmed H1N1 cases, highlighting poor laboratory and surveillance systems in the region. Limited public health and surveillance capacity may be the reason for the absence of case reports from most African countries. CDC, USAID, and other international health experts are working to improve laboratory and disease surveillance capacity in African countries. CDC has distributed H1N1 testing kits to laboratories worldwide, including 18 in Africa. Access to treatments and vaccines for diseases in poor countries has been a long-standing issue, especially during the peak of HIV/AIDS transmission. Access to treatments and vaccines for diseases in poor countries has been a long-standing issue, especially during the peak of HIV/AIDS transmission. Discussions about access resurfaced at the peak of global H5N1 avian flu outbreaks. Indonesia intermittently sent viral samples to WHO, citing concerns that once a vaccine was developed, poorer countries would be unable to afford them or wealthier producing countries would hoard the vaccines. Some have raised similar concerns again with the recent H1N1 outbreaks. The link between access, poverty, and health have been well-documented. USAID estimates that about 30% of the world's population lacks regular access to medicines and more than 50% of the poorest areas in Africa and Asia lack access. WHO estimates that more than 90% of the global capacity to develop influenza vaccines is located in. WHO estimates that over 90% of global influenza vaccine development capacity is in Europe and North America. Richer countries hold most of the capacity to develop and purchase vaccines, leaving poorer countries reliant on donor generosity. Concerns arise about hoarding of treatments during a pandemic, as well as the ability of poorer countries to administer mass vaccination campaigns. WHO stated it would not conduct mass H1N1 vaccination campaigns, expecting national authorities to handle it. Some argue that countries incapable of administering routine vaccines may struggle to undertake a mass vaccination effort. In 2002, 1.4 million deaths in children under five were preventable with routine vaccines. Health experts, including WHO, are concerned about factors affecting the severity of the circulating H1N1 strain. The possibility of H5N1 and H1N1 strains circulating in the same area raises concerns about gene reassortment and the potential for a new strain causing human illness. Health experts have been worried about H5N1 outbreaks since 2004 due to the risk of a pandemic, with efficient human-to-human transmission being the only missing factor. The highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza outbreak in poultry began in 2003, affecting eight Asian nations. By 2006, 50 countries worldwide confirmed H5N1 outbreaks. In 2008 and 2009, six countries reported human H5N1 cases, with Indonesia and Cambodia not reporting H1N1 cases. H5N1 bird flu has a high mortality rate of about 60% in humans. H5N1 bird flu has a high mortality rate of about 60% in humans, but it is not as easily transmissible as H1N1. Most human deaths from H5N1 have occurred after direct contact with sick birds. Animals have not been identified as a source of transmission for H1N1."
