    "content": "The report discusses key base closure developments from the 105th to the 107th Congress, including the signing of legislation in December 2001 (P.L. 107-107) for a new base closure round in 2005. This legislation extends and amends the 1990 base closure Act (P.L. 101-510) that expired after the 1995 round, completing action on 451 installations by FY2001. The 1995 BRAC closures and realignments resulted in significant savings of $16.7 billion initially and $6.6 billion annually. The 1997 Quadrennial Defense Review highlighted the need for additional base closures due to decreasing defense spending and force structure. The 1997 Quadrennial Defense Review called for two more rounds of base closures in 1999 and 2001 to address the imbalance between infrastructure and force structure. Since the first closure round, force structure decreased by 33% and will reach a total of 36% reduction under the QDR, while domestic infrastructure decreased by 21%. More base closures are necessary to achieve a proper balance. Secretary of Defense Cohen's plan to start new rounds of base closures within the next five years was met with resistance on Capitol Hill due to concerns about economic and political repercussions in districts. The closures are seen as necessary to achieve a balance between infrastructure and force structure and to secure savings for future readiness and weapons acquisition programs. Without these savings, DOD may struggle to fulfill its missions and responsibilities in the future. The Senate Armed Services Committee narrowly failed to approve two more rounds of base closures in 1999 and 2001. Senator Levin and other senators pledged to push for more base closings to reduce excess infrastructure for new weapons funding. The full Senate later voted 66-33 in favor of this initiative. The full Senate voted 66-33 against the McCain-Levin initiative for new base closings, opting for a substitute amendment that required DOD to develop accounting techniques to measure costs and savings. The amendment, sponsored by Senators Dorgan, Lott, and Daschle, mandated DOD to submit a cost/savings report to Congress in a timely manner to potentially authorize another round of base closings in 2001. In 2001, Congress debated authorizing another round of base closings. Representative Joel Hefley opposed new closures for at least five years, questioning the actual savings of shutting down bases. DOD claimed net savings, but the Congressional Budget Office could not confirm those estimates. In 1996, Congressional opponents questioned rushing into new rounds of base closures without understanding the military implications of previous rounds. Despite lack of support on Capitol Hill, senior DOD officials and the President pushed for new closures. Gen. John Shalikashvili, the retiring Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called for more base closures in September 1997 to fund top priority weapons programs. The Defense Reform Initiative (DRI) announced in November 1997 included two rounds of base closures in 2001 and 2005, aiming to save $2.8 billion annually. This was part of a larger plan to save $6 billion annually through actions like outsourcing to private companies. The Defense Reform Initiative (DRI) included base closings, outsourcing to private industry, paperless contracting, and reducing personnel. Support for new base closures came from a 1997 report urging quick action to begin closures earlier than planned. The Defense Reform Initiative included base closings to accelerate the transformation of U.S. military capabilities. President Clinton's actions regarding the closure of two Air Force maintenance depots were highly contentious. President Clinton opposed closing McClellan and Kelly Air Force depots in California and Texas, suggesting privatization-in-place to prevent job losses. Opponents accused President Clinton of political meddling in the base closing process by proposing privatization-in-place to prevent job losses at McClellan and Kelly Air Force depots in California and Texas. Legislators from Oklahoma, Georgia, and Utah opposed the plan, fearing job loss and vulnerability to future base closures. Some Members opposed President Clinton's intervention in base closures, leading to resentment that persisted until the end of his second term. Congressional opponents cited his actions as a reason for their opposition to new base closure rounds. Legislation was proposed to block the privatization of depot maintenance work at McClellan and Kelly air force bases, with conditions set for certification of efficiency at other depots. The House National Security Committee approved depot-related measures on June 16, followed by the Senate Armed Services Committee on June 17. However, the provisions were removed from the DOD authorization bill due to a threatened filibuster by Senators from California and Texas. Representative Terry Everett's attempt to delete the restrictions in the House FY1998 defense authorization bill was defeated on June 23. The House and Senate faced challenges regarding depot-related measures in the FY1998 defense authorization bill. Senator Inhofe led an effort to restore depot restrictions in the Senate bill, but withdrew the amendment before floor consideration. The depot-related language in the House bill became a major obstacle in reaching a final agreement, with neither side willing to yield. The Senate and House faced challenges over depot competition at McClellan and Kelly air force bases. A compromise was reached, increasing the limit on depot work by private contractors to 50%. The House passed the conference report on October 28. The House passed the conference report on October 28 by a vote of 286 to 123. The Senate debated the provisions regarding depot maintenance operations but did not reach a final vote. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison's bid to postpone the final vote was denied. The Senate eventually passed the conference report by a vote of 90 to 10 on November 6. President Clinton signed the bill into law on November 18 (P.L. 105-85), which included language prohibiting DOD from planning new base operations. The Dorgan Amendment prohibited DOD from planning new base closures until a report on costs and savings was submitted. The report was delivered ahead of the deadline in April 1998 by Secretary of Defense Cohen. Secretary of Defense Cohen emphasized the need for new base closure and realignment legislation to address the 23% excess in the current base structure. He highlighted the importance of savings from closures for modernizing weapons systems and improving readiness, pointing out the imbalance between force and base structures. For example, while the defense budget and force structure had decreased significantly, the base structure had only declined by 21%. Cohen also noted the disparity in the reduction of Navy ships compared to berthing space. The base closure report highlighted planned reductions in Army soldiers and berthing space, with a significant decrease in costs compared to original estimates. The savings from base closures during the 1988-1995 rounds were expected to exceed initial estimates, with projected net total savings of about $14 billion. The Department of Defense expected net total savings of $14 billion through 2001, with annual savings of $5.6 billion thereafter. The figures were later revised upward by the DOD and General Accounting Office. Two new rounds of closures in 2001 and 2005 were expected to produce additional savings of $3 billion a year. The report also included a recommendation to apply the model of previous independent base closure commissions. The DOD recommended applying the model of previous base closure commissions for rounds in 2001 and 2005. A memo from the Air Force mentioned John D. Podesta trying to keep depot maintenance work at McClellan Air Force Base in Sacramento. Members opposed keeping the work at McClellan AFB and Kelly AFB, accusing the Administration of favoritism. Members of Congress accused the Administration of meddling in the base closure process, leading to increased suspicion and strong opposition to new base closures. The House National Security Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee were divided on the issue, with widespread resistance to the recommendation for two new base closure rounds. The Senate Armed Services Committee was evenly divided on the issue of new base closures in 2001, with a 10-8 margin defeating the proposal. Senators McCain and Levin, who were co-sponsors of the legislation, considered seeking support for a floor amendment during Senate consideration of the FY1999 defense authorization bill but ultimately abandoned their initiative due to majority opposition. The Senate voted 48-45 in support of an amendment to the FY1999 defense authorization bill that would have made it more difficult for the Pentagon to close bases with a certain number of civilian personnel. Senator James Inhofe sponsored the amendment, which aimed to restrict base closures and realignments. The Inhofe amendment aimed to delay or block the Pentagon from closing bases with a certain number of civilian employees. It also opposed new rounds of closures until previous actions were completed. The amendment was dropped from the FY1999 defense authorization bill during conference. The Office reviewed DOD's base realignment and closure report on July 1, 1998, finding that it provided most but not all requested information. DOD's estimates of savings were consistent with Congress's, but CBO explained that firm measures of BRAC savings cannot exist as they are avoided costs, not actual expenditures. DOD cannot observe or record avoided costs as actual expenditures, leading to estimated savings instead of measured ones. CBO noted a lack of analysis on potential base closures and the difficulty in predicting the impact on local communities. The DOD faced challenges in locating requested data for BRAC costs and savings estimates, including environmental and caretaker costs post-closure. The GAO review praised DOD for providing required information, giving generally good grades for their report on BRAC closures. The GAO affirmed that previous BRAC closure rounds would result in substantial net savings, but noted that DOD's report provides a rough approximation of costs and savings. DOD's data systems do not capture all savings associated with BRAC actions, and there is no separate system to track BRAC savings. Additionally, DOD's analysis shows no long-term problems affecting military capabilities due to BRAC actions. The DOD's report on BRAC actions shows that communities affected by prior rounds are rebounding economically, with some faring better than others. The proposed BRAC rounds in 2001 and 2005 would follow similar processes. The legislative proposal for two additional BRAC rounds could serve as a basis for future legislation. Congress faced the decision of authorizing new base closings at the start of the 106th Congress. At the outset of the 106th Congress, the debate centered around authorizing new base closings. Senator John McCain and Senator Carl Levin sponsored a bill calling for two new rounds in 2001 and 2003, citing excess infrastructure capacity claimed by DOD. Senator McCain emphasized the significant cost savings from closing and realigning bases. Senator John McCain and Senator Carl Levin proposed two significant changes in the law to save billions of dollars by closing and realigning bases. The BRAC selection process would start and end two months later in 2001, allowing a new President to nominate commission members. Privatization-in-place would only be allowed if recommended by the base closure commission. Secretary of Defense William Cohen emphasized the importance of further base closures. Secretary of Defense William Cohen emphasized the importance of further base closures in a speech to the Illinois legislature in January 1999. He highlighted the wastage of money on unneeded facilities, stating that closing bases would save $20 billion during implementation and generate $3 billion annually thereafter. Despite his appeals, many Members of Congress remained opposed to new rounds of base closures. Despite Secretary of Defense Cohen's call for two more closure rounds, many Members of Congress opposed new base closures due to widespread fear among constituents. The Senate Armed Services Committee voted against authorizing any new rounds during the FY2000 defense authorization bill mark-up. Senator John McCain and Senator Carl Levin's attempt to revive base closures was rejected by the full Senate on May 26. The Senate rejected a last-ditch effort by Senators John McCain and Carl Levin to revive their base closure initiative during the defense bill passage. The 60 to 40 vote marked the third year in a row that DOD's attempt to close more bases had been blocked. Opposition in the House was even stronger, effectively quashing DOD's initiative for the year. Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre sought authority to close bases in 2003 and 2005. Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre emphasized the opportune time for Congress to take the initiative in improving the base closing process. Secretary of Defense Cohen argued that bureaucratic obstacles hindered the transition to private use of closed bases, costing the Pentagon up to $20 billion that could be better spent on upgrading weapon systems and enhancing the performance of U.S. fighting forces. He also assured that politics would not interfere in future base closure decisions. In June 2000, Congress rejected an amendment for new rounds of base closures sponsored by Senators McCain and Levin. The debate reflected ongoing concerns about military base closures. The Department of Defense sought authority for additional closures and realignments in the 107th Congress. Senator Carl Levin and Senator John McCain introduced bill S. 397 for new rounds of base closures in 2003 and 2005. Taxpayers for Common Sense supported the initiative, estimating savings of up to $21 billion by closing excess military bases. Senator Kay Bailey was also involved in the discussions. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison expressed concerns about increasing restrictions on U.S. military training abroad and questioned the wisdom of closing more domestic military bases prematurely. She highlighted past BRAC decisions that were considered mistakes, such as at Reese Air Force Base, TX, and Fort Hood, TX. The Department of Defense reversed the BRAC decision and proposed a new round of base closures and consolidations in 2001 due to excess military infrastructure capacity. The new initiative, called the Efficient Facilities Initiative of 2001 (EFI), aimed to reduce excess infrastructure based on the experience of Brooks Air Force Base in San Antonio, TX. In 2001, Brooks Air Force Base in San Antonio, TX transferred its property to the local community as a demonstration project approved by Congress. The Senate Armed Services Committee grappled with two base closure proposals and ultimately recommended a new round of closures. On September 6, 2001, the Senate Armed Services Committee voted 17 to 8 for a new round of base closures. The full Senate approved the proposal on September 25, 2001, by a margin of 53 to 47. This marked the first success in five years for proponents of base closure. General Henry H. Shelton and Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld emphasized the need to address excess infrastructure costs due to the ongoing struggle with terrorist groups. Defense Secretary Rumsfeld emphasized the need to convert excess capacity into war-fighting ability amidst the current struggle with terrorist groups. Opponents argued that with the ongoing war on terrorism and uncertain economy, it was not the right time to start closing bases. Minority Leader Trent Lott expressed concerns about the timing, especially when reserves were being called up to support the military. Supporters, however, highlighted the importance of prioritizing military resources over home-state interests. Senator John McCain supported trusting the military leadership in combating terrorism, while the House opposed including base-closing language in the defense authorization bill. A stalemate ensued between the House and Senate leaders during conference negotiations. After a stalemate over base closures, Senator John McCain warned of a potential veto by the President. Senior negotiators reached a compromise on December 10, 2001, and the defense authorization bill was signed on December 28, 2001. The conference report retained most of the 1990 BRAC Act language with some modifications. Congress extended the authority of the base closure and realignment act. The 2005 base closure and realignment act extends the authority of the 1990 act for one new round. The Secretary of Defense must submit a force structure plan detailing end strength, force levels, and review all types of installations, including overseas bases. The plan should include an inventory of military installations, excess infrastructure categories, and an economic analysis of options for reducing excess infrastructure. Certification is required after submitting the force structure plan. The 2005 base closure and realignment act extends the authority of the 1990 act for one new round. The Secretary of Defense must submit a force structure plan detailing end strength, force levels, and review all types of installations, including overseas bases. Certification is required after submitting the force structure plan. The act also increases the number of members on the commission from 8 to 9 and allows the Secretary of Defense to testify before the commission on any proposed addition of a base. In 1997, the Department of Defense announced the need for two more base closure rounds in 1999 and 2001 to reduce excess infrastructure. Despite little enthusiasm from Congress, subsequent appeals by Secretary of Defense Cohen in 1998, 1999, and 2000 were unsuccessful. However, in 2001, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld proposed further closures. In 2001, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld succeeded in winning approval from Congress for a new round of base closures, scheduled for 2005. Communities near military bases are concerned about their survival. Strategies include keeping military units at home and acquiring units from other parts of the country to ensure a base's survival in the next round. The growing impact of \"range encroachment\" near military bases is a serious concern for communities as it may de-value installations and make them prime candidates for closure in 2005. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 outlines the process for nominations and approval of Commission's list by the President and Congress within a specified timeframe. If nominations are not sent by the required date, the process is terminated, and Congress has 45 days to pass a motion of disapproval."
