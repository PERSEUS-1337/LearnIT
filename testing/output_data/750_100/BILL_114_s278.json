    "content": "The \"Citizen Empowerment Act\" may be cited as the official title. Part III of title 5, United States Code, is amended by adding a new chapter 79A for services to members of the public. The \"Citizen Empowerment Act\" establishes procedures for in-person and telephonic interactions by executive branch employees regarding possible violations of federal statutes or regulations. The \"Citizen Empowerment Act\" outlines penalties for violations, defines terms like 'State' and 'telephonic', and requires recording of enforcement actions by Executive agency employees conducting covered interactions. The \"Citizen Empowerment Act\" allows individuals to make audio recordings of covered interactions with Executive agency employees at their own expense. Employees can also record interactions if they inform the individual and provide a transcript upon request. Employees of Executive agencies must provide individuals with a verbal or written notice of their rights before or at an initial covered interaction. This notice includes the option for the individual to request a transcript or copy of the recording, with reimbursement for the transcription and reproduction costs. Employees of Executive agencies must notify individuals of their rights before or during a covered interaction. This includes the option to request a transcript or copy of the recording, with reimbursement for costs. Additionally, previous notifications for separate violations can be considered valid for the current situation. Employees of Executive agencies have the right to make audio recordings and receive transcripts or copies as if they were the individual. They must receive the same notice as the individual and have the same rights regarding recordings and transcripts. Any audio recording or transcript made by an individual under subsection (b)(1) or provided to them under subsection (b)(2)(B) belongs to the individual. This section does not create a private right of action. Exceptions include discussions involving classified information, public safety, or criminal investigations. Exceptions to the ownership of audio recordings or transcripts made by individuals include classified information, public safety concerns, and ongoing criminal investigations conducted by Federal law enforcement officers. The paragraph discusses the requirement for written notification regarding the recording of covered interactions, superseding previous laws related to recording interactions. The paragraph discusses disciplinary action for employees violating the requirement for written notification of covered interactions. Services to members of the public are outlined in section 7921."
