    "content": "The \"Red River Private Property Protection Act\" disclaims any right to land south of the Red River's South Bank boundary line. Previous surveys by the Bureau of Land Management will not determine the current boundary line. The \"Red River Private Property Protection Act\" mandates a new survey to identify the South Bank boundary line, adhering to specific criteria and conducted by Licensed State Land Surveyors. The survey must be completed within 2 years and approved by the Texas General Land Office to satisfy the Act's requirements. SEC. 4. APPEAL.\n\nWithin 1 year of survey approval, private property owners can appeal public domain claims to an Administrative Law Judge.\n\nSEC. 5. RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PLAN.\n\nNo affected land can be treated as Federal until survey approval and no further appeals are possible.\n\nSEC. 6. CONSTRUCTION. SEC. 6. CONSTRUCTION. This Act does not change or affect the interest of States or sovereignty rights of federally recognized Indian tribes over lands north of the Red River's South Bank boundary line. After completing the survey and ensuring no further appeals, the Secretary will offer identified Federal lands for competitive sale at fair market value. Sales are subject to existing tribal, State, and local rights. Proceeds from the sale of identified Federal lands will be used to offset costs associated with the Act. The Secretary must report to the House and Senate committees on any unsold lands and reasons for not selling them within 5 years of the Act's enactment. SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms such as \"affected area\" as lands along the Red River, \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of the Interior, and \"South Bank\" as a water-washed elevation along the river. The South Bank boundary line, commonly known as a cut bank, is the boundary between Texas and Oklahoma along the Red River. It is identified through the gradient boundary survey method as specified in a decree from a legal case in 1923. The gradient boundary survey method is used to locate the South Bank boundary line between Texas and Oklahoma along the Red River, as established by a legal decree in 1923. The legal decree in 1923 established the erosion and accretion boundaries between Texas and Oklahoma along the Red River."
