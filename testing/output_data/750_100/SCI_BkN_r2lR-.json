    "content": "Recent advances in artificial intelligence focus on identifying analogies across domains without supervision. The paper introduces AN-GAN, a matching-by-synthesis approach that outperforms current techniques in finding exact analogies between datasets. The task involves translating images across domains, with a key emphasis on visual fidelity for identifying matching samples. The cross-domain mapping process is divided into domain alignment and learning the mapping function. The mapping task involves domain alignment and learning the mapping function iteratively. Humans excel at making analogies between unseen and seen domains without prior supervision, which is crucial for leveraging previous knowledge in new situations. Identifying analogies between multiple domains is a key challenge for Artificial Intelligence, especially in unsupervised translation tasks. Recent approaches in AI have focused on unsupervised mapping between domains, such as mapping aerial photos to Google-Maps images without explicit correspondences. This involves learning a mapping function that can translate images from one domain to another. Recent approaches in AI have focused on unsupervised mapping between domains, such as mapping aerial photos to Google-Maps images without explicit correspondences. This involves utilizing constraints like distributional and cycle constraints to achieve the task of analogy identification by finding pairs of examples related by a non-linear transformation. In this work, the problem of analogy identification is addressed by adding exemplar-based constraints to improve visual fidelity in translated images. The method shows effectiveness even when only some sample images have exact analogies. The method improves visual fidelity in translated images by finding correspondences between sets even when no exact analogies are available. It yields better quality than mapping functions and allows for a more accurate two-step approach for training a domain mapping function. This paper aims to identify analogies between datasets without supervision, related to image matching methods and unsupervised style-transfer. It discusses aligning domains and fitting a translation function between them using a fully supervised method. Larger architectures and non-adversarial loss functions can be utilized for the supervised network. Image matching is a long-standing computer vision task with various approaches proposed, including supervised deep neural networks and generic visual feature matching. However, in unsupervised scenarios, standard visual features struggle to achieve good analogies between different domains. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) technology is presented as a potential solution. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) technology, introduced by Goodfellow et al. in 2014, has revolutionized image synthesis across various domains. GAN methods involve training a generator network G to produce samples from a target distribution by simultaneously training a discriminator network D. This approach has been widely adopted in image to image translation tasks to generate realistic images. The architecture used is based on BID12's design. The generative architecture based on BID12 is used for image mapping, creating images from input images rather than random noise. Unsupervised mapping involves no supervision except for sample images from both domains, recently applied for image to image translation. Supervised mapping uses matching pairs of input and output images. In supervised mapping, matching pairs of input and output images are used to train the mapping directly. The discriminator receives pairs of images, one being the source image and the other either the matching target image or a generated image. The U-net architecture is employed to strengthen the link between the source and target images. Although no supervision is used in this work, successful completion of the algorithm generates correspondences between domains, allowing for the use of supervised mapping methods on the inferred matches. BID2 showed improved mapping results in supervised settings without using GANs. The method for analogy identification involves finding matching indexes between sets of images in domains A and B. The goal is to match every A domain image with a B domain image if a match exists, using an iterative approach. An iterative approach is used to find matches between images in two domains, A and B. A GAN-based distribution approach is employed to map images from domain A to domain B. The mapping function T AB is trained to make images from domain A appear as if they belong to domain B by optimizing the distribution of the mapped images to match those in domain B. The distribution-constraint alone may be insufficient in datasets, leading to the addition of constraints like circularity and distance invariance. The cycle approach trains one-sided GANs in both domains to optimize the discriminator's task of discriminating between distributions. The popular cycle approach trains one-sided GANs in both directions A \u2192 B and B \u2192 A, ensuring that an A image translated to B and back recovers the original image. The two-sided cycle loss function includes L1 loss and provides mapping functions between domains A and B, but does not guarantee exact correspondences between images. In the previous section, a distributional approach was used to map A domain images to B domain images. This section introduces a method for exact matches between domains, finding matching indices for each image pair. Once exact matching is achieved, a fully supervised mapping function can be trained to obtain high-quality mappings between domains. The proposed match matrix between B domain images and A domain images is used to match each A image with a mixture of B samples. The text discusses the process of finding exact matches between A domain images and B domain images using weights \u03b1 i,j. The optimization involves continuous optimization over T AB and binary programming over \u03b1 i,j. To enforce sparsity, an entropy constraint is added to the optimization process. The text discusses enforcing sparsity in optimization by adding an entropy constraint. The final objective includes enforcing constraints using an auxiliary variable and a Softmax function. Increasing the significance of the entropy term helps converge solutions to the original problem, recovering exact correspondences. AN-GAN is a cross-domain matching method that iteratively updates T AB and \u03b2 for N epochs, achieving excellent results with a good initialization of T AB being essential for performance. The method combines exemplar-based matching with optimization techniques to address the challenging optimization problem. AN-GAN is a cross-domain matching method that utilizes exemplar and distribution-based constraints. The AN-GAN loss function includes distributional, cycle, and exemplar loss constraints. The optimization problem involves adversarially training discriminators D A and D B. AN-GAN utilizes exemplar and distribution-based constraints in its loss function, involving adversarially training discriminators D A and D B. The optimization process includes an initial burn-in period, followed by iterations for exemplar-loss and T -iteration. The learning rate for exemplar loss is decayed after 20 epochs. The architecture and hyper-parameters used are similar to CycleGAN, with shared \u03b2 parameters between mapping directions. In experiments, shared \u03b2 parameters inform mapping directions, with fixed hyper-parameters. Euclidean or L1 loss functions were not perceptual enough, but Laplacian pyramid loss showed improvement. Best results came from using a perceptual loss function, consistent with prior works. Our loss function utilizes VGG features extracted from images I1 and I2, with different numbers of feature maps based on image resolution. L1 loss on pixels is also used to consider colors. The perceptual loss function is defined using feature maps \u03c6m1 and \u03c6m2, with Np as the number of pixels and Nm as the number of features in layer m. Our method utilizes VGG features extracted from images I1 and I2, with different numbers of feature maps based on image resolution. The loss function considers colors using L1 loss on pixels and a perceptual loss function defined with Np as the number of pixels and Nm as the number of features in layer m. The approach is evaluated through matching experiments on public datasets, comparing against existing solutions for cross-domain matching. The curr_chunk discusses different methods for finding the nearest neighbor of the source image in the target domain, including using L1 loss on raw pixels and VGG feature loss. The methods involve training using CycleGAN code and computing the nearest neighbor in the target set. The authors used CycleGAN code to train AN-GAN with VGG loss for finding the nearest neighbor in the target set. The method was evaluated on 4 public datasets including Facades and Maps dataset scraped from Google Maps. The authors used CycleGAN code to train AN-GAN with VGG loss for finding the nearest neighbor in the target set. They used 1096 images in the training set from the Zappos50K dataset and 137k images of Amazon handbags. Edge images were automatically detected using HED. The datasets were down-sampled to 2k images each for memory complexity. The method was compared with five others for exact correspondence identification. The authors used CycleGAN code to train AN-GAN with VGG loss for finding the nearest neighbor in the target set. They compared five methods for exact correspondence identification, finding that matching between domains using pixels or deep features cannot solve the task due to differences in the domains. Simple mapping using CycleGAN was also ineffective. Perceptual features, specifically VGG features, were used to improve matching performance in image retrieval tasks. Exhaustive search was deemed too computationally expensive, leading to the need for subsampling features. Perceptual features outperformed pixel-based matching methods. The method of matching linear combinations of mapped images using \u03b1 iterations showed significant improvements in performance. It is less sensitive to outliers and uses the same \u03b2 parameters for both sides of the match to enhance identification. The exemplar loss alone could theoretically provide a plausible solution for domain matches and mapping functions, but the optimization problem proved difficult and did not converge. The distributional auxiliary loss helped the exemplar loss converge successfully through \u03b1 \u2212 T iterations, showing its importance for analogy finding. The AN-GAN method, utilizing the full exemplar-based loss, significantly improved performance for all datasets and matching directions. In experiments, a percentage of matches were made unavailable by randomly removing images from datasets A and B. The task was to identify correct matches for samples with matches in the other domain, evaluating the percentage of images with exact matches. Our method can handle scenarios where not all examples have matches, even when 10-25% of samples do not have matches. Results show that AN-GAN achieves around 90% match in some datasets, despite lower quality mapping function due to low exact match ratio. In experiments, AN-GAN achieved a 90% match rate with up to 75% of samples not having matches. The method was tested on scenarios without exact analogies, using DiscoGAN architecture for mapping in the Shoes2Handbags scenario from BID9. Several analogies were observed in FIG2. In experiments, AN-GAN achieved a 90% match rate with up to 75% of samples not having matches using DiscoGAN architecture for mapping in the Shoes2Handbags scenario. The method showed that AN-GAN produced better analogies compared to DiscoGAN and DiscoGAN + \u03b1 iterations. A two-step approach for training a mapping function between datasets with exact matches was suggested for high accuracy alignment. The two-step approach involves finding analogies using AN-GAN and training a mapping function with self-supervision. The Facades dataset achieved 97% alignment accuracy, used for training a fully self-supervised mapping function with Pix2Pix. The supervised mapping showed higher accuracy compared to unsupervised mapping methods like CycleGAN. Our method for image mapping is more accurate than unsupervised methods like CycleGAN. It effectively solves the unsupervised problem by finding correspondences between domains, resulting in higher quality images similar to fully-supervised approaches. The self-supervised method performs similarly to fully supervised methods and outperforms CycleGAN on tasks like edges2shoes and edges2handbags datasets. The supervised stage uses a Pix2Pix architecture with only L1 loss, yielding improved performance over CycleGAN and competitive with full-supervision. The method was also evaluated on point cloud matching, showing effectiveness in low dimensional settings with close but not exact correspondences between samples. The experiments were conducted on point cloud matching using the Bunny benchmark with random 3D rotations to test alignment success rates. Both CycleGAN and the proposed method utilized a specific architecture for the task. The experiments focused on point cloud matching using random 3D rotations to test alignment success rates. A linear affine matrix with a bias term was used for the mapping function, with a loss term encouraging orthonormality of the weights. Results showed significant improvement over baseline results, especially at large angles. Our method for cross domain matching with an exemplar constraint outperformed previous work, especially for large transformations. It is effective for low dimensional transformations and settings without exact matches. Our method for cross domain matching with an exemplar constraint has shown superior performance on public datasets for full and partial exact matching. It presents an alternative approach to domain translation by aligning domains and training a supervised mapping function. Future work includes exploring matching between different modalities and developing new distribution matching algorithms for challenging scenarios."
