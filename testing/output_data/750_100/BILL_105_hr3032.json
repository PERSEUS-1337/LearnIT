    "content": "The Act titled \"Construction Subcontractors Payment Protection Enhancement Act of 1998\" establishes additional responsibilities for the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy. The Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act is amended to establish Government-wide policies for timely payment of contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers. The Prompt Payment Act, the Miller Act, and the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 are included in the Government-wide policies for timely payment of contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers. The Government-wide Federal Acquisition Regulation will be revised to implement amendments made by the Act, with proposed regulations to be published within 120 days and final regulations within 180 days. Additionally, related amendments to the Miller Act will be made. The Miller Act is amended to improve payment bond protection by equalizing the amount of the payment bond to the performance bond. Progress payments must be made within seven days to contractors who have not been paid in full. The Miller Act is amended to extend payment bond protection to all subcontractors and suppliers, ensuring progress payments are made promptly within seven days. The Miller Act is amended to require notice of a lawsuit to be given to the contractor within 90 days of payment bond issuance. Additionally, no waiver of protection under the Act is valid unless in writing after the right to sue is established. The Miller Act is amended to modernize service of payment bond claims by allowing delivery through various means, including electronic methods. Additionally, delays in payment bond protection are eliminated through further amendments to the Act. The Miller Act (40 U.S.C. 270b) is amended to allow suits to be filed within ninety days after the last labor or material provision, even if the contractor denies payment. This amendment aims to discourage frivolous payment bond litigation. The Miller Act is amended to allow suits within ninety days after the last labor or material provision, discouraging frivolous payment bond litigation by awarding court costs, attorneys' fees, and interest to the prevailing party if the suit is deemed frivolous or groundless. The Miller Act is amended to allow suits within ninety days after the last labor or material provision, discouraging frivolous payment bond litigation by awarding court costs, attorneys' fees, and interest to the prevailing party if the suit is deemed frivolous or groundless. Additionally, contracting officers' accountability is enhanced by adding a new subsection to the Miller Act. The contracting officer is responsible for obtaining and ensuring the payment bond remains in effect during the contract administration. If the bond is not in effect due to the officer's negligence, the court may authorize a suit to be brought by the affected party. The court may authorize a person to bring a suit against the United States for the amount they would have sued for under section 2."
