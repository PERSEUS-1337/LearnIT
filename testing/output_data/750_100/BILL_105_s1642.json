    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Federal Financial Assistance Management Improvement Act of 1998\". It includes findings related to financial assistance management. The Congress finds that there are over 600 different Federal financial assistance programs, some of which have duplicative or burdensome administrative requirements, hindering cost-effective service delivery at the local level. State, local, and tribal governments, along with nonprofit organizations, are facing complex problems that require coordinated services. Streamlining and simplification of Federal financial assistance administrative procedures and reporting requirements will improve service delivery to the public. The purposes of this Act are to improve the effectiveness and performance of Federal financial assistance programs, simplify application and reporting requirements, enhance service delivery to the public, and promote greater coordination among service providers. In this Act, the term \"Director\" refers to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, \"Federal agency\" means any agency defined under section 551(1) of title 5, United States Code, and \"Federal financial assistance\" has the same meaning as defined in section 7501(a)(5) of title 31, United States Code. The term \"nonprofit organization\" refers to any organization operated primarily for scientific, educational, service, charitable, or similar purposes in the public interest. A nonprofit organization operates for public interest, not primarily for profit, using proceeds to maintain or expand operations. The term \"State\" includes various entities within the United States and its territories. The term \"tribal government\" refers to an Indian tribe as defined in section 7501(a)(9) of title 31, United States Code. \"Uniform administrative rule\" is a government-wide rule for achieving national policy objectives across multiple Federal financial assistance programs.
