    "content": "The codification of effective dates for claims under laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs is outlined in Section 1. The definitions of 'claimant,' 'claim,' and 'formal claim' under title 38, United States Code, are amended in Section 5100. The term 'informal claim' refers to a written communication requesting a determination of entitlement to benefits under laws administered by the Secretary, submitted in a format other than the prescribed application form. An informal claim is a written request for benefits not on the official form, while a reasonably raised claim is evidence of entitlement not explicitly mentioned in a claim. The text discusses the concept of a claim being logically placed at issue even if not explicitly raised, with a clerical amendment to the table of sections in the chapter. Section 5101(a) of the title is amended to provide claimants with an application form for formal claims upon receipt of an informal claim. Informal requests for claim increase or reopening are treated the same as formal claims. The amendment allows informal requests for claim increase or reopening to be treated as formal claims, with a deadline of 180 days after submission of an informal communication. The amendment allows informal requests for claim increase or reopening to be treated as formal claims, with a deadline of 180 days after submission of an informal communication. If the person fails to file an application within 180 days of receiving necessary forms, the Secretary will consider the application filed when the completed form is submitted. The Secretary is required to address and adjudicate reasonably raised claims, including evidence for separate conditions not part of a formal claim. The amendments made by this Act regarding the treatment of reasonably raised claims will be effective on the date of enactment and apply to claims submitted on or after that date."
