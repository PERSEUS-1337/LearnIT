The Congress finds that asthma affects millions of Americans, including children, and is the most common chronic respiratory disease in children. The prevalence of pediatric asthma has significantly increased over the years. The prevalence of asthma is higher in preschool children, with a 160 percent increase. It is also more common in women than in men, with 5.6 percent of women and 5.1 percent of men affected. Asthma is more prevalent in low-income families, with 79.2 out of 1,000 individuals under 45 in families earning less than $10,000 affected, compared to 53.6 out of 1,000 in families earning $20,000 to $35,000. In 1997, over 5,000 Americans died from asthma attacks. During 1993-1995, African Americans had an average of 38.5 asthma deaths per million individuals, compared to 15.1 deaths for Caucasians. Asthma costs the US over $12 billion annually, with rising prevalence leading to higher future costs. African Americans are five times more likely to seek asthma care in emergency rooms.
