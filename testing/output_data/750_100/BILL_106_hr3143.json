    "content": "The Act titled \"High Performance Schools Act of 1999\" is established for the purpose of improving school performance. The Congress finds that American K-12 schools spend over $6 billion annually on energy costs, more than on books and computers combined. Educators and students perform best in a comfortable, healthy, naturally lit environment. Over half of the nation's K-12 schools are over 40 years old and need renovation for efficiency and comfort, with 6,000 new schools needed. Over the next 10 years, 6,000 new schools will be required to accommodate the growing number of students. Inadequate ventilation, poor lighting, and uncomfortable temperatures in school buildings can affect students' ability to concentrate and excel. Older schools often have inefficient water consumption. A whole building approach is recommended for designing new schools and renovating existing ones to improve efficiency and comfort. Adopting a whole building approach for school construction and renovation projects can lead to high performance buildings with improved student and teacher performance, lower life-cycle costs, and energy conservation benefits. Construction and renovation projects in schools can save energy costs, allowing more funds for teachers and materials. Using renewable energy sources and environmentally friendly products can improve indoor air quality and create healthful school buildings. Congress is considering legislation to assist school districts in building new schools and renovating existing ones to create high-performance, healthful, energy-efficient, and environmentally sound buildings. SEC. 3. PROGRAM ESTABLISHMENT AND ADMINISTRATION. The High Performance Schools Program is established in the Department of Education to provide grants to school districts for energy efficiency performance and program administration. The High Performance Schools Program provides grants to school districts for energy efficiency performance, aiming for a 30 percent increase beyond the 1998 International Energy Conservation Code levels. Eligible districts must demonstrate a need due to growing enrollments or renovation projects, lack adequate funds, and meet specific criteria to receive the grants.

Eligible districts must demonstrate a need due to growing enrollments or renovation projects, lack adequate funds, and meet specific criteria to receive the grants. Grants under subsection (b)(2) shall be used to evaluate compliance by school districts with requirements of this Act and may also be used for distributing information and materials to promote the development of high performance school buildings. The High Performance Schools Program aims to improve energy efficiency in school buildings by providing grants for planning, designing, and monitoring high performance facilities. This includes organizing programs for school board members, district personnel, architects, and engineers to advance the concept of high performance schools. Grants for promoting high performance school building projects include activities like marketing, financing, working with school administrations, students, and communities, and coordinating public benefit programs. Grants are provided to school districts with developed plans in consultation with State offices of energy and education. The State agency designated by the Governor develops feasible plans for grant purposes. School districts are encouraged to supplement grant funds with other sources for plan implementation. The State agency designated by the Governor develops feasible plans for grant purposes, and school districts are encouraged to supplement grant funds with other sources for plan implementation. SEC. 4. ALLOCATION OF FUNDS. Governors of the States will receive funds for implementing the Act, and they will decide which State agency will administer the assistance program to school districts. Funds allocated under section 5 will be divided as follows: 70% for grants under section 3(b)(1), 15% for grants under section 3(b)(2), and 15% for grants under section 3(b)(3). The Secretary of Education may retain up to $300,000 per year to assist State agencies in coordinating and implementing the Program. These funds can be used to develop reference materials for high-performance school buildings. SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\nAuthorized appropriations for grants under section 3(b) are $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2001, $210,000,000 for fiscal year 2002, $220,000,000 for fiscal year 2003, $230,000,000 for fiscal year 2004, and necessary sums for the following 6 fiscal years. The term \"high performance school building\" refers to a school building that maximizes renewable energy use, energy conservation practices, and cost-effectiveness on a life-cycle basis. The term \"renewable energy\" includes solar, wind, geothermal, hydropower, and biomass power."
