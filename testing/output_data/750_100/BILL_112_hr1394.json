    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011\". Congress finds that lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death, with 28% of all cancer deaths attributed to it. In 2010, there were 222,520 new diagnoses and 157,300 deaths from lung cancer. Projections suggest a significant increase in lung cancer incidence by 2030, especially among women and men, as well as minority communities. Lung cancer causes more deaths annually than the next 4 leading causes of cancer deaths combined. The 5-year survival rate for lung cancer is only 15 percent, while breast cancer has a 89 percent survival rate, prostate cancer 99 percent, and colon cancer 65 percent. Despite this, lung cancer receives the least research funding among major cancers. In 2001, the Lung Cancer Progress Review Group of the National Cancer Institute highlighted the lack of funding for lung cancer research compared to other cancers. The group called for the creation of an integrated research program, but no comprehensive plan has been developed. The President's National Cancer Advisory Board Report of 2010 identified radon as the second leading cause of lung cancer after smoking. Lung cancer is the second leading cause of cancer, with radon identified as a significant environmental contaminant. Hormonal and genetic factors may also play a role in its onset. The disease is highly stigmatized, often blamed on patients regardless of smoking history. Around 20% of lung cancer patients have never smoked, and 60% are former smokers who quit years ago. Lung cancer in non-smokers, especially women, is a significant cause of cancer death. It affects various ethnic groups, with a higher impact on African-American males. Military personnel and workers exposed to carcinogens are at risk. Exposure to carcinogens like Agent Orange, silica, arsenic, uranium, beryllium, and battlefield fuel emissions increases the risk of lung cancer. Only 16 percent of lung cancer cases are diagnosed early, with no specific targets for early detection or treatment in health initiatives. Actuarial analysis suggests that early detection of lung cancer could lead to significant savings. The National Cancer Institute study in 2009 showed that early detection of lung cancer could save over 70,000 lives annually in the US. By 2020, the value of life lost to lung cancer is projected to exceed $433 billion, but a 4% annual decline in mortality could cut that in half. In 2010, the National Cancer Institute released initial results from a trial comparing low-dose CT scans to standard methods for lung cancer screening. The study compared low-dose helical CT scans to standard chest x-rays for lung cancer screening and found a 20% reduction in lung cancer deaths among participants screened with CT scans. The Congress emphasizes the need for a national public health priority to reduce lung cancer mortality and calls for a comprehensive program coordinated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. This program aims to address all aspects of lung cancer and reduce mortality among current smokers, former smokers, and non-smokers. Additionally, a new Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Program is added to the Public Health Service Act. The Congress emphasizes the need for a national public health priority to reduce lung cancer mortality and calls for a comprehensive program coordinated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Additionally, a new Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Program is added to the Public Health Service Act under SEC. 399V-6. The Secretary, in consultation with various agencies and experts, must implement a comprehensive program within 180 days of the Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011. The Mortality Reduction Act of 2011 aims to reduce lung cancer mortality by 50% by 2020. The program includes a strategic review of research grants by the National Cancer Institute and funding for the Airway Biology and Disease Branch of the National Heart, Lung. The Mortality Reduction Act of 2011 aims to reduce lung cancer mortality by 50% by 2020. It includes expanding research programs on predispositions to lung cancer, interrelationships with other diseases, and developing screening and treatment innovations. The Mortality Reduction Act of 2011 aims to reduce lung cancer mortality by expanding research programs and providing funds to various institutes for implementing research programs related to lung cancer incidence and health disparities. The Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities collaborates on lung cancer research and outreach programs for minority populations. Funds are provided to the FDA for establishing quality standards in healthcare settings. The bill aims to regulate radiology practices conducting lung cancer screenings, expedite updates in imaging standards, and conduct annual surveys to review compliance and performance. Funding is also allocated to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for establishing a Lung program. The bill aims to regulate radiology practices for lung cancer screenings and provide funding for early detection programs for high-risk populations. The bill includes provisions for early detection programs and requirements for state cancer control plans to address lung cancer mortality. It also mandates the annual review of lung cancer detection methods by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. The Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Program aims to address the burden of lung cancer on women, minorities, rural, and underserved populations through cooperation and coordination of various health programs and tobacco control initiatives within the Department of Health and Human Services. The Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Program focuses on coordinating drug and cessation treatments with early detection protocols. The Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Program coordinates drug and cessation treatments with early detection protocols. Additionally, SEC. 5 addresses the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs will coordinate with the Secretary of Health and Human Services in developing and implementing programs for reducing lung cancer mortality among military personnel and veterans with increased risk due to smoking history and exposure to carcinogens during active duty service. The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs will coordinate with the Secretary of Health and Human Services in developing and implementing programs for reducing lung cancer mortality among military personnel and veterans with increased risk due to smoking history and exposure to carcinogens during active duty service. This includes implementing coordinated care programs for military personnel and veterans diagnosed with lung cancer. Lung cancer screening demonstration project. The Congress supports a national lung cancer screening project to assess public health needs and develop an effective process. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will lead the project in collaboration with other agencies. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, along with other key officials, will establish a Lung Cancer Computed Tomography Screening and Treatment Demonstration Project to identify optimal risk populations. The Lung Cancer Computed Tomography Screening and Treatment Demonstration Project aims to identify optimal risk populations, develop effective screening processes, ensure quality control, and integrate health information technology. The project involves collaboration with National Cancer Institute Centers, Department of Defense Medical Treatment Centers, and sites within the Veterans Affairs Healthcare system. The Secretary will establish quality standards and guidelines for licensing facilities conducting computed tomography screening for lung cancer at various sites including treatment centers, community health centers, and physician offices. The Secretary will establish quality standards and guidelines for facilities conducting computed tomography screening for lung cancer, including the establishment of a quality assurance program to ensure equipment reliability and accuracy. The demonstration project will run for a 5-year period, with a report to Congress due within 180 days of enactment. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress on the projected cost of the demonstration project and provide annual progress reports thereafter. SEC. 7. LUNG CANCER ADVISORY BOARD. The Lung Cancer Advisory Board, established by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, monitors programs under the Act, provides annual reports to Congress, and includes members from various government departments. The Lung Cancer Advisory Board, established by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, includes representatives from various fields appointed by the Secretary, such as clinical medicine, lung cancer research, radiology, drug development, minority health advocacy, veterans service organizations, and occupational medicine. Authorization of appropriations is granted for fiscal years 2012 through 2016 to carry out the Act and its amendments."
