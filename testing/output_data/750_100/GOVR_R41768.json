    "content": "The federal parity law aims to ensure that coverage terms for mental health and substance use disorder services are no more restrictive than those for medical and surgical services. It consists of two laws: the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 and the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008. These laws require certain coverage terms to be equal between mental health services and medical services. The federal parity law ensures that coverage terms for mental health and substance use disorder services are on par with medical and surgical services. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 did not change the specific coverage terms required for parity. Federal parity law only applies to insurers who choose to cover mental health and substance use disorder services for certain plan types. The ACA expands federal parity law to include more plan types such as Qualified Health Plans, individual market plans, and Medicaid benchmark plans. The ACA expands federal parity law to include Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) offered through Exchanges, individual market plans, and Medicaid benchmark plans. QHPs must comply with federal parity law requirements in the same manner as health insurance issuers and group health plans. The ACA expands federal parity law to include Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) offered through Exchanges, individual market plans, and Medicaid benchmark plans. Medicaid may be offered in traditional state plan benefits or benchmark coverage. Medicaid benchmark plans must partially comply with federal parity law. Federal parity law applies to ensure equal treatment limitations and financial requirements for mental health and substance use disorder services compared to medical and surgical services. Small fully insured and self-insured plans are exempt from compliance. Traditional fee-for-service Medicaid and Medicare are also not covered by federal parity law. The federal parity law exemption applies to small employer group health plans and \"groups of one.\" Traditional fee-for-service Medicaid is not covered by federal parity law due to certain coverage structures. Federal parity law does not apply to traditional fee-for-service Medicare, but federal law mandates that copayments for Medicare Part B outpatient mental health services be 20% of the Medicare-approved amount by 2014. The law aims to address disparities in coverage terms between mental health services and medical services. The federal parity law does not require coverage of mental health and substance use disorder services, but mandates parity with medical and surgical services if they are covered. The ACA includes broader changes that require coverage of mental health and substance use disorder services. The ACA requires the establishment of Exchanges where individuals and employers can purchase health insurance. Plans offered in the Exchanges must include a minimum set of benefits known as the Essential Health Benefits Package (EHBP), which includes Essential Health Benefits (EHB) and specified tiers of coverage. The ACA mandates the Essential Health Benefits Package (EHBP) in Exchanges, including Essential Health Benefits (EHB) and specified coverage tiers. The Secretary of HHS defines EHB items/services, with 10 categories required, including mental health/substance use disorder services. EHB benefits must be comparable to those in a typical employer plan. The Department of Labor (DOL) conducted a survey on employer-sponsored coverage and reported the results to the HHS Secretary. The report found that most health plans offer mental health and substance use disorder treatment. The ACA does not specify these services as part of the Essential Health Benefits (EHB), which will be determined through the rulemaking process. The HHS Secretary has discretion to include additional benefits in the Essential Health Benefits (EHB) beyond the 10 categories listed in the statute. In December 2011, HHS released an informational bulletin outlining a proposal for states to define their EHB using benchmark plans. HHS proposes states define Essential Health Benefits (EHB) using benchmark plans, choosing from four options: largest HMO, one of three largest federal employee plans, one of three largest state employee plans, or one of three largest small group plans. Designated plan must have comparable services to a typical employer plan. The HHS Secretary requested the Institute of Medicine to determine Essential Health Benefits (EHB). The IOM released a report on the criteria for EHB, without recommending specific services. ACA mandates plans to offer either the EHBP or EHB, creating coverage for mental health. The ACA mandates plans to offer either the EHBP or EHB, including coverage for mental health and substance use disorder services. This requirement applies to new plans in the individual and small group markets, QHPs, and Medicaid benchmark plans. The ACA mandates coverage of Essential Health Benefits (EHB) including mental health and substance use disorder services for new plans in the individual and small group markets, QHPs, and Medicaid benchmark plans by January 1, 2014. Grandfathered and large group plans outside of the Exchanges are not required to offer EHB. Many plans are now required to cover mental health and substance use disorder services on par with medical and surgical services, leading to voluntary compliance with federal parity law to stay competitive in the private market."
