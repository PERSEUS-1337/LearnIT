    "content": "The Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984 reformed patent and drug laws to balance innovation and competition in the pharmaceutical industry. Congressional focus has shifted to pharmaceutical patent litigation settlements. Pharmaceutical patent litigation involves brand-name companies enforcing patents against generic competitors through federal court litigation, leading to judgments of infringement or invalidity. Settlements may also occur in these cases. In pharmaceutical patent litigation, parties may settle their case with agreements that include cash payments from brand-name drug companies to generic firms in exchange for not challenging patents or selling generic versions of drugs. These settlements, also known as \"pay-for-delay\" agreements, are controversial among observers. Since 2003, Congress has required litigants in pharmaceutical patent settlements to notify federal antitrust authorities. However, Congress has not established substantive standards for assessing the validity of these agreements under antitrust law, leaving it to judicial application of general antitrust principles. The U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Federal Trade Commission v. Actavis, Inc. on June 17, 2013, established that reverse payment settlements should be evaluated under the \"rule of reason\" approach, rather than being presumptively illegal. This decision resolved disagreements among lower courts on the legality of such settlements, leaving them with the complex task of applying the rule of reason. The lower courts must now apply the rule of reason to reverse payment settlements. Legislation in the 113th Congress addresses this issue, with bills like the Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act (S. 214) and the FAIR Generics Act (S. 504) aiming to regulate these settlements. These bills have not yet been enacted. This report discusses innovation and competition policy issues related to pharmaceutical patent litigation settlements. The report discusses pharmaceutical patent litigation settlements, including reverse payment settlements and their status under antitrust laws. It also covers congressional issues and possible alternatives. Inventors must submit applications to the US Patent and Trademark Office for patent protection. USPTO examiners assess the applications for patent eligibility. A patent application must include a detailed description of the invention and at least one claim. Examiners evaluate if the invention meets patentability criteria like novelty and nonobviousness. Novelty requires the invention to not be fully anticipated by prior patents or publications. The \"prior art\" consists of earlier materials that document state-of-the-art knowledge accessible to the public. To meet the nonobviousness standard, an invention must not have been readily achievable by a competent artisan based on the prior art. If granted, a patent allows the owner to exclude others from using the claimed invention for twenty years. The grant of a patent allows inventors exclusivity for twenty years to practice their inventions or license others. This exclusivity enables inventors to recoup their investment by charging higher prices. Patent owners must monitor competitors to prevent unauthorized use of their invention. Patent owners must often litigate to enforce their intellectual property rights. While a patent grants exclusivity, FDA approval is required to distribute pharmaceutical products. Developers must demonstrate safety and effectiveness through preclinical and clinical investigations for FDA marketing approval. Prior to the Hatch-Waxman Act, generic drug manufacturers had to file their own New Drug Application (NDA) to sell their products, even if the drug had already been approved by the FDA. Some manufacturers could submit a \"paper NDA\" based on published scientific literature to demonstrate safety and efficacy. Some generic manufacturers had to prove the safety and efficacy of their drugs again, even though they were chemically identical to approved pharmaceuticals. This process was seen as costly, duplicative, and time-consuming by some commentators. The Hatch-Waxman Act addressed concerns about costly and time-consuming processes for generic drug approval by creating an expedited pathway called an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA). The Hatch-Waxman Act created an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) pathway for generic drugs to obtain marketing approval by demonstrating bioequivalence to pioneer drugs, allowing them to avoid costs and delays associated with a full NDA. This also allows generic manufacturers to market their FDA-approved bioequivalent drugs once relevant patents expire. The Hatch-Waxman Act provides a means for patent proprietors to restore lost patent term due to FDA approval delays, with a maximum extension period of five years. This extension compensates brand-name firms for the costs of generating pre-clinical and clinical data. The Hatch-Waxman Act established procedures for resolving patent disputes related to generic drug approval. Brand-name pharmaceutical firms may hold patents that could be infringed by generic drugs, leading to special procedures for resolving such disputes. The Hatch-Waxman Act established procedures for resolving patent disputes related to generic drug approval. Brand-name pharmaceutical firms may hold patents that could be infringed by generic drugs, leading to special procedures for resolving such disputes. The FDA lists these patents in the \"Orange Book,\" and generic drug manufacturers must engage in a certification procedure regarding these patents. An ANDA applicant must address each Orange Book-listed patent associated with the drug they seek to market. The Hatch-Waxman Act established procedures for resolving patent disputes related to generic drug approval. Generic drug manufacturers must engage in a certification procedure regarding patents listed in the \"Orange Book\" by the FDA. Certifications include paragraph I, II, III, and IV, indicating patent information, expiration, agreement not to market, or patent invalidity. Approval for ANDAs certified under paragraphs I or II is immediate, while paragraph III requires waiting for approval. The Hatch-Waxman Act incentivizes generic drug manufacturers to challenge pharmaceutical patents by offering a 180-day exclusivity period as a reward. This period is granted after filing an ANDA with a paragraph IV certification, which may lead to patent infringement litigation by the brand-name drug owner. The Hatch-Waxman Act offers a 180-day exclusivity period to the first generic drug applicant filing a paragraph IV certification, preventing subsequent applicants from marketing approval for the same drug product. This exclusivity can lead to higher profits for the first applicant, encouraging patent challenges. The Hatch-Waxman Act provides a 180-day generic exclusivity period for the first paragraph IV ANDA applicant. However, forfeiture events, such as failure to market promptly or obtain FDA approval in a timely manner, can result in the loss of this exclusivity. The goal is to prevent the practice of 'parking' exclusivity periods. The Hatch-Waxman Act's 180-day generic exclusivity period aims to prevent 'parking' of exclusivity periods. If a generic firm's paragraph IV ANDA results in a patent infringement suit, an injunction may prevent them from marketing the product until the NDA holder's patents expire. Independent generic drug companies often amend their ANDAs in response to patent litigation. Independent generic drug companies commonly amend their ANDAs in response to patent litigation, replacing paragraph IV certifications with paragraph III certifications. The courts may rule in favor of the generic firm by determining that their proposed product does not infringe patents or that the patents are invalid. Once the FDA approves their ANDA, the generic firm can launch their product. Another possible resolution in pharmaceutical patent litigation is the issuance of final judgment in favor of either the brand-name drug company or the generic firm. Reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent litigation involve generic firms being sued for patent infringement after filing a paragraph IV ANDA. The settlement often includes the generic firm agreeing not to challenge the patent or produce a generic version of the drug in exchange for monetary compensation from the NDA holder. Opinions on the impact of these settlements on social welfare vary. Some commentators believe reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent litigation are anticompetitive, involving firms colluding to restrict output and share profits. These settlements also prevent patent invalidity challenges, limiting generic competition. Others see no issue, citing a judicial policy favoring settlements to avoid expenses. Settlements in litigation are favored to avoid expenses and achieve timely resolutions, benefiting both parties. Judge Posner explains that settlements involve an exchange of benefits and obligations, with the defendant receiving compensation. Reverse payment settlements in patent disputes have raised concerns about potential anticompetitive effects. These agreements may allow for generic competition before the patent expires, benefiting consumers compared to a judgment upholding the patent. The Hatch-Waxman Act may promote the use of reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent litigation by altering the traditional balance in patent disputes. This Act establishes dispute settlement procedures that could lead accused infringers to compensate patent proprietors to avoid the risk of an infringement finding and potential injunction. Some observers argue that the Hatch-Waxman Act shifts the risk balance between patent holders and generic manufacturers. The Act allows generic manufacturers to challenge patent validity without facing the risk of infringement damages, while patent holders have no corresponding upside. Some commentators believe that the unique procedures of the Hatch-Waxman Act have led to reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent litigation. Congressional action on these settlements has been limited, with the 2003 Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act requiring the DOJ and FTC to receive copies of certain patent settlement agreements in the pharmaceutical field. The 2003 Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act mandates the filing of patent settlement agreements in the pharmaceutical field executed on or after January 7, 2004. These agreements trigger notification requirements if they pertain to the manufacture, marketing, or sale of brand-name or generic drugs, or the 180-day generic exclusivity period. The Medicare Prescription Drug Act requires filing of patent settlement agreements in the pharmaceutical field. Certain agreements, such as purchase orders or employment contracts, are exempt from this requirement. The FTC reported 140 final resolutions of patent disputes in FY2012, with 40 settlements possibly involving pay-for-delay payments. The MMA imposed a filing obligation on certain patent settlements but did not specify the details. The legislation did not establish standards for the validity of patent settlements between pharmaceutical firms. Various parties claimed that some settlements violated antitrust laws, leading to different court rulings based on antitrust principles. This report discusses judicial opinions on reverse payment settlements after introducing antitrust law concepts. The antitrust laws, including the Sherman Act and Clayton Act, address anti-competitive behavior like reverse payment settlements. Section 1 of the Sherman Act prohibits contracts or conspiracies that restrain trade. For more detailed information, interested readers can refer to other sources. The courts interpret language in antitrust laws regarding restraints of trade as applying only to unreasonable restraints. The determination of unreasonable restraint is done under the \"rule of reason,\" where factors like business information and competition impact are considered. This approach requires courts to balance reasonableness in their judgment. The rule of reason in antitrust laws requires courts to balance the anticompetitive consequences of a practice against its business justifications. Per se illegality applies to restraints that are conclusively presumed to be unreasonable and illegal without further inquiry. Per se violations in antitrust laws are practices that are deemed illegal without detailed inquiry into their harm or business justifications. Examples include price fixing, group boycotts, and market division. Courts may also use a \"quick look\" approach between per se illegality and the rule of reason, where defendants must show pro-competitive justifications for their actions. Reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent litigation are subject to strict antitrust scrutiny, with some courts deeming them per se invalid. For example, the Sixth Circuit held that an agreement between Hoescht Marion Roussel Inc. and Andrx Pharmaceuticals was per se invalid. The Sixth Circuit deemed the HMR-Andrx agreement as a horizontal agreement, a restraint of trade at the same competition level, violating antitrust laws. However, other Courts of Appeals ruled that reverse payment settlements were permissible as long as they did not exceed the patent scope, citing the Valley Drug Co. v. Geneva Pharmaceuticals, Inc. case. The Valley Drug Co. v. Geneva Pharmaceuticals, Inc. case involved agreements Abbott Laboratories made with generic firms, deemed per se illegal by the district court under the Sherman Act. The Eleventh Circuit reversed, remanding for scrutiny of any agreement parts beyond patent protection. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit rejected the \"scope of the patent\" approach for reverse payment settlements in the K-Dur Antitrust Litigation case on July 16, 2012. The Third Circuit rejected the \"scope of the patent\" approach for reverse payment settlements in the K-Dur Antitrust Litigation case, stating that it improperly restricts antitrust law and goes against the policies of the Hatch-Waxman Act and Supreme Court precedent on patent litigation and competition. The court emphasized that the presumption of validity for granted patents is procedural, not a substantive right, and should not outweigh congressional goals of the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Third Circuit rejected the \"scope of the patent\" approach for reverse payment settlements in the K-Dur Antitrust Litigation case, adopting a \"quick rule of reason\" test that presumed reverse payments were anticompetitive. Parties could rebut this presumption by showing payments were for a different purpose or had pro-competitive benefits. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case of Federal Trade Commission v. Actavis, Inc regarding reverse payment settlements in the pharmaceutical industry. The Court held that these settlements should be evaluated under the \"rule of reason\" approach, rather than being presumptively illegal. Solvay Pharmaceuticals, the NDA holder of ANDROGEL\u00ae, brought charges of patent infringement against generic firms Actavis and Paddock Laboratories under the Hatch-Waxman Act, leading to a settlement in the case. The parties settled the case under the Hatch-Waxman Act, with generic firms receiving money to delay marketing their products until 2015. The FTC accused them of sharing profits and avoiding competition for nine years, but the courts rejected the claims. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed the settlement under the \"scope of the patent\" standard, stating that reverse payment settlements are immune from antitrust attack unless there is sham litigation or fraud. The Supreme Court later reversed this decision in a 5-3 ruling, finding that the anticompetitive effects of the agreement fell within the scope of the patent but did not immunize it from scrutiny. The Supreme Court ruled that while the agreement fell within the scope of the patent, it was not immune from antitrust scrutiny. This is because litigation under the Hatch-Waxman Act involves challenges to patent validity or noninfringement, which can impact competition if the generic firm succeeds. Justice Breyer argued that determining antitrust legality based on the settlement's outcome would be inconsistent. The Supreme Court ruled that patent-related settlements cannot be immune from antitrust scrutiny. Antitrust legality should be determined by considering traditional antitrust factors, not just patent law policy. The Supreme Court ruled that antitrust factors, including market power and legal considerations like patents, must be considered in patent-related settlements. The Hatch-Waxman Act's provisions support subjecting reverse payment settlements to antitrust scrutiny, despite the policy favoring dispute settlement. Justice Breyer outlined five reasons for this stance. The Supreme Court ruled that antitrust factors must be considered in patent-related settlements. Justice Breyer outlined five reasons why reverse payments should be subject to antitrust scrutiny, outweighing the policy favoring dispute settlement. The Supreme Court ruled that antitrust factors must be considered in patent-related settlements, with Justice Breyer outlining reasons why reverse payments should be subject to antitrust scrutiny, outweighing the policy favoring dispute settlement. The majority declined to adopt a presumptively unlawful approach for reverse payment settlements, stating it should only be applied where there is clear evidence of anticompetitive effects. The Supreme Court ruled that reverse payment settlements in patent-related cases must be analyzed for antitrust implications. The Court determined that antitrust liability should be established using the traditional rule of reason analysis, rather than a presumptively unlawful approach. Chief Justice Roberts, along with Justices Scalia and Thomas, dissented, arguing that antitrust law should only be violated if the settlement exceeds the scope of the patent. The Supreme Court's ruling on reverse payment settlements in patent cases requires analysis for antitrust implications. Antitrust law is violated if the settlement exceeds the patent scope, obtained by fraud, or involves sham litigation. Dissenters worry this may deter generic firms from challenging patents, weaken innovator protection, and hinder settlement of patent disputes. The Actavis decision doesn't bar pharmaceutical firms from settling under the Hatch-Waxman Act, but agreements must be carefully structured and explained to avoid litigation. The Supreme Court's ruling on reverse payment settlements in patent cases requires analysis for antitrust implications. Justice Breyer believes Hatch-Waxman antitrust cases won't always involve detailed patent examination, but Chief Justice expresses concern over patent validity and infringement being central to antitrust disputes. Congress has various options to consider in this landscape. One option for Congress is to await further judicial developments on reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent litigation. Another option is to regulate these settlements through proposed bills in the 113th Congress, such as the Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act, S. 27. The bill S. 27 aims to regulate reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent litigation by presuming them to have anticompetitive effects unless proven otherwise with clear evidence of procompetitive benefits. It includes factors for courts to consider in such cases. The Fair and Immediate Release of Generics Act, S. 504, proposes changes to the Hatch-Waxman Act to discourage reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent litigation. It grants generic firms rights to regulatory exclusivity and obligates them to adhere to settlement agreements with brand-name firms. Brand-name firms would be required to enforce their patents under the legislation. The Hatch-Waxman Act requires brand-name firms to enforce their patents within 45 days of a patent challenge by a generic firm. Pharmaceutical patent litigation settlement is crucial for public health, balancing the development of new medicines by brand-name companies and increasing access through generic firms. The Act mediates disputes between these rivals to meet the demands of the patient population. Pharmaceutical patent litigation settlements, when in line with antitrust principles, can promote medical innovation and benefit consumers by balancing the interests of brand-name and generic firms."
