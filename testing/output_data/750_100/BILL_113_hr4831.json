    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Twenty-First Century Manufacturing Skills and Jobs Act of 2014\". It includes provisions for federal matching payments for state new manufacturing jobs training tax credits. The Secretary of the Treasury will make quarterly payments to eligible community colleges based on new manufacturing job withholding matches for trainees. The withholding match is determined by amounts remitted by participating manufacturing employers. For this section, an eligible community college is defined as a public institution of higher education that primarily awards 2-year associate's degrees accepted for credit towards a bachelor's degree. The college must be located in a state with a manufacturing job training tax credit program and actively participate in the program. The State new manufacturing jobs training tax credit program is established by a State government for eligible community colleges and manufacturing employers to sign a contract meeting specific requirements for eligible trainees. This program allows the employer to withhold State income taxes. The State income taxes withheld by the employer on behalf of eligible trainees will be remitted to the community college for education provided, as part of the State new manufacturing jobs training tax credit program. The State income taxes withheld by the employer for eligible trainees will be treated as payment of income taxes owed by the trainee. A qualified contract is between an eligible community college and a manufacturing employer with job sites in the State. The contract under the State program requires the eligible community college to provide qualified training to individuals designated by the employer without charging tuition or fees. The employer will hire these individuals. The employer will hire individuals for full-time employment at a job site in the State, paying them a wage of at least 175 percent of the Federal minimum wage or the amount specified by the State program. The employer will also remit State income taxes as per the program. The employer will remit State income taxes withheld on behalf of the individual to the community college for training, not exceeding the specified cost of qualified training. The contract must specify the total cost of training provided, including equipment and materials. Qualified training refers to education or training that equips an individual with the necessary skills for a job or to obtain required licenses. The cost and terms must be reasonable by market standards. Qualified training includes obtaining necessary skills or licenses for a job through a certificate aligned with industry standards or governmental regulations. The job must be new for a State program to qualify for new manufacturing jobs training tax incentives. The new manufacturing jobs training tax credit program requires eligible trainees to be hired for new jobs, not for recalled, replacement, or existing positions within the employer's workforce. The new job must not have existed in the employer's business within the 1-year period before the date of hire, must not be from a closed or reduced business operation, and should result in a net increase in employment for the employer. Only U.S. employees are considered for this requirement. Only U.S. employees at job sites in the United States are considered for the requirement. All persons treated as a single employer under specific sections of the Internal Revenue Code are treated as a single employer for this purpose. Employers and eligible community colleges must cooperate with local workforce investment boards. Employers and eligible community colleges participating in a State new manufacturing jobs training tax credit program can collaborate with local workforce investment boards to recruit and train eligible trainees. Eligible trainees are individuals who have received qualified training through an eligible community college under the program. The manufacturing jobs training tax credit program applies to individuals employed full-time by an employer in the same state as the eligible community college, meeting wage and job requirements, and requiring qualified training. The manufacturing jobs training tax credit program applies to eligible manufacturing employers who employ individuals in manufacturing facilities located in the United States, with the primary business classified in sector 31, 32, or 33 of the North American Industrial Classification System. The manufacturing jobs training tax credit program allows eligible manufacturing employers to remit withheld State income tax to a community college for employee training. This remitted amount is not considered as a payment by the employer for tax credits or deductions under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The manufacturing jobs training tax credit program allows eligible manufacturing employers to remit withheld State income tax to a community college for employee training.
