    "content": "Countervailing duty laws aim to help domestic industries facing injury from subsidized imports by imposing additional import duties equal to the estimated subsidy amount. Relief requires the International Trade Commission to confirm industry injury and the International Trade Administration to verify the subsidized imports. The ITA found that targeted imports were subsidized, leading to a change in policy towards China in a 2007 CVD investigation on coated free sheet paper. Despite previously considering China a nonmarket economy, the ITA identified subsidies in China due to market principles in certain industries. The ITA reaffirmed China as a nonmarket economy in a 2007 subsidy decision specific to China. NME countries are designated based on market principles and currency convertibility. Wage rates in NME countries do not reflect fair value. The ITA designates NME countries based on market principles and currency convertibility. NME countries include Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, China, Georgia, Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. The ITA decided not to apply CVD action to NME countries in 1983-1984. The ITA designated NME countries based on market principles and currency convertibility, including China since 1983. The US conducted countervailing investigations on carbon steel wire rod from Czechoslovakia and Poland, and potassium chloride from East Germany and the Soviet Union. China, the US's second largest trading partner, has a significant trade deficit and alleged adverse impact on US industries and workers. The alleged adverse impact of Chinese imports on U.S. industries and workers has led to calls for increased use of U.S. trade remedy laws against Chinese products. Concerns include China's use of \"illegal\" subsidy programs to boost its industries and exports. China is the main target of U.S. antidumping actions, with over 80 duty orders in place as of August 12, 2010. The ITA calculates higher AD duty amounts for Chinese imports, leading to concerns about China's undervalued currency affecting the U.S. trade deficit and manufacturing sectors like apparel and furniture. The U.S. faces competition from China in manufacturing sectors like apparel and furniture due to lower cost goods. Congressional interest in countervailing action against Chinese imports is fueled by alleged currency manipulation. Legislation on currency misalignment is being discussed. The ITA determined in 1983 that China was selling Greige Polyester Cotton Print Cloth at less than fair value. This determination was reaffirmed in 2006 in the context of an investigation on lined paper. U.S. law considers China a nonmarket economy country until revoked by the ITA. Subsidies were not found in NME countries, leading to no countervailing action against China since 1991. The NME designation for China can only be used for a limited time, as specified in its WTO accession package. After December 11, 2016, the US and other WTO members cannot use nonmarket economy methodology in CVD or AD investigations. The United States used a country-based methodology for price comparability in CVD or AD investigations in the 1983-1984 period. Two countervailing duty laws were in force at that time, both requiring determination of subsidization amount on dutiable products from the country of origin. One law also needed proof of injury to a U.S. industry from subsidized imports. The earlier countervailing duty law, Section 303 of the Tariff Act of 1930, was repealed in January 1995. It applied to products from countries not \"under the Agreement,\" which included countries subject to GATT Subsidies and Countervailing Code or with similar obligations to the US. Section 303 of the Tariff Act of 1930, which provided for countervailing duties without injury determination, was repealed in 1995 by the Uruguay Round Agreements Act. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 added comprehensive provisions for countervailing legislation with broader country applicability. Subtitle A of Title VII to the Tariff Act of 1930 implemented the international Subsidies and Countervailing Code from the GATT meeting in 1979. This legislation requires a determination of subsidy and injury to U.S. industries for countervailing duty assessment on imported merchandise. The URAA amended the countervailing duty law of the 1979 Act by incorporating provisions comparable to section 303, which do not require injury determination in countervailing investigations of subsidized imports from countries other than \"Subsidies Agreement countries.\" The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 is still in effect, with countervailing duty investigations initiated for carbon steel wire rod imports from Czechoslovakia and Poland in 1983. Allegations were made regarding public benefits received by manufacturers in both countries. Both Czechoslovakia and Poland received public benefits through multiple exchange rate systems and other programs for exporting firms. The determinations on common issues were mostly identical with minor country-specific differences. Page references in this report will focus on the Czechoslovak case. The ITA found Czechoslovakia and Poland to be \"countries not under the Agreement\" and conducted countervailing procedures without determining injury. Both countries were considered nonmarket economy (NME) countries, but the question of whether the countervailing duty law applies to NME countries had not been resolved. The countervailing duty law applies to nonmarket economy countries, as confirmed in preliminary determinations for carbon steel wire rod cases. The ITA found that NME countries are not exempt from the law based on statutory terms and legislative history. The ITA, in its first opportunity, determined that nonmarket economy countries are not excluded from the countervailing duty law without further review. Prices were the focus in analyzing subsidization. The ITA highlighted that in nonmarket economies, central planners set prices without considering economic value, leading to prices not reflecting scarcity or abundance. This results in scarce goods not increasing in price unless mandated by central planners. The ITA then analyzed alleged subsidization programs in detail. The ITA analyzed alleged subsidization programs, including multiple exchange rates, currency retention schemes, trade conversion coefficients, and price equalization payments. They concluded that these programs did not confer a subsidy in market or nonmarket economies. The Polish adjustment coefficient program was also deemed not to constitute a bounty or grant. However, insufficient information was available to make a determination on the Czechoslovak tax exemption program. The ITA preliminarily determined that the Czechoslovak and Polish practices did not provide bounties or grants under the CVD law. The investigations continued into the final phase, focusing on the application of the CVD law to nonmarket economy countries. In the final determinations of the carbon steel wire rod cases, the ITA concluded that Congress never directly addressed this issue. The ITA found that Congress never directly addressed the application of the countervailing duty law to nonmarket economy countries in the carbon steel wire rod cases. The ITA highlighted Congress's enactment of remedial provisions in the Trade Act of 1974 specifically addressing injurious imports from \"State-controlled-economy\" or \"Communist\" countries in the context of antidumping and market disruption, but not for countervailing action. Congress recognized the need for special legislation for State-controlled-economy countries due to the inadequacy of traditional trade remedies. The Trade Act of 1974 addressed injurious imports from State-controlled-economy countries, but not for countervailing action. The need for special legislation for these countries was recognized due to the inadequacy of traditional trade remedies. The CVD law was restructured by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979, with no mention of its application to NME countries. The Trade Act of 1974 addressed injurious imports from State-controlled-economy countries, but not for countervailing action. The CVD law was restructured by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979, with no mention of its application to NME countries. Agreement on Tariffs and Trade permits regulation of unfairly priced imports from NME countries under antidumping or countervailing duty legislation. The ITA concluded that it is difficult to identify and quantify subsidies in NMEs due to the lack of market reference points. The countervailing duty law does not apply easily to nonmarket economy countries like Czechoslovakia and Poland, as it is challenging to measure subsidies in such systems. The ITA determined that identifying a \"bounty or grant\" in an NME is not feasible, leading to uncertainty in determining subsidization levels. The ITA found that manufacturers in Czechoslovakia and Poland did not receive bounties or grants, leading to final negative countervailing duty determinations. Two U.S. chemical manufacturers filed petitions alleging subsidization of potassium chloride imported from the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union, initiating investigations in April 1984. The ITA rescinded potassium chloride investigations with Czechoslovakia and Poland as NMEs in 1984. No countervailing investigations of subsidized imports from NME countries were initiated since then, except for one specialized case in 1991. The ITA initiated a countervailing duty investigation of Ceiling and Oscillating Fans Imported from China in 1991, based on a petition claiming that the PRC fan sector operates substantially pursuant to market principles. The ITA initiated a countervailing duty investigation of Ceiling and Oscillating Fans Imported from China in 1991, based on a petition claiming that the Chinese fan industry is sufficiently market-oriented to use industry-provided economic data in determining fair market value. The ITA concluded in its preliminary investigation that the industry cannot be considered a market-oriented industry due to non-market-determined input prices. The ITA concluded that the PC fans industry is not an MOI, leading to a final negative determination in the case. Petitioners challenged the ITA's actions in the U.S. Court of International Trade. The U.S. Court of International Trade consolidated cases challenging governmental subsidies in nonmarket economies. It reversed carbon steel wire rod cases, remanded them to the ITA, and ordered potash case investigations to resume. The CIT addressed ITA's grounds for determinations. The U.S. Court of International Trade reversed carbon steel wire rod cases and ordered potash case investigations to resume. The court addressed the ITA's grounds for determinations regarding the nonapplicability of countervailing procedure to NME countries. The CIT held that the ITA had made a basic error in interpreting and administering the CVD law. The U.S. Court of International Trade reversed carbon steel wire rod cases and ordered potash case investigations to resume. The CIT found that the ITA erred in interpreting the CVD law by excluding subsidies in nonmarket economies. The court emphasized that the CVD law applies to all countries without exemptions, criticizing the ITA for creating exemptions for nonmarket economies. The U.S. Court of International Trade criticized the ITA for excluding subsidies in nonmarket economies, stating that the CVD law applies to all countries without exemptions. The court emphasized that the ITA's interpretation created illogical exemptions for nonmarket economies, contradicting the meaning of the CVD statute. The difficulties with the CVD law were seen as issues of measurement, which the agency was capable of addressing. The U.S. Court of International Trade criticized the ITA for excluding subsidies in nonmarket economies, stating that the CVD law applies to all countries without exemptions. The court emphasized that the ITA's interpretation created illogical exemptions for nonmarket economies, contradicting the meaning of the CVD statute. The difficulties with the CVD law were seen as issues of measurement, which the agency was capable of addressing. The court also highlighted the importance of detecting patterns of regularity and investigating deviations from those patterns in the economy, regardless of its form. The U.S. Court of International Trade criticized the ITA for excluding subsidies in nonmarket economies, stating that the CVD law applies to all countries without exemptions. The court dismissed the ITA's reliance on economic academia's views and emphasized the importance of detecting patterns in the economy. The U.S. Court of International Trade criticized the exclusion of subsidies in nonmarket economies by the ITA, stating that the CVD law applies to all countries without exemptions. The court implicitly challenged administrative actions that were contrary to law and attempted to amend the countervailing law through administrative fiat. The U.S. government appealed the CIT decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which reviewed the legislative history and development of relevant trade remedy laws, concluding that the CVD statute had remained substantially unchanged since its inception. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reviewed the CVD statute, which had remained unchanged since its inception in 1897. The court could not determine if the statute applied to nonmarket economies due to undefined terms, as there were no nonmarket economies when the law was originally enacted. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reviewed the CVD statute, which had remained unchanged since its inception in 1897. The court had to determine if the statute would have applied to nonmarket economies if they had existed at the time. In the potash case, the court concluded that the economic incentives provided by the Soviet Union and East Germany did not constitute bounties or grants under the CVD law. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reviewed the CVD statute, which had remained unchanged since its inception in 1897. In the potash case, the court concluded that the benefits provided by the Soviet Union and East Germany for potash exports to the U.S. were not considered bounties or grants under the law. The Court of Appeals vacated the CIT order that reversed the ITA's final CVD determinations in two wire rod cases. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reviewed CVD determinations in wire rod and potash cases, remanding them to the CIT for lack of jurisdiction. This decision sparked a reaction in Congress, leading to the introduction of H.R. 3 in the 100th Congress for the application of countervailing duty law to nonmarket economy countries. The proposed statute in H.R. 3 aimed to apply countervailing duty law to nonmarket economy countries, with detailed procedural provisions and injury determination by the U.S. International Trade Commission. Companion bills S. 770 and H.R. 1687 were also introduced for the same purpose. In March 1987, bills S. 770 and H.R. 1687 were introduced to apply countervailing duty provisions to imports from state-controlled economy countries. This issue was revisited in the 103rd and 104th Congresses, with S. 90 in the 103rd Congress expanding the definition of \"countervailable subsidy\" to include nonmarket economy countries. In the 106th through 108th Congresses, bills were introduced to apply countervailing duty laws to non-market economy (NME) countries for investigations of subsidies provided after the enactment date. Similar bills in the 108th Congress applied to investigations filed after the enactment date. In the 109th Congress, bills were introduced to apply countervailing duty laws to subsidized imports from non-market economy (NME) countries, based on petitions filed after the enactment of the legislation. This provision was included in broader trade-remedial legislation introduced on July 14, 2005. H.R. 3306 (\"Fair Trade with China Act of 2005\") and S. 1421 focused on countervailing duty laws for subsidized imports from non-market economy countries, including China. The legislation applied to CVD petitions filed after enactment, without affecting NME status under antidumping provisions. Several bills in the 110th Congress aimed to apply countervailing duty law to non-market economy (NME) countries, including China. These bills sought to address alleged foreign exchange-rate manipulation by China, defining it as a countervailable subsidy. Some of the bills introduced were S. 364, H.R. 571, H.R. 708, H.R. 782, H.R. 2942, and S. 796. In the 110th Congress, bills were introduced to apply countervailing duties to non-market economies like China, addressing foreign exchange-rate manipulation. Bills included H.R. 1229 and S. 974, as well as S. 1919. In the 111th Congress, H.R. 496 and H.R. 499 aimed to apply countervailing duties specifically to nonmarket economies. The bills introduced in the 110th and 111th Congress aimed to apply countervailing duties to non-market economies like China, regardless of ownership or economic reforms. The administering authority is not required to consider the effect of the subsidy in determining its existence. The bills would also prevent the ITA from considering market economy treatment for individual businesses in AD proceedings. The bills introduced in the 110th and 111th Congress aimed to apply countervailing duties to non-market economies like China, regardless of ownership or economic reforms. The bills would also provide a China-specific alternate methodology for determining subsidy amounts, considering the unique conditions prevailing in China. Authorities may adjust terms and conditions prevailing in China for subsidy calculations, but if not feasible, they can use conditions outside of China. If China is deemed a non-market economy, authorities should presume difficulties in considering Chinese terms and conditions and use external data for calculations. The bills propose using surrogate market economy data for subsidy calculations and require a joint resolution of Congress to revoke a country's NME status. The Bush Administration took steps to address China's alleged export subsidies, including initiating a CVD investigation on a Chinese product. The ITA initiated a CVD investigation on a product from China and consultations were initiated in the WTO on China's subsidy regime. On November 27, 2006, the ITA announced a CVD investigation on CFS paper against China. The ITC preliminarily determined on December 15, 2006, that a U.S. domestic industry is materially injured by subsidized coated paper from China. The ITA announced an affirmative preliminary determination of subsidy in the CVD investigation on coated free sheet (CFS) paper from China, with net countervailable subsidy rates ranging from 10.9% to 20.35%. Final determination revealed countervailable subsidies provided to producers and exporters, with subsidy amounts ranging from 7.40% to 44.25%. The ITA found that China's economy, while undergoing reforms, still maintains a significant state role. Despite reaffirming China as an NME country, the agency noted differences from Soviet-style economies, where central planners set prices and cover losses for enterprises. State control extends to investment decisions, money, and credit allocation. The ITA found that China's economy still maintains a significant state role, but market forces determine prices for over 90% of products, wages are negotiated, foreign currency is more accessible, and private ownership rights are acknowledged by the government. The current PRC government has shrunk the state's role in some areas while preserving it in others. The ITA concluded that China's economy allows for determining benefits to Chinese producers, despite being an NME country. The ITC made a negative determination of injury in investigations on CFS paper due to modest production capacity increases in China and Indonesia, no potential for product shifting, and lack of evidence. Based on the lack of evidence of significant price effects, moderate inventories, and absence of negative effects on the domestic industry, it is concluded that the domestic CFSP industry is not threatened by imports from China and Indonesia. The investigation into imports from China and Indonesia concluded that the domestic industry is not threatened, leading to the termination of the investigation and refunding of duties. The ITA was able to measure subsidies in China, although no CV duties were imposed. Subsequent investigations resulted in the first CVD order on products from an NME country since 1983. The first CVD order on products from an NME country since 1983 was placed on 13 products from China, with 8 investigations pending. China filed suit to prevent the ITA from continuing the CVD investigation, but the Court ruled it did not have jurisdiction due to no final determination being made. The Court did not rule on whether the ITA has the legal authority to apply countervailing duty law to NMEs, but stated that Commerce is not prohibited from doing so. China requested WTO dispute settlement consultations with the United States regarding preliminary antidumping and countervailing duty determinations on CFS paper. No further action has been taken in the dispute. China has initiated anti-dumping investigations against products from the United States and other countries since joining the WTO. In 2009, China started its first countervailing duty (CVD) case. By March 2010, China had 3 ongoing CVD investigations, all involving U.S. products. The U.S. requested WTO dispute settlement consultations with China over what they deemed as illegal subsidies. China agreed to terminate one of the challenged subsidy programs in March 2007. China's central bank implemented a regulation allowing large exporters to access discounted loans not available to other companies. The United States raised concerns about Chinese tax laws and measures providing tax refunds or exemptions to businesses purchasing domestically produced goods. These subsidies were seen as distorting trade conditions for U.S. manufacturers and small to medium-sized enterprises across various industries. On November 29, 2007, USTR Schwab announced that China had agreed to terminate all subsidies that the United States alleged were illegal under WTO rules by January 1, 2008. China signed separate Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) with the United States and Mexico promising to permanently eliminate the WTO-prohibited subsidies. In the 2010 National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers, the USTR reported that China had eliminated the subsidies, as agreed. On December 19, 2008, the United States requested consultations with China regarding certain measures offering grants, loans, and incentives to Chinese enterprises based on export performance criteria. A settlement agreement was reached in December 2009, confirming China's elimination of challenged export-contingent benefits. Despite the ITA's identification of subsidies in China, some in Congress planned legislation to combat unfair trade practices. Congress may want to consider legislation ensuring that the CVD laws and actions specifically apply to other NME countries as well as China, to combat unfair trade practices. Legislation may need to be considered to extend CVD laws to other NME countries like Vietnam. Trade with other NME countries is not significant currently, with no outstanding AD orders or disputes. There are no specific methodologies provided for identifying subsidies in nonmarket economies. The antidumping statute provides a methodology for determining normal value in nonmarket economy (NME) countries, including using inputs and factors of production from a market economy country. Countervailing duties (CVD) procedures have trade-offs for U.S. industries, as AD duties tend to be higher than CVD duties, especially for imports from NME countries like China. The antidumping statute provides a methodology for determining normal value in nonmarket economy (NME) countries, including using inputs and factors of production from a market economy country. If China retains its NME status and subsidies are found on targeted merchandise, some companion AD duties may need to be revised downward to avoid double counting. This introduces uncertainty about the total level of protection applied to Chinese products, potentially resulting in lower combined rates than expected. A determination by ITA that it can target subsidies in China could lead to unintended consequences, potentially reducing overall protection. However, different remedies for price manipulation may allow some U.S. industries to obtain relief through CVD procedures."
