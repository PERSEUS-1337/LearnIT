    "content": "Since Burma's military junta transferred power to a quasi-civilian government in 2011, Congress has mostly deferred to the White House and relevant departments on U.S. policy towards Burma. The Obama Administration has primarily used executive authority or existing legislation for policy adjustments, with some consultation with congressional committees. The Obama Administration has consulted with congressional committees and key Members of Congress on changes in U.S. policy towards Burma. Additional changes may require direct congressional action. Congress may reassess the situation in Burma and resume a more active role in determining U.S. policy. The State Department announced a new approach to U.S. relations with Burma on September 28, 2009. On September 28, 2009, the State Department announced a change in U.S. policy towards Burma. The existing sanctions regime would remain, but new elements were added, including direct dialogue with Burma's ruling military junta and cooperation on international security issues. The Obama policy aimed to promote democracy and human rights in Burma while pursuing goals of previous administrations. The Obama Administration's policy towards Burma aimed to support a unified, peaceful, prosperous, and democratic Burma that respects human rights. Key goals included releasing political prisoners, ending conflicts with ethnic minorities, and initiating political dialogue with opposition leaders. Additionally, Burma was urged to sever ties with North Korea and abandon its alleged nuclear weapons program. The Obama Administration's policy towards Burma aimed to support a unified, peaceful, prosperous, and democratic Burma that respects human rights. The SPDC called for and held parliamentary elections in November 2010, the first in 20 years, and released opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest. Despite the elections not meeting international standards, the SPDC respected the results and transferred power on March 30, 2011. Since the parliamentary elections in November 2010, the SPDC transferred power to a quasi-civilian government led by President Thein Sein, who has implemented political and economic reforms. This government has released hundreds of political prisoners and repealed oppressive laws. In April 2012, Burma held parliamentary by-elections where Aung San Suu Kyi's party, the NLD, won 43 out of 46 seats. The Obama Administration responded positively to Burma's political developments by increasing high-level meetings with the Thein Sein government and easing existing restrictions. The Obama Administration responded positively to Burma's political developments by increasing high-level meetings with the Thein Sein government and easing many existing sanctions on Burma. This included appointing the first U.S. ambassador to Burma in 20 years, Hillary Clinton's visit as the first Secretary of State in over 50 years, and President Obama's historic visit as the first U.S. President while in office. Specific sanctions on Burma have been waived, and plans are in place to increase U.S. assistance to the country. Plans are underway to increase U.S. assistance to Burma, including reopening the USAID mission after a 23-year hiatus. Despite changes in the country, the political and economic situation remains serious, with ongoing fighting between the Burmese military and ethnic-based militias, particularly in Kachin State. The conflict in Burma, especially in Kachin State, involves serious human rights violations by the Tatmadaw. Ethnic tensions have been exposed in Rakhine State. While some laws have improved civil liberties, oppressive laws from colonial times persist. The NLD participated in the 2012 by-elections, but other parties face registration issues due to political detentions. Over 200 political prisoners are still detained in Burma despite multiple releases since May 2011. The 113th Congress may consider various issues regarding Burma's political and economic development, including President Thein Sein's commitment to democracy and human rights, the ability to implement reforms, and collaboration with the Union Parliament and military for reform. The question of whether U.S. policy is too closely tied to President Thein Sein is also raised. The United States is urged to consider promoting political and economic reform in Burma, focusing on developing relations with ethnic minorities and their representative organizations. Questions arise about the Obama Administration's pace in easing sanctions and whether they are being properly enforced. The key issue is what steps need to be taken for sanctions to be removed or waivers reversed. The United States is urged to consider promoting political and economic reform in Burma, focusing on developing relations with ethnic minorities and their representative organizations. Questions arise about the Obama Administration's pace in easing sanctions and whether they are being properly enforced. The origins of the Obama Administration's Burma policy can be traced back to a 2007 article in Foreign Affairs, which called for a change in approach towards Burma's ruling military. The Obama Administration is urged to promote political and economic reform in Burma by engaging with the military regime and continuing sanctions. Initially skeptical, the Administration's approach towards Burma has evolved over time. The Obama Administration initially had reservations about the Burmese government but became more optimistic over time, strengthening ties with President Thein Sein's administration. This shift in approach also involved maintaining contact with Aung San Suu Kyi, opposition parties, and ethnic groups. The Obama Administration shifted its approach towards Burma, focusing on promoting progressive forces within Thein Sein's government and isolating anti-reform individuals. This led to a partnership with President Thein Sein's government, potentially straining relations with opposition parties and ethnic groups. The Obama Administration shifted its approach towards Burma, aligning with President Thein Sein's government to promote further reforms and isolating anti-reform individuals. This new strategy may strain relations with opposition parties and ethnic organizations. The Obama Administration's focus on creating an environment for reforms in Burma has sparked debate among experts and interest groups. Some believe the administration has moved too fast in rewarding modest progress, while others think it has been too slow in lifting sanctions that hinder reforms. The Obama Administration's new Burma policy involved direct discussions with SPDC officials and maintaining existing U.S. sanctions until concrete progress towards reform is seen. Additional targeted sanctions could be implemented if needed. The Obama Administration reserved the right to impose additional sanctions or relax existing ones based on the political situation in Burma, particularly in response to the 2010 elections where some parties boycotted due to unfair election laws. The SPDC transformed the Union Solidarity and Development Association into a political party, the Union Solidarity and Development Party, with SPDC Prime Minister Thein Sein as its leader. Ethnic militias were to be transformed into Border Guard Forces under the command of the Burmese military or risk losing existing ceasefire agreements. In August 2009, the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army's refusal to join the Border Guard Force led to a military offensive, causing over 30,000 refugees to flee to China. Fighting erupted between the Burmese military and the Shan State Army-North in November 2010, sparking conflicts with other ethnic militias in eastern Burma. The Obama Administration's cautious response to Burma's political transition may have been influenced by reports of Burma's alleged nuclear weapons program and arms trade with North Korea. In 2009, a cargo ship allegedly carrying arms from North Korea to Burma was monitored by U.S. naval vessels, violating a U.N. Security Council Resolution. The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) warned in 2010 about Burma's potential development of nuclear weapons, and Al Jazeera reported on Burma's nuclear ambitions in June 2010. The Obama Administration responded cautiously to Burma's political transition due to reports of an alleged nuclear weapons program and arms trade with North Korea. Concerns were raised about Burma's ability to develop nuclear weapons, despite receiving technical support from North Korea. The continuation of arms trade prohibited by U.N. Security Council Resolution 1874 was a major worry for the Obama Administration. President Obama issued a statement following the parliamentary elections in November 2010, expressing disappointment in the lack of freedom in Burma. Obama criticized the November 7 elections in Burma as neither free nor fair, citing the regime's detention of over 2,100 political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi. The electoral laws and Election Commission were biased against the National League for Democracy. The Burmese regime silenced the National League for Democracy and hindered opposition candidates. The US will maintain pressure on Burma and calls for the release of political prisoners and an end to human rights violations. The US urges Burma to cease human rights violations, hold violators accountable, and engage in dialogue with pro-democracy and ethnic minority groups. Acting Deputy Department Spokesman Mark C. Toner criticized the flawed electoral process in Burma and called for the release of political prisoners. The US urges Burmese authorities to release political prisoners, recognize democratic parties, and engage in inclusive dialogue for reconciliation. Derek Mitchell was confirmed as a key figure in responding to developments in Burma. Derek Mitchell, confirmed as the first Special Representative for Burma in 2011, holds an ambassadorial ranking and is responsible for coordinating U.S. policy towards Burma as per the JADE Act. The new government in Burma showed mixed progress, with a release of political prisoners and efforts towards reconciliation, but also suspicions of illicit cargo from North Korea intercepted by a Navy destroyer. The cargo ship suspected of carrying banned weapons technology between North Korea and Burma was refused to be boarded by its North Korean crew and sailed back to North Korea. The Burmese Army broke a ceasefire with the Kachin Independence Army, leading to fighting spreading in Burma. Former Assistant Secretary Campbell summarized the Obama Administration's impressions of the new Burmese government in a speech on May 31, 2011. The Obama Administration expressed disappointment with the new Burmese government's progress, disagreeing with their claim of achieving a disciplined democracy. Former SPDC officials still held key positions. The United States is not optimistic about immediate policy changes in Burma, as former SPDC officials still hold key positions in the government. Ambassador Mitchell visited Burma and met with President Thein Sein, Aung San Suu Kyi, NLD leaders, and ethnic group representatives. President Thein Sein expressed willingness to negotiate ceasefire agreements with ethnic militias. Ambassador Mitchell described his conversations in Burma as candid. Ambassador Mitchell's visit to Burma involved candid conversations about human rights abuses, conflicts with ethnic militias, and Burma's relations with North Korea. The visit set the stage for future developments in bilateral relations and paved the way for Foreign Minister Wunna Maung Lwin's visit to the U.S. In October 2011, President Thein Sein announced a second large-scale prisoner pardon. President Thein Sein announced the second large-scale prisoner pardon, releasing 6,359 people, including 241 political prisoners. Ambassador Mitchell and Assistant Secretary Michael Posner visited Burma to discuss political reform, ethnic conflicts, and human rights. President Thein Sein also signed a law allowing peaceful protests in Burma. President Obama attended the East Asia Summit in Bali, Indonesia. President Obama released a statement on Burma during the East Asia Summit in Bali, Indonesia, expressing concerns about human rights violations but also acknowledging progress. After consulting with Aung San Suu Kyi, he sent Secretary of State Clinton to Burma to explore possibilities for positive change and improve relations between the two countries. Clinton visited Burma from November 30 to December 2, 2011, becoming the first Secretary of State to do so. During her visit to Burma in 2011, Secretary of State Clinton announced new U.S. development programs including an English language program, aid for victims of internal conflict, and academic exchange programs. USAID also planned to expand an anti-malaria program into Burma. All initiatives were permissible under U.S. sanctions at the time. In 2011, the Burmese government implemented political reforms and negotiated ceasefire agreements. The Union Parliament passed laws improving civil liberties, including the Labour Organization Law and the Law Relating to Peaceful Assembly and Peaceful Procession. President Thein Sein ended pre-publication censorship for certain topics but kept post-publication censorship in place. In 2011, President Thein Sein appointed the Myanmar National Human Rights Commission to promote citizens' fundamental rights. Ceasefire talks between the Tatmadaw and KIA in Kachin State made progress with preliminary agreements signed with ethnic groups like DKBA and Mongla. In 2012, President Thein Sein granted prisoner pardons, including political prisoners, and President Obama waived a section of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act for Burma. The TVPA requires U.S. executive directors of financial institutions to vote against providing loans to Burma. The Obama Administration partially opened the door for IMF and MDBs to provide assistance to Burma. The presidential waiver of the TVPA provision allowed the IMF and MDBs to offer technical support to Burma. In April 2012, Burma held a by-election that attracted national and international attention due to Aung San Suu Kyi and the NLD's decision to participate. The April by-elections in Burma, while an improvement over previous elections, did not meet all the standards for being free, fair, transparent, and inclusive according to the United Nations Special Rapporteur. Aung San Suu Kyi and 42 NLD candidates won seats, with the remaining going to candidates from the USDP and SNDP. The Obama Administration congratulated the people of Burma on their participation in the electoral process. On April 1, various countries congratulated Burma on their electoral participation and Aung San Suu Kyi's strong showing. The Obama Administration announced support for reforms in Burma two days later, following the official election results. The Obama Administration announced support for reforms in Burma, including five steps taken using existing executive authority. Former Secretary Clinton consulted with Congress, allies, and friends in Europe and Asia. Senior Administration officials provided additional information about the steps, including relaxing restrictions on private U.S. organizations providing nonprofit activities in Burma. The State Department, in collaboration with OFAC, created an expanded general license to facilitate nonprofit activities in Burma. OFAC approved the license on April 17, 2012, allowing financial services for not-for-profit projects. The easing of trade and investment restrictions aims to have an immediate impact on the country's people and reduce obstacles to reform. The officials mentioned agriculture, banking, tourism, and telecommunications as potential areas for easing trade and investment restrictions. They highlighted the need for caution in \"more regressive sectors\" like gems and timber, where projects may face opposition from local populations. The plan is to implement the five steps using existing waiver authorities and rescinding executive orders. The plan to ease trade and investment restrictions in Burma includes establishing a USAID mission, supporting UNDP projects, relaxing nonprofit activity restrictions, and facilitating travel for Burmese officials. Presidential waiver authority and certification to Congress are required for these steps. On May 16, 2012, Burma's Foreign Minister visited Washington, DC, where the Obama Administration announced renewing sanctions for one year, nominating an ambassador to Burma, and easing export bans. President Obama announced an easing of U.S. bans on financial services and new investment in Burma. Former Secretary Clinton provided details on allowing American investment and export of U.S. financial services, emphasizing responsible investment and deterring abuses. She called on the U.S. business community to set a good corporate example. The U.S. business community was urged to set a good corporate example by President Obama. Details were provided about easing the investment and financial services ban in Burma, allowing U.S. investors to invest in all sectors and export financial services to Burmese entities not on the SDN list. The SDN list will be regularly updated to prevent \"bad actors\" from benefiting. The criteria for placing a person or company on the SDN list in Burma were being determined, likely based on business practices and attitudes towards reforms. The State Department was working with various stakeholders to develop voluntary corporate governance standards for U.S. companies in Burma. The Obama Administration released documents to ease sanctions on July 11, 2012, with Executive Order 13619 expanding the scope. On May 17, 2012, sanctions were announced, and Executive Order 13619 expanded sanctions on specific Burmese nationals. On July 11, 2012, the Obama Administration eased two existing sanctions on Burma regarding new U.S. investments and financial services. The ban on new U.S. investments in Burma was imposed by Section 570 of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act of 1997. President Obama delegated authority to waive the investment ban to then Secretary Clinton, who then exercised it through Deputy Secretary of State Thomas R. Nides. This waiver paved the way for OFAC to release General License No. 17. General License No. 17 allows new investments in Burma by U.S. persons with limitations, such as avoiding investments with certain entities and complying with State Department reporting requirements. Pre-approval or notification is not required for new investments, but investors are responsible for ensuring compliance with sanctions. The State Department's reporting requirements for investments in Burma include reporting any investment involving the Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE) within 60 days and all investments over $500,000 annually by April 1. Information about the investment will be made public, and an investment is considered to have occurred when parties enter into a contract or when a U.S. party purchases ownership in a resource. OFAC announced General License No. 16, allowing the export of financial services to Burma with restrictions. Financial services cannot be provided to certain entities or individuals, and the license supersedes General License No. 14-C and 15. Pre-approval from OFAC is not required for providing financial services. President Obama imposed sanctions on certain Burmese nationals via E.O. 13619, prohibiting visas, asset freezes, and financial services for those involved in threatening peace, human rights abuses, or arms trading in Burma. The Obama Administration imposed sanctions on Burmese nationals involved in arms trading with North Korea, amidst positive and negative political developments in Burma. Progress towards peace agreements in Burma stalled after preliminary ceasefire agreements with 12 ethnic groups. President Thein Sein reorganized his negotiating team, excluding Aung Thaung. Riots erupted in Rakhine State between Rohingyas and Rakhines. Burma's censorship board warned publications about their coverage. The Press Scrutiny and Registration Division (PSRD) warned publications about their coverage of rioting and blocked reports of Tin Aung Myint Oo's resignation. Dozens were killed, thousands displaced, mostly Rohingyas. President Thein Sein made progress on political rights and economic reform, pardoning 80 prisoners, including 25 political prisoners. Burma's censorship board ended pre-publication censorship for printed materials in August 2012. In August 2012, Burma's Ministry of Information ended pre-publication censorship for printed materials and implemented a unified managed float exchange rate system. President Thein Sein reshuffled his cabinet, possibly to remove resistors to reforms or consolidate his power. The President reshuffled his cabinet in August 2012, possibly to consolidate his political power. There was a debate over the oversight authority of the Union Parliament, with the Constitutional Tribunal ruling that parliamentary bodies could not compel ministerial officials to testify. The Tribunal's decision in August 2012, stating parliamentary bodies couldn't compel ministerial officials to testify, led to protests and calls for impeachment. In September 2012, nine tribunal members resigned, and the Obama Administration eased sanctions on Burma. President Thein Sein and Lower House Speaker Shwe Mann were removed from the OFAC list on September 19, 2012. On September 19, 2012, President Thein Sein and Lower House Speaker Shwe Mann were removed from the list of Specially Designated Nationals (SDN), lifting financial sanctions. H.R. 6431 was passed to grant the President authority to waive U.S. opposition to IFI assistance to Burma, signed into law on October 5, 2012. Prior to her meeting with President Thein Sein in New York City on September 26, 2012, Secretary Clinton announced steps to ease restrictions on importing Burmese goods into the United States. This was in recognition of Burma's progress towards reform and in response to requests from both the government and opposition. President Thein Sein addressed the U.N. General Assembly on September 27, 2012, highlighting Burma's political reform process. He portrayed the country as moving away from authoritarian rule towards a more democratic system. President Thein Sein highlighted Burma's transition from authoritarian rule to a democratic government with a strong parliament. He mentioned amnesties for prisoners, the return of political exiles, parliamentary by-elections, media freedom, Internet access, workers' and employers' organizations, and increased political participation. Despite facing challenges, he emphasized the progress towards reform. The nation faced challenges including armed conflicts and communal violence in Rakhine State. Chris Milligan was sworn in as USAID's Mission Director to Burma in 2012, focusing on democracy, human rights, governance, peace, food security, and health. The mission has grown to about 20 people. President Obama delegated authority to waive U.S. opposition to IFI assistance to Burma to Secretary Clinton in 2012. Clinton determined it was in the national interest to support assistance for Burma, effectively waiving the requirement to oppose IFI assistance. The World Bank approved an $80 million grant to Burma for community-driven development with the support of the United States. Assistant Secretary of State Michael Posner led a U.S. delegation to Burma for a human rights dialogue, including Lieutenant General Francis Wiercinski. Topics discussed included rule of law, human rights protection, and military issues. The agenda covered topics like rule of law, human rights, and military code of conduct. Burma was invited to attend Cobra Gold, a joint military training exercise. The US considered allowing Burmese military officers to observe the exercise. President Obama planned a stopover in Burma during his trip to Southeast Asia. President Obama planned a stopover in Burma during his trip to Southeast Asia to attend the East Asia Summit in Cambodia. He would be the first U.S. President to visit Burma while in office, meeting with President Thein Sein and Aung San Suu Kyi, and giving a speech on political reform. Special Assistant Samantha Power noted progress in Burma since Obama's previous visit. Since Secretary Clinton's visit to Burma in 1955, there has been progress towards democracy. The US has responded with steps to recognize and encourage further reform, while updating sanctions to target those who interfere with peace or democracy. Challenges faced by Burma include ethnic unrest, ongoing conflicts, justice system development, free press cultivation, and civil society formation. Secretary Clinton's visit to Burma in 1955 marked progress towards democracy. The US responded by recognizing and encouraging further reform, updating sanctions to target those who interfere with peace or democracy. Challenges in Burma include ethnic unrest, ongoing conflicts, justice system development, free press cultivation, and civil society formation. National Security Advisor Donilon stated that President Obama's visit to Burma endorsed and supported ongoing reforms, promoting progress. On the same day as Donilon's speech, the State Department waived the ban on imports from Burma, allowing the import of products of Burmese origin except for jadeite and rubies. President Obama's visit to Burma included meetings with key leaders, a public speech at the University of Yangon, and focused on social issues in both countries. The venue choice was politically significant due to its historical importance in Burma's anti-colonial movement and uprising against military rule. President Obama highlighted key social issues in both Burma and the United States, emphasizing the importance of free expression, assembly, and press freedom for democracy. He also discussed the U.S. system of governance that limits the power of its leaders. Additionally, he emphasized the right of all people to live without fear and the need for national reconciliation and an end to ethnic discrimination. President Obama emphasized the importance of free expression, assembly, and press freedom for democracy in Burma. He also stressed the need for national reconciliation and an end to ethnic discrimination. Obama expressed confidence in the country's progress and pledged U.S. support on the journey towards positive change. Meetings with Burmese leaders were described as frank and constructive, but post-meeting remarks indicated a different assessment of the situation. President Obama had a positive meeting with President Thein Sein in Burma, praising their cooperation on non-proliferation issues. However, he acknowledged that political reforms are just the beginning of a long journey. Thein Sein mentioned agreements on democracy and human rights. Obama also met with Aung San Suu Kyi and summarized U.S. policy towards Burma since 2011. President Obama met with Aung San Suu Kyi in Yangon to sustain democratization momentum. Aung San Suu Kyi emphasized the need to avoid being misled by false success. The Burmese government agreed to comply with U.N. sanctions on North Korea during Obama's visit. The Burmese government agreed to comply with U.N. sanctions on North Korea, sign the Additional Protocol to the IAEA Comprehensive Safeguards Agreements, allow ICRC to resume prisoner visits, review cases of \"prisoners of concern,\" agree to the U.S.-Myanmar Joint Plan on Trafficking in Persons, implement ILO's Action Plan on Forced Labor, commit to OGP membership by 2016, and pursue a durable ceasefire in Kachin. The Burmese government agreed to comply with U.N. sanctions on North Korea, sign the Additional Protocol to the IAEA Comprehensive Safeguards Agreements, allow ICRC to resume prisoner visits, review cases of \"prisoners of concern,\" agree to the U.S.-Myanmar Joint Plan on Trafficking in Persons, implement ILO's Action Plan on Forced Labor, commit to OGP membership by 2016, pursue a durable ceasefire in Kachin State, prevent violent attacks on civilians in Rakhine State, and hold perpetrators accountable. However, there were concerns about the government's commitment to political reform following violent attacks on protesters in Sagaing Region. The Burmese military launched a major assault against the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) in Kachin State, breaking a 17-year-old ceasefire. Despite promises made to President Obama, fighting between the Tatmadaw and the KIA escalated, with unsuccessful ceasefire talks leading to a build-up of forces in the region. The Tatmadaw's \"Operation Thunderbolt\" resulted in the injury of Buddhist monks and civilians. The Tatmadaw launched \"Operation Thunderbolt\" against the KIA in December 2012 to take over their headquarters in Laiza. The offensive involved at least five battalions and the use of aircraft, drawing international criticism for civilian casualties, human rights abuses, and the use of child soldiers. The Burmese government and KIA were involved in a conflict with allegations of child soldier use. US officials visited Kachin State to assess the situation and urged both sides to establish a dialogue process. A fragile ceasefire in Kachin State broke down as Tatmadaw forces attacked a KIA base near Laiza. The U.S. Embassy criticized the Burmese Army for resuming fighting despite announcing a ceasefire. The Burmese Army continues a military offensive near the Kachin Independence Army headquarters in Laiza despite a ceasefire announcement. The United States strongly opposes the ongoing fighting, which has led to civilian casualties and hindered national reconciliation efforts. Burma's Ministry of Foreign Affairs blames the KIA for violating the ceasefire and describes their actions as \"terrorist attacks.\" Initial negotiations between the Union Government and KIO/KIA representatives took place on February 4, 2013. Negotiations between the Union Government and the KIO/KIA were held in Ruili, China on February 4, 2013. Despite ongoing fighting in Kachin State, the Union Government made policy changes to protect civil liberties, including dissolving the Press Scrutiny and Registration Division on January 24. The Tatmadaw's support for the negotiations with KIO/KIA and their adherence to any agreements remain uncertain. On January 24, the government abolished the media censorship agency and established a Copyrights and Registration Division. President Thein Sein revoked a military junta order banning gatherings without permission on January 28. The Ministry of Information submitted a draft media legislation to Parliament on March 4, 2013. The Ministry of Information (MOI) sent a new media bill to Parliament on March 4, 2013, aiming to replace the 1962 Printer and Publishers Registration Act. However, the draft legislation faced criticism from media groups in Burma for being more restrictive than the existing law. The MOI's move to forward the bill to Parliament went against an agreement with the Myanmar Press Council, causing further controversy. The draft law was published in the Burmese version of the New Light of Myanmar on February 27, 2013, leading to objections from the Myanmar Journalist Association (MJA). The Myanmar Journalist Association, Myanmar Journalist Network, and Myanmar Journalist Union condemned a draft bill proposed by the Ministry of Information on February 27, 2013. The bill includes provisions that restrict reporting on ethnic conflicts, criticizing the constitution, and disturbing the rule of law. It also allows a MOI-appointed official to control publishing licenses, seen as a form of media censorship. Penalties for violations include imprisonment and fines. The proposed bill by the Ministry of Information in Myanmar includes severe penalties of imprisonment and fines for journalists, which are more stringent than the 1962 law. OFAC issued general license No. 19 on February 22, 2013, to ease financial transactions with certain Burmese banks for U.S. companies and NGOs operating in Burma. Ayeyarwady Bank was added to the SDN list on the same day. The U.S. sanctions were causing difficulties, but OFAC allowed transactions with four of Burma's larger banks to support the easing of economic sanctions. Critics noted that the banks are owned by \"cronies\" with close ties to the Burmese military. The Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission held a hearing on human rights in Burma in February 2013. The Obama Administration's approach to U.S. policy towards Burma reflects a new era of relations, responding to President Thein Sein's reform agenda. Assistant Secretary Posner and Special Representative Murphy testified on recognizing and encouraging further progress in Burma. The Obama Administration supports Burma's reform agenda and seeks to be a long-term partner in the country's progress, according to Assistant Secretary Posner. Positive and negative changes have occurred since Burma's quasi-civilian government took power. The Obama Administration supports Burma's reform agenda and seeks to be a long-term partner in the country's progress. Positive and negative changes have occurred in Burma since the new policy was announced. The political situation in Burma remains fragile and complex, with important issues about the prospects for political reforms in the future. General Khin Kyunt announced a roadmap to a \"disciplined democracy\" in Burma, with the transfer of power to the Union Government and Parliament completing the sixth step towards building a modern nation. President Thein Sein has moved Burma into the final step of building a democratic nation, but the concept of a \"disciplined democracy\" in Burma remains unclear. Key elements for a future democratic Burma are still subjects of political debate. The political debate in Burma revolves around key issues such as civilian control over the military, special powers of the Tatmadaw, federal vs. central government structure, balance of power between branches of government, and the selection process for the President and Vice Presidents. The debate in Burma focuses on key issues like civilian control over the military, government structure, and selection process for President and Vice Presidents. Questions remain about citizenship conditions, rights for Rohingyas, civil liberties restrictions, and the opaque nature of the military leadership. The relationship between the military and Union Government in Burma is opaque. President Thein Sein's recent ministerial changes in February 2013 included appointing two former generals to his Cabinet. The military's influence in the Union Government of Burma is significant, with many cabinet ministers being current or former military officers. Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hliang's actions suggest limited support for political reform, as he has not followed President Thein Sein's orders to cease military operations against certain groups. Questions have been raised about General Min Aung Hlaing's political intentions due to his reassignment of top military personnel. The military's influence in the Union Government of Burma is significant, with many cabinet ministers being current or former military officers. Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hliang's actions suggest limited support for political reform. The replacement of military-appointed members of the Union Parliament in 2012 was seen as an effort to tighten discipline. Relations between the military and the Union Parliament have been strained at times, with tensions highlighted in recent incidents. During the February 2013 session, the Union Parliament questioned the proposed military budget, which accounted for nearly 21% of federal spending. A parliamentary commission found that the Tatmadaw had seized over 247,000 acres of land between July 2012 and January 2013, recommending the return of most confiscated land and compensation for displaced individuals. The military's extensive involvement in Burma's economy remains a unresolved issue in the country's reform process. Under the SPDC, regional commanders held significant political power and benefited economically. Major corporations in lucrative sectors like mining, oil, and gas are allegedly owned by the military or senior officers. The Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (UMEHL) is a prominent entity reportedly owned by the Ministry of Defense and operated by the Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC) on behalf of the military. The military in Burma controls major corporations through entities like UMEHL and MEC, providing them with independent revenue sources. This has fueled a low-level civil war since 1948, with ethnic minorities feeling marginalized by the government. The Burmese government failed to uphold the Panglong Agreement granting autonomy to ethnic minorities, leading to a military coup in 1962. The military is designated as the main entity for safeguarding national integrity and sovereignty in the 2008 Constitution. The Union Government proposes a three-step peace process to end the civil war and reconcile with ethnic organizations. The steps include negotiating a ceasefire, broader agreements on development, and a national agreement. The Union Government proposes a three-step peace process to end the civil war and reconcile with ethnic organizations. The third step involves negotiating a national agreement on amending the 2008 Constitution in line with previous agreements. A \"peace committee\" has been established, with former Railway Minister Aung Min leading negotiations with ethnic organizations. The Union Government's three-step peace process has been rejected by prominent ethnic organizations. The United Nationalities Federal Council (UNFC) proposed direct negotiations with the Union Government, followed by a national conference and convention to establish a federal union of Burma without the 2008 Constitution. The UNFC has appointed a negotiating team with representatives from member organizations for talks with the Union Government and various ethnic groups. Ceasefire agreements have been reached with 13 out of 21 groups, excluding the KIO/KIA. Informal talks in China in 2013 led to an agreement for future discussions, but no negotiations have completed the second step of the Union Government's peace process. The completion of the second step of the Union Government's peace process in Burma is a significant milestone, but several unresolved issues remain. These include disagreements over the powers of the central government versus the ethnic States, as well as the need for the support of the Burmese military for any national reconciliation agreement. The Burmese military's lack of participation in current negotiations raises doubts about their support for the peace process. The parties also need to agree on the process for negotiating terms of national reconciliation, with the Union Government pushing for incorporation of ethnic organizations into the current governance system. The major ethnic groups in Burma prefer equal talks with the Union Government and question the legitimacy of the 2008 Constitution. The drafting of the Constitution excluded many opposition parties and ethnic organizations, making its future uncertain for national reconciliation. The 2008 Constitution in Burma was drafted without the participation of ethnic organizations, seen as a tool to maintain military power. Limited public access to the Constitution before the 2008 referendum and fraudulent results raised doubts about the legitimacy of the Union Government and Parliament. The document is considered legitimate by the Union Government and military. President Thein Sein and the Burmese military see the 2008 Constitution as legitimate. The President is open to limited amendments, including changes to the Tatmadaw's privileged status in the Union Parliament. Opposition parties, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, also seek amendments to the constitution. The NLD, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, aims to amend the 2008 Constitution to allow her to serve as President after the 2015 elections. While opposition parties are willing to follow the amendment process, many ethnic organizations reject the constitution and prefer direct negotiations with the government and military for a new constitution. The 2008 Constitution outlines the process for amending it, requiring support from at least 20% of Union Parliament members and 75% for adoption. Some parties prefer direct negotiations for a new constitution over amending the current one. The 2008 Constitution requires support from at least 20% of Union Parliament members for amending it, and 75% for adoption. Certain sections of the Constitution also need approval in a nation-wide referendum with more than half of eligible voters. These sections include the government structure, military's special status, conditions for a state of emergency declaration. The 2008 Constitution sets requirements for amending it, including support from 20% of Union Parliament members and approval in a nation-wide referendum. Any amendment must also obtain support from military appointees, potentially affecting the government structure and satisfying ethnic organizations. The 2008 Constitution sets requirements for amending it, including support from 20% of Union Parliament members and approval in a nation-wide referendum. Any amendment must also obtain support from military appointees, potentially affecting the government structure and satisfying ethnic organizations. If a compromise is reached, the amendment still needs approval from over 50% of eligible voters, which could be a challenge. The 113th Congress may play a more active role in shaping U.S. policy towards Burma during this political transition. Critics have differing views on the Obama Administration's approach to Burma, with some saying it has moved too fast in relaxing sanctions and others saying it has been too slow and cautious. The Obama Administration's approach to Burma has been criticized for moving too slowly, leading to a loss of influence over political dynamics and economic development. The 112th Congress passed laws and bills related to Burma, mostly extending sanctions, with limited further action taken. The 112th Congress passed laws related to Burma, extending sanctions through five new laws. The 112th Congress passed laws extending sanctions on Burma, including prohibiting the use of funds for military training or operations involving child soldiers. Section 7014 of Division I of P.L. 112-74 banned the use of funds for military training or operations involving child soldiers in Burma. Additionally, Section 7044(b) requires the Secretary of the Treasury to oppose financial support for Burma in international financial institutions. P.L. 112-192 granted the Secretary of the Treasury the authority to vote in favor of providing assistance for Burma in international financial institutions if the President deems it necessary. The President can provide assistance to Burma through international financial institutions if deemed in the national interest, with notification to specific congressional committees. The Secretary of State and Treasury must consult with committees beforehand. The 112th Congress introduced over 20 bills related to Burma, with only five becoming law. H.Con.Res. 135 authorized the presentation of the Congressional Gold Medal to Aung San Suu Kyi. Six congressional hearings on Burma were held, split between the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. The House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations held several hearings related to Burma, including discussions on religious freedom, democracy, human rights, and U.S. policy towards Burma. Two of the Senate hearings were nomination hearings for Derek J. Mitchell. The Senate Committee on Foreign Relations held hearings for Derek J. Mitchell's nominations as Special Representative and Policy Coordinator for Burma and Ambassador to Burma. The 113th Congress may consider various aspects of U.S. policy towards Burma. The 113th Congress may review U.S. policy towards Burma, including the implementation of existing laws and potential legislative adjustments. Congressional oversight of funding for assistance programs in Burma will also be conducted. The 113th Congress may conduct oversight on U.S. policy towards Burma, including examining the Obama Administration's approach and implementation of existing laws. Congressional hearings or information requests may be utilized to gather information on developments in Burma. The 113th Congress may consider examining the Obama Administration's approach to Burma and the easing of sanctions. Key aspects to consider include the political situation in Burma, the pace of sanctions easing, and the focus on President Thein Sein and other Burmese officials. The Obama Administration's approach to Burma and the easing of sanctions may be examined by the 113th Congress. Key aspects to consider include the political situation in Burma, the legitimacy of the Union Government and Parliament, the 2008 Constitution, and the attitudes of the Burmese military towards political reform. The 113th Congress may examine the attitudes of the Burmese military towards political reform and consider the best approach for dealing with them in the future. The Obama Administration's view on ethnic groups and militias, as well as the possibility of establishing closer relations with ethnic organizations, are also key considerations for U.S. policy towards Burma. Congress may also explore specific issues related to U.S. policy implementation. The Obama Administration's implementation of U.S. policy towards Burma includes issues such as the appointment of a Special Representative and Policy Coordinator, administration of lists for sanctions, and submission of required reports to Congress. The JADE Act requires the President to appoint a Special Representative and Policy Coordinator for Burma with the rank of ambassador, subject to Senate approval. The appointee cannot hold another executive branch position concurrently. Ambassador Derek J. Mitchell was confirmed for this role. The Senate confirmed Ambassador Derek J. Mitchell as Special Representative and Policy Coordinator for Burma on August 2, 2011. He later became U.S. Ambassador to Burma on June 29, 2012. W. Patrick Murphy then served as acting Special Representative and Policy Coordinator for Burma starting July 23, 2012. The Federal Vacancies Act of 1998 allows for temporary appointments for Senate-approved positions for up to 210 days. The time restriction for temporary appointments to Senate-approved positions is suspended if a nomination is pending. Murphy's temporary appointment as Special Representative for Burma has exceeded the 210-day limit. Congress may inquire about the Obama Administration's plans for nominating a permanent replacement. Implementation of sanctions on Burmese individuals and entities has faced criticism for not complying with existing laws. The Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003 and the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act prohibit entry visas for certain Burmese nationals unless deemed in the national interest. Presidential determinations and executive orders also block visas for selected Burmese individuals. The Department of State is responsible for blocking visas for selected Burmese nationals, as per the 2003 BFDA and the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act. These acts also freeze assets of certain Burmese individuals in the U.S. and prohibit the provision of financial services to them. The Secretary of the Treasury administers these financial sanctions in accordance with relevant laws and presidential EOs. Section 5(d)(4) of the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act mandates the Secretaries of State and the Treasury to allocate resources for identifying potential sanctions targets. Human rights groups criticize the State and Treasury Departments for not fully enforcing visa bans and financial sanctions. The State Department has not disclosed the names on its visa ban list, raising concerns about compliance with the law. Several Burmese government officials have visited the U.S. in the past two years. Several Burmese government officials have visited the United States in the last two years, potentially violating sanctions under the 2003 BFDA and the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act. It is unclear if the required presidential determination to Congress was provided for these visits. The Treasury Department has delegated the responsibility of maintaining the list of sanctioned Burmese individuals to the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The SDN list includes individuals, groups, companies subject to Treasury sanctions. Critics say it lacks Burmese nationals and companies. Implementation of required reports to Congress has faced criticism. The required reports to Congress under Burmese sanction laws have not all been delivered on time, with some lacking detail. Sanctions on Burma remain in place until conditions are met or Congress acts to remove them, including a general import ban. The general import ban under the 2003 BFDA can be renewed annually by Congress. President Obama has waived some sanctions on Burma, but the authority to impose them remains. The current extension of the import ban ends on July 25, 2013. The State Department determined a waiver of the import ban was in the national interest. The 113th Congress may consider actions to terminate or remove the sanctions. The 113th Congress may consider extending the import ban on Burma and altering U.S. policy towards Burma, including imposing or re-imposing sanctions. Congress may also clarify conditions for terminating sanctions. The 113th Congress may consider funding levels for assistance programs in Burma proposed by the Obama Administration, including aid for landmine victims, English language training, academic exchange programs, and programs for democracy and governance. The Obama Administration plans to reopen the USAID mission in Rangoon and expand staffing and operations in Burma, requiring additional federal funding. Funding for programs in Burma may be affected by sequestration and budget constraints, with a 5% reduction mandated by the Budget Control Act of 2011. Sequestration allows for reprogramming of funds by the Department of State and USAID, but uncertainty over country allocations makes it difficult to calculate post-sequestration funding levels for Burma. A rough estimate suggests a 5% reduction from FY2012 estimates. Once final FY2013 funding legislation is passed, the Department of State can determine the actual funding levels. Congress passes final FY2013 funding legislation, allowing the Department of State to determine country and program allocations, including reprogramming for sequestration at the country level. U.S. policy may influence Burma's future as it undergoes political and economic changes leading up to the 2015 parliamentary elections. The 113th Congress could play a role in shaping U.S. policy towards Burma during this time. The text chunk discusses the importance of U.S. policy towards Burma during a critical period of transition to a civilian democratic government. It includes a map of Burma, a chronology of major events, and required reports to Congress on Burma. Reports on Burma are required by various laws to be submitted to Congress or designated committees. The reports detail different topics related to Burma, including the responsible agency, frequency, deadline, and mode of delivery."
