The \"Y2K Liability and Antitrust Reform Act\" addresses liability for computer date failure in Federal or State courts. Actions against individuals are deemed contract-based, allowing recovery for consequential business loss and repair costs if no personal injury is involved. The defendant must notify all buyers of potential computer date failure through mail or on their website, and provide necessary information at no cost. The defendant must provide free repair or replacement for computer programs or hardware involved in date failure, regardless of when they were first introduced for sale. The defendant must provide notice specifying the computer system or component experiencing a date failure and how the buyer can obtain repair or replacement. This subsection does not apply to certain situations. The subsection allows contracting parties to make agreements on liability and damages related to computer date failure. The term \"person\" refers to those engaged in commerce to design, develop, or manufacture computer systems. In cases of computer date failure, legal action can only be pursued in contract law, allowing recovery for business losses and repair costs if no personal injury is involved, and the defendant has made efforts to prevent the failure. The defendant must have made efforts to protect its system from computer date failure and tested its systems by simulating the transition to the year 2000 by July 1, 1999.

By August 1, 1999, they must have posted a notice of compliance efforts for public review and provided the same notice to the President's Council on the Year 2000 Conversion. This subsection does not limit contracting parties' ability to enter into liability agreements. The section defines \"action\" as legal proceedings related to computer date failure and \"computer date failure\" as the inability of a computer system. Parties can enter liability agreements on liability and damages resulting from computer date failure. The term \"computer date failure\" refers to the inability of a computer system or software to accurately store, process, provide, or receive data between the years 1999 and 2000 and beyond, or the possibility of such inability or incompatibility. A program or software is a set of instructions used in a computer to achieve a specific result. A computer system includes electronic devices, networks, and embedded chips that perform functions like logic, arithmetic, data processing, and communication. SEC. 3. TEMPORARY ANTITRUST EXEMPTION. Antitrust laws do not apply to conduct aimed at addressing computer date failure until December 31, 2001, except for actions resulting in a boycott. Antitrust laws, as defined in this section, include the Clayton Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act, as well as any similar State laws."
