    "content": "The \"Family Act of 2011\" is the short title of this Act. It includes findings as outlined in Section 2. Congress finds that infertility is recognized as a disease by the World Health Organization and is considered an emerging public health priority by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Approximately 3,000,000 individuals have infertility according to the CDC. Medical insurance coverage for infertility treatments is limited, with only 8 states having laws requiring comprehensive coverage. Medical insurance coverage for infertility treatments is limited, with only 19 percent of large employer-sponsored health plans and 11 percent of small employer-sponsored health plans covering in vitro fertilization. Even in States with coverage mandates, out-of-pocket expenses for these treatments are significant. SEC. 3. CREDIT FOR CERTAIN INFERTILITY TREATMENTS. An amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 introduces a new section providing a credit for certain infertility treatments. The new section allows eligible individuals a tax credit of 50% of qualified infertility treatment expenses, up to a limit of $13,360 per year. The tax credit allowable under subsection (a) for a taxable year is reduced by an amount based on the taxpayer's adjusted gross income exceeding $150,000, with a ratio to $40,000. Adjusted gross income for determining the tax credit does not include sections 911, 931, and 933. No credit is allowed if a deduction or credit is taken elsewhere in the tax code. Additionally, no credit is allowed for expenses if reimbursement or compensation is received. The tax credit does not apply if reimbursement or compensation is received from a Federal, State, or local program, or under an insurance policy. The credit allowed for any taxable year cannot exceed a certain limit based on the amount of tax. The tax credit cannot exceed the excess of the regular tax liability plus the tax imposed by section 55 over the sum of allowable credits for the taxable year. Unused credit can be carried forward in certain cases. If the credit allowable under subsection (a) exceeds the limitation imposed by section 26(a)(2) for the taxable year, the excess can be carried forward to the next year and added to the credit allowable for that year. The credit allowable under subsection (a) can be carried forward to the succeeding taxable year, with a limitation of no more than 5 years. Qualified infertility treatment expenses refer to amounts paid for infertility treatments. Treatment expenses for infertility via in vitro fertilization must be provided by a licensed medical practitioner and administered for a diagnosis of infertility in the United States. Expenses incurred for fertility preservation procedures before a diagnosis of infertility are also eligible. Fertility preservation procedures conducted before medical procedures that may cause infertility are considered qualified infertility treatment expenses, regardless of subsequent infertility diagnosis. Expenses for fertility preservation before procedures resulting in infertility are not considered qualified infertility treatment expenses. The term 'infertility' refers to the inability to conceive or carry a pregnancy to live birth, including iatrogenic infertility caused by medical treatments. It does not include infertility resulting from procedures designed for sterilization. An 'eligible individual' is someone diagnosed with infertility by a licensed physician in the United States. Married taxpayers must file joint returns. Rules similar to section 21(e) apply. Dollar limitations in subsection (b)(1) increase for taxable years after December 31, 2012. The dollar amount for taxable years is adjusted for cost-of-living increases. Amounts not multiples of $10 are rounded to the nearest multiple. Income limitations are increased for taxable years after December 31, 2002. The dollar amount for taxable years is adjusted for cost-of-living increases, rounded to the nearest multiple of $10. The table of sections for subpart A of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended. Section 23A is amended in various sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to include credit for infertility treatments. The amendments made by this section include inserting \"23A,\" after \"23,\" and apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2011."
