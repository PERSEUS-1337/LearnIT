    "content": "The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA), enacted in 1990, provides one-time cash benefits to individuals who participated in atomic weapons testing or lived near the Nevada Test Site during atmospheric atomic weapons testing. Benefits are also available to uranium industry workers between 1942 and 1971 who developed specified medical conditions after possible radiation exposure. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) provides benefits to individuals exposed to radiation from atomic weapons testing or the uranium industry. The program, administered by the Department of Justice, has approved over 30,000 claims totaling nearly $2 billion. RECA benefits are considered mandatory spending and must be applied for before July 10, 2022, when the program will end. The United States conducted 1,054 atomic weapons tests between 1945 and 1992, with the majority at the Nevada Test Site. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) provides benefits for individuals exposed to radiation, with over 30,000 claims approved totaling nearly $2 billion. Applications for RECA benefits must be filed before July 10, 2022, when the program will end. The Nevada Test Site (NTS) is a 1,375 square-mile federal reservation located 65 miles north of Las Vegas in Nye County, Nevada. Out of the 928 tests conducted at NTS, 828 were underground tests and 100 were atmospheric tests. These atmospheric tests were conducted between January 27, 1951, and October 30, 1958, and again between July 7, 1962, and July 17, 1962. The largest atmospheric test at the Nevada Test Site (NTS) was the Hood Test on July 5, 1957, with an energy yield equivalent to 74,000 tons of TNT. Benefits under the RECA program include $75,000 for onsite participants, $50,000 for downwinders, and $100,000 for uranium workers. All benefits are one-time lump sum payments. Benefits under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) program are one-time lump sum payments for uranium workers, miners, millers, and ore transporters. The payments are not adjusted for changes in wages or cost of living and are not subject to federal income tax. However, they may be reduced by other payments received for related illnesses or injuries. No medical benefits are provided by RECA, but eligible workers can receive an additional $50,000 for compensation and medical costs. Under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA), eligible individuals can receive a one-time lump sum payment of $50,000 for compensation and medical costs related to covered illnesses. If the claimant is deceased, the benefit is paid to their surviving spouse, children, parents, or grandchildren in that order. To be eligible for RECA benefits, survivors listed in specific order can receive compensation. An onsite participant must meet exposure and disease requirements from atomic weapons testing. Geographic and participation criteria must also be met for eligibility. Survivors eligible for RECA benefits must have been in specific geographic areas during atmospheric atomic weapons testing, including NTS, Pacific Test Sites, Trinity Test Site, and South Atlantic Test Site. Operation Argus was conducted in a designated site with restricted access for security and safety reasons during atmospheric atomic weapons testing. Decontamination of equipment used in nuclear detonations and monitoring fallout were key activities at these official government installations. Eligible individuals had specific occupations and were onsite during testing and up to six months after. Eligible individuals for Operation Argus included members of specific occupations who were onsite during testing and up to six months after, performing duties within the identified operational area. Health Service; Required Activities performed duties within the identified operational area during atmospheric detonations of nuclear devices, including decontamination of equipment, cloud tracking, garrison duties on Enewetak atoll, and monitoring fallout as part of a radiological safety team. To be eligible for RECA benefits as a downwinder, a person must have contracted one of the listed cancers after exposure to ionizing radiation from participation in an atmospheric atomic weapons test. A downwinder must have been physically present near NTS for a specified period between 1951 and 1958, or during a specific period in 1962. To qualify for RECA benefits, a downwinder must have contracted one of the listed cancers after exposure to ionizing radiation from an atmospheric atomic weapons test at NTS between June 30, 1962, and July 31, 1962. A uranium miner must have worked in a uranium mine for at least one year between January 1, 1942, and December 31, 1971, or have been exposed to at least 40 working-level months of radiation during this period in specific states. A WLM is defined as one working level of radiation exposure every work day for a month. It is equivalent to the concentration of decay products of radon that will release 130,000 MeV of alpha energy per liter of air. Uranium miners must have developed lung cancer or specific respiratory diseases after exposure to radiation to qualify for benefits. Uranium millers and ore transporters may qualify for RECA benefits if they meet specific exposure and disease requirements. They must have worked in a uranium mill or transporting uranium ore from 1941 to 1971 and developed certain conditions after radiation exposure, such as lung or renal cancer. The RECA program administered by DOJ's Civil Division provides benefits to individuals who worked in uranium mills or transported uranium ore from 1941 to 1971 and developed specific conditions after radiation exposure, such as lung or renal cancer. Claimants must submit written documentation of their illnesses to qualify for benefits. The RECA program administered by DOJ's Civil Division provides benefits to individuals who worked in uranium mills or transported uranium ore from 1941 to 1971 and developed specific conditions after radiation exposure. Section 6(d)(5) of the RECA statute requires that in cases submitted by Native Americans, the application procedures must consider Native American law, tradition, and custom. Application decisions are made within 12 months by an assistant director in the DOJ Civil Division. If no decision is made within 12 months, the application is automatically approved. The 2000 RECA amendments authorized HHS to provide grants for cancer screenings and medical documentation assistance. These grants are administered by HRSA as the RESEP program, with six clinics currently operating in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, and Utah. Applicants for RECA benefits at six RESEP clinics in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, and Utah, including one for Native Americans, are not required to be screened for cancer. Denied applicants can appeal to the DOJ within 60 days, with a decision made by an appeals officer appointed by the assistant attorney general of the Civil Division. Further appeals can seek judicial review. An applicant dissatisfied with the outcome of an appeal for RECA benefits may seek judicial review in the U.S. district court. Applicants can be represented by licensed attorneys or non-attorney representatives of tribal organizations. Non-attorney representatives authorized to represent RECA claimants cannot charge fees for their services. Licensed attorneys representing RECA claimants are subject to limitations on the fees they can collect. Attorneys representing RECA claimants can collect fees based on the date of their contract with the claimant: 2% for contracts after July 10, 2000, and 10% for contracts before that date. They can also recover costs for unsuccessful claims and expenses for successful claims, as per a 2007 court decision and subsequent regulations. The RECA program, now in its 25th year, is facing potential changes as some Members of Congress propose expanding eligibility for downwinders and providing benefits to uranium workers exposed to radiation after 1971. Despite no statutory changes since 2000, these issues are likely to keep RECA on the congressional agenda. To qualify for benefits as a downwinder, individuals must have been present in designated counties in Arizona, Nevada, or Utah during a specific period. Residents of areas outside of the current downwinder eligibility area have expressed concern about health effects from atomic weapons testing, but only those present in designated counties in Arizona, Nevada, or Utah during atmospheric testing at NTS are eligible for benefits under the RECA program. New downwinder eligibility areas cannot be added through regulation or executive action. The RECA program was created in 1990 due to downwinders' inability to win civil judgments against the federal government or atomic weapons testing contractors for health effects from atomic testing fallout. Bills were introduced in 1979 to compensate downwinders affected by atmospheric testing at NTS, including those with cancer, onsite participants, and sheep herds. The bill H.R. 4766 aimed to provide coverage for downwinders affected by atmospheric atomic testing at NTS, including those with leukemia, thyroid cancer, bone cancer, or other cancers prevalent in the area. Eligibility was determined based on a specific geographical area around NTS. The proposed bill H.R. 4766 aimed to provide coverage for downwinders affected by atmospheric atomic testing at NTS, including specific cancers. The bill also included provisions for creating a federal advisory board to add to the list of specified cancers and determine eligibility based on geographic areas. The proposed bill H.R. 4766 aimed to expand coverage for downwinders affected by atmospheric atomic testing at NTS, including specific cancers. It included areas in Arizona, Nevada, and Utah, with the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare having the authority to add more areas. The original RECA statute had a smaller downwinder eligibility area. The RECA covered areas in Arizona, Nevada, and Utah for downwinders affected by atomic testing. The eligibility area was expanded in 2000, adding geographical areas in Arizona and Utah. Members of Congress have introduced bills to further expand coverage. Since the 2000 RECA amendments, Congress has introduced bills to expand downwinder eligibility to include individuals in Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Guam, and those affected by the Trinity test fallout in New Mexico. In 2002, HRSA requested the NRC to study the health effects of radiation exposure and make recommendations to Congress. The NRC advised against expanding downwinder eligibility solely based on geographic area. The NRC recommended a science-based approach to determine downwinder eligibility for RECA benefits, considering factors like where individuals lived, time spent outdoors, and milk consumption for exposure to radiation fallout. The NRC recommended a science-based approach for downwinder eligibility for RECA benefits, focusing on factors like milk consumption and exposure to Iodine 131 through contaminated vegetation. The new model evaluates individual claims based on absorbed dose of radionuclides, allowing every person in the country to apply for benefits. The NRC recommended a science-based approach for downwinder eligibility for RECA benefits, focusing on factors like milk consumption and exposure to Iodine 131 through contaminated vegetation. A proposed model would calculate the probability of cancer caused by ionizing radiation exposure, potentially adjusting benefit levels based on this probability. This model differs from the current geographic-based eligibility under RECA. The NRC recommended a shift in RECA downwinder eligibility from geography to a probability of causation model. This model may result in fewer successful claims due to low radiation exposure levels and the weak cancer-causing nature of ionizing radiation. The NRC favors a presumptive eligibility model similar to that used in the EEOICPA and veterans' programs. The NRC report states that exposure to radiation from fallout is unlikely to be a substantial cause of cancer, leading to few successful compensation claims for uranium miners and millers under current law. Under current law, RECA benefits for uranium workers are only available if they were exposed to radiation before 1972. The cut-off date was chosen because the government stopped procuring uranium for weapons in 1971, but private ownership for nuclear power plants continued after that. Legislation has been introduced to expand RECA eligibility for uranium workers exposed to radiation after 1971, including mine core drillers and research into health effects of uranium tailing piles. Advocates argue that despite safety regulations, uranium workers, especially miners, are still at risk for radon-induced illnesses. Uranium workers, especially miners, are at elevated risk for radon-induced diseases due to higher exposure limits set by Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) compared to NIOSH recommendations. The intent of the RECA program is to provide restitution to individuals affected by fallout from atomic weapons tests and uranium miners. The RECA program aims to compensate individuals affected by fallout from atomic weapons tests and uranium miners exposed to radiation. Expanding RECA to cover post-1971 uranium activities would extend coverage to workers in the commercial uranium sector, beyond its original intent. Workers contracted for commercial uranium activities, such as mining, milling, and ore transporting, may be covered by state workers' compensation systems for medical benefits and compensation in case of workplace injuries, illnesses, or deaths."
