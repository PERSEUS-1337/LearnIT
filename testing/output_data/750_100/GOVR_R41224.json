    "content": "The changing structure of U.S. agriculture has raised concerns about reduced competition in various agricultural markets, including dairy. Key issues in the dairy industry include consolidation and industry concentration. The Administration announced workshops to address competition issues in agriculture, with a specific workshop on the dairy industry scheduled for June 25, 2010 in Madison, WI. A workshop on the U.S. dairy industry is set for June 25, 2010, in Madison, WI. The report covers the structure of the dairy industry, recent financial stress for farmers, movements in farm and retail prices, industry consolidation, economic effects, and U.S. antitrust law. In 2009, the U.S. dairy industry faced financial stress due to lower milk prices, leading to over $1 billion in federal support. Despite this assistance, the number of dairy farms in the U.S. declined. The number of U.S. dairy farms declined by 3% to 65,000 farms in 2009 despite government support. Dairy cow numbers also fell, leading to a decrease in milk production. However, average farm milk prices increased to $15.10 per hundredweight in March 2010. Financial concerns persist for dairy farmers due to lost farm equity and high feed prices. The dairy industry continues to face financial stress due to high feed prices, leading to a reevaluation of policy options by industry stakeholders and Members of Congress. The Obama Administration and some lawmakers are also looking into consolidation and concentration issues within the dairy sector. The dairy industry has evolved into a national market with advancements in milk marketing and government intervention. In the mid-1850s, milk was mainly consumed locally, but as urban areas grew, it was sent to processors. By the 20th century, producers formed cooperative associations for bargaining power. In the early 20th century, dairy farmers formed cooperative associations to negotiate with milk buyers collectively. The Capper-Volstead Act of 1922 provided limited antitrust exemption to farmer cooperatives. By 1925, handlers started paying farmers based on classified pricing for fluid-grade milk, which is still used today. During the Great Depression, demand for milk dropped sharply, leading to the breakdown of the classified pricing system. Federal milk marketing orders (FMMOs) were established to stabilize the market, equalize the market power of dairy farmers and processors, and ensure consumers had access to milk at reasonable prices. Import quotas on dairy products were also enacted to protect producers from foreign competition. During World War II, demand for farm commodities, including milk, increased. In the late 1940s, the government implemented the Dairy Product Price Support Program to protect against price declines. Additional programs like the Dairy Export Incentives Program and Milk Income Loss Contract were added to national dairy policy. These advancements in milk marketing have significantly changed the U.S. dairy industry. Advancements in milk marketing have transformed the U.S. dairy industry over the last century. In the early 20th century, raw milk was transported to processing plants by truck or rail, with milk primarily bottled for home delivery. This local production and consumption of fluid milk persisted for decades. Advancements in transportation and packaging in the 20th century led to a national milk and dairy product market. Retail milk shifted to stores in plastic or paper containers, with bulk milk now transported long distances by tanker trucks to meet market demands. The dairy industry involves local farm milk production and dairy manufacturing plants shipping products like cheese, yogurt, and flavored milk to distribution centers nationwide. A longstanding issue is the relationship between farm and retail prices, with concerns raised about the slow decline in retail food prices compared to falling farm prices in late 2008. This led to a decrease in the farm value share and raised questions about the role of processors and retailers in contributing to economic stress in the agricultural sector, especially for dairy. Retailers are causing economic stress in the agricultural sector, particularly for dairy farmers. Factors such as increased agricultural productivity, demand for value-added products, and changes in food marketing have led to a decline in the farm share of the retail food dollar. In 1950, the farm share was 41%, but by 2006, it had dropped to 18.5%. The farm share of the retail food dollar for milk and dairy products is approximately one-third, higher than the all-food average due to lower processing. The trend for milk and dairy products remained generally flat between 2000 and 2008, with slight uptrends for some products like cheddar. Labor, packaging, profit, transportation, and energy account for the remaining 81.5% of the retail price. The farm-share trend for milk and dairy products was generally flat, with a slight uptrend for cheddar cheese. Between July 2008 and January 2009, the farm price of milk fell, leading to an increase in the marketing margin between farm and retail prices. The farm price of milk reached a record-high of $2.43 per gallon, but retail prices decreased due to lower costs for farm milk and other inputs. The price difference between farm and retail prices dropped to $1.69 per gallon in December, below the recent five-year average margin. Retail price response to farm price changes has time lags of months. Retail prices in food markets adjust faster and more significantly to increases in farm prices than to decreases, a phenomenon known as \"sticky\" retail food prices. Consumer behavior, store preferences, and inventory management can limit these adjustments. Recent economic research suggests that retail prices may not fully adjust to downward farm price movements due to factors such as consumer behavior, store preferences, and inventory management. This can result in a \"disconnect\" between farm and retail prices for agricultural products, especially for stores that offer additional services rather than compete on prices. Consolidation in agriculture has led to fewer and larger operations, including in the dairy sector. Larger operations have lower costs and can increase market share, resulting in fewer dairy farms needed. Firm size limits growth once economies of scale are maximized. Consolidation in the dairy industry has led to increased concentration, with a small number of firms controlling most of the sales or purchases. This trend is seen at the farm, cooperative, and processor levels, as larger operations aim to offset market power of retailers and improve efficiency. Despite a decline in the number of dairy operations, advancements in technology have led to increased dairy cow output. Advancements in dairy farm technology and management have led to a sharp reduction in the number of dairy farms, with annual losses decreasing over time. Despite the decline in dairy farm operations, steady increases in productivity have resulted in a continuous upward trend in total milk production. Domestic demand for milk and milk products has grown slowly in recent years. The per-capita consumption of dairy products has grown slowly since 1990, with cheese consumption offsetting a decline in fluid milk products. Dairy exports have increased, reaching record levels in 2008. Farm numbers have varied based on size, with smaller farms declining and larger farms increasing due to lower production costs. In 2009, dairy farms with 1,000 head or more produced 47% of U.S. milk output, while farms with fewer than 100 head only accounted for 16%. The share of milk produced by large farms increased from 35% in 2005 to 47% in 2009 due to lower production costs. Large dairy farms in the U.S. have seen an increase in milk production, with farms of 1,000 head or more accounting for 47% of the output in 2009. These larger farms benefit from scale economies, modern facilities, and automated systems, leading to lower production costs. Farm sizes vary by region, with western states like California having larger farms with 850 cows on average, while Wisconsin has smaller farms with an average of 88 cows. The average farm size in the U.S. is 133 cows per farm, with cost structures also varying by state. In the U.S., dairy farms vary in size and cost structure by state. Western states with large farms face high feed costs, while farms in Wisconsin with smaller herds benefit from lower operating costs when grain and feed prices rise. Cooperative ownership is common in the industry. Dairy cooperatives, owned by farmers, manage milk distribution and product manufacturing. The number of dairy cooperatives has been decreasing since the 1940s due to mergers for economic benefits. The number of dairy cooperatives has decreased over time due to mergers for economic gains. In 1940-1941, there were over 2,300 cooperatives accounting for half of farm milk marketings. By 2007, only 155 cooperatives remained, but they controlled 83% of the market share. Consolidations and alliances have allowed cooperatives to serve large retail customers efficiently. Consolidation in the retail sector has led to consolidation within cooperatives. In 2008, the top four dairy cooperatives in the United States accounted for 40% of milk production. The National Milk Producers Federation emphasizes the importance of the Capper-Volstead Act. The Capper-Volstead Act allows farmers in milk producer cooperatives to take cooperative action and improve their bargaining position with milk handlers. Some producers believe cooperatives may work against their interests. The dairy processing industry includes processing milk for consumption and manufacturing dairy products like butter and cheese. Various factors have impacted the industry in recent decades. The dairy processing industry has been affected by changes in demand, technological advancements, and shifts in the retail sector. This has led to a decline in the number of dairy firms and an increase in plant and firm sizes to cater to high-volume retailers and large customers. The number of dairy manufacturing plants in the United States has stabilized around 1,100 facilities, with the largest dairy processor/manufacturing companies operating 9 to 81 plants. Concentration trends in the industry are similar to other food processing sectors, with a four-firm concentration ratio of 35% for cheese processing and 43% for fluid milk processing in 2002. Industry concentration in the food processing sector varies, with dairy processing having a concentration ratio of 49%. Other industries like meatpacking and soybean processing are even more concentrated. Local markets can be highly concentrated, raising concerns for farmers and policymakers. The fluid milk industry saw an increase in concentration after a merger in 2001, but it remains slightly below the average level. The retail sector for food products has undergone significant changes in recent years, with nontraditional retailers like discount stores and warehouse clubs competing with traditional supermarkets. This has led to consolidation in the U.S. grocery retailing industry. Consolidation in the U.S. grocery retailing industry has increased over the years, with the top four firms accounting for 36% of national sales by 2005. This trend is relevant for food product suppliers negotiating sales terms with retailers. Local-level concentration in the retail food sector is even higher, with four-firm concentration shares averaging 74% in specific market areas in 2003. In 2003, four-firm concentration shares in specific market areas averaged 74%, ranging from 63% to 85%. Local-level concentration is crucial for consumers due to limited choices among food stores. Retail consolidation has had a significant impact on the dairy industry. One significant impact of retail consolidation and concentration in the dairy industry is the increase in size and market share of processors and manufacturers to meet the demands of food retailers for lower-cost products. Concerns about reduced competition and market power exist, but efficiency gains may lead to cost savings for consumers through lower retail prices. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that concentration in the processing and retail sectors of the beef, pork, and dairy industries did not adversely affect agricultural commodity or retail food prices. Studies showed no evidence of market power, with efficiency effects outweighing market power effects. The GAO report found that concentration in dairy processing may increase in the future, raising concerns about market power and price manipulation. Efficiency gains from concentration were noted, with little impact on commodity or food prices overall. The GAO report found that efficiency benefits outweighed market power effects in dairy processing. It also mentioned that dairy cooperatives can counterbalance the market power of dairy processors. Additionally, the report reviewed studies showing evidence of market power in regional retail milk markets, such as noncompetitive behavior in certain metropolitan markets and market power among retailers in the Boston area. The GAO report highlighted concerns about market concentration in the Boston retail fluid milk market, with experts predicting increased concentration leading to fewer retail outlets. Large retail firms may be pressuring food processors to consolidate, potentially leading to further concentration at the food processor level. Price transparency in dairy product markets is also a concern for policymakers and industry participants. Market concentration in the dairy industry has led to fewer transactions, weakening price discovery. Integrated markets with custom contracts result in fewer trades on the spot market, reducing transparency and efficiency. The primary spot market for dairy is located at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), where cheese, butter, and nonfat dry milk are traded. Prices determined at this market are used to establish wholesale price contracts nationwide, with USDA setting monthly minimum prices for farm milk based on these prices. Some dairy producer groups believe the CME is an inadequate pricing mechanism. Some dairy producer groups criticize the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) as an inadequate pricing mechanism due to concerns about market transparency, oversight, and volatility. A 2007 GAO study highlighted the susceptibility of the CME spot cheese market to manipulation, with a small number of trades and traders making it vulnerable. However, industry participants believe any manipulation would be short-lived. Many large participants in the cheese and dairy industry closely monitor the market and are prepared to trade if prices become disconnected from supply and demand conditions, potentially counteracting price manipulation attempts. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the CME monitor spot market activities for signs of manipulation, with some industry participants aiming to increase sales volume on the CME to reduce manipulation risks. In December 2008, several dairy industry participants agreed to pay a penalty for attempted manipulation. In 2008, dairy industry participants paid a penalty for attempting to manipulate milk futures prices through cheese purchases on the CME. The CME introduced new futures and options contracts for skimmed milk powder as a global risk management tool. Producers and policymakers are interested in expanding USDA's price reporting system for dairy products to improve price transparency. In the 2008 farm bill, Congress authorized more frequent price reporting for dairy products, subject to appropriations. U.S. antitrust laws focus on competition in markets and prohibit unlawful mergers and business practices. The Sherman Act and the Clayton Act are the two basic antitrust laws in the United States, enforceable by the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission. The Sherman Act and the Clayton Act are two key antitrust laws in the United States enforced by the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission. The Sherman Act prohibits activities that restrain trade, including monopolization, with violations subject to fines of up to $1 million. The Clayton Act prohibits mergers or acquisitions that may lessen competition, with penalties of up to $1 million for individuals and $100 million for corporations. The Act aims to prevent activities that might restrain trade, and the \"Merger Guidelines\" issued by DOJ and FTC are being updated to reflect this. The Clayton Act allows for premerger notification to examine potential mergers/acquisitions before consummation. Remedies include legal action to stop mergers or conditioning approval on modifications to address antitrust concerns. The Capper-Volstead Act provides limited antitrust exemption for farmer cooperatives, allowing them to collaborate on processing and marketing agricultural products. This exemption aims to avoid costly and risky court battles over antitrust issues. In April 2009, Dean Foods, the largest fluid milk processor in the United States, purchased two plants owned by Foremost Farms, a cooperative in Wisconsin. The Department of Justice (DOJ) and several states filed a civil antitrust suit against Dean Foods, alleging that the purchase violated the Clayton Act. DOJ asserts that Dean's acquisition will eliminate a price competitor in the market. DOJ claims that Dean's acquisition of Foremost Farms will reduce competition in the milk market for schools and grocery chains in Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin. This will eliminate head-to-head competition between the two companies, impacting school milk and fluid milk purchases. The lawsuit seeks to require Dean Foods to sell dairy processing plants acquired from Foremost Farms, as Dean Foods now holds 57% of the market for processed milk in certain regions. Dean Foods defends the acquisition, stating it complies with antitrust laws and benefits dairy farmers by providing a stable outlet for their milk, resulting in cost savings for consumers and increased competition. The ongoing case against Dean Foods highlights the economics of consolidation in the U.S. dairy industry, with a class action antitrust complaint filed against four major firms in the Northeast dairy market. The U.S. District Court for Vermont is hearing a case on behalf of Northeast dairy farmers against Dairy Farmers of America, Inc., Dairy Marketing Services, Dean Foods, and HP Hood. The lawsuit alleges a conspiracy to control the supply of fluid milk in the region, leading to lower prices for farmers. This case sheds light on the consolidation in the U.S. dairy industry. The lawsuit alleges that dairy producers in the Northeast must affiliate with either DFA or DMS due to exclusive supply agreements with Dean Foods and HP Hood, leading to market power abuse to the detriment of independent producers and cooperatives. DFA claims to have increased returns for farmers through cost-saving efficiencies. The cooperative focuses on increasing producer returns and cost-saving efficiencies in field services, hauling, and administration. Litigation involving multiple class action lawsuits against Dean Foods, National Dairy Holdings, and DFA may take years to resolve. Determining the net effect of concentration on market power and efficiency gains is complex due to various influencing factors. Market power and efficiency gains in the dairy industry are influenced by factors like product differentiation, market entry ease, and contract structures. Efficiency improvements can come from technology advancements and business practices. Commodity prices are also impacted by economic events and government policies, making it challenging to isolate the effects of concentration."
