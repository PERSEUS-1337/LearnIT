Congress finds that Americans cherish healthy oceans and wildlife, feel a strong moral responsibility to protect marine ecosystems, and recognize the importance of habitats in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas for a variety of wildlife species. The Arctic ecosystems are crucial for Alaska Native cultures and are experiencing significant changes due to climate change, impacting species like polar bears. The US Fish and Wildlife Service proposed listing the polar bear as a threatened species in 2007. The polar bear, a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, relies on sea ice to hunt seals. The Department of the Interior missed a deadline to decide on protections for the polar bear and proceeded with oil and gas leasing in the Chukchi Sea Lease Sale 193 area. The Sale 193 area, spanning 29.4 million acres offshore Alaska, is polar bear habitat. A court ruling in 2008 required the Department of the Interior to decide on listing the polar bear under the Endangered Species Act by May 15, 2008. Reports in 2007 projected significant loss of polar bear habitat due to future sea ice conditions. The future of polar bears is at risk due to global warming and potential oil and gas development in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas, leading to a projected decline in their population by the middle of the 21st century. The observed trajectory of Arctic sea ice decline may be underestimated, posing additional risks to polar bears and other marine life in the region. The Beaufort and Chukchi Seas face challenges in recovering spilled oil due to harsh environments, especially during icy periods. The Minerals Management Service plans to lease millions of acres in these areas, overlapping with vital polar bear habitat. The Minerals Management Service warns of significant risks to polar bear population and other marine mammals from large oil spills in the Arctic Ocean, particularly during the broken-ice period. Lack of information on marine mammal ecology and habitat use is also noted. Tribal governments oppose offshore oil and gas development in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas due to threats to subsistence resources, public health, and cultural survival. Onshore industrial activities can harm habitat and disturb wildlife, including denning polar bears. Prohibition on leasing in Beaufort and Chukchi Sea planning areas. Section 8 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act prohibits leasing in the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea planning areas until missing information on marine and coastal ecosystems is identified by the National Research Council. The curr_chunk focuses on the composition, distribution, status, and ecology of living marine resources in the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea ecosystems, particularly in relation to climate change impacts and baseline information for potential impacts. The curr_chunk discusses the impacts of oil and gas activities on plant and animal species, marine environments, and Alaskan Native communities. It also evaluates the adequacy of environmental, public health, and cultural studies conducted in Alaska. The curr_chunk discusses evaluating ongoing and completed studies related to the impacts of oil and gas activities on plant and animal species, marine environments, and Alaskan Native communities. It includes identifying missing information, assessing study adequacy, and making recommendations for additional research. The curr_chunk discusses requirements for providing missing information related to the listing of polar bears under the Endangered Species Act and oil spill response gaps. The curr_chunk addresses the need for an oil spill response gap analysis for arctic oil operations and sets a standard for recovery of spilled oil within 30 days. The curr_chunk sets a standard for oil spill response in arctic environments, requiring 85 percent oil recovery within 30 days before issuing leases or approving exploration plans. The curr_chunk establishes requirements for oil spill prevention systems and operational restrictions to ensure 85 percent oil recovery in any ice condition or season, close areas to oil and gas activity when necessary, and minimize spill risks. The curr_chunk states that the Secretary must ensure all recommendations are implemented, and oil and gas activities in the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea Planning Areas do not pose a substantial risk to wildlife or habitat. The Secretary must ensure all recommendations are implemented to prevent risks to wildlife and habitat from oil and gas activities in the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea Planning Areas, including identifying mitigation measures and assessing their effectiveness. The response gap and response gap analysis are defined terms in this subsection. The curr_chunk discusses calculating response operating limits of spill response systems for various environmental factors and assessing local response capabilities and oil spill contingency plans. The curr_chunk explains the factors that can cause variables to exceed system limits when combined, assessing the frequency, duration, and timing of limiting factors that may prevent achieving oil spill recovery standards. The curr_chunk discusses quantifying the percentage of time local conditions exceed spill response system limits to achieve oil spill recovery standards, using environmental and climate data for a specific location."
