    "content": "President Trump proposes to resume development of the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository in Nevada, which was previously suspended under the Obama Administration. The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget request includes $120 million for the Department of Energy for Yucca Mountain and interim nuclear waste storage, along with an additional $47.7 million for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to resume the licensing process. The House passed an FY2019 appropriations bill for Energy and Water Development, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs (H.R. 5895) on June 8, 2018, including $100 million more than the Administration requested for Yucca Mountain. The Senate version of the bill passed on June 25, 2018, with no Yucca Mountain funding. Yucca Mountain is the only site under consideration by the Department of Energy for a national high-level radioactive waste repository. The Obama Administration halted funding for the Yucca Mountain radioactive waste repository project in 2010 and moved to withdraw the license application. Despite Congress approving the funding halt, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act still designates Yucca Mountain as the sole repository candidate site. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future was established to develop a new nuclear waste policy after the termination of the Yucca Mountain project. The Blue Ribbon Commission (BRC) recommended the establishment of a new organization to develop nuclear waste repositories and storage facilities through a consent-based process. They also suggested conducting research on waste disposal technologies. The DOE issued a Strategy for the Management and Disposal of Used Nuclear Fuel and High-Level Waste in response to the BRC report, calling for a new nuclear waste management entity to develop consent-based storage and disposal sites. The strategy included plans for a pilot interim spent fuel storage facility by 2021, a larger-scale storage facility by 2025, and a geologic disposal facility by 2048. The DOE issued a draft consent-based siting process for the Yucca Mountain repository in 2017. The House approved a bill in 2018 to withdraw the site from other uses. This would fulfill a licensing condition identified by the NRC staff in their Safety Evaluation Report. The NRC staff issued a Safety Evaluation Report (SER) in response to a court order for the Yucca Mountain repository. The report concluded that the repository design met safety and environmental standards but recommended not authorizing construction until all requirements were met. A supplemental environmental impact statement was completed in May 2016. The NRC completed a supplemental EIS for Yucca Mountain in May 2016 and made licensing documents publicly available. Then-NRC Chairman Stephen Burns stated that $330 million was needed for the licensing process, including adjudicatory hearings on 300 issues. The Trump Administration requested $47.7 million for NRC licensing activities in FY2019 and $120 million for DOE to defend its license application and develop interim storage. The Obama Administration proposed a separate underground repository for high-level radioactive waste and spent fuel from nuclear defense activities, reversing a 1985 decision to dispose of defense and civilian nuclear waste together. Then-Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz suggested that a defense-only repository could be easier to site, license, and construct due to the smaller volume of defense waste. The DOE suggested a defense-only nuclear waste repository could be developed outside the Nuclear Waste Policy Act framework, subject to U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensing and NWPA requirements. The DOE's draft plan estimated that disposal of defense waste could start about 22 years after a consent-based siting process. However, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) criticized the plan for excluding major costs and having an overly optimistic schedule. Republican leaders also criticized the plan for a defense-only nuclear waste repository. Legislation introduced on January 11, 2017 (H.R. 433) aims to block development of a defense-only nuclear waste repository until the NRC issues a licensing decision on the Yucca Mountain repository. Similar provisions are included in nuclear waste legislation (H.R. 3053) passed by the House on May 10, 2018. The FY2019 appropriations bill includes provisions authorizing DOE to develop consent-based pilot interim storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel. The Senate passed H.R. 5895 on June 25, 2018, which includes provisions for priority storage of spent fuel at pilot facilities. The Department of Energy (DOE) would need consent from the governor, local jurisdictions, and affected Indian tribes to select a site for a pilot storage facility. DOE must report to Congress on compensation for host jurisdictions and a mechanism to ensure transfer of waste to a permanent repository. The Senate passed H.R. 5895 on June 25, 2018, which includes provisions for priority storage of spent fuel at pilot facilities. A pilot storage facility would be moved to a permanent underground repository using a consent-based siting process \"within a reasonable time.\" Consent-based siting provisions for a monitored retrievable storage facility are included in a nuclear waste bill (H.R. 3053) passed by the House on May 10, 2018. The bill passed by the House on May 10, 2018, would authorize DOE to store spent nuclear fuel at interim storage facilities owned by non-federal entities with consent from the governor, local government, and affected Indian tribes. Legislation introduced in the 114th Congress aimed to implement recommendations for nuclear waste storage and disposal facilities. Holtec International filed an NRC license application for a spent fuel storage facility in New Mexico near the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. The facility will hold 10,000 canisters of spent fuel in below-grade concrete silos, developed in 20 phases over 20 years. Each phase will consist of 500 canisters containing up to 8,680 metric tons of spent fuel. The waste management company Waste Control Specialists (WCS) filed an application for an NRC license to develop an interim storage facility for spent nuclear fuel in Texas. WCS later formed a joint venture with Orano USA called Waste Control Partners and submitted a renewed application for the Texas facility. The proposed facility will consist of 500 canisters per phase, with a total storage capacity of 120,000 metric tons. The Waste Control Specialists (WCS) applied for a license to build a spent fuel storage facility in Texas near Andrews, TX. The facility would store spent fuel for up to 40 years with possible extensions, with the Department of Energy (DOE) covering costs through the Nuclear Waste Fund. WCS had aimed to complete construction by 2022 before requesting a license application suspension. The Waste Control Specialists (WCS) applied for a license to build a spent fuel storage facility in Texas near Andrews, TX, with DOE covering costs through the Nuclear Waste Fund. Legislation has been introduced to authorize DOE to enter contracts with non-federal interim storage facilities for spent fuel. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget request included funding for Yucca Mountain, but it was not approved by Congress. For FY2019, the Administration is seeking $110 million for DOE to seek an NRC license for the repository, and $47.7 million for NRC. The Trump Administration is seeking $110 million for DOE to seek an NRC license for the repository, with NRC receiving $47.7 million to consider the application. Additionally, $10 million would go towards developing interim nuclear waste storage facilities. The total DOE funding for nuclear waste in FY2019 would be $120 million, sourced from two appropriations accounts. The House passed the Appropriations bill with $100 million extra for Yucca Mountain, while the Senate version had no funding for it. DOE stopped collecting nuclear waste fees in 2014 due to a court ruling, and uncertainty surrounds the future of the nuclear waste program. The U.S. Court of Appeals ordered the DOE to stop collecting fees for nuclear waste disposal, totaling about $750 million per year. The court found DOE's waste plans too vague to estimate costs accurately, with a range of uncertainty of nearly $7 trillion. The Trump Administration announced a new cost assessment for the Yucca Mountain program to determine the nuclear waste fee. NRC approved a final rule on continued storage of spent nuclear fuel, replacing the earlier waste confidence rule struck down by the U.S. Court of Appeals. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that the NRC should have conducted an environmental review before issuing the waste confidence findings in 2010. NRC must ensure safe waste management before licensing new nuclear plants. After the court struck down the waste confidence rule, NRC halted licensing of new facilities generating radioactive waste. NRC approved the continued storage rule in August 2014, ending the suspension of final licensing decisions for new reactors and spent fuel storage facilities. A consolidated lawsuit challenging NRC's continued storage rule was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals in June 2016. NRC proposed a modification of its low-level waste disposal regulations in March 2015. The NRC proposed modifications to low-level waste disposal regulations in March 2015, aiming to establish time periods for technical analyses of waste sites for public protection. The final version was submitted for approval in September 2016, with further revisions issued in September 2017. Nuclear waste, often referred to as the Achilles' heel, contains low concentrations of radioactive materials that decay quickly. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act focuses on Yucca Mountain, NV, as a repository for highly radioactive waste, opposed by the State of Nevada. The State of Nevada strongly opposes the planned Yucca Mountain repository due to safety concerns such as volcanic activity, earthquakes, water infiltration, and nuclear chain reactions. The DOE determined Yucca Mountain suitable for a repository under the George W. Bush Administration, but the Obama Administration delayed the licensing process. The Obama Administration decided not to open the Yucca Mountain repository due to Nevada's opposition. Funding for the project was halted in FY2011, leading to the closure of the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management. President Trump plans to restart the Yucca Mountain project, requesting $120 million in his FY2019 budget. DOE would receive $110 million for an NRC license, NRC would get $47.7 million to review the application, and $10 million would go towards interim waste storage facilities. The Obama Administration filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application with prejudice, receiving support from Nevada but opposition from states with defense-related and civilian radioactive waste. State utility regulators also intervened, arguing against the dismissal of the Yucca Mountain application. The Obama Administration filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application, but faced opposition from states with defense-related and civilian radioactive waste. The ASLB denied DOE's withdrawal motion, ruling that NRC must determine the repository's acceptability first. NRC commissioners upheld this decision, but halted further consideration due to budget constraints. Lawsuits were filed to overturn the license withdrawal on statutory grounds. Lawsuits were filed to overturn the Yucca Mountain license withdrawal, with the U.S. Court of Appeals ruling that NRC must continue work on the application as long as funding is available. NRC directed staff to complete the Yucca Mountain safety evaluation report, issuing Volume 3 in October 2014. NRC issued Volume 3 of the Safety Evaluation Report (SER) for DOE's Yucca Mountain repository in October 2014, stating compliance with safety standards for 1 million years. Final two volumes of SER were issued in January 2015. NRC required completion of land and water rights requirements and a supplement to DOE's environmental impact statement before authorizing construction. Supplemental EIS was completed in May 2016, with Yucca Mountain licensing documents made publicly available. NRC Chairman Stephen Burns led the process. The Yucca Mountain project was halted in 2010, and the Obama Administration established the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future to explore alternative waste disposal strategies. NRC Chairman Stephen Burns testified that an additional $330 million in appropriations would be needed to complete the licensing process, including adjudicatory hearings on numerous issues raised by the State of Nevada and others. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended the establishment of a new nuclear waste management entity with consent-based selection of storage and disposal sites. DOE issued a strategy for managing nuclear waste in 2013, calling for the development of such sites. The DOE strategy for nuclear waste management includes plans for opening interim storage facilities by 2021 and a geologic disposal facility by 2048. Public input is being sought to develop a consent-based siting process. The DOE issued a draft consent-based siting process on January 12, 2017, with five phases: initiation and community outreach, preliminary site assessment for interim storage and permanent repository. Legislation would fund a waste management agency for this process. Phase 3 involves a detailed site assessment for interim storage and repository, taking 2-4 years. Communities with suitable sites would then decide on hosting facilities. Phase 4 includes an agreement process lasting 1-2 years for interim storage and 2-5 years for repository, involving negotiations between the potential host community and waste management agency. Phase 5 covers licensing, construction, operation, and closure of the facilities. Phase 5 involves licensing, construction, operation, and closure of the facilities. Licensing and construction timelines are estimated at up to 5 years for an interim storage facility and 15 years for a repository. The Trump Administration's proposal aims to restart the Yucca Mountain project in FY2019, providing funding for various aspects such as legal and technical support for the license application to NRC. The request includes $10 million for interim storage planning and management. The nuclear power industry supports completing the NRC's licensing review of Yucca Mountain and pursuing alternative storage and disposal facilities within 20 years of opening a consolidated storage site. The safety of geologic disposal of nuclear waste depends on the characteristics of the rock formations where a repository would be excavated. The safety of geologic disposal of nuclear waste relies on the characteristics of rock formations for repository excavation. Despite global consensus on geologic isolation as the best long-term solution, specific site applications have proven challenging, as seen in the Yucca Mountain controversy. The DOE's proposed high-level waste sites have faced flaws like water intrusion and earthquake vulnerability, raising concerns about releasing radioactivity. Predicting waste site performance over 1 million years is uncertain. Public controversy surrounds waste transportation routes. President Obama's budgets included research on technologies to reduce waste volume. The Bush Administration proposed large-scale facilities to reprocess and recycle spent nuclear fuel by separating long-lived elements like plutonium. However, reprocessing has been controversial due to cost concerns and potential weapons use. The Obama Administration shifted DOE's nuclear waste research towards fundamental science, moving away from near-term reprocessing facility development. The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget request continued this focus. The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget request would reduce DOE funding for nuclear spent fuel reprocessing, focusing on a long-term, science-based approach. President Bush recommended the Yucca Mountain site to Congress in 2002, with Nevada Governor Guinn submitting a state veto. An approval resolution was signed by President Bush in July 2002. President Bush signed an approval resolution in July 2002 (P.L. 107-200) regarding civilian radioactive waste disposal. Low-level waste from nuclear power plants, medical institutions, and research activities is currently disposed of in large trenches in South Carolina, Texas, and Washington. The Washington facility only accepts waste from its region, while the South Carolina site is limited to members of the Atlantic disposal compact. The lowest-concentration class of low-level radioactive waste is accepted by a Utah commercial disposal facility from anywhere in the United States. Threats by states to close their disposal facilities led to congressional authorization of regional compacts for low-level waste disposal in 1985. The first new disposal site under the regional compact system opened in Texas in 2011. The Texas Legislature approved legislation to allow up to 30% of the facility's capacity to be used by states outside the Texas Compact. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA) authorized DOE to enter contracts with U.S. generators of spent nuclear fuel for disposal. DOE missed the deadline to begin disposing of waste, leading to lawsuits from nuclear utilities for additional storage costs. DOE's missed deadline for nuclear waste disposal led to lawsuits from utilities for additional storage costs. A settlement with PECO Energy allowed them to keep $80 million in waste fee revenues, but other utilities sued DOE, arguing that fees should only fund the waste program, not compensate for missed deadlines. The court ruled that compensation must come from general revenues, not the waste fund. Subsequent nuclear waste compensation to utilities has come from the U.S. Treasury's Judgment Fund, totaling about $6.9 billion by FY2017. 39 lawsuits settled, representing 84% of U.S. nuclear electricity generation, with 46 cases receiving final court judgments. \"Utilities submit annual reimbursement claims to DOE for delay-related nuclear waste storage costs. Disagreements go to arbitration. Those not settled with DOJ seek compensation through the U.S. Court of Federal Claims for incurred damages. Court of Claims awards cover only past damages, requiring ongoing claims for future costs.\" DOE estimates potential liabilities for waste program delays at $34.1 billion, including $6.9 billion already paid. Delays could lead to environmental enforcement action over DOE's high-level waste. Some waste is stored in noncompliance, risking fines if not removed according to compliance schedules. The DOE must charge a fee on nuclear power generation to pay for the nuclear waste program, but fee collections were suspended in May 2014 after the Yucca Mountain project was halted. The nuclear industry and state utility regulators sued to stop further fee collection, leading to petitions filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals by NARUC and NEI. The Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) and state utility regulators filed suits in 2010 to stop the collection of $750 million per year in fees for nuclear waste disposal. The DOE argued that the fees were necessary for future disposal costs, with Energy Secretary Steven Chu determining in November 2010 that excess funds were not being collected. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that Secretary Chu's decision to maintain nuclear waste fees unchanged was not valid, ordering a more thorough study within six months. The court emphasized the need to evaluate alternative costs and timing, as the fees were based on projections for the now terminated Yucca Mountain site. DOE conducted a new fee adequacy assessment in January 2013 to evaluate various waste management scenarios. Results showed costs exceeding projected revenues by up to $2 trillion or a surplus of $5 trillion. Due to the varying outcomes, DOE concluded that there was no clear evidence to raise or lower fees. Following a review request by NEI and NARUC, the Circuit Court ordered DOE to stop collecting nuclear waste fees on November 19, 2013. The court ordered DOE to stop collecting nuclear waste fees on November 19, 2013, as their waste plans were too vague for cost estimation. DOE ceased fee collection from nuclear power generators on May 16, 2014. The Trump Administration planned to restart the Yucca Mountain program and conduct a new fee adequacy assessment based on previous cost estimates. The DOE filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application with prejudice, stating that a geologic repository at Yucca Mountain is not a viable option for nuclear waste disposal. This decision was not based on scientific or technical findings but on the Obama Administration's policy change. The Obama Administration's policy change led to the DOE's decision to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application with prejudice, citing opposition from Nevada and the need for a waste solution with greater public acceptance. The ASLB denied the withdrawal motion, stating that DOE cannot terminate the project unilaterally until NRC determines the repository's acceptability. DOE appealed the ASLB decision to NRC commissioners, arguing that the Secretary of Energy has the authority to make policy decisions regarding nuclear waste disposal, including discontinuing the Yucca Mountain project. After a tie vote by NRC commissioners, the licensing board's denial of the license withdrawal was upheld. NRC stopped further consideration of the license application due to budget constraints. Plaintiffs, including Nye County, NV, petitioned the court to compel NRC to continue the licensing proceedings. The Court of Appeals ruled that NRC must proceed with the Yucca Mountain license application as long as funding was available. The NRC had $11.1 million in funds for the Yucca Mountain project. An additional $330 million is needed for the licensing review, with DOE estimating their costs at $1.9 billion. The Trump Administration plans to resume NRC consideration. The Trump Administration proposes to resume consideration of the NRC license for the Yucca Mountain project, with a budget request of $110 million for a program office and legal support. An additional $30 million is requested by NRC to restart the adjudicatory proceeding. NRC must ensure safe disposal of nuclear waste before issuing licenses, as mandated by a 1979 court decision. The NRC issued a Waste Confidence Decision in 1984, stating that nuclear waste could be safely stored at reactor sites for 30 years after plant closure, with a permanent repository available by 2007-2009. Due to delays in opening a repository, the decision was updated in 1990 to expect a repository by the early 21st century. In 2010, a new waste confidence rule was issued, stating a repository would be available \"when necessary.\" The 2010 waste confidence rule stated a repository would be available \"when necessary\" for safe waste storage at reactor sites for at least 60 years after shutdown. Lawsuits were filed to overturn this rule due to concerns about environmental risks, leading to a court ruling in 2012 that NRC must conduct an environmental review under NEPA. The court found flaws in NRC's rulemaking process. The court found flaws in NRC's rulemaking process regarding permanent storage availability and safety of on-site storage for spent fuel at nuclear plants. NRC's response to the court ruling led to a halt in licensing new facilities producing nuclear waste for over two years. NRC approved a final rule in 2014 on continued storage of spent nuclear fuel. The NRC approved a final rule in 2014 on continued storage of spent nuclear fuel to replace the waste confidence rule that had been struck down. The new rule describes environmental effects of waste storage based on a generic environmental impact statement (GEIS) analyzing three potential time periods of storage before a permanent repository is available. The NRC approved a final rule in 2014 for continued storage of spent nuclear fuel, based on a generic environmental impact statement (GEIS) analyzing three potential time periods of storage before a permanent repository is available. The timeframes include short-term (up to 60 years), long-term (up to 160 years), and indefinite. The environmental impact was deemed minimal, and a consolidated lawsuit challenging the rule was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals. The U.S. Court of Appeals rejected a proposal to overturn NRC's storage rule in 2016. Congressional controversy arose over the termination of work on the Yucca Mountain repository by the Obama Administration. President Trump's plan to restart the Yucca Mountain licensing process has shifted the nuclear waste debate in Congress. Senator Reid's retirement has also impacted the discussion, but new funding has not been provided by the 115th Congress. The 115th Congress has not provided new funding for Yucca Mountain, with the House approving funds for the project in FY2018 but the Senate not doing so. In FY2019, the House included $100 million above the Administration's funding request, while the Senate did not provide any funds. Concerns about nuclear waste were raised during the confirmation hearing for former Texas Governor Rick Perry as Secretary of Energy. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada expressed her concerns to Governor Perry about Yucca Mountain becoming a nuclear waste dumping ground. Despite their differences, she believes they can work together to prevent Yucca Mountain from being used for this purpose. The Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017 (H.R. 3053) aims to prevent Yucca Mountain from being used as a nuclear waste repository by withdrawing the site from public lands laws and placing it under DOE control. It also allows DOE to store spent fuel at an interim storage facility and increases the capacity limit of the Yucca Mountain repository to 110,000 metric tons. The House-passed bill for the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017 included changes from the Energy and Commerce Committee version, eliminating mandatory funding provisions. It aimed to address criticism of the Nuclear Waste Fund being used for deficit reduction by providing mandatory funding for repository development stages and allowing future waste fee collections to offset program appropriations. The bill also included provisions for Monitored Retrievable Storage (MRS) facilities. The House-passed bill for the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017 included provisions for Monitored Retrievable Storage (MRS) facilities. The bill specifies that DOE's acceptance of spent nuclear fuel at commercial reactor sites for storage at an MRS facility would transfer ownership to the Secretary of Energy. DOE would be authorized to site, construct, and operate MRS facilities, or store spent fuel at facilities developed by nonfederal entities with which DOE had reached an agreement. The Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017 allows DOE to enter into Monitored Retrievable Storage (MRS) agreements with nonfederal entities for spent nuclear fuel storage. Prior approvals are required from NRC, state governor, local government, and Indian tribe. A federal MRS facility may be considered if it can be built faster and cheaper than a nonfederal facility. The Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017 allows DOE to enter into Monitored Retrievable Storage (MRS) agreements with nonfederal entities for spent nuclear fuel storage. Spent fuel from closed reactors would have priority for shipment to an MRS. Appropriations for an MRS would come from the general fund, not the Nuclear Waste Fund. Storage at the MRS facility would be contingent on NRC approval for the Yucca Mountain repository or a determination of imminent approval by the Secretary of Energy. Construction of the MRS would halt if the repository license were revoked. The proposed Yucca Mountain repository would be located on 147,000 acres of federal land encompassing parts of DOE's Nevada Test Site and the Nellis Air Force Range, along with public land managed by the Bureau of Land Management. H.R. 3053 would permanently withdraw the site from uses authorized under federal public land laws, such as mineral leasing, and transfer jurisdiction to the Secretary of Energy for activities related to the repository. The Yucca Mountain repository site would be permanently withdrawn from federal public land laws, such as mineral leasing, and transferred to the Secretary of Energy for the development of a permanent underground repository for nuclear waste. The repository would not be subject to certain hazardous waste requirements, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission would need to make a final decision on construction authorization within 30 months after enactment. The Yucca Mountain site would be used for a permanent underground repository for nuclear waste, with a limit raised to 110,000 metric tons. DOE could conduct infrastructure activities before construction authorization. Planning for a separate repository for defense-related waste is prohibited until NRC decides on Yucca Mountain. Resumption of nuclear waste fees collection is tied to NRC approval. The collection of nuclear waste fees could not resume until NRC approved the Yucca Mountain repository. Fees collected would be limited to 90% of annual appropriations for DOE's waste management program. Any uncollected fees could be required to be paid later. Fees collected would offset appropriations, resulting in zero net appropriations during the process. The bill specifies that nuclear waste fees would offset appropriations, resulting in zero net appropriations during the process. The existing balance of the Nuclear Waste Fund would remain available for appropriation without offsets. The Secretary of Energy would be authorized to enter into a benefits agreement with the State of Nevada. The bill allows for benefits agreements with the State of Nevada and local governments, increasing annual payments to $15 million before spent fuel is received at Yucca Mountain. Nevada would receive $400 million upon the first spent fuel receipt and $40 million annually thereafter. Other affected local governments could also enter into agreements. Acceptance of an agreement does not imply consent to host the repository. All agreements are subject to congressional appropriation from the Nuclear Waste Fund. The Director of the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) would oversee functions of the Secretary of Energy established by NWPA, subject to congressional appropriation. The OCRWM Director could serve two five-year terms and be removed by the President for specific reasons. Nuclear waste management functions under the Department of Energy Organization Act would be transferred to OCRWM. The Nuclear Waste Informed Consent Act, introduced by Senator Heller and Representative Titus, would require the Secretary of Energy to obtain consent from State and local governments before using funds from the Nuclear Waste Fund for a repository. This legislation promotes a consent-based approach to siting nuclear waste repositories, as recommended by the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future. Similar legislation was introduced in the 114th Congress but was not enacted. The Sensible Nuclear Waste Disposition Act (H.R. 433) introduced by Representative Joe Wilson in the 115th Congress would delay DOE from developing a repository for defense nuclear waste until NRC issues a final decision on Yucca Mountain. Proposals for private-sector interim storage facilities in Texas and New Mexico have also gained congressional attention. H.R. 474 was introduced to authorize DOE to contract with privately owned spent fuel storage facilities. The Interim Consolidated Storage Act of 2017 (H.R. 474) introduced by Representative Issa allows DOE to take title to spent nuclear fuel from commercial reactors for private storage. Annual interest from the Nuclear Waste Fund can be used by DOE to pay for private interim storage without further congressional approval. This legislation is similar to previous bills introduced in the 114th Congress but not enacted. The Removing Nuclear Waste from our Communities Act of 2017 (H.R. 4442) authorizes DOE to store spent fuel from nuclear plants at privately owned consolidated storage facilities. Priority is given to nuclear plant sites with no currently operating reactors and a population of at least 15 million within a 50-mile radius. Legislation introduced by Senator Duckworth and Representative Schneider (S. 1903 and H.R. 3970) provides assistance to communities with stored spent fuel at closed reactor sites, offering $15 per kilogram of nuclear waste and reviving an expired tax credit. The Removing Nuclear Waste from our Communities Act of 2017 would provide $15 per kilogram of nuclear waste to communities, revive a tax credit for first-time homebuyers, and make them eligible for the New Markets Tax Credit. It also establishes a task force to simplify the process of applying for government assistance and requires the DOE to explore options for hosting decommissioned nuclear waste and study economic uses for closed reactor sites. Concerns have been raised in Congress about risks posed by spent fuel storage pools in nuclear power plants. The Dry Cask Storage Act of 2018 (H.R. 4891) introduced in the 115th Congress would require nuclear power plants to develop NRC-approved plans for moving spent fuel to dry storage casks within seven years. The Dry Cask Storage Act of 2018 (H.R. 4891) would expand emergency planning zones to 50 miles around non-compliant reactors. NRC could use interest from the Nuclear Waste Fund to help plants transfer spent fuel to dry storage. Similar legislation was introduced in previous Congresses. Murkowski, Feinstein, and Cantwell introduced legislation in 2015 (S. 854) to establish an independent Nuclear Waste Administration for nuclear waste storage and disposal facilities. The bill required consent from state, local, and tribal governments for facility siting and aimed to open a pilot storage facility by 2021 for nuclear waste from shutdown reactors. The Nuclear Waste Administration (NWA) was proposed to handle nuclear waste storage and disposal. A pilot storage facility for priority waste was planned by 2021, with a permanent repository by 2048. NWA could only request proposals for nonpriority waste storage after 10 years if funds were allocated for a permanent repository. The Nuclear Waste Administration (NWA) would have been authorized to offer financial compensation and incentives for hosting nuclear waste facilities. Sites with storage facilities and a repository would receive preference. Defense waste could be placed in defense-only facilities under S. 854. President Obama authorized a defense-only repository in 2015. Nuclear waste fees would be held in a Working Capital Fund. The Nuclear Waste Administration established a Working Capital Fund to fund S. 854 activities without annual limitations. The disposal limit of 70,000 metric tons for the first repository under NWPA would be removed. A Senate hearing on S. 1240 was held on July 30, 2013, with positive feedback from Energy Secretary Moniz and NARUC Electricity Committee Chairman Boyd. The Senate hearing on S. 1240 received positive feedback from Energy Secretary Moniz and NARUC Electricity Committee Chairman Boyd. The bill was considered a step in the right direction but was opposed by Natural Resources Defense Council Senior Attorney Geoffrey H. Fettus for various reasons. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved funding for DOE to develop a pilot spent fuel interim storage facility in the FY2017 Energy and Water bill. This included an authorization and a $10.0 million appropriation for a consent-based waste storage pilot facility. Similar language was also included in previous energy and water bills passed by the Senate. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved funding for a pilot spent fuel interim storage facility in the FY2017 Energy and Water bill. The debate over nuclear waste policy was influenced by the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident in Japan in 2011. The spent fuel pools at a plant were initially suspected to have boiled or leaked, potentially causing fuel damage and radioactive releases. However, later analysis showed the spent fuel did not overheat. A bill introduced by Senator Barbara Boxer in 2015 would require NRC to maintain safety and security at closed reactors until spent fuel is moved to dry storage, but it was not enacted. NRC released a study in 2013 stating that expedited transfer of spent fuel to dry cask storage would provide limited safety benefits. The expedited transfer of spent fuel to dry cask storage is deemed to provide only a minor safety benefit, with expected implementation costs not justified. Radioactive waste varies in characteristics, some being safe to handle while others remain dangerous for thousands of years. Major types of radioactive waste include spent nuclear fuel. Spent nuclear fuel, withdrawn from a reactor after irradiation, is highly radioactive and contains fission products and long-lived radionuclides like plutonium. The nuclear industry refers to it as \"used nuclear fuel\" as it could potentially be reprocessed to extract uranium and plutonium for new fuel. High-level waste is the highly radioactive residue created by spent fuel reprocessing, primarily for defense purposes in the United States. It contains most radioactive fission products, with uranium and plutonium usually removed for reuse. However, long-lived radioactive elements remain, requiring isolation for 10,000 years or more. Transuranic waste is low-activity waste with long-lived elements heavier than uranium, such as plutonium, requiring radiation shielding for handling. Transuranic waste, primarily plutonium, requires radiation shielding for handling. In the United States, it is generated mainly by nuclear weapons production processes. Long-term isolation is necessary due to the plutonium content. The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in Carlsbad, NM, is the nation's only permanent repository for TRU waste. It resumed underground waste emplacement in 2017 after a radioactive release suspension. Low-level waste, not classified as spent fuel or high-level waste, is also disposed of at the WIPP site. Low-level waste is radioactive waste that is not classified as spent fuel, high-level waste, TRU waste, or byproduct material. It is divided into four classes by the NRC based on radioactivity levels. Low-level waste disposal facilities have concentration limits set by the NRC. Uranium mill tailings are sand-like residues from uranium ore processing. Tailings are sand-like residues from uranium ore processing with low radioactivity but large volumes that can pose hazards like radon emissions and groundwater contamination. Mixed waste includes chemically hazardous waste with radioactive material, regulated by DOE or NRC for radioactive elements and EPA for nonradioactive elements. When spent nuclear fuel is removed from a reactor, it is thermally hot and highly radioactive, in the form of fuel assemblies containing metal-clad fuel rods. Fresh fuel rods contain enriched uranium U-235, but after nuclear fission, most U-235 nuclei have split into highly radioactive fission products. After nuclear fission, U-238 nuclei absorb neutrons and decay into radioactive plutonium and fission products. Spent fuel assemblies are stored in deep pools of water near reactors to prevent overheating and protect workers from radiation. Older fuel is sealed in dry canisters and transferred to shielded storage facilities. The NRC mandates that spent fuel cool for 7-10 years before being moved to dry storage. The U.S. commercial nuclear reactors store spent fuel at various sites, including 59 operating nuclear plant sites, 15 shutdown plant sites, and the Idaho National Laboratory. A large reactor discharges 20-30 metric tons of spent fuel annually, totaling about 2,200 metric tons for the entire industry each year. By the end of 2017, approximately 80,000 metric tons of spent fuel was stored at U.S. nuclear plants, with 30,000 metric tons in dry casks, surpassing the 70,000-metric-ton limit for Yucca Mountain. The total amount of existing waste would exceed NWPA's 70,000-metric-ton limit for Yucca Mountain, even without counting 7,000 metric tons of DOE spent fuel and high-level waste planned for disposal. DOE's estimates of spent fuel from U.S. reactors range from 105,000 to 130,000 metric tons, requiring interim storage or a permanent repository. The need for new storage capacity for nuclear waste is increasing due to the inability of the Department of Energy (DOE) to accept waste into its disposal system. Utilities are expected to build new dry storage facilities at reactor sites. Concerns about the vulnerability of stored spent fuel have been raised, especially after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The NRC released a report in January 2001 highlighting the potential risks of an aircraft crash or sabotage causing overheating of spent fuel. The NRC and NAS reports highlighted the risk of overheating spent fuel causing fires and releasing radioactivity. Recommendations include interspersing hotter and cooler fuel assemblies, installing spray systems, and transferring fuel to dry cask storage to reduce the likelihood of fires. The nuclear industry suggests transferring fuel from pools to dry cask storage as a safety measure. The NRC task force recommends having electrical power and water spray systems available for spent fuel pools. The NRC approved an order in 2012 requiring U.S. reactors to install improved water-level monitoring equipment at their spent fuel pools. In 2017, 5.1 million cubic feet of low-level waste with 57,179 curies of radioactivity was shipped to disposal sites. Volumes and radioactivity levels can vary based on nuclear decommissioning projects and cleanup activities. The total volume of low-level radioactive waste reported in 2016 was 1.7 million cubic feet, with Class A waste making up most of the volume. Class B and C waste contain the majority of the radioactivity. Most of the nation's Class B and C waste has been stored on-site since June 2008 due to the lack of a permanent disposal site. The Obama Administration halted development of the Yucca Mountain repository after FY2010, but it remains the sole candidate site for civilian highly radioactive waste disposal. The Trump Administration is proposing to revive the program in FY2019 with funding for Yucca Mountain and interim nuclear waste storage. DOE issued an alternative waste management strategy in January 2013 calling for a pilot facility. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 established a system for selecting a geologic repository for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste. DOE's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) was created to carry out the program, funded by the Nuclear Waste Fund. Obama's strategy in 2013 called for a pilot facility for spent fuel storage by 2021 and a new repository by 2048 at a volunteer location, requiring new legislation. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 established a system for selecting a geologic repository for nuclear waste disposal. The fee for the program is set at a tenth of a cent per kilowatt-hour and can be adjusted by the Secretary of Energy. DOE was required to select three candidate sites for the first national high-level waste repository, but the act was modified in 1987. The only candidate site DOE may consider for a permanent repository was specified in the amendments. The 1987 amendments to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act specified that Yucca Mountain, Nevada is the only candidate site for a permanent high-level waste repository. If Yucca Mountain cannot be licensed, DOE must seek further instructions from Congress. The amendments also allowed for the construction of a monitored retrievable storage facility to store spent fuel, but DOE cannot select a site for this facility until recommending the construction of a permanent repository at Yucca Mountain. The Obama Administration halted funding for the Yucca Mountain project and transferred its functions to DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future developed a new waste management strategy and concluded that specific sites for new nuclear waste facilities, including Yucca Mountain, were not evaluated. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future recommended a new, consent-based approach to siting nuclear waste facilities, stating that the existing policy with Yucca Mountain as the sole candidate site has broken down. This approach involves extensive negotiations with affected states, tribes, and local governments to establish legally binding agreements on project parameters. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future recommended a new, consent-based approach to siting nuclear waste facilities, emphasizing the need for negotiations with states, tribes, and local governments to establish legally binding agreements on project parameters. The commission highlighted the success of the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico as a model for the new waste management program. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future recommended establishing a congressionally chartered federal corporation for nuclear waste management, independent from Administration control but subject to congressional oversight and NRC regulation. They also called for administrative and legislative changes in the Nuclear Waste Fund to prioritize funding for the waste management program. Additionally, the commission urged the development of a permanent underground repository and interim central storage facilities. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future recommended establishing a federal corporation for nuclear waste management, independent from Administration control. They called for administrative changes in the Nuclear Waste Fund to prioritize funding for the program and urged the development of interim central storage facilities. In response, the DOE issued a Strategy for the Management and Disposal of Used Nuclear Fuel and High-Level Waste, planning to open a pilot interim spent fuel storage facility by 2021. The DOE planned to open an interim spent fuel storage facility by 2021 for fuel from decommissioned nuclear plants. A larger-scale facility with a capacity of 20,000 metric tons or more was set to open by 2025. The strategy aimed to prevent the storage facility from becoming a de facto repository and recommended linking it to the development of a permanent repository. However, current restrictions on the MRS hinder its construction. The DOE strategy aims to open a geologic disposal facility by 2048, with site selection by 2016 and completion of design and licensing by 2042. The process for selecting sites for storage and disposal facilities is to be \"consent based,\" but details on implementation are lacking. The Obama Administration's strategy for nuclear waste management involves consulting with Congress and interest groups to define consent and codify it. A bill introduced in the 114th Congress aimed to modify the waste program. The Obama Administration's waste strategy involves consulting with Congress and interest groups to define consent and codify it. A bill in the 114th Congress aimed to modify the waste program, including proposals for privatization. A report recommended testing a consent-based approach by siting a separate repository for defense and research waste, reversing the long-standing federal policy of a single repository for both civilian and defense waste. The Obama Administration's waste strategy involves planning a separate underground repository for high-level radioactive waste generated by nuclear defense activities, as recommended by a 2014 DOE report. President Obama authorized the Department of Energy to begin this planning on March 24, 2015. The Obama Administration authorized the Department of Energy to plan a separate underground repository for high-level radioactive waste from nuclear defense activities. GAO criticized DOE's analysis of the defense-only repository in January 2017, leading to bills introduced to delay the plan. President Obama blocked DOE's preferred rail route to Yucca Mountain in July 2015, but other potential rail routes were still available. Waste Control Specialists filed an application in April 2016 for an NRC license to develop a consolidated interim storage facility for spent nuclear fuel in Texas. WCS requested NRC to pause license application for a spent nuclear fuel storage facility in Texas due to high estimated costs. WCS later partnered with Orano USA to submit a renewed application in June 2018. The proposed facility would be located at a 14,000-acre site near Andrews, TX, with construction planned in eight phases using dry casks on concrete pads. The proposed spent fuel storage facility in Texas by WCS would consist of dry casks on concrete pads in eight phases, each capable of holding 5,000 metric tons of spent fuel. DOE would take title to the fuel, ship it to the Texas site, and pay WCS for storage for up to 40 years. WCS argues that a privately developed facility would not be bound by NWPA restrictions like the Yucca Mountain project. The DOE is prohibited from building a storage facility without progress on Yucca Mountain. Holtec International filed an NRC license application for a spent fuel storage facility in New Mexico near the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. Local officials support additional waste facilities at the site, originally planned for high-level waste. The state of New Mexico may consider accepting high-level waste at the WIPP site with conditions, including assistance with cleaning up contaminated uranium production sites. Governor Susana Martinez supported these efforts, but U.S. senators Udall and Heinrich opposed an interim storage facility without a plan for permanent disposal. A 2014 radioactive release from WIPP could impact public support for expanded waste disposal. The suspension of disposal operations in New Mexico could impact public support for expanded waste activities. Interest in hosting nuclear waste sites has been expressed in Mississippi and Loving County, Texas. Legislation has been introduced to authorize DOE to enter contracts with privately owned spent fuel storage facilities. The bill (H.R. 3643) would transfer spent nuclear fuel to a private storage facility, with DOE taking title. Interest from the Nuclear Waste Fund could be used by DOE to fund private interim storage. The bill has 33 cosponsors, including 14 from Texas. Another bill (H.R. 3053) includes provisions for a private-sector storage facility and was approved by the House Energy and Commerce Committee in 2017. An earlier effort to develop a private storage facility was initiated due to DOE missing the 1998 deadline for nuclear waste removal from reactor sites. The Private Fuel Storage (PFS) consortium signed an agreement with the Skull Valley Band of the Goshute Indians in Utah to develop a storage facility on tribal land. A 20-year license for storing up to 44,000 tons of spent fuel was issued by the NRC in 2006, but the Department of the Interior later disapproved the project. The Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Bureau of Land Management disapproved a proposed lease and rights-of-way for a waste storage facility on tribal land. A federal lawsuit was filed to challenge the decisions, leading to a court order for the Department of the Interior to reconsider the permits. The Department of the Interior was ordered to reconsider its decisions on the PFS permits. PFS requested the termination of its license in 2012. The focus remains on Yucca Mountain for civilian waste, as mandated by the NWPA. EPA and NRC set standards for high-level waste repositories, with specific requirements for Yucca Mountain under the Energy Policy Act of 1992. Transport of waste is regulated by NRC. Transportation of waste to storage and disposal sites is regulated by NRC and DOT. DOE shipments to Yucca Mountain and an MRS facility must use NRC-certified casks and comply with NRC requirements. Shipments must also follow DOT regulations on routing, placarding, and safety. NRC's licensing requirements for Yucca Mountain require compliance with EPA's standards and establish procedures for seeking a repository license. DOE must receive construction authorization before being issued a license for the Yucca Mountain repository. The Yucca Mountain repository requires authorization before nuclear waste can be emplaced underground. Specific standards are in place to ensure the site meets radiation dose limits for public safety. EPA's general standards may not be feasible for Yucca Mountain, necessitating unique requirements. The National Academy of Sciences recommended Yucca Mountain environmental standards to limit risk to individuals near the repository, rather than setting specific limits for radioactive material releases. The study also found no scientific basis for predicting human behavior thousands of years into the future. EPA proposed Yucca Mountain standards in accordance with the Energy Policy Act of 1992. EPA proposed Yucca Mountain radiation protection standards in 1999, limiting annual radiation doses for the maximally exposed individual and groundwater exposure for the first 10,000 years of repository operation. The nuclear industry criticized the proposal as overly stringent, while environmental groups argued that the 10,000-year standard was too short. The EPA issued final Yucca Mountain standards on June 6, 2001, with a 15 millirem overall exposure limit and a 4 millirem groundwater limit. Despite DOE's opposition, the site was deemed able to meet the standards. NRC revised its regulations to align with EPA standards on September 7, 2001. The court struck down the 10,000-year compliance period in the EPA and NRC Yucca Mountain standards, citing inconsistency with the NAS study. In response, EPA proposed new standards on August 9, 2005. The EPA proposed new Yucca Mountain standards on August 9, 2005, which included higher annual dose limits for the period of 10,000 years through 1 million years. Nevada officials criticized the proposed standards as too lenient. EPA issued its final rule amending the standards on September 30, 2008, reducing the annual dose limit for the same period. The final rule reduced the annual dose limit from 350 to 100 millirems for the period of 10,000 through 1 million years, aligning with international standards. Compliance with the post-10,000-year standard will be based on the arithmetic mean of projected doses. The 4 millirem groundwater standard applies only to the first 10,000 years. NRC updated its repository licensing regulations to match the new EPA standards on April 13, 2009. DOE estimated in its June 2008 report for the Yucca Mountain repository that the maximum mean annual individual dose after 10,000 years. The Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (FSEIS) for the Yucca Mountain repository stated that the maximum mean annual individual dose after 10,000 years would be 2 millirems, a significant reduction from the previously estimated peak doses of 150 millirems after 400,000 years. This reduction was attributed to changes in DOE's computer model and assumptions. The DOE's Fuel Cycle Research and Development Program conducts research on various technologies for managing spent nuclear fuel. The FY2017 DOE budget justification included research on improving spent nuclear fuel management, aligned with the Obama Administration's waste strategy. The FY2018 budget proposal by the Trump Administration allocated $88.5 million for nuclear waste processing but eliminated funding for the integrated waste strategy. The FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act provided $63.9 million for generic nuclear waste R&D and $22.5 million for integrated waste management. The FY2019 budget request includes $10 million for waste disposal R&D and no funding for integrated waste management. The FY2019 budget request includes $10 million for waste disposal R&D, focusing on reprocessing spent fuel to convert long-lived radionuclides. DOE cannot spend the $37.2 billion in the Waste Fund until appropriated by Congress. The FY2019 Administration budget request shows a $37.2 billion balance in the Waste Fund. Before the Yucca Mountain project was halted in FY2010, $7.41 billion had been spent. The total cost of the Yucca Mountain program was estimated at $96.2 billion in 2007 dollars from 1983 to 2133. The 1980 Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act and 1985 amendments authorize states to handle low-level radioactive waste disposal through interstate compacts. By the end of 1992, two out of three commercial low-level waste disposal facilities could refuse waste from outside their regional compacts. One site in Beatty, NV, closed, leaving facilities in Barnwell, SC, and Hanford, WA, to manage waste within their regions. The 1980 Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act and 1985 amendments allow states to handle low-level radioactive waste disposal through interstate compacts. Facilities in Barnwell, SC, and Hanford, WA, can refuse waste from outside their regional compacts. A new disposal facility near Andrews, TX, opened in 2012 to alleviate storage issues for Class A, B, and C low-level waste. The facility can also accept waste from other states, with the first shipment received from Vermont in April 2012. The Texas compact for low-level radioactive waste disposal was initially approved with Vermont and Maine but was later rejected by Texas and Maine withdrew. Governor Rick Perry authorized the licensing of disposal facilities in Andrews County in 2003. The Andrews County disposal facility in Texas was approved in 2009 by TCEQ after acquiring necessary land and mineral rights. The Barnwell facility in South Carolina accepts low-level waste from the Atlantic Compact, which includes Connecticut, New Jersey, and South Carolina. South Carolina can limit the use of the facility to compact members. The Barnwell facility in South Carolina phased out acceptance of noncompact waste by June 30, 2008. South Carolina proposed opening the facility to waste generators outside the Southeast Compact in 1995, but the Southeast Compact Commission rejected the proposal. This led South Carolina to withdraw from the Southeast Compact and begin accepting waste from all states except North Carolina at Barnwell. The Barnwell facility in South Carolina phased out acceptance of noncompact waste by June 30, 2008. South Carolina withdrew from the Southeast Compact and began accepting waste from all states except North Carolina at Barnwell. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that North Carolina's withdrawal from the Southeast Compact did not subject them to sanctions. Hanford, WA is the only other disposal facility for low-level waste, controlled by the Northwest Compact. Licensing of commercial low-level waste facilities is regulated by the NRC or approved agreement states. The NRC regulates low-level waste licenses, conforming to environmental and radiation protection standards. Transportation is jointly regulated by NRC and the Department of Transportation. Proposed modifications to disposal regulations were submitted in 2015 and further revisions were issued in 2017. The NRC staff has drafted regulations to establish time periods for technical analyses of low-level waste sites to ensure protection of the general population. Analysis would be required for a 1,000-year compliance period if no significant quantities of long-lived radioactive material are present, and for a 10,000-year compliance period if significant quantities are present. Post-10,000-year analysis and protection for inadvertent intruders would also be required. The NRC's low-level waste regulations were adopted in 1982, and disposal of radioactive waste is a key issue in the nuclear power debate. Spent fuel from nuclear power plants must be stored on-site indefinitely without a national waste management system. Concern about spent fuel storage safety has increased since the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant disaster in March 2011. The federal government's nuclear waste disposal policy is focused on the Yucca Mountain site, despite President Obama's actions to terminate it. The Yucca Mountain project was terminated by President Obama, halting DOE waste program activities. Congress debates its future, with the NRC finding in 2014 supporting its viability. The Trump Administration proposed restarting Yucca Mountain licensing after Senator Reid's retirement. The Trump Administration requested $120 million in FY2018 for Yucca Mountain licensing and spent fuel storage to fulfill federal obligations, enhance national security, and reduce taxpayer burden. The funding was not approved for FY2018, but the request has been repeated for FY2019. Owners of existing reactors with waste-disposal contracts with DOE are likely to seek damages from the federal government. The lack of a nuclear waste disposal system could lead to owners of existing reactors seeking damages from the federal government, with potential liabilities estimated at $34.1 billion. The nuclear industry predicts that future damages could increase significantly if the federal disposal program fails. The lack of a nuclear waste disposal system could impact the licensing of new nuclear plants and lead to compliance deadline issues for defense waste disposal. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended options like centralized interim storage and reprocessing to address delays in nuclear waste disposal. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended establishing a congressionally chartered corporation for siting new waste storage facilities, with longer on-site storage likely due to delays in the nuclear waste program. The \"consent based\" siting process has garnered interest from localities in New Mexico and Texas. The success of any renewed \"consent based\" siting effort for nuclear waste storage facilities is likely to depend on the cooperation of states. The U.S. Nuclear Waste Negotiator's voluntary siting efforts faced opposition from potential host states. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future recommended establishing a congressionally chartered corporation for siting new waste storage facilities.
