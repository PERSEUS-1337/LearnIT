    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature of California prioritizes improving occupational health and safety for family child care providers to ensure a safer environment for both providers and the children under their care. Family child care providers face occupational health and safety hazards such as toxic chemicals, illness, stress, and physical strain. They have musculoskeletal injury rates similar to industrial workers. Since they lack workers' compensation insurance, it is crucial for them and the children in their care to receive proper training to prevent injuries and illnesses on the job. The Health and Safety Code is being amended to address these concerns. The Health and Safety Code is being amended to address concerns regarding occupational health and safety hazards faced by family child care providers. Section 1596.86 is updated to require the annual publication of lists covering licensed child day care facilities, excluding small family day care homes, specifying services, capacity, and licensing information. The department will prevent the use of lists containing personal information to protect small family day care homes. The Health and Safety Code is being amended to address occupational health and safety hazards for family child care providers. Personal information of small family day care homes will be protected, except for necessary purposes like licensing administration and child placement.

The entity selected to provide trainings required by Section 1596.864 includes family day care organizations and specialized health care service plans licensed under the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975. They offer employee assistance program services with child care referral services. Parents seeking local day care services can receive names and telephone numbers of local small family day care providers upon request. The department, in consultation with the Child Development Division of the State Department of Education, will establish regulations for the confidentiality of information on small family day care homes. These regulations will ensure that only licensed homes in good standing are referred to, with consequences for violations. Section 1596.864 of the Health and Safety Code defines \"family child care provider\" as either a licensed family day care home provider or a person providing child care under a publicly funded program, excluding relatives of the children in care. A publicly funded child care program subsidizes early learning and care for children, administered by various state departments or agencies, excluding the K-12 public education system. A family child care provider must attend a two-hour training on occupational health and safety risks specific to the child care profession to protect their own health and safety and that of the children in their care. The State Department of Social Services may establish a schedule for family child care providers to complete required training within four years or three months of becoming a provider. The training includes identifying and minimizing risks like chemical and biological hazards. The training for family child care providers includes identifying and minimizing risks such as chemical and biological hazards, infectious diseases, and physical hazards. It also involves small and large group discussions, learning opportunities from current professionals, presentations by relevant organizations, and feedback on received training. The Department of Industrial Relations selects a training entity through a competitive process. The selected entity must have experience in providing occupational health and safety training to family child care providers, train providers to give required training to others, and provide updates on health and safety matters to trained providers. The State Department of Social Services administers the contract with the entity selected to develop and provide training for family child care providers. The curriculum for the training sessions is reviewed and approved by the Division of Occupational Safety and Health. Training is coordinated with other preservice requirements and resource networks to reduce the burden on providers. On a monthly basis, the department provides lists of family child care providers who have attended training and those who still need to attend, along with their contact information, to the training entity. The entity uses this information to update providers on health and safety issues. Providers can request to have their home address and telephone number removed from the lists before release. The department and the training entity must comply with the Dymally-Alatorre Bilingual Services Act, providing training materials in non-English languages. This section will be effective on July 1, 2017. This section of the act will be effective on July 1, 2017 and does not require reimbursement according to the California Constitution. It pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions. The Legislature aims to establish the rights of child care providers in alternative payment programs to report violations to the State Department of Education. A new section 8221.6 is added to the Education Code. Section 8221.6 of the Education Code allows licensed or license-exempt child care providers in alternative payment programs to file complaints for non-compliance with laws or regulations. This includes programs like the California Alternative Payment Program, CalWORKs Stage 2 Program, and CalWORKs Stage 3 Program. The CalWORKs Stage 2 Program, CalWORKs Stage 3 Program, and Migrant Alternative Payment Program are included in Section 8221.6 of the Education Code. The operation of this section is dependent on annual budget appropriations."
