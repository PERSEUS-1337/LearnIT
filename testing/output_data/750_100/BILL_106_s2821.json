    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"FERS Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Buyback Act of 2000\". It addresses the creditability of service. The FERS Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Buyback Act of 2000 amends Section 8411(b) of title 5, United States Code to include service as a temporary or intermittent employee for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation between December 31, 1988, and June 30, 2000, as creditable service. The FERS Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Buyback Act of 2000 amends Section 8411 of title 5, United States Code to require employees or Members to deposit an amount equal to 1.3 for service performed as a temporary or intermittent employee for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Employees or Members are required to deposit 1.3 percent of basic pay to the Fund for service performed as a temporary or intermittent employee for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Any deposit made more than 5 years later must include interest, and if not made, consequences may apply. If the deposit is not made or is incomplete, the service of the employee or Member will still be creditable, but their annuity under this chapter will be reduced similar to section 8418(b). SEC. 3. PROVISIONS RELATING TO PERSONS WHO HAVE SEPARATED. The Office of Personnel Management will establish regulations for obtaining credit for service performed by individuals who have separated from Government service. Credit will only be given upon submission of a written application by December 31, 2001. Annuities will be recomputed when an application is submitted. An application under this subsection will result in the recomputation of annuities to include service described in section 8411(b)(6) of title 5, United States Code. If the full deposit required under section 8411(j) of title 5 is not made timely, credit for service may not be granted. When applying for recomputation of annuities for certain services, a reduction will be made in the annuity amount as per section 8411(j). No interest is included in the deposit for this process. SEC. 4. NOTIFICATION AND OTHER DUTIES OF THE OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT. The Office of Personnel Management will inform individuals of their rights under the Act and assist in obtaining necessary information from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation will provide information on an individual's performance of services as requested by the Office under section 3(c)."
