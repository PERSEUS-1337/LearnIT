    "content": "The Middle East poses challenges to U.S. foreign policy due to various state and non-state actors aligned against U.S. interests, including Iran, Hezbollah, and Hamas. Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons capability is a major concern. Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons capability poses serious balance of power and proliferation concerns globally. There are fears of Israel preemptively striking Iran, leading to a wider war. Iran's strong ties to Syria complicate U.S. efforts in the region. Despite improved U.S. image in the Middle East under the Obama Administration, dissatisfaction with U.S. policy remains. The Middle East remains a complex region with various state and non-state actors aligned against U.S. interests. Efforts to close Guantanamo and improve relations with the Muslim world have not limited their influence. The ongoing war in Afghanistan and challenges in the Israel-Palestine peace process have also hindered U.S. influence. Regional actors like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Turkey are taking more responsibility for resolving disputes, reducing reliance on U.S. diplomacy. The Middle East faces challenges from the global financial crisis, poverty, and lack of democracy. The United States advocates for economic and political reform in the region. The 112th Congress faces challenges in responding to Palestinian divisions, Hamas' control of Gaza, Israeli settlements, and obstacles to the peace process. Budget constraints raise questions about continued support for regional initiatives like foreign aid and democracy promotion. Congress may need new tools to address radical regimes like Iran and Syria. Members of the 112th Congress may need to address various issues in the Middle East, including the war in Afghanistan, terrorism, foreign assistance, democracy promotion, human rights concerns, and the global financial crisis. They may also face unexpected challenges in balancing counterterrorism strategies with diplomatic efforts to improve relationships with Arab regimes. The 112th Congress may need to address challenges in the Middle East, including economic sanctions against Iran to curb its nuclear development. International consensus is growing on adopting stricter measures, complementing existing U.S. laws targeting Iran's alleged WMD programs and support for militant groups. The U.S. and major allies are increasingly in favor of sanctions targeting Iran's energy sector to curb its WMD programs and support for militant groups. Efforts to isolate Iran from the international financial system began in 1996 with the Iran Sanctions Act, which penalizes foreign companies doing business with Iran's energy sector. The goal is to persuade foreign firms to choose between the Iranian market and the much larger U.S. market. In the 111th Congress, the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 (CISADA) significantly expanded sanctions on Iran, including restrictions on gasoline imports and access to the U.S. market for banks conducting transactions with sanctioned Iranian entities. CISADA also limited U.S. trade with Iran and high technology trade with countries enabling WMD-related technology to reach Iran. The June 9, 2010, adoption of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1929 imposed a ban on sales of heavy weapons to Iran and sanctioned Iranian entities affiliated with its Revolutionary Guard. European Union and national sanctions followed, restricting trade financing and banking relationships with Iran, particularly in the energy sector. The sanctions imposed by major economic powers on Iran, including the EU, are having a growing effect on Iran's economy. There have been announcements of international firms exiting the Iranian market, but the impact on Iran's nuclear program is not clear. The 112th Congress may consider additional Iran sanctions legislation. The United States and Israel have strong bilateral relations based on domestic U.S. support for Israel, shared strategic goals in the Middle East, democratic values, and historic ties. U.S. foreign aid has played a significant role in strengthening these ties, despite differences over Israel's settlements and arms sales. Possible measures to support Iran's domestic opposition may be considered. Despite concerns over Israel's settlements and arms sales, the United States has maintained strong bilateral relations with Israel, providing aid packages to support its security and military edge in the region. Critics argue that U.S. aid exacerbates tensions in the Middle East by indirectly causing suffering to Palestinians through Israeli arms purchases. Congress and successive administrations have consistently affirmed support for Israel's security. The United States has consistently affirmed its commitment to preserving Israel's Qualitative Military Edge (QME) over neighboring militaries. The Obama Administration requested $3 billion in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) for Israel in FY2011 to support its security and military capabilities. The 112th Congress may address defense appropriations for U.S.-Israeli missile defense cooperation. In FY2010, over $202 million was appropriated for this purpose, with an additional $205 million announced by the Obama Administration for the Iron Dome system. Congress may authorize and appropriate funds for Iron Dome. Israel's wars with neighbors since 1948 have shaped the need for missile defense systems. Since Israel's founding in 1948, U.S. diplomacy has been involved in resolving wars with its neighbors, leading to Congressional aid appropriations for peace treaties. President Obama emphasized Israeli-Palestinian peace as a U.S. national security interest due to its impact on relations in the Middle East and extremist activities. President Obama's call for a halt to Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank led to limited progress in peace talks with the Palestinian Liberation Organization. However, settlements remained a major obstacle as Israel continued with settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The US Administration offered incentives to Israel for a settlement freeze in East Jerusalem, hoping to make progress in final status talks. However, this effort was abandoned in December, and new approaches are being sought. Final status issues include borders, security, Jerusalem, refugees, and water. Congress may be interested in the Arab-Israeli peace process due to its oversight role. In the 111th Congress, resolutions were introduced regarding Jerusalem as Israel's capital and relocating the U.S. embassy. Congress emphasizes an undivided Jerusalem as Israel's capital, while the Obama Administration sees it as a final status issue for negotiation. In the 112th Congress, legislation may address moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, conditions for a new Palestinian state, and reactions to potential violent confrontations between Israeli forces and Palestinians. Congress also passed resolutions supporting Israel's right to self-defense against rocket attacks and a flotilla attempting to break Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip. The Administration may request additional aid for Israel and Palestinians to support a potential peace accord. U.S. aid to Palestinians aligns with U.S. policy priorities of combating terrorism and promoting stability in the West Bank for peaceful coexistence with Israel. U.S. aid policy towards Palestinians during the 111th Congress continues to focus on promoting stability and prosperity in the West Bank for peaceful coexistence with Israel, meeting humanitarian needs in the Gaza Strip, and preventing destabilization. This policy was established in June 2007 following the split between the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and the regime in the Gaza Strip led by Hamas. Annual U.S. bilateral assistance has been directed towards the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. Annual U.S. bilateral assistance to the West Bank and Gaza Strip has averaged over $600 million annually, including direct budgetary assistance and security assistance for the PA. Additional humanitarian assistance for Palestinian refugees has averaged over $200 million annually since 2007. The US provides annual bilateral assistance to the West Bank and Gaza Strip, averaging over $600 million annually since 2007. This aid is subject to vetting and oversight due to concerns about funds being diverted to Palestinian terrorist groups. US policymakers urge greater assistance from Arab states, whose contributions are often late or less than pledged. In 2010, the Administration notified Congress of proposed military equipment sales to Saudi Arabia. The proposed sale of military equipment to Saudi Arabia includes fighter aircraft, helicopters, upgrades, and related weaponry and services worth over $60 billion. The sales aim to sustain long-term relationships and ensure continued U.S. influence for decades. This raises policy questions for Congress. The Obama Administration hopes proposed sales to Saudi Arabia will strengthen them against Iran and maintain long-term relationships for continued U.S. influence. Improvements in U.S.-Saudi counterterrorism cooperation have been praised, but challenges remain, including on terrorist financing. Challenges remain in U.S.-Saudi relations, including concerns about human rights and terrorist financing. Saudi leaders are wary of embracing Iraq's government and engaging with Israel. Congressional committees reviewed proposed arms sales in the 111th Congress. In November 2010, 198 members of Congress raised concerns about proposed arms sales to Saudi Arabia. The Obama Administration believed in strengthening the U.S. military partnership with Saudi Arabia while maintaining Israel's military edge. The U.S. government also planned to supply Israel with F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft. The United States planned to supply Israel with advanced F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft to maintain its military edge in the region. Legislation introduced in December 2010 aimed to block proposed arms sales to Saudi Arabia, prompting Congress to consider additional oversight of military cooperation with the kingdom. The U.S. has a long history of training and arming the Saudi Arabian military since the 1940s. In the 1940s, U.S. military training and equipment support programs in Saudi Arabia are crucial for U.S.-Saudi relations. New U.S. programs for Saudi security forces and infrastructure are being implemented. Congress can block or modify arms sales before delivery, subject to presidential veto. The 30-day review period under the Arms Export Control Act may impact new legislation on arms sales to Saudi Arabia. Congress may enhance oversight of U.S. security assistance due to concerns about Yemen-based terrorists. The 112th Congress may focus on U.S. counterterrorism policy in Yemen, especially after AQAP's failed attempt to bomb an airline in 2009. AQAP attempted to bomb Northwest Airlines Flight 253 on Christmas Day 2009 and two air cargo flights using explosives hidden in printer cartridges in October 2010. Anwar al Awlaki, an American citizen and AQAP's radical ideologue, has tried to radicalize U.S. citizens for terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. Awlaki has links to individuals like Major Nidal M. Hasan, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, and Faisal Shahzad. The Obama Administration is considering increasing assistance and intelligence cooperation with Yemen without militarizing the U.S. presence. Reports suggest the CIA may use drones or place military units under JSOC control. U.S. military has limited presence in Yemen, so intelligence agencies may need time to familiarize with the local terrain. The Obama Administration is considering increasing assistance and intelligence cooperation with Yemen without militarizing the U.S. presence. U.S. intelligence agencies may need time to employ all assets effectively in Yemen against Al Qaeda-affiliated groups. Congress may assess the balance between short-term counterterrorism needs and long-term stabilization goals in Yemen. Lawmakers may push for more U.S. military involvement if AQAP threatens attacks on U.S. soil. Some members may demand Yemen's cooperation in apprehending wanted AQAP operatives like Awlaki. The 112th Congress may consider new measures in response. The 112th Congress may consider new appropriations for Yemen, with the United States providing an estimated $290 million in total aid in FY2010. The Defense Department has proposed increasing security assistance to Yemen to $1.2 billion over a five- or six-year period. Yemeni forces have launched campaigns against suspected AQAP strongholds in recent months. The U.S. and Yemen are cooperating on security efforts against AQAP in Abyan and Shabwah governorates. Concerns arise over Yemen's release of alleged terrorists to appease tribal and Islamist opposition to U.S. involvement. In Iraq, there is peaceful political competition and attempts to build cross-sectarian alliances, but ethnic and factional conflicts persist. The infighting in Iraq over key political offices significantly delayed the agreement on leadership of a new government after the 2010 national elections. With U.S. intervention, major ethnic and sectarian factions reached an agreement on senior positions in the government on November 10, 2010, breaking a long deadlock. Since then, the major political blocs have started implementing the agreement to form a broad-based government. The new government in Iraq, formed after the 2010 national elections, is facing challenges in reaching consensus on major issues. Some worry about U.S. influence waning and dominance of parties aligned with Iran. There are concerns about potential conflicts between the Kurdistan Regional Government and nationalist Arabs. Despite the drawdown of U.S. forces, ongoing attacks contribute to a sense of uncertainty and disillusionment among Iraqis. The drawdown of U.S. forces in Iraq raises concerns about stability post-2011, with experts questioning the potential for Iraq to become a \"failed state\" without continued U.S. presence. Iraqi Security Forces may not meet benchmarks by the end of 2011, and the formation of the government is crucial for securing a long-term strategic partnership with the U.S. The U.S. aims to secure a long-term strategic partnership with Iraq, despite opposition from some Iraqi parties. Transitioning from military to civilian leadership in Iraq, the State Department is expanding civilian personnel and overseeing security needs. U.S. economic assistance to Iraq has decreased since 2003-2007. U.S. economic assistance to Iraq has declined significantly since the 2003-2007 period, with FY2010 assistance reaching $382.5 million. The Administration's FY2011 request aimed to maintain economic aid at that level and support Iraq's security forces, despite Senate appropriators recommending cuts in both areas. Funding for Iraq in FY2011 is provided under the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 (P.L. 111-242). Future economic and security assistance for Iraq under the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 (P.L. 111-242) may face resistance in the 112th Congress due to concerns about Iraq's ability to invest in its own reconstruction and security forces. Iraq's oil revenues are expected to increase, but it still faces challenges with domestic investment needs, foreign debts, and financial management. The transition from U.S. military operations to a U.S. civilian-led presence in Iraq is ongoing. The transition from U.S. military operations to a U.S. civilian-led presence in Iraq opens new avenues for oversight by Congress, including appropriations, authorization requests, and arms sales for U.S.-Iraqi security cooperation. Congressional attention has focused on certain aspects of the complex relationship with long-term U.S. NATO ally Turkey, particularly issues of interest to diaspora communities such as Greek-Americans and Armenian Americans. They demand changes in Turkey's policies regarding the Greek Orthodox Church, religious freedom, Cyprus, and other matters. Turkey's policies on the Greek Orthodox Church, religious freedom, Cyprus, and the Armenian national \"genocide\" of 1915-1917 are under scrutiny by Congress. Concerns have also been raised about Turkey's foreign policy orientation, especially after incidents like the confrontation between Turkish activists and Israeli commandos. Legislation in the 111th Congress called on the Administration to urge Turkey to make changes. Legislation in the 112th Congress focused on urging Turkey to respect the property and religious rights of the Greek Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarch in Istanbul, recognize his international status, and allow clergy training. The House passed resolutions calling for the affirmation of the U.S. historical record on the Armenian genocide and the protection of Greek Orthodox religious sites in Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus. In the 112th Congress, issues concerning Turkey include the rights of the Greek Orthodox Church, the genocide resolution, and potential defense appropriations for missile defense systems. Congressional interest is also focused on possible political and policy changes in Turkey following the NATO summit in November 2010. Interest in potential political and policy changes after the 2011 Turkish national election may lead to oversight hearings if Ambassador-designate to Turkey Francis J. Ricciardone does not receive a recess appointment or a Senate nomination in the 112th Congress. Lawmakers in the 112th Congress may focus on U.S. policy towards Syria in efforts to distance Syria from Iran, with the Obama Administration showing a willingness to engage in diplomatic dialogue with the Syrian government since taking office in 2009. The Obama Administration has shown a willingness to engage in diplomatic dialogue with the Syrian government in hopes of securing cooperation on various issues. Despite some gestures towards the Asad government, U.S. sanctions against Syria have remained in place since 2009. Critics argue that the change in tone towards Syria was superficial, leading the administration to now shift tactics towards applying more pressure. The Obama Administration is shifting tactics to pressure the Syrian government to play a constructive role in stabilizing Lebanon and advancing the Arab-Israeli peace process. This change follows renewed international concern about Lebanon and Hezbollah's threats to destabilize the country. Efforts to restart Israeli-Syrian peace talks have been unsuccessful due to resistance from both countries. U.S.-Syrian relations may become more tense, with Congress potentially getting involved. During the 111th Congress, lawmakers introduced H.R. 1206, the Syria Accountability and Liberation Act, which aimed to impose new sanctions on countries and individuals assisting Syria in obtaining weapons of mass destruction. Congress may consider imposing new sanctions against the Asad regime amidst potentially tense U.S.-Syrian relations. Additionally, there may be funding allocated for democracy and governance programs for opposition members and human rights activists in Syria. Congress may choose to fund democracy and governance programs for opposition members and human rights activists repressed by the Asad government. The nomination of Robert S. Ford as Ambassador-Designate to Syria remains on hold, with no vote planned for confirmation in the Senate. Supporters argue that sending an ambassador to Syria is crucial for U.S. interests, while opponents view it as a concession to a rogue regime. U.S. policy towards Lebanon aims to support the current unity government led by Prime Minister Saad Hariri and limit Iranian influence. The current unity government in Lebanon, led by Prime Minister Saad Hariri, aims to limit Iranian and Syrian influence and contain Hezbollah. The United States supports Lebanon with economic and military assistance, particularly in the security sector. Prime Minister Hariri's government faces challenges due to pending STL indictments and increased sectarian tension. Hezbollah is conducting a public relations campaign to discredit the STL, rejecting potential indictments as a U.S. and Israeli attack on the \"resistance.\" Hariri's government's legitimacy relies on the STL's success, but Hezbollah's opposition may threaten his power if indictments proceed. The STL indictments may impact Hariri's power in Lebanon, potentially leading to changes in the government that could affect U.S. policy and assistance. The Obama Administration has requested $246 million in foreign assistance to strengthen the Lebanese state and deter non-state actors. In August 2010, the LAF fired on an IDF unit near the Blue Line. In routine brush-clearing maintenance along the Blue Line, an incident occurred where two Lebanese soldiers, a journalist, and an Israeli officer were killed. Some members of Congress placed a hold on the FY2010 $100 million FMF appropriation for Lebanon due to concerns about U.S. equipment being used against Israel. The hold was lifted in December 2010, but questions arose about the future of U.S. assistance to Lebanon. Egypt may undergo a leadership transition soon, prompting the 112th Congress to support a more democratic government that upholds human rights and religious freedom. Egypt, as the largest Arab country, is a crucial U.S. ally in regional diplomacy and military cooperation, especially in the Arab-Israeli peace process. Political liberalization in Egypt could have a ripple effect across the Middle East and beyond. Some believe that a stable, autocratic Egypt at peace with Israel is in the U.S. interest, fearing a sudden takeover by the Muslim Brotherhood. In the 2010 parliamentary elections, the ruling party won over 90% of seats, with only one Muslim Brotherhood member elected. The State Department expressed concern over irregularities in the parliamentary elections, including disruptions of opposition campaigns, arrests of supporters, media access denial, and interference by security forces. These issues raise doubts about the fairness and transparency of the electoral process. Congress has provided Egypt with $1.5 billion in military and economic aid over the last few fiscal years. Funding for democracy promotion in Egypt has been controversial, with the Egyptian government opposing foreign support to independent NGOs working on political reform and government accountability. In FY2005, Congress directed that democracy and governance activities in Egypt shall not require prior approval from the government. Economic aid for democracy promotion decreased as overall aid to Egypt decreased. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY2010, provided $25 million for democracy promotion. The Obama Administration aims to ease tensions with Egypt. Some analysts suggest the Obama Administration wants to reduce democracy assistance to ease tensions with Egypt. Critics argue that U.S. aid should be tied to improvements in human rights and religious freedom. The U.S. has been engaged in a global war against Al Qaeda since the 9/11 attacks. Despite the U.S. war against Al Qaeda weakening the organization's ability to attack the United States, the group's survival, regional affiliates' strength, and appeal among some Muslims remain challenging. Al Qaeda operatives are determined to attack the U.S. and exploit vulnerabilities, reactions, and policy mistakes. Recent events show increased ideological outreach and promotion of low-cost operations by individuals with limited linkages. The Internet is facilitating independent, low-cost terrorist operations with limited connections to established networks, complicating counterterrorism efforts. In the Middle East, U.S. policymakers face dilemmas balancing counterterrorism goals with other strategic priorities. The past decade of war in Afghanistan and Iraq has highlighted the costs and benefits of U.S. actions. The costs, benefits, and limits of U.S. military operations targeting Al Qaeda operatives in Afghanistan and Iraq have been demonstrated over the past decade. Al Qaeda rhetoric criticizes the continued U.S. military presence in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia, despite ongoing withdrawals from Iraq. Limited operations against Al Qaeda figures and counterterrorism assistance programs for allied governments have faced criticism for violating sovereignty and supporting undemocratic regimes. U.S. support for democratic reform in countries like Egypt, Jordan, and the West Bank/Gaza risks alienating allies and empowering Islamist parties. Despite increased U.S. outreach to Muslims, public opinion polls show skepticism and criticism of U.S. policies. Some suggest more direct efforts to destroy Al Qaeda and confront religious extremism are necessary, despite potential costs. Some argue for a containment strategy against Al Qaeda, emphasizing the need for Muslims to reject extremism. Others stress the importance of a broader U.S. agenda in the Middle East beyond security concerns to address persistent challenges. The 111th Congress discussed these issues. The 111th Congress focused on U.S. counterterrorism policy, including terrorist threats, foreign assistance, and financing. The 112th Congress may further evaluate counterterrorism strategy and engagement with Muslim countries in the Middle East. Congressional interest in maintaining U.S.-Iraqi relations is also highlighted. Issues of potential congressional interest in the Middle East include maintaining U.S.-Iraqi counterterrorism partnership, defeating Al Qaeda affiliates in Yemen and the Sahel, securing greater counterterrorism cooperation from allied governments in the Gulf, and securing peace between Israel and its neighbors.
