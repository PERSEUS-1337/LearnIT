    "content": "The Trump Administration requested $76.2 billion for the Department of Transportation (DOT) for FY2019, proposing significant cuts in funding for various programs. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $87.8 billion for DOT in the FY2019 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. The Senate passed H.R. 6147, which includes the FY2019 THUD appropriations bill providing $86.6 billion for the Department of Transportation, a slight increase over FY2018. The House committee bill would result in level inflation-adjusted funding for DOT compared to FY2018. The Senate bill would likely lead to a slight reduction in inflation-adjusted funding for the Department of Transportation (DOT) compared to its FY2018 level. DOT's funding structure is unique as most of its funding comes from mandatory budget authority from trust funds, with the majority of expenditures in the form of grants to states and local governments. Around two-thirds to three-fourths of DOT's funding is mandatory, while one-third to one-fourth is discretionary. In recent years, around 90% of the Department of Transportation's annual funding has come from two large trust funds, the Highway Trust Fund and the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. However, in FY2018, there was a significant increase in discretionary funding, leading to a change in the funding breakdown. The majority of funding from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund is categorized as discretionary budget authority. The Airport and Airway Trust Fund is mainly discretionary budget authority, with about 80% of the Department of Transportation's funding going to states, local authorities, and Amtrak in the form of grants. The Federal Aviation Administration, responsible for air traffic control, has a budget primarily focused on operations rather than grants. The Department of Transportation's funding comes from taxes, trust fund reauthorizations, and budget apportionment. Programs like highways, transit, and rail are authorized through FY2020, while federal aviation programs face reauthorization in 2018. Nonemergency funding has increased from $70 billion in FY2012 to $86 billion in FY2018, but inflation-adjusted funding peaked in FY2010 at $87.5 billion. The Department of Transportation's inflation-adjusted funding peaked in FY2010 at $87.5 billion and declined until FY2015, then began rising again in FY2016. From FY2012-FY2017, funding was lower than during the FY2007-FY2011 period. Most federal highway funding and transit funding come from the Highway Trust Fund, largely funded by the federal motor fuels excise tax. Table 4 compares FY2019 appropriations for DOT to FY2018. The federal motor fuels excise tax, also known as the gas tax, contributes largely to the revenues of the Highway Trust Fund. However, there has been a shortfall in the fund as expenditures have exceeded revenues for many years. To address this, Congress has transferred funds from the general Treasury to keep the trust fund solvent. One reason for the shortfall is the lack of increase in the federal gas tax since 1993, which is a fixed amount per gallon of fuel sold. The gas tax is a fixed amount per gallon of fuel sold, not a percentage of the fuel cost. The Highway Trust Fund receives 18.3 cents for each gallon of gasoline and 24.3 cents for each gallon of diesel. Inflation and increasing fuel efficiency have reduced the value of the gas tax. The Congressional Budget Office predicts flat gasoline consumption through 2024 due to improved fuel efficiency in vehicles. In 2024, the U.S. passenger fleet's fuel efficiency is expected to offset increased miles driven. CBO projects Highway Trust Fund revenues of $39-41 billion annually from FY2018 to FY2027, falling short of projected expenditures. Congress allocated $1.5 billion for national infrastructure grants in FY2018, known as BUILD Transportation grants. The House recommended $750 million, while the Senate proposed $1 billion. The Senate-passed bill would provide $1 billion for transportation projects. The Senate Committee on Appropriations prohibited the Department of Transportation (DOT) from using an applicant's willingness to create new sources of nonfederal revenue as a selection criterion for grants. The committee directed DOT to use the selection criteria from the FY2016 grant process for the TIGER grant program. The TIGER grant program, originating from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, aims to address criticisms of federal transportation funding by funding projects with national or regional impacts. The Senate Committee on Appropriations directed the Department of Transportation to use the FY2016 grant process criteria for the TIGER grant program. The challenges in transportation funding are highlighted by the division based on modes of transportation, hindering projects from competing for funds based on comparative benefits. An example is the Gateway Program by Amtrak, focusing on projects along the Northeast Corridor rail line near the New York/New Jersey border, including the replacement of a deteriorating tunnel under the Hudson River. The $13 billion-plus project's cost burden falls on New York. The $13 billion-plus Gateway Program, focusing on projects along the Northeast Corridor rail line near the New York/New Jersey border, requires funding from New York and New Jersey. The BUILD program provides grants for projects of national, regional, or metropolitan significance, with funding mostly going towards regional and metropolitan projects due to congressional direction. The BUILD/TIGER program is funded by Congress to distribute funds equitably across geographic areas, between rural and urban areas, and among transportation modes. The program has low minimum grant thresholds and is oversubscribed, with critics arguing that grants disproportionately go to urban areas. Congress has directed that at least 20% of funding should go to projects in rural areas. In FY2018, Congress increased rural project funding from 20% to 30%. The House Appropriations Committee recommends 33% for rural projects in FY2019, while the Senate bill sticks to 30%. Another 33% is designated for projects near major seaports, with the remaining 33% for urban areas. The BUILD/TIGER grant appropriation process has followed a consistent pattern in recent years, with the Obama Administration requesting funding, the House proposing cuts, the Senate proposing similar amounts to previous appropriations, and Congress ultimately agreeing on a final amount. In FY2018, despite the Trump Administration's request for no funding, Congress funded the program. This trend seems to be repeating in the FY2019 appropriations bills. The Essential Air Service (EAS) program in the FY2019 appropriations bills is funded through a combination of mandatory and discretionary budget authority, including a $140 million mandatory annual authorization financed by overflight fees. The Trump Administration requested $93 million in discretionary funding for the EAS program. The Trump Administration requested $93 million for the EAS program in FY2019, while the House committee bill recommended $175 million. The Senate-passed bill also suggests $175 million in funding. This would result in a 10% increase over the FY2018 total funding level of $285.8 million. The EAS program aims to maintain commercial air service to small communities by subsidizing necessary flights. The EAS program aims to preserve commercial air service to small communities by subsidizing unprofitable flights. The program's cost has doubled since FY2008, with changes made in 2012 to limit subsidies and allow smaller planes for communities with few passengers. Supporters argue that maintaining airline service to small communities is essential. Supporters of the EAS program argue that subsidizing air service to smaller communities promotes economic development in rural areas. Critics point out that the subsidy cost per passenger is high and many airports in the program have very few passengers. Some airports receiving EAS subsidies are close to major airports. Railroads were directed to install positive train control (PTC) by Congress in 2008 to prevent incidents caused by operator error. Despite billions spent by freight railroads, most required tracks did not have PTC by the 2015 deadline. Congress extended the deadline to 2018, with an option for further extension to 2020 with FRA approval. Some funding has been provided to help railroads comply. The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget did not include funding for PTC implementation. Congress provided funding in recent years: $50 million in FY2016, $199 million in FY2017 (for commuter railroads), and at least $250 million in FY2018. The House-reported bill allocated $150 million for PTC projects, while the Senate-passed bill did not specify an amount but directed DOT to prioritize PTC projects for grants. The Passenger Rail Reform and Investment Act of 2015 reauthorized Amtrak and changed its federal grant structure. It now receives separate grants for the Northeast Corridor and the rest of its national network, as well as authorizing three new grant programs for intercity passenger rail development. The Administration's FY2019 budget requested $738 million for intercity passenger rail funding, all for grants to Amtrak. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $1.9 billion for Amtrak, $800 million for two new grant programs, and $150 million for the Magnetic Levitation Technology Deployment Program. The Senate bill would also provide $1.9 billion. The Senate bill would provide $1.9 billion for Amtrak and $565 million for new grant programs, prioritizing PTC projects. Congress historically provided little funding for intercity passenger rail development, except for brief periods in FY2009 and FY2010. Funding for intercity passenger rail development was absent from FY2011 to FY2016, except for PTC implementation projects. In FY2017, Congress provided $98 million for new intercity passenger rail grant programs, increasing to $863 million in FY2018. The Federal Transit Administration allocates roughly $13 billion to state and local transit agencies through various formula-based programs, with only a few discretionary grant programs. The Capital Investment Grants program (CIG), also known as the New Starts program, funds new fixed-guideway transit lines and extensions. It has three components: New Starts grants for projects over $300 million seeking over $100 million in federal funding, Small Starts grants for projects under $300 million seeking less than $100 million in federal funding, and Core Capacity grants for projects increasing the capacity of existing systems. The Capital Investment Grants program funds projects to increase capacity of existing transit systems by at least 10%. There is an Expedited Project Delivery Pilot for eligible projects seeking no more than a 25% federal share. Grant funds for large projects are disbursed over years, with funding committed to multiyear agreements signed in previous years. The Trump Administration requested $1.0 billion for Capital Investment Grants in FY2019. The Trump Administration requested $1.0 billion for Capital Investment Grants in FY2019, $1.6 billion less than FY2018. Congress expressed concern over the Administration's stance on the program, with the House recommending $2.614 billion and the Senate bill proposing $2.553 billion. Funding is prioritized for projects with existing full funding grant agreements. The Trump Administration has not requested funding for new transit projects in its FY2018 or FY2019 DOT budget requests, breaking with previous federal policy. Congress has not supported this stance and provided more funding than requested for the CIG program in FY2018. Congress provided significantly more funding than requested by FTA for the CIG program in FY2018 and FY2019, directing the agency to follow statutory guidelines. The Senate Appropriations Committee report highlighted FTA's non-compliance with congressional directives for program improvements. Transportation for America, a transportation advocacy group, asserts that FTA is deliberately delaying the project development process for transit projects despite Congress providing funding for new projects. FTA has only issued $533 million in grants for projects under the CIG program in the FY2017 and FY2018 DOT appropriations acts. Project sponsors are facing increased costs due to the lengthened review process, with some bids expiring before FTA completes its review. FTA denies delaying the project review process, and New Starts grants can cover up to 80% of the project cost. Since FY2002, FTA has been directed not to sign any FFGAs for New Starts projects. Critics argue that lowering the federal share for New Starts projects could make highway projects more attractive compared to public transportation projects, as the federal share for highway projects is typically 80%. The FY2018 DOT appropriations act lowered the federal share limit for New Starts projects to 51%, while the House-reported FY2019 bill includes a provision capping the federal share at 50%. The Senate-passed bill does not have a similar provision. Advocates argue that requiring a higher local match for New Starts projects can support more projects with available funding and encourage communities to carefully estimate costs and benefits, reducing the risk of cost overruns and low ridership. Most federal transportation funding is distributed by mode, with the majority going to states by formula. While Congress allocates around $55 billion annually for surface transportation programs, most of the funding is automatically divided among states, making it challenging for states to accumulate funds for major projects. This situation is exemplified by Amtrak's Gateway Program. Amtrak's Gateway Program aims to increase rail service capacity between northern New Jersey and Manhattan by replacing bridges, expanding track capacity, and adding a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River. The existing tunnel, over a century old, was damaged during Hurricane Sandy and is deteriorating. The Gateway Program, aimed at increasing rail service capacity between northern New Jersey and Manhattan, includes the construction of a new Hudson River Tunnel. The estimated cost of the program is at least $24 billion, with the tunnel alone costing $11.1 billion. Funding for intercity rail projects has been limited, with the largest grant program in FY2017 funded at $68 million, increasing to $593 million in FY2018. The Capital Investment Grants program in FY2018 had $2.6 billion in funding, with intense competition for grants. An agreement was reached in 2016 to share costs for the new Hudson Tunnel between DOT, Amtrak, and the States of New Jersey and New York. The Trump Administration does not feel bound by the previous agreement to share costs for the new Hudson Tunnel. Congress would need to provide the funding, as neither the House nor Senate Appropriations Committees mentioned the Gateway Program in their FY2019 reports. However, both committees recommended significant funding for rail and transit grant programs that Gateway projects could be eligible for. Additionally, they recommended $240 million more for Amtrak's Northeast Corridor account than Amtrak requested for FY2019. The Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 authorized $1.5 billion over 10 years in grants to WMATA for maintenance and capital projects, to be matched by DC, Maryland, and Virginia. The FY2018 grant was the final installment of this commitment, but WMATA's budget assumed continued funding. The Administration requested $120 million for this grant. The Administration requested $120 million for the WMATA grant for FY2019, while the House Appropriations Committee and Senate-passed bill recommended $150 million. Both committees directed WMATA to work on extending the grant authorization and implementing wireless service throughout the rail system to address maintenance backlog issues. The WMATA has a backlog of maintenance needs and has experienced fatal incidents, leading to questions about its safety culture. An investigation found mismanagement of federal funding, resulting in restrictions on the use of federal funds. FTA assumed oversight of WMATA's safety compliance practices in 2015. The FTA oversees WMATA safety performance in DC, Maryland, and Virginia. FTA notified leaders of the jurisdictions to create a new safety oversight agency, the Metrorail Safety Commission, to replace the Tri-State Oversight Committee. 5% of FY2017 transit funds were withheld until the new agency is operational. The FTA oversees WMATA safety performance in DC, Maryland, and Virginia and notified leaders to create a new safety oversight agency, the Metrorail Safety Commission. FTA outlined steps for the Commission to take over oversight responsibilities from FTA. The NTSB recommended FRA oversee WMATA's rail operations, but Congress would need to grant FRA authority."
