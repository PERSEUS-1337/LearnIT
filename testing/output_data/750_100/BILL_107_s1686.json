The Congress finds that higher nurse staffing levels lead to better patient outcomes, but there are challenges in recruiting and retaining nursing staff. About 500,000 licensed nurses are not practicing nursing due to job dissatisfaction and overtime work. The widespread use of mandatory overtime in nursing contributes to job dissatisfaction and fatigue among nurses, leading to medical errors and compromising patient safety. Limiting mandatory overtime can help address these issues.
