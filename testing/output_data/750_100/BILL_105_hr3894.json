    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Air Force Science and Technology Reinvigoration Act\" and includes findings. Congress finds that the Air Force's founders expected scientific research and technology development to be a priority for America's aeronautical defenses. Scientific investigation is crucial for air, space, and information superiority, requiring a strong research base both within and outside the Air Force. Investment in Air Force research and development has benefited American industry, especially aerospace, and contributed significantly to the economy, aligning with the vision of Air Force founder General Henry H. Arnold for a science-focused Air Force. The text chunk discusses the importance of science and technology functions within the Department of the Air Force, aligning with the vision of Air Force founder General Henry H. Arnold. The sense of Congress is that a minimum of 2.5% of Air Force funds should be allocated to science and technology, with separate management and funding from acquisition. Additionally, at least 15% of science and technology funds should be invested in new technology areas. The Air Force should increase the number of officers and civilian employees with doctorate degrees in technical fields and expand the variety of technical degrees at the master's level from both the Air Force Institute of Technology and civilian universities to meet future technological challenges. To prevent stagnation in Air Force science and technology, a concentrated effort is recommended to eliminate 5 percent of programs annually, reallocating funds from discontinued programs to new ones. SEC. 4. AMENDMENTS RELATING TO SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FUNCTIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE. Amendments are made to separate the research and development function from the equipping function of the Secretary of the Air Force. This includes adding a new paragraph for research and development and amending sections related to the research and development function of the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force. Amendments are made to establish the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Science and Technology, increasing the number of Assistant Secretaries to five and designating one specifically for Science and Technology. Amendments establish the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Science and Technology and designate one of the Deputy Chiefs of Staff for Science and Technology. SEC. 5. STUDY. The Secretary of the Air Force must contract the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences to study the Air Force's technology base. The study will recommend minimum requirements to maintain a technology base for superiority in air and space weapons systems and information technology, addressing the effects on national defense and civilian industries. The Secretary of the Air Force must contract the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences to study the Air Force's technology base and recommend minimum requirements to maintain superiority in air and space weapons systems and information technology. The study will also recommend the appropriate level of staff with baccalaureate, masters, and doctorate degrees, and the optimal ratio of civilian and military staff holding such degrees to ensure the vitality of the Air Force's science and technology functions. A report on the study results must be submitted to Congress within 120 days."
