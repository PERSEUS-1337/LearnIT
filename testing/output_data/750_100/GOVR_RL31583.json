    "content": "The federal K-12 education legislation, starting from the Improving America's Schools Act in 1994 to the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, has focused on granting flexibility to grantees. This report outlines the authorizations for state and local flexibility in administering federal K-12 education programs. The report outlines authorizations for state and local flexibility in administering federal K-12 education programs, allowing for waivers of federal program requirements and transfer of funds among programs. The report discusses authorizations for state and local flexibility in administering federal K-12 education programs, including waivers of federal program requirements and fund transfers among programs. These flexibility authorities mainly apply to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) but not the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The report focuses on federal K-12 education program requirements under the ESEA, excluding the IDEA. It discusses potential amendments to the ESEA by the 110th Congress and will be updated regularly. The report also addresses concerns about program requirements and special flexibility for grantees. The report discusses federal K-12 education program requirements under the ESEA, excluding the IDEA. It explores special flexibility authorities that allow for waivers of certain requirements. Federal K-12 education programs have accountability requirements to ensure funds are used appropriately, with some flexibility granted under special authorities. These requirements cover areas like pupil eligibility, fund allocation, and outcomes, while allowing flexibility in instructional methods and other aspects. Federal K-12 education programs offer flexibility in instructional methods and grade levels served. They focus on student populations with special needs, specific instructional services, innovative approaches, and subject areas like math or science. Federal K-12 education programs are categorized into different areas, with most falling under targeted programs while some are considered block grants. These programs provide support for various activities and are guided by federal requirements. Federal K-12 education programs are guided by federal requirements, which can be categorized into \"requirements\" and \"non-regulatory policy guidance.\" Requirements must be met by grantees as a matter of law and may appear in the form of regulations or statutory text. Program regulations supplement statutory language primarily in a limited number of areas. Federal Regulations supplement statutory language primarily in complex areas where the U.S. Department of Education prioritizes specific actions due to insufficient guidance in statutory text. For example, ESEA Title I-A requirements on curriculum content and pupil performance standards. Authorizing statutes may require ED to publish regulations on certain issues, but ED can also issue regulations for any aid program it administers. Additionally, non-regulatory policy guidance is also provided by ED. The U.S. Department of Education issues federal regulations to supplement statutory language in complex areas where specific actions are needed. Non-regulatory policy guidance, such as \"Dear Colleague\" letters, is also published for many programs, providing answers to specific questions but not legally binding grantees to follow them. The use of \"non-regulatory\" guidance can be more complex than intended, as grantees may treat it as equivalent to regulations, even if not required. This is similar to \"competitive priorities\" set by ED for grant programs, giving preferential consideration to certain applications. The use of \"non-regulatory\" guidance can be more complex than intended, as grantees may treat it as equivalent to regulations. Priority consideration is given to applicants serving schools with high percentages of low-income families, increasing their chances of receiving support. These priorities are typically published in the announcement of the grant competition in the Federal Register. The Department of Education has been moving towards less voluminous regulations for federal education programs, with some programs having no regulations at all. For programs with regulations, they are generally briefer and address fewer issues than in the past. This shift began in the early 1990s, with a focus on providing non-regulatory policy guidance instead. Regulations for ESEA Title I-A post-IASA enactment in 1994 and NCLB of 2001 took a minimalist approach, focusing on standards, assessments, accountability, schoolwide programs, private school participation, and fund allocation. The Department of Education aims to regulate only when necessary for flexibility or statutory requirements. The Secretary intends to issue nonregulatory guidance under Title I programs to inform stakeholders about flexibility in carrying out statutory requirements for K-12 education assistance programs. This guidance will address legal and policy issues without extensive regulation. Federal grants require accountability for appropriate use of funds by SEAs, LEAs, and aid grantees to demonstrate program goal achievement. Accountability includes ensuring funds benefit eligible localities, pupils, and purposes for equal educational opportunities. The curr_chunk discusses outcome and fiscal accountability in using federal funds to improve student achievement and quality of K-12 instruction. It emphasizes the importance of ensuring funds are used effectively and do not replace state or local funds. The curr_chunk highlights the requirements for using federal funds to target high-need pupil groups, limit fund uses to high priority services, ensure funds supplement state/local resources, involve parental participation, set minimum qualifications for staff, report program activities to parents, meet student achievement goals, and evaluate instructional services. The curr_chunk discusses the consequences for grantees who violate regulations regarding federally supported instructional services, including the possibility of repaying funds or being prohibited from receiving further grants. General requirements for all recipients of federal education assistance are outlined in the Education Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR). LEAs participating in federal child nutrition programs must comply with various requirements, such as providing free or reduced-price school lunches to low-income students. Additionally, federal regulations from agencies other than the Department of Education may apply to LEAs and schools as employers. LEAs and schools must comply with various federal regulations as employers, including workplace safety and labor relations. State and local agencies have discretion in areas like grade levels and instructional techniques, with broad requirements for programs like NCLB. Program-specific requirements under NCLB and ESEA allow for state and LEA discretion, with criticisms focused on restrictions like fund commingling and targeted aid. The NCLB and ESEA have program-specific requirements allowing state and LEA discretion, with criticisms focused on restrictions like fund commingling and targeted aid to pupils and schools with the greatest needs. The NCLB and ESEA have program-specific requirements to target aid to pupils and schools with the greatest needs, including eligibility thresholds for flexibility and outcome accountability requirements. These requirements may seem inflexible from a state or local perspective, especially for low enrollment LEAs receiving small grants under various federal programs. LEAs receiving small grants under federal programs may face challenges such as fragmentation of services, inefficient resource use, and partial addressing of needs, which could be more effectively addressed with a focus on the whole child and their entire instructional program. The traditional federal categorical approach to education has been criticized for leading to fragmented instruction and focusing more on resources than improving student outcomes. Implementing federal programs in states with varying policies and demographics can also pose challenges. Some problems with categorical program structures and requirements may stem from misunderstandings of federal statutes and regulations or strict state interpretations. State and local education officials often complain about constraints on the use of federal funds, despite efforts to focus aid on needy students and avoid monitoring issues. LEA staff struggle to access accurate information on federal requirements for K-12 education assistance, leading to cautious responses. The GAO report found that LEA staff often lack information on federal requirements for K-12 education assistance, leading to cautious responses and limited flexibility. Staff also expressed concerns about the costs of meeting administrative responsibilities and facing challenges with timelines and management in federal education programs. Prior to the NCLB, various authorities allowed waivers for federal K-12 program requirements by SEAs and LEAs. These waivers had limitations in terms of the requirements, programs affected, and eligible states or LEAs. Some waivers required case-by-case requests, while others had blanket authority. Accountability for pupil outcomes varied among the authorities. In addition to Ed-Flex and Secretarial waivers, there was a high level of school-level flexibility. Before the NCLB, waivers like Ed-Flex and Secretarial waivers provided school-level flexibility in federal program funds. The Innovative Programs block grant also offered a wide range of flexibility. Additionally, small, rural LEAs had flexibility under FY2001 appropriations legislation for ED. These forms of special flexibility were established prior to the NCLB of 2001. Ed-Flex allows SEAs in participating states to waive requirements under selected ESEA programs for LEAs or schools. Initially authorized for six states in 1994, it was expanded to 12 states in 1996 and later modified to remove the cap on participating states. The Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999 removed the cap on participating states. Technical amendments were made by the NCLB of 2001, and Ed-Flex authority was extended until the next reauthorization of ESEA Title I, Part A in 2006. Initially granted to 12 states, Ed-Flex status was obtained by 10 states under P.L. 106-25. No state has been granted Ed-Flex authority since January 2002. Under P.L. 109-211, Ed-Flex authority for 10 states was extended until the reauthorization of ESEA Title I, Part A. No new states have been granted Ed-Flex authority since January 2002. Ed-Flex authority extends to 10 states, requiring commitment to waive state and federal requirements for LEAs and schools. States must adhere to curriculum and performance standards under ESEA Title I-A, monitor performance, and submit annual reports to ED. The curr_chunk discusses various programs under the ESEA, including literacy programs, education for migratory children, intervention programs for at-risk youth, school reform, teacher training, technology grants, immigrant education, safe schools, and innovative programs. These programs are administered by SEAs and allocate funds by formula. Additionally, the Carl D. Perkins Act is mentioned. The Ed-Flex statutes allow participating states to waive certain administrative requirements for state-administered programs under the ESEA. However, fiscal accountability requirements cannot be waived unless the Secretary of Education is satisfied that the underlying purposes are met. The Ed-Flex statutes allow states to waive administrative requirements for ESEA programs, but fiscal accountability requirements cannot be waived unless the Secretary of Education approves. LEAs must maintain spending levels for specified educational services, use federal aid to supplement state and local funds, ensure equitable participation by private school pupils and teachers, involve parents in program activities, allocate funds appropriately, meet ESEA Title I-A school selection requirements, and comply with civil rights regulations. States can waive administrative requirements for ESEA programs through Ed-Flex statutes, but fiscal accountability requirements need approval from the Secretary of Education. SEAs must ensure that the purposes of statutory requirements are still met when granting waivers. Local waivers can be terminated if student performance is inadequate or declines for two consecutive years. States must submit annual reports on granted waivers. Beginning with the second annual report, states must include information on the effects of waivers on student performance. ED is required to make state reports available to Congress and the public, summarizing the effects of Ed-Flex waivers on state reform efforts and pupil performance. The 2001 report lacked details on states' use of Ed-Flex authority and program impacts. The Ed-Flex authority focused on new activities under P.L. 106-25, overlooking ongoing activities in states with earlier authority. No subsequent annual reports have been published by ED. Waivers can be granted to SEAs or LEAs on a case-by-case basis by the U.S. Secretary of Education, with Title IX, Part D of the ESEA being the most utilized authority. Under Title IX, Part D of the ESEA, the Secretary of Education can waive requirements for programs authorized by the ESEA. Requests for waivers must include specific educational goals and methods for measuring progress annually. Waivers can be requested by SEAs, LEAs, Indian tribes, or schools through their LEAs. The provisions for waivers are similar to those for the Ed-Flex program. The ESEA Title IX-D waiver authority is similar to the Ed-Flex program but has additional requirements that cannot be waived, including prohibitions on certain uses of funds and eligibility requirements for charter schools. ESEA Title IX-D waivers can be granted for up to four years, with the possibility of extension if they contribute to improved student achievement. The Secretary of Education can terminate waivers if pupil performance is inadequate or if the waiver is no longer necessary. The Secretary of Education is required to publish a notice of the decision to grant a waiver in the Federal Register. A total of 197 waivers were granted under ESEA Title IX-D between January 2002 and December 31, 2006, with relatively few being substantive. Between January 2002 and December 31, 2006, a total of 197 waivers were granted under ESEA Title IX-D. Most waivers were related to administrative cost limitations and extensions of funding periods, with some granted for specific circumstances like Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, pilot programs, and accountability provisions under ESEA Title I-A. Between January 2002 and December 31, 2006, a total of 197 waivers were granted under ESEA Title IX-D, primarily for administrative cost limitations, funding period extensions, and specific circumstances like Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Additionally, waivers were granted for accountability provisions under ESEA Title I-A, with 6 LEAs identified for improvement acting as SES providers. Annual reports on waiver effects and effectiveness were required under ESEA Title IX-D, but it is unclear if any have been submitted. The PCS waiver authority under ESEA Section 5204(e) allows for waivers of any requirement over which the Secretary of Education has administrative authority, with the exception of requirements related to the definition of a charter school eligible for PCS funds. Schools with 40% or more low-income students can use federal funds for schoolwide programs, offering flexibility in spending across various education programs. This allows for improved services for all students, rather than targeting only the most disadvantaged. Schoolwide programs allow schools with 40% or more low-income students to use federal funds flexibly to benefit all students, not just the most disadvantaged. These programs are exempt from certain regulations but must ensure funds supplement, not replace, other sources of funding. The IDEA allows for commingling of funds in schoolwide programs, primarily impacting Title I-A programs. Other federal K-12 education programs are usually focused on LEAs, not individual schools. Non-Title I-A programs may focus on individual schools but not on groups of pupils with specific educational needs. The IDEA allows for commingling of funds in schoolwide programs, primarily impacting Title I-A programs. Schoolwide programs can combine Title I-A funds with state and local funds without separate accounting, providing flexibility compared to targeted assistance programs. Few additional requirements are needed for schoolwide programs to enjoy this flexibility. The number of schoolwide programs has increased. The number of schoolwide programs has grown rapidly in recent years, with a large majority of Title I-A pupils now in schoolwide programs. The eligibility threshold for schoolwide programs was reduced to 40% of pupils from low-income families by the NCLB, allowing high poverty schools to operate schoolwide programs. The NCLB has reduced the eligibility threshold for schoolwide programs to 40% of pupils from low-income families, allowing high poverty schools to operate schoolwide programs. This change raises questions about the equity of selecting only the lowest-achieving pupils for Title I-A services in high poverty schools. The level of Title I-A grants should be sufficient to impact overall school services in these schools. The NCLB has lowered the threshold for schoolwide programs to 40% of low-income students, allowing high poverty schools to implement these programs. The impact of this expansion on achievement levels is not well-documented. The Rural Education Achievement Program (REAP) provides grant programs and flexibility for small, rural LEAs. The Rural Education Achievement Program (REAP) provides flexibility for small, rural LEAs with low attendance or in sparsely populated areas to combine or transfer funds for various educational programs under ESEA Titles II-A, II-D, IV-A, and V-A. The Rural Education Achievement Program (REAP) allows small LEAs to combine or transfer funds for authorized activities under ESEA Titles I-A, III, and IV-B to address the challenge of small grant sizes. This flexibility aims to enhance the effectiveness of funds for these LEAs. The \"REAP Flex\" authority provides special flexibility to small, rural LEAs, allowing them to transfer 100% of funds to various programs under ESEA Titles III and IV-B. This authority differs from the broader Transferability authority available to all LEAs, which only allows for the transfer of 50% of funds. The small, rural LEA authority aims to maximize the effectiveness of limited funds for these schools. The small, rural schools flexibility authority (REAP Flex) allows LEAs to transfer funds to programs under ESEA Titles III and IV-B. Participation is widespread, with approximately 4,781 LEAs eligible and 51% participating in 2005-2006. Funds are often transferred from ESEA Titles II-A and IV-A. Rural LEAs found the flexibility of REAP Flex useful as their formula allocations were too small for school improvement activities. There was confusion between REAP Flex and Transferability authority at the LEA level. ESEA Title V-A, Innovative Programs is a K-12 education program administered by ED that is considered a block grant, providing flexibility to states and LEAs in using federal aid funds for a wide range of educational activities. ESEA Title V-A, Innovative Programs is a block grant program that provides flexibility to states and LEAs in using funds. Funds are allocated to states based on population aged 5-17, with a majority going to LEAs based on state-developed formulas. LEAs receive funds based on state-developed formulas that consider enrollment of pupils in public and private schools, with adjustments for high-cost pupils. The minimum percentage of funds suballocated to LEAs varies based on program funding levels. The Title V-A grants require states to suballocate at least 85% of the grant to LEAs, with some states needing to suballocate 100% of grants above the FY2002 level. States can retain up to 15% for administrative costs, with the rest used for specified programs and services. The Title V-A grants require states to suballocate a majority of the grant to LEAs for various educational programs and services, including pupil assessments, achievement standards, charter schools, school choice options, school repair, renovation, and statewide education reform initiatives. LEAs can use the funds for innovative assistance programs listed in Section 5131. Title V-A grants provide funding for a variety of educational programs and services at the state and local level. These programs range from specific initiatives like charter schools and school nurses to broader projects aimed at improving academic achievement for disadvantaged students. The flexibility in how funds can be used by LEAs and states categorizes Title V-A as a block grant. ESEA Title V-A, considered a block grant, prohibits SEAs from influencing LEA decisions on fund usage. Enacted in 1981 as Chapter 2 of ECIA, it consolidated over 40 federal K-12 education programs in response to a Reagan Administration proposal. The ESEA Title V-A block grant, enacted in 1981, consolidated federal education programs. A study found that recipient LEAs used funds for instructional materials, educational technology, and targeted academic services. Title V-A funds are used by LEAs for educational technology and supplemental targeted academic services, with large LEAs focusing on teacher professional development and school-based improvement. Resources are not often directed towards high-need pupils or schools. Decisions on fund usage are influenced by long-term LEA plans and school priorities. Appropriations for Title V-A have decreased significantly over the years. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2008 provides zero funds for Title V-A, potentially leading to the program's termination due to lack of support for increased funding. Despite being popular among education officials, the program lacks strong advocacy for funding. Funds for Title V-A have been supplemented by other authorities in recent years. Title V-A programs have faced challenges in securing funding, with limited information on their effects reducing incentives for maintaining funding levels. These programs have received less favorable treatment in funding decisions compared to those with clear targeting or links to improved educational outcomes, especially for high-need pupil groups. Amendments to ESEA Title V-A under NCLB now require states to provide annual summaries on how the assistance is contributing. Under NCLB, Title V-A programs must submit annual summaries on how assistance is improving student academic achievement or education quality. SEAs and LEAs can increase Title V-A funding by transferring funds from other federal programs. Previous provisions also offer flexibility to states and LEAs. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) introduced additional flexibility authorities for SEAs and LEAs, including the authority for consolidated applications, plans, or reports for ESEA programs, and the authority to consolidate certain funds for administration of federal programs. These authorities are currently provided in Parts B and C of ESEA Title IX. The NCLB, enacted on January 8, 2002, introduced flexibility authorities for ESEA programs. Title VI, Part A, Subpart 2 allows LEAs to transfer up to 50% of their formula grants among four ESEA programs. Under NCLB, LEAs can transfer funds between ESEA programs like Title IV-A-1 and Title V-A, but not from Title I-A. LEAs failing to meet AYP can only transfer 30% of their grants to address AYP standards. States can transfer up to 50% of program funds, except for administrative funds, among these programs. LEAs under corrective actions under Title I-A cannot transfer funds. States have limited authority to transfer funds between ESEA programs, excluding Title I-A, with a total of approximately $3.5 billion in FY2008 appropriations. LEAs can transfer funds without specific approval, except for those under corrective actions. LEAs have the authority to transfer funds between ESEA programs, excluding Title I-A, without needing approval, with a wide range of purposes for the transferred funds. Program requirements still apply, funds cannot be transferred across fiscal years, and all affected programs will continue to exist where the authority is exercised. According to a study by ED in July 2007, participation in Transferability is modest, with 12-16% of LEAs involved in 2005-2006. Confusion between REAP Flex and Transferability authorities complicates estimates of participation levels. LEAs and SEAs often provide conflicting reports on Transferability usage. LEAs participating in Transferability often moved funds from ESEA Title II-A and Title IV-A into Titles I-A and V-A to compensate for reductions in formula grants, target resources on failing schools, or utilize funds with flexibility. According to an evaluation report, reasons for LEAs not participating in Transferability include lack of information, satisfaction with existing flexibility, and insufficient funding levels. A new State and Local Flexibility Demonstration Act allows up to seven states to consolidate state administration and activity funds. The State and Local Flexibility Demonstration Act allows states to consolidate various funds under different education programs for greater flexibility in fund usage. States may consolidate funds under different education programs for flexibility, granted for five years. Authority can be terminated if AYP requirements are not met for two years or if terms are violated. Renewal possible if requirements are met. States must enter agreements with 4-10 LEAs, half with child poverty rates above 20%. LEAs with child poverty rates above 20% can consolidate funds under local flexibility authority, aligning with state uses. Participating states can specify purposes for Title V-A funds, unlike the general rule allowing LEAs to choose. State-Flex authority has been granted. State-Flex authority has been granted to only one state, Florida, which later withdrew before implementation. No state has participated in the State-Flex program yet. Local-Flex authority allows up to 80 LEAs to consolidate funds under various programs. LEAs can consolidate funds from various programs under ESEA for five years with no more than 4% for administration. Authority can be renewed if goals are met, but will be lost if AYP requirements are not met for two years or if flexibility agreement is violated. Limited types of flexibility are allowed under state and local demonstration programs. Under the state and local flexibility demonstration programs, certain requirements such as civil rights, fiscal accountability, and equitable participation by private school pupils and teachers cannot be waived. Participating states and LEAs must report annually on the use of consolidated funds. Other program requirements do not apply to the consolidated funds. Only Seattle, Washington, has participated in the Local-Flex program. Seattle's eligibility to participate in the Local-Flex program has been temporarily suspended due to failure to make AYP for two consecutive years. Despite efforts to promote State-Flex and Local-Flex authority, there has been little interest from states and LEAs. Currently, only one LEA has participated in Local-Flex, with no states in State-Flex. The ED study found that barriers to participation in State-Flex and Local-Flex programs included additional responsibilities, limited organizational capacity, and lack of information dissemination. A new round of competition for these programs began on March 18, 2004, with no set deadline for participation. The Local-Flex competition has no set deadline. States and LEAs in State-Flex or Local-Flex will receive preference in future grant competitions. This preference is due to their comprehensive planning to improve teacher quality and student achievement. State-Flex and Local-Flex programs allow funds from various ESEA programs to be used for authorized purposes with few restrictions. Participation is limited to a maximum of seven states and a small number of LEAs. Despite the preference given in grant competitions, interest from SEAs and LEAs has been limited. The State-Flex and Local-Flex programs have limited participation from SEAs and LEAs despite grant competitions. State-Flex authority allows state administration funds to be used for other purposes, but states must still meet their administrative responsibilities. The share of funds available for state administration and activities is small, especially for the largest affected program like ESEA Title I-A. The State-Flex and Local-Flex programs have limited participation from SEAs and LEAs despite grant competitions. The relevant share of state total grants varies from 1% to 26.5% under different programs. Participating states would have substantial influence over the use of funds consolidated by LEAs with local performance agreements. LEAs in the state demonstration program might have diminished flexibility in using consolidated funds aligned with state use. The inclusion of the ESEA Title V-A Innovative Programs block grant in the Local-Flex authority is of limited significance as those funds can already be used for a wide range of activities. Comparing State-Flex and Local-Flex authority with flexibility authorities in earlier versions of H.R. 1 shows similarities in authorizing local flexibility. The Senate version of H.R. 1 proposed a broader state and local flexibility/performance agreement authority, which was not included in the final legislation. This provision would have offered greater flexibility compared to the enacted State-Flex and Local-Flex authorities. The Senate version of H.R. 1 proposed a broader state and local flexibility/performance agreement authority, offering greater flexibility than the enacted State-Flex and Local-Flex authorities. The scope of the H.R. 1/Senate flexibility/performance agreement authority was similar in terms of the maximum number of participating states (7) but more limited in the number of LEAs in other states (25) that could participate. The types of program requirements for the use of consolidated funds remained similar. The Senate version of H.R. 1 proposed a broader state and local flexibility/performance agreement authority, offering greater flexibility than the enacted State-Flex and Local-Flex authorities. The range of ESEA programs subject to the flexibility authority was much more broad and involved substantially higher levels of funding, incorporating most state-administered formula grant programs authorized by the ESEA. Funds could be used for activities authorized under any of the combined programs, including the wide range of authorized activities under the Innovative Programs block grant. The Senate version of H.R. 1 proposed a broader state and local flexibility/performance agreement authority, offering greater flexibility than the enacted State-Flex and Local-Flex authorities. Participating states could reallocate funds among and within LEAs to target concentrations of poor children, but State-Flex does not allow this. The additional outcome accountability required would have mandated exceeding AYP goals by a statistically significant amount. The report discusses the need for state AYP standards to be statistically significant and not just large, especially in states with a large pupil population. It also analyzes cross-cutting issues related to flexibility in education policies. The special flexibility authorities allow states and LEAs to use federal aid funds according to their own priorities, with limitations on participation, programs affected, and program requirements that may be waived. The special flexibility authorities allow states and LEAs to waive federal program requirements in exchange for increased accountability based on pupil achievement outcomes, particularly under NCLB. These authorities provide flexibility within the context of heightened accountability requirements for Title I-A and other ESEA programs. The ESEA and related federal programs offer flexibility authorities for LEAs, with REAP Flex being the most widely used among small, rural LEAs. Reporting requirements on the use of flexibility and its impact on pupil achievement exist, but specific impacts are not well-documented. The ESEA Title I-A schoolwide program authority provides flexibility for LEAs, but it is limited to the school level and only applies to schools with slightly above average low-income pupil rates. The current flexibility authorities may not fully address the primary concerns of states and LEAs regarding restrictions on federal funds and administrative burdens. The Secretarial case-by-case waiver authorities are limited by the necessity of submitting individual requests to the U.S. Secretary of Education. LEAs must apply to their SEAs for waivers under the Ed-Flex authority. States and LEAs can exercise fund Transferability authority, but cannot transfer more than 50% of funds received under any program. Rural LEA flexibility authority is available. The limited increase in flexibility provided by the rural LEA, State-Flex, and Local-Flex authorities has resulted in low participation rates. Certain requirements, such as fiscal accountability, cannot be waived under these authorities. The flexibility authorities, including fiscal accountability, private school participation, and ESEA Title I-A requirements, do not offer significant flexibility. A 1999 GAO report found that these authorities do not address the main regulatory burdens. The flexibility authorities enacted do not address the main regulatory burdens of states and LEAs, including requirements under IDEA, Americans with Disabilities Act, child nutrition program administration, and environmental requirements. Some SEA staff view Ed-Flex as of limited value, while others see it as encouraging innovation and flexibility. These remarks also apply to new authorities enacted in 2001. The new authorities enacted in 2001 and 2002 have provided increased flexibility for LEAs and schools in using funds, especially in schoolwide programs. This flexibility coincides with a period of greater flexibility in federal program requirements. The NCLB consolidated programs related to teachers and technology, giving states more flexibility. Limited information is available on the use of this flexibility, with low participation in some areas. Waivers can remove federal barriers to local educational reform. The NCLB consolidated programs for teachers and technology, providing states with more flexibility. Waivers have been used for various purposes, some unrelated to innovation. ESEA Title IX-D authority allowed states to participate in a growth model pilot for determining AYP. A recent study found that flexibility authority under REAP Flex and Transferability was mainly used to move funds from ESEA Title II-A and Title IV-A to Titles I-A and V-A. LEAs used this authority to offset reductions in formula grants and target resources on schools not meeting progress standards. In the pre-NCLB era, flexibility authorities were used to waive requirements such as low-income pupil thresholds for Title I-A eligibility and deadlines for standards and assessments adoption. In the pre-NCLB era, flexibility authorities were used to waive requirements for Title I-A eligibility and deadlines for standards and assessments adoption. This included limitations on funds for teacher recruitment and training programs like Class Size Reduction and Eisenhower Professional Development Programs. The use of waivers to expand Title I-A participation may limit the impact of schoolwide programs on schools with low poverty rates. There is no systematic evidence that schoolwide programs are more effective than targeted assistance programs in improving education for disadvantaged students. The use of waivers in Title I-A funding disperses funds among low-poverty schools, reducing concentration on high-poverty schools. Waivers can delay meeting ESEA Title I-A requirements, undermining outcome accountability. LEAs often request waivers to focus teacher hiring on early education. After the enactment of NCLB, waivers were frequently requested to accommodate specific limitations on the use of funds based on local conditions. These waivers aimed to adjust teacher hiring, form consortia for small LEAs, allocate teacher training funds for math and science instruction, and limit CSR funds for professional development. The NCLB changed the eligibility threshold for schoolwide programs to 40% of low-income students nationwide. The CSR and Eisenhower programs were merged into a more flexible ESEA Title II program. Few waivers have been granted under ESEA Title IX-D post-NCLB. Limited information is available on the impact of special forms of flexibility on pupil achievement during the post-NCLB era. Anecdotal information on the achievement effects of Ed-Flex and Secretarial waivers in a limited number of LEAs was included in a 1999 ED report. No reports have been published on the actual purposes of waivers or their effects in states under the Ed-Flex authority enacted in 1999. The 1999 ED report included information on waivers in a limited number of LEAs, focusing on whether affected schools met state AYP standards. Supporters of flexibility authorities argue that they have positively impacted state and local education systems, as seen in a 1998 ED report on Ed-Flex. This report concluded that Ed-Flex has supported standards-based reform by facilitating program coordination and strengthening the planning process. Ed-Flex promotes coordination of programs and planning process by allowing LEAs and schools to develop instructional programs without standard federal or state constraints. It streamlines program administration, supports resources utilization for increased student achievement, and reduces the achievement gap between different populations. The Ed-Flex program shifts focus towards outcomes rather than procedures, but there is limited data showing improved pupil achievement. Questions arise about the availability of sufficient information to analyze the benefits and impact of special flexibility authorities on pupil achievement. Despite the shift towards outcomes with special flexibility authorities like Ed-Flex, there is a lack of relevant information from the Department of Education (ED) on the use and effects of waivers. This hinders the evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of these authorities. The outcome accountability requirements associated with special flexibility authorities like Ed-Flex involve goals set by states and LEAs, as well as meeting state-established adequate yearly progress (AYP). The Ed-Flex authority involves meeting state-established AYP requirements under ESEA Title I-A. A GAO study found variation in states' clarity and specificity of outcome goals for granting waivers. The GAO study found that states had set no specific objectives for LEAs or schools granted waivers, with limited ED oversight of Ed-Flex implementation. The only concrete outcome accountability requirement was meeting AYP requirements. The current flexibility authorities do not require additional outcome accountability for participating LEAs and states beyond that of Title I-A and other ESEA programs. Instead, they emphasize consequences for failing to meet general outcome accountability requirements, which may still be substantial compared to states without special flexibility authority. The current flexibility authorities do not require additional outcome accountability for participating LEAs and states beyond that of Title I-A and other ESEA programs. However, those with special flexibility authority would have an additional incentive to meet the requirements to maintain their eligibility, and an additional negative consequence for failing to do so. This enhancement of outcome accountability requirements may be consistent with the nature of the special flexibility authorities described in this report. The provisions for increased flexibility and outcome accountability are limited, especially in light of recent legislation like NCLB. Some argue that high levels of state and local flexibility in using federal education funds do not require additional outcome or accountability requirements. Critics argue that granting special forms of flexibility without additional outcome or accountability requirements is unjustified. Critics defend accountability requirements as national priorities and are concerned about the lack of accountability provisions in special flexibility authorities, which have been used for unproven purposes."
