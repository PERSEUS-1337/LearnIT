    "content": "The United States has historically had abundant natural resources, but growing industrialization and population led to increased reliance on foreign energy sources in the 20th century. Concerns over price volatility and supply fluctuations prompted federal efforts to enhance energy independence and reduce domestic consumption. The United States has implemented programs to increase energy independence and reduce domestic consumption by focusing on energy efficiency, conservation of resources, and developing renewable energy sources. These programs have been redesigned periodically over almost 40 years to meet changing economic conditions and national interests, applying broadly across various sectors and communities. Since 2005, Congress has enacted major energy laws to establish, expand, or modify energy efficiency and renewable energy programs operated by the Department of Energy (DOE). The Department of Energy (DOE) operates numerous energy efficiency and renewable energy incentive programs, with other departments like Treasury, Agriculture, Interior, Labor, Housing, Veterans Affairs, and Small Business Administration also offering programs. These federal programs provide grants, loans, loan guarantees, and incentives for energy efficiency, conservation, and renewable energy RDD&D. The federal energy efficiency and renewable energy incentive programs are grouped by administering agency with references to applicable federal agency websites. Incentives are summarized and indexed in the appendixes, compiled from various sources including authorizing statutes, the U.S. Code, and budget documents. Budgetary figures are sourced from executive agency justifications and congressional reports. The curr_chunk provides information on agriculture-related grant programs and programs supporting alternatives to conventional fuels and engines in transportation. It references specific CRS reports for more details on these topics. The curr_chunk discusses federal programs related to alternative fuel and advanced vehicle technology incentives, including a summary of renewable energy and energy efficiency incentives, an index of programs by applicant eligibility and technology type, and expired incentive programs. The curr_chunk lists various federal programs related to energy efficiency and renewable energy technology deployment, including grants, rebate programs, tax credits, and competitive grants for worker training."
