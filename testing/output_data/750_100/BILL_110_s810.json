FINDINGS.\" Congress finds the need to increase the number of high school students prepared for STEM education and emphasizes the importance of hands-on laboratory experience in science programs. The National Research Council found that the quality of high school science laboratories is poor for most students, with disagreement among educators and researchers on defining labs' purpose. Schools with higher concentrations of non-Asian minorities and poor students are less likely to have adequate lab facilities. The Government Accountability Office found that nearly half of schools with a majority minority student population did not meet laboratory science requirements. Additionally, 40% of college students who left the science fields cited issues with high school science preparation, such as lack of lab experience and exposure to theoretical thinking. It is in the national interest for the Federal Government to invest in research and projects to enhance science education. Invest in research and demonstration projects to improve teaching of laboratory science in high schools. The grant program outlined in Section 2 aims to support research and demonstration projects to enhance the teaching of laboratory science in high schools. Section 8(8) of the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 is amended to redesignate subparagraphs and clauses, adjust indentation, and make language changes. A pilot program is also introduced as part of the initiative to support research and demonstration projects in high school laboratory science teaching. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 is amended to introduce a pilot program called 'Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science' to enhance mathematics, science, engineering, and technology instruction at the secondary level through grants for improving laboratories and providing instrumentation. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 introduces a pilot program called 'Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science' to enhance STEM instruction at the secondary level through grants for equipment, maintenance, professional development, and instructional development. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 introduces a pilot program called 'Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science' to enhance STEM instruction at the secondary level through grants for equipment, maintenance, professional development, and instructional programs integrating laboratory experiences with classroom instruction, training in laboratory safety, and hands-on laboratory experiences to encourage interest. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 introduces a pilot program to encourage individuals in mathematics, science, engineering, and technology to pursue postsecondary studies in these fields. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 introduces a pilot program to encourage individuals in STEM fields to pursue postsecondary studies. Grants awarded under this program are to partnerships including higher education institutions, high-need local educational agencies, businesses, and nonprofit organizations. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 introduces a pilot program where grants can be awarded to partnerships involving various entities such as State educational agencies, National Laboratories, and community-based organizations. The Federal share of the cost for activities funded by these grants should not exceed 50 percent. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 introduces a pilot program for grants involving partnerships with State educational agencies, National Laboratories, and community-based organizations. The Federal share of the cost for these grants should not exceed 50 percent. SEC. 3. REPORT. The Director of the National Science Foundation will evaluate pilot projects funded by the grant program to improve student performance in STEM fields. A report on the evaluation results will be submitted to specific Senate and House committees within 5 years of the Act's enactment, identifying best practices. The report will identify best practices and materials developed by grant awardees under this Act. Authorization of appropriations for the National Science Foundation under this Act and its amendments include $5,000,000 for fiscal year 2008 and necessary sums for the following 3 years."
