    "content": "The \"Landmine Elimination Act of 1997\" is the short title of this Act. It includes findings related to landmines. Congress found that in 1995, the Senate voted to impose a moratorium on US use of anti-personnel landmines, and in 1996, senior retired military officers urged the President to ban production and use of these landmines, stating it would be humane and militarily responsible. In 1996, President Clinton declared that the use of anti-personnel landmines would not undermine military effectiveness or safety, citing casualties in Vietnam and Bosnia. The Department of State estimates a landmine-related death or injury every 22 minutes. On May 16, 1996, President Clinton announced the US's commitment to banning anti-personnel landmines. In June 1996, the Organization of American States, including the US, aimed for a landmine-free Western Hemisphere. The Organization of African Unity also set a goal for Africa to be free of anti-personnel landmines. Canada declared negotiations for a treaty to ban anti-personnel landmines on October 5, 1996. On December 10, 1996, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution to pursue a treaty banning anti-personnel landmines, with formal negotiations to begin in Oslo, Norway in September 1997. The United States could use its international influence to secure support for a treaty banning anti-personnel landmines, which would enhance US security and humanitarian interests by deterring their use against US Armed Forces and civilians. SEC. 3. RESTRICTION ON NEW DEPLOYMENTS OF ANTI-PERSONNEL LANDMINES. Beginning on January 1, 2000, no funds may be used for new deployments of anti-personnel landmines. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report to Congress within 180 days outlining alternatives for such deployments on the Korean Peninsula. Consultations with experts are required for the report. The President has the authority to delay the restriction if needed. The President can delay the restriction on new deployments of anti-personnel landmines on the Korean Peninsula if deemed necessary for the defense of the Republic of Korea. The report must include efforts to implement proposals and similar measures. The report submitted under subsection (b) and subsequent proposals by the Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff are important for implementing measures related to anti-personnel landmines on the Korean Peninsula. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"anti-personnel landmine\" refers to munitions designed to detonate by contact with a person, causing harm or death. \"New deployments of anti-personnel landmines\" are those placed after January 1, 2000. Exclusions: Command-detonated Claymore munitions are not considered anti-personnel landmines."
