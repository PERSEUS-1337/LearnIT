    "content": "The \"Lumbee Recognition Act\" is cited in Section 1, while Section 2 amends the preamble of the Act of June 7, 1956 by making specific changes. The Lumbee Indians of North Carolina are recognized as descendants of coastal tribes and have been acknowledged as an Indian tribe by the State of North Carolina since 1885 and by the Congress of the United States in 1956. The Lumbee Indians, recognized as descendants of coastal tribes, should be granted full Federal recognition with benefits and privileges as an Indian tribe. The Lumbee Indians, descendants of coastal tribes, are seeking full Federal recognition with benefits and privileges as an Indian tribe. The Act of June 7, 1956 is amended to address this recognition. Federal recognition is extended to the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina, allowing them to receive benefits and services as an Indian tribe. Other Indian groups in the area can petition for acknowledgment of tribal existence if not enrolled in the Lumbee Tribe. The Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina and its members are eligible for services and benefits provided to Indians. Members residing in specific counties are considered to be on or near an Indian reservation. The Secretary verifies needs and budget for the tribe. The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Health and Human Services will develop a determination of needs and budget for services eligible to members of the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina after verifying the tribal roll. This will be included in the budget request to Congress. The tribal roll, verified by the Secretary of the Interior, will define the service population of the Tribe for the delivery of Federal services. Verification will confirm compliance with membership criteria in the Tribe's constitution adopted on November 11, 2000. Verification of the tribal roll by the Secretary of the Interior must be completed within 1 year of the enactment of this section in 2000. The Tribe seeks to convey fee land to the United States for trust purposes, to be treated as on-reservation trust acquisitions if located in Robeson County, North Carolina. The State of North Carolina has jurisdiction over criminal offenses and civil actions on land owned by the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina. The Secretary of the Interior can accept transfers of land from North Carolina to the United States. The Lumbee Tribe can transfer jurisdiction of their land from North Carolina to the United States under an agreement, with a 2-year waiting period before it takes effect. This transfer does not affect the application of the Indian Child Welfare Act. Authorization of appropriations is granted to carry out the Act."
