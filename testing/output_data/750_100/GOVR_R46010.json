    "content": "For the first 100 years of the electric power industry, electricity generation was centralized. In response to the 1970s energy crisis, Congress promoted alternatives like customer-sited generation, a type of distributed generation located on customer properties. One policy to encourage this is net metering, defined in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Net metering allows electric consumers to offset energy provided by the utility with energy generated on-site, mainly through solar PV. This policy is relevant to discussions on renewable energy in the nation's electricity system. Some Members of Congress are interested in how states have modified their net metering policies and the impact on stakeholders. Recent state policy changes may either expand or slow down solar energy development. Congress has the option to restrict, encourage, or require state policy modifications regarding net metering. This report discusses current issues related to net metering policy, which determines how electricity customers with distributed generation are compensated for electricity they deliver to the grid. Net metering typically involves compensating customers on a one-to-one basis for electricity purchased from the grid. Net metering involves compensating customers for electricity they deliver to the grid by subtracting it from the amount they consume for billing purposes. Different policy options include buy-all, sell-all, and net billing. As of April 2019, 45 states had net metering policies in place that require utilities to offer net metering to customers, with some policies including alternatives to net energy metering. In states without mandatory net metering, some utilities voluntarily offer the service. Nearly 2 million customers participated in net metering programs according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), around 1% of U.S. electricity customers participated in net metering programs in 2018, totaling almost 2 million customers. The number of net metering customers has been increasing since 2013. Net metering participation can be measured in various ways, such as total net metering capacity or electricity delivered to the grid from net metering generators. The EIA data shows that net metering participation varies by state, with Hawaii having the highest rate at over 15% of customers. Factors influencing participation include state policies, renewable standards, electricity prices, and solar resources. Electricity ratemaking involves allocating costs to customers incurred by utilities in producing and delivering electricity. Various factors and complexities influence this process, with state net metering policies being a major area of debate. This section discusses ratemaking considerations for vertically-integrated investor-owned utilities, where the utility owns and operates all parts of the electricity system. State regulators approve rates for the utility to charge customers, ensuring costs are recovered through bill payments. Costs include building and operating power plants, transmission, and compliance with regulations. The process of setting rates for utilities involves considering various costs such as building and maintaining infrastructure, grid operation, programmatic costs, and return on investments. Rates are typically set based on volumetric rates, where all customers within a customer class pay the same rate per kilowatt-hour. The more electricity a customer uses, the higher their bill will be. Customers' electricity bills vary monthly based on consumption. Regulators estimate a volumetric rate to cover utility costs shared among all customers. Customer service costs may be separate and appear as a fixed charge on the bill. The customer's electricity bill includes volumetric charges based on consumption and a fixed customer charge. Some high-consuming customers may also have demand charges. EPACT05 encouraged states to adopt net metering. States with net metering have different compensation approaches, impacting DG deployment. A study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory found that compensation mechanisms strongly influence the value proposition of DG investments for customers. Net metering compensates customers at the utility's retail rate of electricity. Initially seen as a simple approach, policymakers assumed the retail rate was a sufficient proxy for the value of solar or DG. The retail rate was initially assumed to be a good proxy for the value of solar or DG, with small numbers of participating customers and kilowatt hours credited at this rate. Retail rates offer high compensation for net metering generation due to reflecting the utility's total costs for delivering electricity. The retail rate reflects the utility's total costs for delivering electricity, including generating electricity and maintaining the grid. Net metering customers may recover upfront costs of a DG system more quickly with retail rates, but this could lead to increased costs for non-net metering customers due to a cost shift or cross-subsidy. Net metering customers generate their own electricity, reducing utility costs. However, they still rely on the grid for services, leading to potential cost increases for non-net metering customers. Some stakeholders have raised concerns about potential equity issues with residential net metering customers having higher incomes than non-net metering customers, leading to cross-subsidy worries. Studies vary in their findings on the extent of cross-subsidies, attributing it to different methodologies used in estimating costs and benefits over varying timeframes. This lack of consensus contributes to the uncertainty surrounding the magnitude of cross-subsidies. One synthesis of estimates around 2015 found that net metering cost shifts range from $444 to $1,752 per customer annually. Observers may disagree on the threshold for policy action regarding cross-subsidies. Net metering is just one factor influencing electricity rates, with local factors like DG penetration and demand growth also playing a role. A 2017 study assessed various factors affecting electricity rates, including net metering, energy efficiency, natural gas prices, and utility capital expenditures. The study found that DG would likely increase rates by 0.03 to 0.2 cents/kWh, compared to other factors causing increases up to 3.6 cents/kWh. The presence of a cost shift does not necessarily mean non-net metering customers are transferring money to net metering customers. The extent of this would depend on net metering participation rates. Some states are transitioning from using the retail rate as a proxy for allocating system costs and benefits to net metering customers to more precise methods. Regulators aim to mitigate cost shifts through ratemaking decisions, which may have inherent time lags. Cost shifts are not unique to distributed generation (DG) and are addressed in the larger context of rate design principles. States are exploring options to address concerns about cross-subsidies from retail rate compensation for net metering customers. This includes adding fixed charges or changing the compensation rate to allow utilities to recover grid maintenance costs. Some stakeholders support compensating net metering customers at the retail rate for its perceived advantages, such as administrative simplicity. Utilities and advocates for low-income customers typically favor this approach, arguing that fixed charges can reduce cost shifting. On the other hand, opponents like the solar industry and environmental advocates believe that net metering promotes competition and that discouraging distributed generation ignores its societal benefits. Determining a value for fixed charges that accurately reflects net metering customers' use of the grid has been complex and controversial in practice. Some states have adopted an alternative compensation rate called an avoided cost rate to represent the energy costs utilities avoid when net metering customers supply their own energy. The avoided cost rate reflects energy production costs and may include network upgrades for reliable integration of distributed generation like solar PV. It is usually lower than retail rates and is used as an alternative compensation rate for net metering customers with solar PV installations. Customers with installed solar PV are compensated based on a value of solar (VOS) rate, which reflects societal benefits like reduced air emissions. Solar advocates support including societal benefits in net metering policy and rate design. VOS rates are typically higher than avoided cost rates but lower than retail rates. States have the flexibility to determine VOS rates. New York and other states have the flexibility to set a Value of Solar (VOS) rate for distributed energy resources, including solar generation. This rate reflects estimated grid and societal benefits and can be higher than retail rates. The debate includes whether to use VOS or avoided cost rates in net metering arrangements. The debate around alternative compensation approaches for distributed generation (DG) includes considerations of costs and benefits, which can be time- and location-specific. States vary in their evaluation of net metering, as shown in a 2018 analysis of 15 state studies. This analysis highlighted the use of different assumptions and value categories in assessing net metering costs and benefits. State net metering policies vary in compensation and other aspects such as program caps, source eligibility, credit retention, and system ownership, all of which can impact the deployment of distributed generation (DG). Program caps limit the number of participants based on power units or a percentage of electricity demand. Program caps in state net metering policies can impact the promotion of distributed generation (DG) by limiting participants based on power units or electricity demand percentages. These caps can reduce risks to the electricity system and prevent cross-subsidies, but they may also hinder the achievement of renewable energy goals. States set specific criteria for net metering participation, including generation sources, capacity limits, and technology types. Solar energy is the primary source, but other energy types may also be allowed based on cost, customer type, and location. For instance, combined heat and power facilities are more appealing to large commercial and industrial customers. Facilities attractive to large commercial and industrial customers that use steam. Distributed wind projects appealing to farms or customers with large acreage. Net metering customers can deliver surplus generation to the grid. State net metering policies compensate for total electricity generation or only surplus generation. Net metering customers can receive credits for surplus generation delivered to the grid. Credit retention policies vary by state and can impact reducing electricity costs to $0. Single generators behind a meter, like rooftop solar installations, are common. Some states allow aggregate net metering for customers with multiple meters, such as farms or municipalities. Shared net metering allows multiple customers with the same net metering generation capacity to receive credits for surplus generation. Virtual net metering is a version of shared net metering for onsite projects like multi-family dwellings. Third party participation, such as solar leasing, allows entities other than the electricity consumer to own the solar system. Some Members of Congress have introduced legislation to address states' net metering policies, which could impact state regulations on compensation rates and fixed charges for net metering customers. For example, S.Amdt. 3120 in the 114th Congress aimed to limit state regulators' ability to adjust compensation rates, while S.Amdt. 3053 would have required regulators to consider cross-subsidies in net metering policies. H.R. 4175 in the 116th Congress proposed states to consider adopting net billing policies for community solar. In the 116th Congress, legislation such as S. 346 and H.R. 1009 would require studies by the National Academies on various aspects of net metering, including alternative incentives for distributed generation and operating techniques. In the 116th Congress, legislation such as S. 346 and H.R. 1009 would require studies on alternative incentives for distributed generation, net metering planning and operating techniques, and consumer and industry incentives for net metering."
