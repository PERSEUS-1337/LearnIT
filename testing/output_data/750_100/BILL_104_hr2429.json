    "content": "The \"Farms for the Future Act Amendments of 1995\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. The purpose and findings are outlined in Section 2. The \"Farms for the Future Act Amendments of 1995\" aims to provide financially competitive options for agricultural producers to maintain prime, unique, and strategic farmland in agricultural production, as outlined in Section 2. Federal assistance is necessary to protect prime, unique, and strategic farmlands as states and local governments have not been able to incentivize landowners to maintain these lands in agricultural production. Federal assistance is needed to protect prime, unique, and strategic farmlands through federal cost-sharing for the acquisition of farmland protection easements under the Farms for the Future Act of 1990. The term 'qualifying farmland' refers to land used for agriculture deemed important by a State or local agency due to its agricultural, economic, or environmental value and at risk of being converted to incompatible uses. 'Farmland protection easement' is an easement that protects farmland from such conversion. Farmland protection easement prohibits incompatible land uses, binds future landowners, and is approved by eligible States for cost-sharing. The Secretary may provide matching grants to eligible States for acquiring farmland protection easements or developing similar programs to protect qualifying farmland. Grants are on a 50-50 matching basis, with local governments also eligible for approval. The Secretary may provide matching grants for acquiring farmland protection easements on a 50-50 basis, with the possibility of grants up to 90 percent for eligible States actively protecting farmland. There is a limitation where an eligible State cannot receive more than 10 percent of the total matching grants available for a fiscal year, unless fewer than 10 States participate. The Secretary may provide matching grants for acquiring farmland protection easements on a 50-50 basis, with grants up to 90 percent for eligible States actively protecting farmland. States may receive their pro rata share of total matching funds available. Funds must be used to protect qualifying farmland, prioritizing lands important to the State's agriculture industry, and ensuring that the purchase price of easements does not exceed fair market value. Authorization of appropriations is provided. Authorization of appropriations is provided for carrying out the section each fiscal year."
