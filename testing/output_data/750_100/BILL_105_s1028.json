    "content": "The Act titled \"Quincy Library Group Forest Recovery and Economic Stability Act of 1997\" establishes a pilot project for Plumas, Lassen, and Tahoe National Forests to implement the Quincy Library Group proposal. The Quincy Library Group-Community Stability Proposal is an agreement by a coalition in northern California to develop a resource management program for Federal lands in the Sierra Nevada area. It includes a map dated June 1993. The Act establishes a pilot project for implementing this proposal in specific national forests. The Secretary of Agriculture will conduct a pilot project on Federal lands to implement resource management activities as recommended in the Quincy Library Group-Community Stability Proposal. The Secretary of Agriculture will conduct a pilot project on Federal lands within designated areas in California as part of the Quincy Library Group-Community Stability Proposal. During the pilot project in designated areas in California, spotted owl habitat areas and protected activity centers will be deferred from resource management activities and timber harvesting. The Regional Forester for region 5 will ensure that road building and timber harvesting activities are suspended during the project term. The pilot project in California defers spotted owl habitat areas and protected activity centers from resource management and timber harvesting. Riparian protection guidelines apply to all resource management activities in specified federal lands. The pilot project in California defers timber harvesting activities in the pilot project area as outlined in the guidelines from a Forest Service research document dated March 1993. During the pilot project in California, resource management activities must comply with applicable Federal law and guidelines for the conservation of the California spotted owl. The Secretary will implement these activities on Federal lands on an acreage basis. The pilot project in California involves resource management activities on Federal lands, including fuelbreak construction and vegetation management on 40,000 to 60,000 acres per year. Group and individual tree selection methods will be utilized. Utilization of group selection and individual tree selection methods in uneven-aged forest management to achieve desired forest conditions. Group selection on .57% of the pilot project area each year, with potential for individual tree selection. Total acreage for resource management activities in the pilot project area. The pilot project involves implementing resource management activities on a total acreage not exceeding 70,000 acres each year, including riparian management and cost-effective measures. Funding for the project is also addressed. The pilot project involves implementing resource management activities on up to 70,000 acres annually, including riparian management and cost-effective measures. The Secretary will use specific funds provided for the project and excess funds allocated for the administration of certain national forests. The pilot project involves resource management activities on up to 70,000 acres annually in Plumas National Forest, Lassen National Forest, and Tahoe National Forest. The Secretary is prohibited from using funds allocated for other national forest units and forest supervisors have flexibility in allocating excess funds for project administration. The administration and management of Plumas National Forest, Lassen National Forest, and the Sierraville Ranger District of Tahoe National Forest are authorized to perform resource management activities. The Secretary or forest supervisors cannot use certain authorities if it will limit other multiple use activities. Up to 12 percent of available funds can be used for overhead costs. Authorized supplemental funds are available to implement the pilot project as necessary, with baseline funds required to include existing funding levels for resource management activities. The pilot project will be conducted for a minimum of five years, starting from the enactment of the Act or until the completion of land and resource management plan revisions for specific national forests. Consultation is required for each statement as per subsection (b)(1). Within 180 days of the Act's enactment, the Regional Forester for Region 5 will start amending the land and resource management plans for specific national forests in consultation with the Quincy Library Group. The Forest Service may use private contracts to fulfill the requirements of this section. The Regional Forester will amend land management plans in consultation with the Quincy Library Group, incorporating pilot projects and resource activities. Changes will be made based on environmental analyses and relevant laws. Reporting is required annually by February 28. The Secretary, in consultation with the Quincy Library Group, must submit an annual report to Congress by February 28 on the pilot project's status. The report should include a detailed account of fund usage and schedules for the previous fiscal year. The annual report to Congress must include a detailed account of fund usage and schedules for the previous fiscal year, as well as a description of total acres treated for various resource management activities and the benefits achieved. The annual report to Congress must include a detailed account of fund usage and schedules for the previous fiscal year, as well as a description of total acres treated for various resource management activities and the benefits achieved. Additionally, it should provide a description of the economic benefits to local communities and compare revenues and costs of resource management activities on Federal lands before and after inclusion in the pilot project. The annual report to Congress must include a detailed account of fund usage, schedules for resource management activities, adverse environmental impacts, and limitations on expenditures. Additionally, a final report will be compiled after 6 months of the second year of the pilot project, assessing the project based on science. The assessment and report on the pilot project will include watershed monitoring, analysis of adverse environmental impacts, and consultation with stakeholders. The assessment and report on the pilot project, in consultation with the Quincy Library Group, must be submitted to Congress by July 1, 2002. Federal funds for the assessment and report are limited to $150,000, with an additional $75,000 allocated for watershed monitoring in fiscal years 2000, 2001, and 2002. This section does not exempt the project from other laws. The pilot project must comply with all Federal environmental laws."
