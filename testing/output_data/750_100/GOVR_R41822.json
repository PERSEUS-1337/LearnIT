    "content": "The 112th Congress is considering legislative proposals to limit the government's risk from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government-sponsored enterprises responsible for nearly half of the nation's residential mortgage debt. In 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac faced capital inadequacy due to mortgage defaults and foreclosures. To support them during the financial crisis, the U.S. Treasury purchased over $175 billion in special preferred stock and the Fed bought $1.4 trillion in MBS from investors. The U.S. Treasury purchased over $175 billion in preferred stock from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac during the financial crisis. Legislation may reduce the enterprises' size and increase their costs, potentially leading to higher prices for their business partners. The proposed legislation may increase costs for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, leading to lower mortgage prices and higher interest rates for borrowers. It could also allow other securitizers to compete more effectively. New limitations on mortgage purchases and increased regulatory oversight are also part of the bills. Additionally, increased capital requirements would reduce risks but add to costs. The legislative proposals aim to increase costs for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, potentially leading to lower mortgage prices and higher interest rates for borrowers. New SEC filing requirements would remove a competitive advantage and align them with competitors. Other proposals include returning the enterprises to stockholder control or dissolution, and replacing them in the secondary mortgage markets. The enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, faced financial difficulties due to mortgage delinquencies and inadequate capital. In 2008, they entered voluntary conservatorship under the FHFA. Legislative proposals aim to increase costs for the enterprises and potentially lead to lower mortgage prices and higher interest rates for borrowers. Other proposals include returning the enterprises to stockholder control or dissolution. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac provide financial support to stay solvent, indirectly benefiting homeowners by offering mortgage money. They purchase mortgages from lenders, create MBS, and guarantee loan repayment. They back nearly half of the nation's home mortgages. The Obama Administration's report on the future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac presents three alternatives for the housing finance system: a privatized system with government mortgage programs targeted based on income or first-time homebuyer status, a privatized system with a government guarantee only during a crisis, and a privatized system with backup government reinsurance of private mortgage insurance. No legislation has been introduced to implement these proposals yet. Legislation has not been introduced to implement the Obama Administration's proposals for housing finance reform. Details on the proposals can be found in CRS Report R41719. The report discusses legislation introduced in the 112th Congress, with most bills focusing on specific areas like executive compensation. Some bills aim to reform multiple areas. H.R. 31, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Accountability and Transparency for Taxpayers Act of 2011, would require the director of FHFA to make quarterly reports on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 12 specific areas, including total liabilities, executive compensation, foreclosure mitigation efforts, and mortgage fraud prevention efforts. The FHFA director must report quarterly on various aspects of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, including securities transactions, capital levels, underwriting standards, and mortgage policies. The reports should also cover any additional relevant information deemed important for assessing the enterprises' activities and conditions. The FHFA inspector general would review reports on the enterprises' financial condition and inform Congress. The bill mandates posting reports and IG comments on the FHFA website. The IG will also assess FHFA's loss mitigation policies, including the impact of principal reduction on financial condition and foreclosure rates. There is some overlap with current reporting requirements. The FHFA's monthly Foreclosure Prevention and Refinance Report covers loss mitigation efforts and the effect of reducing the conforming loan limit. H.R. 463, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Transparency Act of 2011, emphasizes oversight in these areas. Congress attaches particular importance to these oversight areas. The Mae and Freddie Mac Transparency Act of 2011 aims to subject the enterprises to FOIA requests by treating them as federal agencies. H.R. 1221, the Equity in Government Compensation Act of 2011, seeks to limit the pay of the enterprises' employees, with excess pay to be turned over to the Treasury. The enterprises would be paid based on the federal government's general schedule (GS), with a maximum pay of $155,500 in Washington, DC in 2011. Executive compensation would be tied to profitability, and covered by TARP provisions. The bill clarifies that enterprise employees are not federal employees. The House Financial Services Committee ordered the bill to be reported as amended on November 15, 2011. FHFA's authority to reject enterprise salaries would be removed by this legislation. H.R. 1222, GSE Subsidy Elimination Act of 2011, would remove FHFA's discretion in setting executive compensation for enterprises. The bill requires enterprises to charge guarantee fees reflecting mortgage risk and capital costs. FHFA can phase in higher fees over two years or impose them immediately. H.R. 1222, GSE Subsidy Elimination Act of 2011, was forwarded to the full committee after being marked up by the House Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government-Sponsored Enterprises. FHFA has the authority to implement the provisions as conservator or receiver. H.R. 1223, GSE Credit Risk Equitable Treatment Act of 2011, aims to prevent differential treatment of mortgage-backed securities issued by enterprises compared to other companies. The bill would require regulatory determinations for \"qualified residential mortgages\" (QRMs) to not be solely based on enterprises' role in securitization, as mandated by Dodd-Frank. QRMs are exempt from risk retention requirements under Dodd-Frank. Under Dodd-Frank, QRMs are exempt from risk retention requirements. The Federal Reserve's general counsel testified that the enterprises' guarantees for MBS do not satisfy the risk retention rules. The proposed rules would allow enterprises' guarantees to satisfy risk retention requirements while in conservatorship or receivership. H.R. 1224, GSE Portfolio Risk Reduction Act of 2011, mandates enterprises to reduce portfolios to $250 billion each over five years. Fannie Mae's portfolio was $789 billion and Freddie Mac's was $697 billion in 2010. Treasury-GSE agreements require mortgage portfolio reductions to reach $250 billion by 2022. The bills H.R. 1182 and S. 693 aim to reduce enterprises' portfolios over five years, while H.R. 408 and S. 178 propose a four-year reduction plan. H.R. 1224 excludes delinquent mortgages from portfolio limits. The House Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government-Sponsored Enterprises marked up H.R. 1224 in April 2011. Financial Services marked up H.R. 1224, allowing FHFA to order enterprises to reduce risk by shrinking portfolios faster. H.R. 1225 requires enterprises to seek Treasury approval before issuing new debt, with a seven-day waiting period post-approval. The Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government-Sponsored Enterprises forwarded H.R. 1225 to the full committee. The Secretary of the Treasury has authority over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which was previously used to regulate their debt issuance. There is debate over whether the Secretary could still assert this authority. H.R. 1226, GSE Mission Improvement Act, would repeal affordable housing goals and duties for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. FHFA would have six months to submit a report on the changes. The bill H.R. 1226 aims to repeal affordable housing goals for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. FHFA must report on the impact on multifamily properties, loans to low-income borrowers, and loans in rural areas within six months. H.R. 1227 would restrict FHFA from approving new products for the enterprises. The Limitation Act of 2011 would restrict FHFA from approving new products for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac while in conservatorship or receivership, unless necessary to preserve assets. H.R. 1227 aims to limit new product approvals by FHFA. H.R. 2425, the Transparency and Security in Mortgage Registration Act of 2011, aims to prohibit Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae from dealing with mortgages registered with MERS, a system bypassing state laws. MERS is facing legal challenges regarding its authority in foreclosures and ownership history maintenance. Contracts between enterprises and employees provide for payment of legal expenses. H.R. 2428 requires enterprises to propose a methodology for determining reasonable legal expenses. FHFA can repudiate contracts entered into before conservatorship. H.R. 2436 prevents reduction in dividend rates paid by enterprises to Treasury. H.R. 2439 focuses on removing GSEs charters. H.R. 2439, Removing GSEs Charters During Receivership Act of 2011, empowers FHFA to revoke an enterprise's charter, currently only Congress can do so. H.R. 2441, Housing Trust Fund Elimination Act of 2011, terminates funds established by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. In FY2010, $80 million was allocated for the Capital Magnet Fund despite enterprises' financial constraints. H.R. 2440, Market Transparency and Taxpayer Protection Act of 2011, would require FHFA to identify and sell non-mission critical assets like patents and mortgage data. H.R. 2462, Cap the GSE Bailout Act of 2011, aims to limit the amount of support Treasury can provide to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The Market Transparency and Taxpayer Protection Act of 2011 aims to set a maximum amount of support for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the Preferred Stock Purchase Agreements. Initially set at $100 billion each, the limit was raised to $200 billion. Amendments allowed for unlimited support in 2010-2012, with the $200 billion limit applying outside of those years. The director of FHFA may provide additional financial support if the private secondary mortgage market is not viable. The Market Transparency and Taxpayer Protection Act of 2011 set a $200 billion limit for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac outside of 2010-2012. Two pairs of companion bills were introduced in the 112th Congress with different provisions for the enterprises. H.R. 1859 and H.R. 2413 would replace the enterprises. Title VI of H.R. 408 and S. 178, known as the GSE Bailout Elimination and Taxpayer Protection Act, aims to terminate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's conservatorships within 24 months. After the conservatorship ends, the enterprises would either be dissolved or continue under revised charters with imposed changes. The revised charters for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would require them to reduce their portfolios to $250 billion each over four years, with no housing goals included. Certain provisions in broader bills are not included, such as the enterprises leaving conservatorship 24-30 months after enactment and either returning to stockholder control or being dissolved under receivership. The revised charters for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would require them to reduce their portfolios to $250 billion each over four years, with no housing goals included. FHFA would have strengthened authority to set and enforce minimum capital levels. The conforming loan limit would be set at $417,000 nationwide with no high-cost exceptions. The conforming loan limit is currently $417,000, except in high-cost areas where it can go up to $625,500. Enterprises are prohibited from purchasing mortgages above the area median home price. The minimum downpayment for mortgages purchased by the enterprises would be 5% in the first 12 months after leaving conservatorship, 7.5% in the second 12 months, and 10% thereafter. The enterprises would be required to pay all state and local taxes, register all stocks and public offerings with the SEC, and be charged for the benefits provided by the government. Companion bills H.R. 1182 and S. 693 contain similar provisions with two additional ones. H.R. 1182 and S. 693 include provisions such as guarantee fee increase, portfolio reduction to $250 billion each over five years, and repeal of affordable housing goals. They also propose ending the enterprises' conservatorship in 24 months. S. 178 aims to end the enterprises' conservatorship in 24 months, phase out their charters for new business after three years, repeal their exemption from SEC registration for MBS and debt, lower the conforming loan limit to $417,000, increase minimum capital requirements, raise borrower downpayment requirements, and mandate enterprises to pay all. H.R. 1182 and S. 693 would prohibit a reduction in the 10% annual cash dividend paid to Treasury under support contracts with the enterprises. H.R. 1859, Housing Finance Reform Act of 2011, would authorize FHFA to charter housing finance guaranty associations to pool and securitize mortgages, with a backup guarantee provided by the federal government. The proposed legislation would authorize housing finance guaranty associations to purchase and securitize existing mortgages, specializing in markets like community banks and multifamily mortgages. The maximum mortgage size would be based on national and area median prices, with nationwide limit at $256,000 and highest area limits in Honolulu and San Jose. The proposed legislation would authorize housing finance guaranty associations to purchase and securitize existing mortgages on one-to-four family dwelling units. The loan-to-value ratio must be 80% or less, unless certain conditions are met. FHFA would regulate the associations and could place them into conservatorship or receivership. The enterprises would not have affordable housing goals during the transition and would be required to pay state and local taxes. H.R. 2413 would establish a federal corporation to purchase and securitize mortgages meeting specific standards. The corporation would charge guarantee and reinsurance fees, adjusting them to maintain market share below 50%. Guarantee fees aim to cover mortgage payments in normal times, while reinsurance fees compensate Treasury for federal backup. The proposed federal corporation would charge guarantee and reinsurance fees based on mortgage quality, not location or volume. Mortgages eligible for purchase must be 30 years or less, up to 80% of the sales price (or 90% with seller participation or private mortgage insurance). Maximum mortgage size based on FY2011 formula with oversight by a reorganized FHFA."
