    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"United States-Canada Fair Grain Trade Act of 1993\". The United States-Canada Fair Grain Trade Act of 1993 addresses issues caused by unfair provisions in the US-Canada Free-Trade Agreement. Canadian grain exports, particularly durum wheat, spring wheat, and barley, have flooded the US market, leading to depressed prices, financial losses for American farmers, and challenges in implementing domestic support programs. Canadian grain exports are increasing without bounds, causing damage to US farmers. The US-Canada Free-Trade Agreement was approved by Congress with a condition to consult with Canada on the price setting policy of the Canadian Wheat Board affecting exports to the US. The US-Canada Free-Trade Agreement requires consultation with Canada on the price setting policy of the Canadian Wheat Board for agricultural goods exported to the US. The agreement also mandates immediate consultation with Canada to exclude agricultural goods shipped via east coast ports from transport rates under Canada's Western Grain Transportation Act. The US has failed to progress on consultations with Canada regarding the price setting policy of the Canadian Wheat Board for agricultural goods exported to the US. This failure led to a flawed binational panel decision that undermines the US-Canada Free-Trade Agreement. The US and Canada are in disagreement over the price setting policy of the Canadian Wheat Board for agricultural goods exported to the US. This disagreement has led to a flawed binational panel decision that undermines the US-Canada Free-Trade Agreement. SEC. 101. PRICE TRANSPARENCY. The President must negotiate with Canada to determine prices for Canadian Wheat Board goods sold to the US. If negotiations fail within 120 days, action will be taken. If Canada fails to establish pricing methods or data procedures within 120 days, imports of Canadian grain to the US will be suspended until successful negotiations are completed under subsection (a) of the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement. SEC. 102. RAIL TRANSPORTATION SUBSIDY. The President will pursue negotiations with Canada regarding the exclusion of agricultural goods from transport rates. If negotiations fail within 120 days, imports of Canadian grain benefiting from the rates will be suspended. The President will suspend grain receiving transport rate benefits until successful negotiations with Canada are completed to terminate such benefits. The President will suspend grain receiving transport rate benefits until successful negotiations with Canada are completed to terminate such benefits. SEC. 103. ACQUISITION PRICE OF GRAIN. The President will negotiate with Canada to define \"acquisition price\" in the US-Canada Free-Trade Agreement to include transportation subsidies, payments by the Canadian Wheat Board, and other subsidies. The US will negotiate with Canada to define \"acquisition price\" in the Free-Trade Agreement, with a deadline of 120 days for successful negotiations before suspending imports of Canadian grain. SEC. 104. Federal agencies must provide technical assistance to petitioners in countervailing duty cases regarding Canadian subsidies for wheat and barley exports to the US. SEC. 201. Export Enhancement Program can be used to promote grain exports. Section 301(b) of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 is amended to promote grain exports by allowing US producers to compete effectively with Canadian producers through the established program. The Government of Canada provides transportation subsidies to promote grain sales to Mexico, while the Canadian Wheat Board sells wheat in foreign markets below acquisition cost. These requirements will counteract the transportation subsidies until an agreement is reached. The US will counteract transportation subsidies from Canada until an agreement is reached to exclude agricultural goods from transport rates and ensure fair wheat sales by the Canadian Wheat Board. The US will counteract transportation subsidies from Canada until an agreement is reached to exclude agricultural goods from transport rates and ensure fair wheat sales by the Canadian Wheat Board, at a price no less than the full acquisition cost. SEC. 202 of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 is amended to include a new subtitle on Agricultural Export Program Protection, with defined terms under SEC. 1581. The new subtitle on Agricultural Export Program Protection under SEC. 202 of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 defines the term 'agricultural trade program' as various export promotion and international food aid programs administered by the Commodity Credit Corporation. The new subtitle on Agricultural Export Program Protection under SEC. 202 of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 excludes certain market promotion programs and defines 'covered foreign commodity' as wheat, feed grains, or soybeans. The term 'commodity' refers to wheat, feed grains, or soybeans imported into the US. 'Entry' means the entry or withdrawal from warehouse. 'Person' includes exporters, assignees, and participants in agricultural trade programs. 'Secretary' refers to the Secretary of Agriculture. 'United States agricultural commodity' has the same meaning. The term 'United States agricultural commodity' has the same meaning as defined in the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978. SEC. 1582. MONITORING OF DOMESTIC USES MADE OF CERTAIN FOREIGN COMMODITIES. SEC. 1582 requires an end-use certificate for covered foreign commodities and quarterly reports on their usage. The end-use certificate for covered foreign commodities must certify the percentage used by the consignee during the quarter and provide information if ownership is transferred. The end-use certificates and quarterly reports required under subsection (a) must contain necessary information, including the name and address of the importer of record of the covered foreign commodity. Ownership transfer details should also be included. The end-use certificates and quarterly reports must include details such as the consignee's name and address, country of origin, description and quantity of the commodity, purpose of use, and transporter information. The quarterly report must include the consignee's processing facility information, identification of end-use certificates, quantity of foreign commodity used, and details of use during the quarter. The quarterly report must include details such as the consignee's processing facility information, end-use certificates, quantity of foreign commodity used, exports, commingling with US commodities, and disposition of commingled commodities. The Secretary may require reporting of sales price for covered foreign commodities to facilitate enforcement of trade laws and agreements. The Secretary ensures confidentiality of purchasers of covered foreign commodities. The Commissioner of Customs requires an end-use certificate for entry of such commodities. Penalties apply for non-compliance with certificate requirements. The Secretary will enforce customs laws regarding entry of merchandise, with civil penalties up to $10,000 for violations. Regulations will be prescribed for carrying out this section, including requirements for quarterly reports. The compliance provisions under section 402 of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 apply to programs authorized in this subtitle. Additionally, there are provisions for suspension or debarment for the use of foreign agricultural commodities in certain agricultural trade programs. The Commodity Credit Corporation must offer a hearing before suspending or debarring a person from participating in an agricultural trade program for violating program terms. The Corporation can waive suspension or debarment if the person proves compliance. The Commodity Credit Corporation may waive suspension or debarment for using a foreign agricultural commodity unintentionally and in a small quantity, but other penalties may still apply. The section and its amendment will take effect 120 days after the Act's enactment, regarding the quantity of foreign agricultural commodities involved. The section and its amendment will take effect 120 days after the Act's enactment, regarding the quantity of foreign agricultural commodities involved. S 730 IS----2"
