The \"Tax Equity Act of 2009\" includes regional cost-of-living adjustments in individual income tax rates, with subsection (f) of section 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 amended to add new paragraphs for further adjustments based on regional cost-of-living. The Tax Equity Act of 2009 introduces regional cost-of-living adjustments to individual income tax rates. The rate table for each individual is adjusted based on the applicable multiplier for their statistical area. The Tax Equity Act of 2009 introduces regional cost-of-living adjustments to individual income tax rates. The rate table for each individual is adjusted based on the applicable multiplier for their statistical area. The primary place of abode during the taxable year determines the tax rate brackets, which are adjusted without changing the rates. The tax amount is also adjusted to reflect changes in the rate brackets, and any amount not a multiple of $50 is rounded to the nearest multiple of $50. The Secretary determines multipliers for statistical areas in the US annually, applying them to taxable years starting the following year. For areas with a cost-of-living differential over 125%, specific multipliers are calculated. For statistical areas with a cost-of-living differential over 125%, the applicable multiplier is 90% of the differential. For areas with differentials between 97% and 125%, the multiplier is 1.05. For all other areas, the multiplier is based on the cost-of-living differential. The cost-of-living differential for any statistical area in a calendar year is determined by dividing the area's cost-of-living by the average cost-of-living for the United States in the preceding year. The Secretary of Labor determines and publishes a cost-of-living index for each statistical area annually based on average market prices for the area. The market prices for the calendar year are determined using the same methodology as the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers. A statistical area includes metropolitan statistical areas defined by the Secretary of Commerce and portions of states not within those areas. The amendment applies to taxable years starting after December 31, 2009, with a transition rule for 2010. Areas outside the US have a multiplier of 1. The effective date for the amendment starting in 2010 is 1 year after the enactment of the Act."
