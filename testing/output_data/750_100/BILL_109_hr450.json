    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Science Education Incentive Act of 2005\". The Congress emphasizes the importance of maintaining the US's position in science and technology to advance human understanding and improve lives. Economic growth in the US is significantly influenced by advancements in science and technology. The growth of the United States today is directly linked to research and development in science and technology. Fundamental research explores the universe and seeks answers to new questions, while applied research applies these answers to everyday problems, making our lives more meaningful and livable. The United States' economic growth relies heavily on its intellectual capital and innovativeness, with education playing a critical role in developing this resource. The country needs scientists, engineers, and technologically proficient workers to drive research and development in a science-based, high-technology workplace. Student performance on international math and science assessments reveals shortcomings in US K-12 education compared to other countries. New teaching methods are needed to meet the demands of a science-based, high-technology workplace and to ensure scientifically literate voters and consumers. Improved teaching methods and curricula, along with teacher training and parental support, are essential for enhancing math and science education. Science is a process of inquiry based on observations and data, leading to a logical understanding of the universe through concepts and theories. Students should learn science by actively engaging in experiments and focusing on concepts. To enhance science education, teachers play a crucial role in connecting students with the content. It is important to identify and recruit high-quality, well-trained teachers who are respected by their peers and offer a rewarding career with opportunities for advancement. Teachers must have incentives to remain in the classroom, improve their practice, and be knowledgeable in their content area, curriculum, research in teaching, and techniques to connect with students. SEC. 3. Refundable credit for portion of tuition paid for undergraduate education of certain teachers. Amend Internal Revenue Code to include new section for tuition assistance for teachers.

An eligible teacher is defined as any individual for a taxable year. For a taxable year, any individual who is a full-time teacher in grades kindergarten through 12th grade, teaching math, science, engineering, or technology courses in grades 9 through 12 or kindergarten through 8 is eligible for a tax credit. For a taxable year, full-time teachers in grades K-12 teaching math, science, engineering, or technology courses are eligible for a tax credit if they have a relevant degree and are highly qualified. School administrative functions are also considered teaching courses. Administrative functions related to teaching courses in schools focusing on such courses are treated as teaching courses. Qualified undergraduate tuition refers to higher education expenses for enrollment at an institution of higher education. The term 'institution of higher education' is defined in the Higher Education Act of 1965. The Secretary will prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of this section.

The curr_chunk discusses the provision of education in STEM subjects for grades K-12, including teaching courses in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics. It also defines the 'defense dependents' education system' and STEM teacher externship expenses. The curr_chunk defines STEM teacher externship expenses as amounts paid for a program involving eligible STEM teachers in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics. The curr_chunk defines eligible STEM teachers as individuals teaching in grades K-12 at educational organizations in the US or on US military bases, who receive training to enhance their teaching skills in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics. The term 'STEM teacher training expenses' refers to costs incurred by a taxpayer in the fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics for training programs for eligible STEM teachers. Eligible teachers are those teaching in grades K-12 in the US or on US military bases.
