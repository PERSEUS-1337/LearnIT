    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The Legislature in California acknowledges public concern about the costs of aging, with two-thirds of respondents worried about affording long-term care. Sixty-three percent are concerned about paying for long-term care as much as for future health care. A majority of respondents in California cannot afford more than three months of nursing home care at an average cost of $6,000 per month. About 40% cannot afford a single month of care. Concerns about paying for long-term care are prevalent across all income levels and partisan affiliations, with 88% of Latino voters lacking long-term care insurance. The Legislature aims to establish a task force to explore creating a culturally competent statewide insurance program for long-term care services. The Long Term Care Insurance Task Force will be created in the Department of Insurance to design and implement this program. The Long Term Care Insurance Task Force will consist of nine members, including the commissioner, Director of Health Care Services, Director of the Department of Aging, and appointees with expertise in long-term care insurance, health policy, long-term care providers, and senior/consumer organizations. Additionally, a representative from an employee organization for long-term care workers will be appointed by the Speaker of the Assembly. The Long Term Care Insurance Task Force includes nine members appointed by various entities, with one member from the long-term care insurance industry chosen by the Senate Committee on Rules. Task force members do not receive compensation, and meetings are subject to the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act. The task force is responsible for specific duties. The Long Term Care Insurance Task Force is tasked with exploring the design and implementation of a statewide long-term care insurance program to provide options for individuals seeking coverage for costs related to functional or cognitive disability. This includes examining eligibility, benefits, financing, and coordination with Medi-Cal and other public resources. The Long Term Care Insurance Task Force is exploring the inclusion of a long-term care insurance program in the state disability insurance structure, potentially funded through a payroll tax increase. It may allow working adults to enroll voluntarily with premium contributions, and consider mandatory enrollment with an opt-out option. The Long Term Care Insurance Task Force is considering a program that would provide a basic insurance benefit to working adults with cognitive limitations. It aims to help individuals stay in their communities by purchasing nonmedical services and offsetting costs for those with chronic conditions. The Long Term Care Insurance Task Force is evaluating the coordination of benefits with existing private health care coverage, workforce demands, establishment of a joint public and private system for long-term care accessibility, and regulatory provisions for public access to insurance programs. The Long Term Care Insurance Task Force will recommend options for a statewide long-term care insurance program in a report to be submitted by July 1, 2017. The department and participating agencies must operate within their existing budgets for this purpose. The department will produce an actuarial report of task force recommendations by July 1, 2018, to ensure a solvent program. The report must be approved by the task force members and submitted to the Legislature. The commissioner may seek private funds for implementation. This section will be in effect until January 1, 2019, unless extended by a later statute."
