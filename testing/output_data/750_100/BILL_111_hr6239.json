    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Prevention of Frivolous Ethanol Lawsuits Act of 2010\". It includes findings related to ethanol lawsuits. The Congress finds that ethanol is widely used in gasoline for vehicles and engines, and any decision to increase ethanol blending must ensure it does not harm emission control systems. The Congress is concerned about the effects of increasing ethanol blending in gasoline on vehicle engines and interstate commerce. The Federal Trade Commission has proposed labeling requirements for fuels exceeding certain limits. The Congress is concerned about the effects of increasing ethanol blending in gasoline on vehicle engines. A Federal testing regimen is underway to determine the impact on newer vehicles, but data is lacking for older vehicles and nonroad engines. The executive branch has proposed labeling requirements for fuels exceeding the current ethanol blending limit. The executive branch has statutory authority to increase the ethanol blending limit in gasoline and is currently in the decision-making process. Congress aims to mitigate negative effects on interstate commerce from this potential increase. Targeted liability protections are proposed for claims related to damages caused by or worsened by the use of ethanol in certain fuel. Liability protections are proposed for covered entities using renewable fuel with ethanol concentrations over 10% in internal combustion engines, granting immunity from federal and state lawsuits for resulting losses. The term \"loss\" includes death, injury, illness, disability, fear of injury or illness, and property damage without regard to the timing of the occurrence. The immunity under paragraph (1) applies to any claim for loss related to the use of renewable fuel with ethanol concentrations over 10%, for operating internal combustion engines. The exception to immunity for covered persons is for a federal cause of action for death or serious injury caused by willful misconduct. An action under 28, United States Code can be brought for wrongful death or serious physical injury by any person who suffers such injury. The action must be filed and maintained in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The action under 28, United States Code can be brought for wrongful death or serious physical injury in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The substantive law for decision in such cases shall be derived from the State where the alleged misconduct occurred, unless inconsistent with Federal law. Complaints in these actions must plead each element of the plaintiff's claim with particularity. The complaint in actions for wrongful death or serious physical injury must include details of alleged willful misconduct, causation, and the injury suffered, along with a verification by affidavit of the plaintiff. The plaintiff must swear an oath that the pleading is true to their knowledge, except for matters alleged on information and belief. Any matter not specifically identified as such is considered to be made upon the plaintiff's knowledge for all purposes. The plaintiff in an action under subsection (b) must prove willful misconduct by each covered person sued with clear and convincing evidence. Any action under subsection (b) will be assigned to a three-judge panel initially, which will have jurisdiction over motions to dismiss and summary judgment. In actions under subsection (b), a three-judge panel initially handles motions and may refer the case to the chief judge for further proceedings if necessary. Civil discovery is not allowed before each defendant has a chance to file a motion to dismiss. In actions under subsection (b), a three-judge panel initially handles motions and may refer the case to the chief judge for further proceedings if necessary. Discovery is limited to matters directly related to contested issues in the action, and responses to discovery requests must be compelled by the court. In actions under subsection (b), a three-judge panel initially handles motions and may refer the case to the chief judge for further proceedings if necessary. Discovery is limited to contested issues, and responses must be compelled by the court. Requests under rule 37 must be justified by the need to prove or defend a material issue, with benefits outweighing the burden for the responding party. In actions under subsection (b), the amount of damages awarded to a plaintiff is reduced by collateral source benefits. Noneconomic damages are awarded proportionally to a defendant's responsibility for harm, covering physical and emotional pain, suffering, and other losses. In actions under subsection (b), damages awarded to a plaintiff are reduced by collateral source benefits. Nonpecuniary losses such as disfigurement, loss of enjoyment of life, and injury to reputation are covered.

The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has jurisdiction over interlocutory appeals within 30 days of an order denying immunity from suit. The subsection (h) excludes manufacturer or distributor liability for willful misconduct if regulated by the Clean Air Act. The subsection (h) excludes manufacturer or distributor liability for willful misconduct regulated by the Clean Air Act. Any enforcement action initiated by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency or the Attorney General must be resolved without a covered remedy before any action under subsection (b) can proceed. The section does not limit any rights or remedies of the United States under other laws or waive sovereign immunity. Definitions include \"covered entity\" as an entity involved in fuel manufacturing, sale, or distribution. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of \"enforcement action\" in relation to entities involved in the manufacture, sale, or distribution of renewable fuel products as defined by the Clean Air Act. It includes various legal actions such as criminal prosecution, injunctions, civil monetary proceedings, and product recalls. The curr_chunk defines a \"covered remedy\" as a legal outcome resulting from a final determination by a court or agency action, including criminal convictions, injunctions, civil monetary payments, and debarment. The terms \"final\" and \"finally\" refer to judgments in court determinations or enforcement actions. The curr_chunk defines \"final determination\" as a judgment that cannot be appealed or a voluntary dismissal, and with respect to agency actions, it is an order not subject to further review within the agency. The term \"willful misconduct\" under subsection (b) excludes acts done in compliance with regulations regarding ethanol-gasoline blends over 10% ethanol, but includes intentional acts to achieve wrongful purposes. The term \"willful misconduct\" excludes acts done in compliance with regulations but includes intentional acts done without legal justification and in disregard of known risks."
