    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Water Advanced Technologies for Efficient Resource Use Act of 2015\". It includes a section on WaterSense. The WaterSense program established within the Environmental Protection Agency promotes water efficient products, buildings, and landscapes to reduce water use, strain on infrastructure, conserve energy, and preserve water resources for future generations through voluntary labeling and communication. The Environmental Protection Agency promotes WaterSense labeled products for water efficiency and performance standards, public awareness, and establishing performance standards. The WaterSense program aims to maintain performance standards for labeled products, promote proper installation by certified professionals, and preserve the integrity of the WaterSense label. The WaterSense program aims to maintain performance standards for labeled products, regularly review and update criteria, collect and share data on market shares, and estimate water and energy savings for public access. The WaterSense program aims to maintain performance standards for labeled products, regularly review and update criteria, collect and share data on market shares, estimate water and energy savings, and solicit feedback from the public before making any changes to categories or specifications. The WaterSense program aims to maintain performance standards for labeled products, regularly review and update criteria, and provide appropriate lead time for new or revised categories, specifications, or installation criteria. The WaterSense program aims to maintain performance standards for labeled products and implement voluntary approaches to improve water efficiency in various sectors. Authorization of appropriations is also provided. Authorization of appropriations for the WaterSense program includes $7.5 million for 2016, $10 million for 2017, $20 million for 2018, and $50 million for 2019 and beyond, adjusted for inflation. Federal procurement of water efficient products is addressed in Section 3. In this section, definitions are provided for terms such as \"agency,\" \"WaterSense product or service,\" \"WaterSense program,\" and \"FEMP designated product.\" These terms relate to water efficiency and federal procurement of water efficient products. The Energy Management Program of the Department of Energy is recognized for its high efficiency. The terms \"product\" and \"service\" exclude water-consuming products for combat missions and those already covered by Federal procurement regulations. Agencies are required to procure water-efficient products. To meet agency requirements for water-consuming products or services, the head of the agency must procure WaterSense or FEMP designated products. WaterSense plumbing products should be installed by certified plumbers, and irrigation systems by certified professionals. The head of an agency is not required to procure WaterSense or FEMP designated products if they find it not cost-effective over the product's life or if no suitable products are available. The head of an agency must include criteria for rating WaterSense products and FEMP in procurement specifications for water consuming products and systems. The head of an agency must consider additional measures for reducing water consumption, including reuse, reclamation, and recycling technologies, leak detection, and use of waterless products. WaterSense and FEMP designated products should be clearly identified in federal catalogs. The General Services Administration and the Defense Logistics Agency must supply WaterSense or FEMP designated products for all product categories, unless specified otherwise in writing due to functional or cost considerations. The Environmental Protection Agency will issue regulations within 180 days to implement the requirements for product life, energy, water, and cost savings. SEC. 4. EARLY ADOPTER WATER EFFICIENT PRODUCTS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. The section defines key terms like \"Administrator,\" \"eligible entity,\" and \"incentive program\" for a program that provides financial incentives for residential water efficiency products. Consumer purchase and installation of residential water efficient products and services for single-family or multifamily residences or landscapes must be rated for water efficiency and performance by the WaterSense program or an approved incentive program. Categories of water efficient products and services, such as faucets, irrigation technologies, point-of-use water treatment devices, reuse technologies, toilets, and showerheads, must be tested by a third-party certifying body according to the WaterSense program before being considered residential water efficient products. The term \"State\" refers to various regions within the United States, including Puerto Rico, Guam, and American Samoa. The \"WaterSense program\" certifies water efficient products and authorizes them to use its label. The \"WaterSense program\" established by this Act provides incentives for residential water efficient products or services through rebates, vouchers, or direct installs. Entities eligible for allocation must have an incentive program and submit an application as required by the Administrator. The Administrator will allocate funds to eligible entities with incentive programs, ensuring the funds supplement existing funds and target specific populations. The allocation amount is based on the population served and the targeted population of the program. The allocated funds can be used to cover up to 50% of the costs for implementing incentive programs targeting specific populations. Entities are encouraged to promote fixture recycling. Entities are encouraged to promote fixture recycling programs for older fixtures replaced under the incentive program. Financial incentives may be issued to consumers who meet program requirements, with the entity having the option to delegate administration to other organizations. The incentive amount is determined by the entity, considering various factors. Entities are encouraged to promote fixture recycling programs for older fixtures replaced under the incentive program. Financial incentives may be issued to consumers who meet program requirements, with the entity having the option to delegate administration to other organizations. The entity considers factors such as allocation amount, available tax incentives, consumer behavior change, and consumer expenditures for product installation. $50,000,000 is authorized for the Administrator to carry out this section. The Administrator is authorized to receive $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2016, $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2017, $150,000,000 for fiscal year 2018, $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2019, and $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2020 to carry out this section. SEC. 139F. EARLY ADOPTER WATER EFFICIENT PRODUCTS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. The Water Advanced Technologies for Efficient Resource Use Act of 2015 excludes amounts received under an incentive program from an individual's gross income. No deduction or credit is allowed for any expenditure to the extent of the amount excluded under the Act. The adjusted basis of property is reduced by the excluded amount provided with respect to the property. Conforming Amendment: The table of sections for part III of subchapter B of chapter 1 of the Code is amended by inserting a new item before section 140. The amendments made by this Act, including the Early adopter water efficient products incentive programs under Sec. 139F, will apply to taxable years starting after the enactment date."
