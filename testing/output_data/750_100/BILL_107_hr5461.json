Congress finds that responders to the 9/11 terrorist attacks required support from various jurisdictions, including local elected officials, neighboring areas, and regional, state, federal, and private sector entities for effective emergency response coordination. Regional planning and coordination by regional councils of governments, planning commissions, and development districts are crucial for effective emergency response, ensuring minimal loss of life and property damage. They have the accountability and experience to coordinate comprehensive regional plans involving Federal, State, and local governments, the private sector, and other stakeholders in community security. The purpose of this Act is to encourage regional councils of government to develop coordinated emergency preparedness and recovery plans involving Federal, State, and local governments, as well as the private sector. Coordinated training, equipment acquisition, and recovery planning are essential for effective regional preparedness and mitigation efforts.

The text chunk discusses the requirement to coordinate the development of regional emergency preparedness, coordination, and recovery plans. The regional councils defined in section 3(2) must convene all stakeholders within a region to coordinate emergency preparedness plans. The regional plan should include assessments of potential targets for destruction and available resources for disaster response. The regional councils must convene stakeholders to coordinate emergency preparedness plans, including assessments of potential targets and resources for disaster response, establishment of a regional communication system, secure information repository, and information on response resources. The curr_chunk provides information on the locations and contacts for various emergency services, medical facilities, first responders, essential service stakeholders, and key military personnel and facilities within the region. The curr_chunk outlines the locations of existing shelters, schools, churches, water and food supplies, water treatment facilities, utilities lines, and other infrastructure for emergency preparedness. Locations of utilities lines, pipelines, generating facilities, sewer mains, treatment plants, communication facilities, radio and television studios, transmission sites, shortwave radio facilities, volunteers, major bridges, and dams are outlined for emergency preparedness. Locations of major bridges, dams, educational facilities, transportation facilities, including ports and airports, local and regional transportation routes, and at-risk populations with large population concentrations are outlined for emergency preparedness. Locations of major concentrations of hazardous and biohazard chemicals, along with schedules of public events, venue capacities, population statistics, school enrollment numbers, and locations of elderly, infirm, and disabled persons needing special assistance are important for emergency preparedness. Locations of hazardous and biohazard chemicals, fuel depots, munitions, explosives, and potential targets like nuclear power plants in the region. Debris disposal locations and potential health risks are also identified. Planning activities include analyzing and documenting disaster possibilities, assessing hazards using Geographic Information Systems, and evaluating potential consequences. The regional plan must be approved by the designated agency's governing body and the Governor. The regional plan must be reviewed annually and updated as needed based on threat assessments, trainings, and drills. Information in the plan is only accessible to officials and agencies responsible under the plan for security purposes. Computer and software technology are required to secure key resources and critical infrastructure outlined in the regional plan. Measures must be taken to protect these assets in coordination with various agencies and representatives from Federal, State, and local governments, the private sector, and other entities. Continuous review, analysis, and recommendations for policy and procedure improvements are necessary. Recommendations for improving policies and procedures regarding information security sharing with law enforcement, intelligence, and other homeland security entities at the federal, state, and local levels, as well as with the private sector, are essential for safeguarding critical infrastructure outlined in the regional plan. SEC. 5. FUNDING. From the amounts appropriated for emergency preparedness and homeland security, not less than three percent shall be allocated to the Department of Homeland Security for the preparation, review, and update of regional plans. Allocations to regions will be based on population, necessary base amounts, vulnerability to catastrophic events, and the presence of significant facilities. Funding for emergency preparedness projects must align with regional plans to ensure consistency with federal agencies."
