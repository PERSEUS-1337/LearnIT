It includes definitions for pediatric involvement in reading and education. The \"Prescribe A Book Act\" defines an eligible entity as a nonprofit organization with demonstrated effectiveness in providing peer-to-peer training on literacy promotion to healthcare providers. This training curriculum is delivered in various medical education settings. The \"Prescribe A Book Act\" aims to support national pediatric conferences and provide technical assistance for implementing a Pediatric Early Literacy Program. It also offers discounted books to healthcare facilities and integrates research into training for healthcare providers. The \"Pediatric Early Literacy Program\" involves healthcare providers promoting reading aloud to young children and offering parents strategies for literacy promotion. The Pediatric Early Literacy Program encourages reading aloud to children, provides books to children aged 6 months to 5 years, and has volunteers read to children in healthcare facilities. The Pediatric Early Literacy Program promotes reading to children, distributes books to young children, and has volunteers read to kids in healthcare settings. It requires research showing positive effects on parent behavior in reading to children and language development in young kids, as well as endorsements from national medical associations. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to eligible entities for Pediatric Early Literacy Programs. Eligible entities must submit an application to the Secretary, including required information. Matching requirement is also specified. The eligible entity receiving a grant must provide non-Federal matching funds equal to at least 50% of the grant received. Matching funds can be in cash or in-kind. Grant funds must be used as specified. The eligible entity receiving a grant under section 5622 must enter into contracts with private nonprofit organizations or public agencies to establish and operate a Pediatric Early Literacy Program. Training and technical assistance must be provided to each contractor, and additional terms and conditions may be included in the agreement as determined by the Secretary. The Secretary will enter into agreements with contractors to ensure program effectiveness. Contractors must prioritize serving at-risk children, including those from low-income families, without medical insurance, and enrolled in Medicaid. Children eligible for the program include those enrolled in State Medicaid or Children's Health Insurance Program, living in rural areas, migrant children, and those with limited library access. The Secretary must ensure that eligible entities have arrangements with book publishers or distributors to obtain books at favorable discounts before making any payments. Additionally, there is a reporting requirement in place. \"An eligible entity receiving a grant under section 5622 must report annually to the Secretary on program effectiveness and include descriptions of each program. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act is amended to include a new subpart for pediatric early literacy programs.\" Subpart 22 includes definitions, program authorization, applications, matching requirement, use of grant funds, restriction on payments, and reporting requirement for pediatric early literacy programs."
