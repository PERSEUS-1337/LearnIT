    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Promoting Unlicensed Spectrum Act of 2015\" and includes definitions for key terms. The Act, known as the \"Promoting Unlicensed Spectrum Act of 2015,\" defines key terms such as \"appropriate committees of Congress,\" \"Assistant Secretary,\" \"Commission,\" and \"Federal entity.\" The \"Spectrum Relocation Fund\" refers to the fund established under section 118 of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act. \"Unlicensed operations\" involve using spectrum on a nonexclusive basis without protection from interference under specific regulations. Licensing by rule under part 96 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations. The Federal Communications Commission allocates and allots spectrum. The Commission will balance spectrum allocation for exclusive licensing through auctions and unlicensed operations, with rules to be implemented within 18 months of the Act's enactment. Consideration will be given to permitting unlicensed operations. The Commission will implement rules allowing unlicensed operations in auctioned spectrum until licensees initiate commercial service. These rules will be included in service rules and reports submitted to Congress. The Commission will implement rules for unlicensed operations in auctioned spectrum until licensees start commercial service, included in service rules and reports to Congress. Additionally, a national strategy for unlicensed spectrum will be developed. The United States aims to maximize spectrum resources, promote innovation in wireless broadband, and ensure a balanced spectrum policy. The Commission will develop a national strategy for additional unlicensed radio frequency bands within a year of this Act's enactment. The national strategy will identify radio frequency bands for unlicensed operations, ensure access to low-, mid-, and high-band spectrum, and consider rules for spectrum sharing. The national strategy aims to expand opportunities for unlicensed operations in various spectrum bands through spectrum sharing models, including underlay unlicensed operations in allocated spectrum without causing interference to licensees. The Commission will examine ways to improve spectrum utilization, databases, and access systems for unlicensed operations, and harmonize additional bands for greater economies of scale. A report is required within one year of the Act's enactment. The Commission will submit a report to Congress describing the strategy developed under the Act, along with any recommendations for legislative change. The report will also be made publicly available on the Commission's website. SEC. 5. MAKING FEDERAL SPECTRUM AVAILABLE FOR UNLICENSED OPERATION. The Assistant Secretary, along with the Commission and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, must submit a report to Congress within 270 days of the Act's enactment on designating additional radio frequency bands for unlicensed operations by Federal entities without causing interference. The report will also address recommendations for reforming the Spectrum Relocation Fund to cover costs incurred by Federal entities. The Relocation Fund addresses costs for Federal entities sharing radio frequency bands with unlicensed radio technologies. Recommendations are made to ensure the Fund's solvency if used for these costs. The possibility of permitting unlicensed operations in spectrum bands used by Federal entities without harmful interference is also considered. The Federal Relocation Fund addresses costs for Federal entities sharing radio frequency bands with unlicensed technologies. Considerations include ensuring the Fund's solvency for these costs and exploring spectrum sharing techniques for unlicensed operations in Federal spectrum."
