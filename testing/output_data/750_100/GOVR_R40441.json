Environmentalists claim the sonar harms whales, causing beach strandings. The Navy issued an environmental assessment concluding minimal harm to marine mammals. Petitioners, mostly environmental groups, sought relief against the exercises for violating environmental laws. The Navy scheduled training exercises using sonar off the coast of southern California. Environmentalists claimed the sonar harmed whales, leading to beach strandings. Petitioners sought relief against the exercises for violating environmental laws. The district court initially granted an injunction, later modified to allow sonar use with mitigation measures. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the modified injunction, citing a possibility of irreparable injury and favoring the plaintiffs. The Supreme Court upheld this decision. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Navy's sonar training exercises off the coast of southern California, stating that the Navy's interest in effective training outweighed the plaintiffs' showing of irreparable injury. The Court criticized the Ninth Circuit's lenient \"possibility\" test for injunctions, requiring plaintiffs to demonstrate a \"likely\" irreparable injury. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Navy's sonar training exercises off the coast of southern California, citing the Navy's need for realistic training as a key factor. The Court reversed the decision and vacated the preliminary injunction, noting that potential harm to marine mammals did not outweigh the Navy's training requirements. The Court did not address the merits of the lawsuit regarding violations of environmental laws. The Supreme Court accepted a case challenging a preliminary injunction on Navy's sonar training exercises, citing national security interests. The Court emphasized the need for realistic training and overturned the injunction, highlighting the Navy's training requirements over potential harm to marine mammals. The United States successfully argued against the Ninth Circuit's criteria for injunctions. The Ninth Circuit, known for its environmental friendliness, had its decision reversed by the Supreme Court. The case involved Forest Service regulations under the ARA that limited public input for projects covered by categorical exclusions. In 2003, the Forest Service approved a timber sale of 238 acres of post-fire forest, which was not subject to appeal due to regulations. The district court invalidated the regulations, leading to a nationwide injunction. The Ninth Circuit later ruled that plaintiffs had standing in Earth Island Institute v. Ruthenbeck. The Ninth Circuit in Earth Island Institute v. Ruthenbeck, 490 F.3d 687 (9th Cir. 2007), found plaintiffs had standing due to injury in fact and ruled that certain regulations conflicted with the ARA, affirming the district court's decision and upholding a nationwide injunction against the regulations' enforcement. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the district court's injunction against the Forest Service regulations. Key questions include the reviewability of the regulations, standing of environmental groups, and the ripeness of the challenges after the timber sale was withdrawn. The Supreme Court is reviewing a case involving an injunction against Forest Service regulations. Key questions include the reviewability of the regulations, standing of environmental groups, and the ripeness of challenges after a timber sale was withdrawn. Environmental groups are using site-specific challenges for program-wide reform, with potential large stakes in the decision. A defeat for such groups could increase the burden on public. The Supreme Court case involves a potential restriction on nationwide remedies for public interest groups challenging government programs. Industrial operations withdraw large amounts of water from waterways, trapping aquatic organisms, leading to the current litigation. The Clean Water Act (CWA) section 316(b) addresses the issue of cooling water intake structures harming aquatic organisms. In 2004, the EPA issued a rule for large power plants, allowing cost-benefit analysis to determine the best technology available for minimizing environmental impact. The Second Circuit invalidated the use of cost-benefit analysis under section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act. EPA can consider cost in determining industry's capability and for cost effectiveness analysis. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to determine if CWA section 316(b) allows EPA to compare costs with benefits in selecting the \"best technology available\" for cooling water intake structures, despite historical resistance to cost-benefit analysis in environmental laws. The Supreme Court is testing whether conservative justices will continue to shift towards accepting cost-benefit analysis in environmental laws, particularly in the context of the Clean Water Act. Industry hopes for a decision that could legitimize cost-benefit analysis in areas where it is not explicitly authorized. The Supreme Court is considering the use of cost-benefit analysis in environmental laws, specifically in the Clean Water Act. The case involves Coeur Alaska's proposal to revive a gold mine in Alaska's Tongass National Forest and the disposal of wastewater. Justice Breyer's past criticism of government regulation for not considering costs enough is highlighted in this case. The company plans to dispose of wastewater from a gold mine in Alaska's Tongass National Forest by piping it to a nearby lake, which would kill aquatic life. The Corps of Engineers issued a permit under the Clean Water Act, allowing the discharge to raise the lake bottom by 50 feet. In U.S. Army Corps of Engineers v. Coeur Alaska, the Ninth Circuit addressed conflicting CWA regulations regarding Coeur's proposed discharge from a gold mine. The Corps issued a permit allowing the discharge to change the bottom elevation of a lake, while the EPA's new standard prohibits discharges from Coeur's type of ore processing into waters of the United States. The Ninth Circuit addressed conflicting CWA regulations regarding Coeur's proposed discharge from a gold mine. The court concluded that the CWA's plain language requires the Section 306 performance standard to apply through an NPDES permit, even if the discharge meets the definition of \"fill material.\" EPA and the Corps did not intend waste products subject to performance standards to be regulated as fill material. The Ninth Circuit ruled that waste products subject to performance standards should not be regulated as fill material, leading to the question of permitting authority under CWA sections 404 and 402. The Supreme Court granted certiorari unexpectedly, with potential consequences of a reversal. The Supreme Court granted certiorari unexpectedly, with potential consequences of a reversal if the Corps redefines \"fill material\" to remove discharges from EPA's NPDES program. EPA and California sued to recover cleanup costs under CERCLA for a contaminated site. The EPA and the state sued various parties for costs related to a contaminated site, including a defunct facility operator, railroads, and Shell Oil Co. The district court found the railroads liable as owners of the site and Shell liable as an \"arranger.\" In United States v. Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Co., the Ninth Circuit addressed the liability of railroads and Shell for cleanup costs. The court held that the harm is capable of apportionment, with railroads liable for 9% and Shell liable for 6% of total cleanup costs. The court ruled that neither the railroads nor Shell provided a reasonable basis for apportionment of cleanup costs. Shell was found liable as an \"arranger\" under broader liability, not just direct arranger liability. The Supreme Court granted certiorari in a CERCLA case involving Shell's liability as an \"arranger\" for a transaction that led to disposal. The question presented was whether the Ninth Circuit erred in reversing the district court's apportionment of responsibility under CERCLA. The Supreme Court granted certiorari in a CERCLA case involving Shell's liability for arranging disposal of hazardous substances. The questions presented include whether liability can be imposed on a manufacturer who sells a product that later causes contamination, and whether joint and several liability can be imposed on multiple parties even with a reasonable basis for divisibility. The Supreme Court granted certiorari in a CERCLA case involving Shell's liability for arranging disposal of hazardous substances. This case raises fundamental Superfund Act issues that the Court has repeatedly denied certiorari on in the past. The heart of the Superfund statute is its expansive liability scheme, designed by Congress to maximize the likelihood that solvent responsible parties would be found at a site to reimburse the government for its cleanup costs. One element of that liability is that parties made liable under the act are jointly and severally liable. The Supreme Court is considering a CERCLA case involving liability for arranging disposal of hazardous substances. Parties under the act are jointly and severally liable unless there is a reasonable basis for apportioning liability. The Court's decision on what constitutes a reasonable basis could impact the government's ability to recover cleanup costs. If a lax standard is adopted, the federal treasury may have to cover cleanup costs more often. A tighter standard for \"arranger\" could also affect liability. The Supreme Court is considering a CERCLA case involving liability for arranging disposal of hazardous substances. A tighter standard for \"arranger\" liability could result in fewer parties being liable, potentially leading to the government having to cover cleanup costs. Industry is concerned about the liability of manufacturers in selling products that may not be considered arranging for disposal. All cases accepted by the Supreme Court are important for their individual programs and standing in administrative law. The Supreme Court is considering five environmental cases that are important for their individual programs and administrative law implications. Industry is optimistic about the outcomes, while the environmental community is apprehensive due to the environmental side winning in the lower courts. This suggests potential decisions favoring industry in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court is reviewing five environmental cases, with industry optimistic about the outcomes. The environmental community is concerned as the lower courts have favored environmental interests. The Supreme Court has historically been less tolerant of regulation and more sympathetic to business concerns. The Supreme Court is reviewing a large number of environmental cases this term, leading to speculation about the reasons behind it. Some believe it could be due to the random certiorari-granting process, while others think conservative justices may want to address environmental issues before potential changes in the Court's composition. Additionally, there is a suggestion that top Supreme Court practitioners are showing more interest in environmental cases. The Supreme Court is reviewing a significant number of environmental cases this term, with top practitioners showing increased interest. The Court continues to reject difficult cases, including those related to the Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act. The Supreme Court has rejected petitions related to the Clean Water Act in Rapanos v. United States multiple times. The Court's nonacceptance of cases is likely due to the lack of a clear majority rationale in the 2006 decision, causing confusion in lower courts. The Supreme Court's nonacceptance of cases related to the Clean Water Act in Rapanos v. United States is likely due to the lack of a clear majority rationale in the 2006 decision, causing confusion in lower courts. If the Court were to accept a post-Rapanos case now, the same result is expected in terms of law extraction from the decision."
