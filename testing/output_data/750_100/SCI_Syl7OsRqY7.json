    "content": "End-to-end neural models have advanced question answering, but recent studies suggest they assume answers and evidence are in close proximity in a single document. To address this limitation, the Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) combines information from multiple documents. The CFC includes a coarse-grain module for interpreting documents in relation to the query and finding relevant answers, and a fine-grain module that scores candidate answers by comparing their occurrences across all documents with the query. These modules use hierarchies of coattention and self-attention to learn. The Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) achieves a new state-of-the-art result of 70.6% on the Qangaroo WikiHop multi-evidence question answering task. It outperforms previous models by 3% accuracy without using pretrained contextual encoders. The CFC emphasizes different parts of the input and can reason over multiple documents to answer questions effectively. In this work, the focus is on multi-evidence question answering, where aggregating evidence from multiple documents is necessary. The Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) is a model that selects answers from candidate answers based on support documents and a query, inspired by coarse-grain and fine-grain reasoning. The Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) selects answers from candidate answers based on support documents and a query. The model employs coarse-grain reasoning to build a summary of support documents and fine-grain reasoning to match specific contexts with the query. The CFC utilizes hierarchical attention to combine information from support documents. The Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) achieves state-of-the-art results on the blind Qangaroo WikiHop test set and improves accuracy on the TriviaQA task. The model combines information from support documents using hierarchical attention. The Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) achieves state-of-the-art results on the blind Qangaroo WikiHop test set and improves accuracy on the TriviaQA task. Components in the attention hierarchies of the CFC learn to focus on distinct parts of the input, enabling effective representation of long documents. Common errors produced by CFC include difficulty in aggregating references, noise in distant supervision, and challenging relation types. The coarse-grain and fine-grain modules correspond to different reasoning strategies, with the coarse-grain module summarizing support documents without knowing the candidates. The Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) achieves top results on Qangaroo WikiHop and TriviaQA tasks by using coattention to build codependent representations of support documents and queries. The model divides labor between coarse-grain and fine-grain modules, allowing attention hierarchies to focus on different parts of the input for better representation of long documents. The text discusses encoding sequences using bidirectional GRUs for query, support documents, and candidate answers in a Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) model. It focuses on word embeddings and parameters for encoding each sequence. The Coarse-grain module of the CFC model uses coattention to build codependent representations of support documents and the query, then summarizes the context using self-attention to compare it to the candidate. Affinity matrix is computed between the document and query to define support and query summary vectors. The support and query summary vectors are defined using softmax normalization. The document context is obtained by concatenating the document context and summary vector. Coattention is abbreviated for document and query encoding to produce the coattention context. The coattention context is summarized using hierarchical self-attention. The coattention context is summarized using hierarchical self-attention, creating a fixed-length summary vector. Scores are computed for each position using a multi-layer perceptron, normalized, and used to compute a weighted sum over the context. The coattention context is summarized using hierarchical self-attention to create a fixed-length summary vector of support documents. This summary is then multiplied with the candidate answer summary to produce a coarse-grain score. The fine-grain module uses coreference resolution to find specific context in support documents for a candidate. Each mention is summarized with self-attention to create a mention representation, followed by computing coattention with the query. This coattention context is summarized again via self-attention to produce a fine-grain summary. The fine-grain module uses coreference resolution to find specific context in support documents for a candidate. Each mention is summarized with self-attention to create a mention representation, followed by computing coattention with the query. This process helps in producing a fine-grain summary for scoring the candidate based on multiple pieces of evidence. The model extracts mention representations using self-attention and computes coattention with the query to score the candidate. The final score is a combination of coarse-grain and fine-grain scores. The model is trained using cross-entropy loss and evaluated on two tasks to assess its effectiveness. The CFC model, trained using cross-entropy loss, achieves state-of-the-art results on multi-evidence question answering tasks. It outperforms existing models on the WikiHop dataset and significantly improves performance on the TriviaQA task by reranking span-extraction model outputs. The Qangaroo WikiHop task was introduced to facilitate research in multi-evidence question answering. The Qangaroo WikiHop task aims to facilitate multi-evidence question answering by linking entities in a document corpus with a knowledge base, creating a bipartite graph. This graph helps identify support documents for fact triplets, improving performance on question answering tasks. The Qangaroo WikiHop task involves multi-evidence question answering by linking entities in a document corpus with a knowledge base. The task uses Coref GRU and BiDAF Baseline models to select correct candidate answers from support documents. The data is tokenized using Stanford CoreNLP and GloVe embeddings are utilized. The CFC model achieves state-of-the-art results on the WikiHop leaderboard, with a new best accuracy of 70.6% on the blind test set. This outperforms the previous state-of-the-art model by Cao et al. (2018) using pretrained contextual encoders. The CFC model outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 3% without using pretrained contextual encoders. The division of labor between coarse-grain and fine-grain modules allows attention hierarchies to focus on different parts of the input, improving modeling of long documents in WikiHop. Additionally, the model is effective on TriviaQA, a dataset requiring evidence aggregation from multiple sentences. The curr_chunk discusses decomposing the TriviaQA task into two subtasks: proposing candidate answers and reranking them using different techniques. It includes an ablation study on the WikiHop dev set to evaluate different model components. The first subtask is addressed using BiDAF++, while the second subtask is handled separately. The curr_chunk discusses reranking answer candidates using the CFC model, showing consistent performance gains over using only the span extraction question answering model. Reranking with the CFC improves performance regardless of correct answers in the candidate set, resulting in a 3.1% EM and 3.0% F1 gain on the TriviaQA dev set. The CFC model improves performance in reranking answer candidates, leading to a 3.1% EM and 3.0% F1 gain on the dev set. The coarse-grain and fine-grain modules significantly contribute to model performance, while replacing self-attention layers and bidirectional GRUs with mean-pooling and unidirectional GRUs results in less performance degradation. Replacing the encoder with a projection over word embeddings leads to a significant performance drop. The fine-grain-only model consistently under-performs the coarse-grain-only model in coreference resolution due to exact lexical matching technique. However, it matches or outperforms the coarse-grain-only model on some examples. The fine-grain-only model outperforms the coarse-grain-only model on examples with many support documents or long documents due to precise entity-matching coreference resolution. Hierarchical attention maps show that coattention layers focus on similar phrases between the document and query, while self-attention layers capture phrases describing the entity. The document describes attention maps for the query \"Hampton Wick War Memorial\" in the administrative territorial entity of London borough of Richmond Upon Thames. Coattention aligns the relation part of the query to the context in the text, with mentions of Hampton Wicks, Hampton Hills, Teddington, and Richmond upon Thames. Fine-grain coattention and self-attention scores are detailed in the Appendix. The third paragraph discusses the coarse-grain summary self-attention scores for the query \"country of origin the troll\" in Richmond upon Thames. The top support documents focus on information about the literary work \"The Troll\", its author Julia Donaldson, and Old Norse. The self-attention tends to prioritize documents relevant to the query object. The text discusses fine-grain coattention over mention representations in relation to the literary work \"The Troll\" by Julia Donaldson and Old Norse. It examines errors produced by the CFC on the WikiHop development set and categorizes them into four types. The CFC model's errors on the WikiHop development set are categorized into two types. The first type (42% of errors) is due to aggregating the wrong reference, while the second type (28% of errors) is from unanswerable questions. Ways to reduce the first type of error include using more robust pretrained contextual encoders and coreference resolution. The CFC model's errors on the WikiHop development set are categorized into different types. The errors include questions that are unanswerable, queries with multiple correct answers, and complex relation types that are difficult to interpret using pretrained word embeddings. The errors in the CFC model on the WikiHop development set include unanswerable questions, queries with multiple correct answers, and complex relation types that are challenging to interpret using pretrained word embeddings. One method to address these errors is to embed relations using tunable symbolic embeddings along with fixed word embeddings. QA tasks involve various sources like Wikipedia, news articles, books, and trivia, with most tasks not requiring reasoning over multiple pieces of evidence, except in cases of coreference. The Qangaroo WikiHop dataset requires reasoning over multiple pieces of evidence across documents, unlike most QA tasks that do not require such reasoning. Query-focused multi-document summarization also involves aggregating information from multiple documents. Large-scale QA datasets have led to the development of end-to-end QA models. Recent advances in QA models include early document attention models, multi-hop memory networks, cross-sequence attention models, and the use of reinforcement learning. Other variations involve match-LSTM, coattention, bidirectional attention, and query-context attention. Convolution and self-attention are used to model local and global interactions. Our work extends previous research on single-document QA by incorporating multi-evidence QA. Attention mechanisms, such as convolutions and self-attention, are utilized for information aggregation in various tasks like machine translation, relation extraction, summarization, and semantic parsing. Incorporating attention mechanisms like self-attention and coattention has been successful in various tasks such as visual question answering, textual entailment, coreference resolution, dialogue state-tracking, machine translation, and semantic parsing. The CFC introduces a novel approach to combining self-attention and coattention hierarchically.
