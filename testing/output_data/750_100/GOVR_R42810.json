    "content": "The Honoring America's Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act of 2012 (H.R. 1627, P.L. 112-154) is an omnibus bill with provisions impacting veterans programs. It reflects a compromise agreement by House and Senate Committees on Veterans Affairs on various bills reported during the 112th Congress. This report provides information on the provisions by program, benefit, or topic. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) operates the nation's largest integrated health care system for veterans, with eligibility based on various factors. Special treatment legislation has been passed by Congress from time to time. In 1981, Congress passed the Veterans' Health Care, Training, and Small Business Loan Act of 1981 (P.L. 97-72) to allow the VA to treat veterans for disorders possibly related to Agent Orange and ionizing radiation exposure. In 1993, Congress passed P.L. 103-210 to provide health care for Persian Gulf War veterans. The VA has authority to provide health care for Persian Gulf War veterans with medical conditions possibly related to exposure to toxic substances during their service. P.L. 112-154 addresses chemical exposure at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, providing eligibility for VA health care services for certain veterans. Section 102 of P.L. 112-154 allows for VA hospital care and medical services. Section 102 of P.L. 112-154 grants VA health care eligibility to veterans and their family members who were at Camp Lejeune, NC from 1957 to 1987 when the water was contaminated. They can receive care for 15 specified illnesses including various cancers, renal toxicity, infertility, and neurobehavioral effects. The VA provides health care eligibility to veterans and family members exposed to contaminated water at Camp Lejeune, NC from 1957 to 1987 for specified illnesses. The VA is the final payer for eligible family members' health insurance. The State Veterans' Home program is a federal-state partnership for nursing home care facilities, with the VA providing grants and per diem payments to states. State law governs access to nursing home care. The VA sets eligibility criteria for nursing home care, while state laws govern management and admission criteria for State Veterans' Homes (SVHs). The VA pays full cost of care for veterans with 70% or more service-connected disability or related conditions in VA facilities or contracted private nursing homes. The Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-461) equalized the cost of nursing home care for veterans with 70% service-connected disability in any setting. It allowed the VA to use higher per diem rates for State Veterans' Homes (SVHs) caring for these veterans, but SVHs reimbursed at higher rates couldn't receive funding from other federal sources like Medicare or Medicaid. The VA implemented a new reimbursement methodology for State Veterans' Homes (SVHs) to provide nursing home care to veterans with service-connected conditions or a disability rating of 70% or greater. Some SVHs reported receiving smaller reimbursements that did not cover the actual cost of care. Section 105 of P.L. 112-154 requires the VA to develop a reimbursement methodology in consultation with SVHs and enter into contracts with SVHs for veterans in need of nursing home care. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found approximately 300 sexual assault incidents reported to the VA police from January 2007 to July 2010, including rape, inappropriate touching, and forced medical examinations. Many incidents were not reported to VA leadership or the VA Office of the Inspector General as required by regulations. The VA is required to establish a policy for reporting and tracking sexual assault and safety incidents at medical facilities, as mandated by P.L. 112-154. This policy must consider the impact on veterans' mental health and substance abuse treatments, and the VA's ability to refer veterans to these services. The VA is mandated to establish a policy for reporting and tracking sexual assault and safety incidents at medical facilities, considering the impact on veterans' mental health and substance abuse treatments. Additionally, the VA must submit an interim report to Congress on the progress of developing this comprehensive policy within 30 days of enactment. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has become a significant issue for servicemembers in Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom due to increased blast injuries from explosive devices. The number of veterans with traumatic brain injury (TBI) is unknown due to difficulties in identification and some veterans not accessing VA healthcare. Advances in protective equipment and combat medicine have reduced fatal injuries. Healthcare professionals are more aware of TBI, leading to more accurate diagnoses. VA is required to provide comprehensive care for veterans with TBI. The VA is required to provide rehabilitative care to veterans with TBI to maximize independence and improve behavioral and mental health functioning, as mandated by Section 107 of P.L. 112-154. There are concerns that the VA's interpretation of the statute may limit access to vital therapies for maintaining physical, cognitive, and other progress. Telemedicine and telehealth are essential components of the VA's long-term care programs for veterans with TBI, providing electronic communication for medical purposes across distances. According to AHRQ, telehealth goes beyond medical encounters and includes health education and related websites. Telemental health, as defined by the VA's National Center for PTSD, involves behavioral health services delivered through communication technology, such as clinical assessment and psychotherapy. Telemental health, also known as telebehavioral health in the Department of Defense, involves using technology to provide mental health care to patients remotely. The VA has been a leader in telehealth since 1977, especially in delivering care to veterans in rural areas. Research shows that telehealth offers many benefits as an alternative to in-person care. Telehealth offers potential benefits as an alternative to in-person treatment and can be cost-effective within the VA health care system. Section 108 of P.L. 112-154 mandates a teleconsultation program for remote mental health and TBI assessments in VA facilities. VA is also required to provide telemedicine training to medical residents in facilities utilizing telemedicine. Veterans enrolled in the VA health care system do not pay copayments for treatment related to service-connected conditions. Those with 50% or more disability are not charged copayments for any condition. Additionally, veterans are not charged copayments for various outpatient services including health fairs, screenings, counseling, and care for military sexual trauma. Veterans may be required to pay copayments for various outpatient services such as flat film radiology, electrocardiograms, counseling for military sexual trauma, readjustment counseling, mental health services, and hospice care. The copayments are $15 for primary care visits and $50 for specialty care visits. However, veterans do not receive more than one outpatient copayment charge per day. VA has the authority to waive copayments for telehealth or telemedicine services under Section 103 of P.L. 112-154. The Department of Veterans Affairs can waive copayments for telehealth services. Legislation allows VA to provide service dogs to veterans with hearing, mobility, or mental health issues, including PTSD. Research is being conducted on the benefits of using service dogs for treatment. The Department of Veterans Affairs can waive copayments for telehealth services and provide service dogs to veterans with various issues, including PTSD. Legislation mandates that accredited service dogs have access to VA facilities. The Office of Rural Health was established to address disparities in services for rural veterans within the VHA. The VHA established the Office of Rural Health (ORH) in 2006 to reduce disparities in service between rural and non-rural veterans. Three Veterans Rural Health Resource Centers (VRHRCs) were opened in FY2009 to develop special practices and products for facilities nationwide. These Centers, located in Maine, Iowa, and Utah, serve as field-based clinical laboratories experimenting with new outreach and care models. Section 110 of P.L. 112-154 recognizes VRHRCs as satellite offices. Section 110 of P.L. 112-154 acknowledges Veterans Rural Health Resource Centers (VRHRCs) as satellite offices of the Office of Rural Health (ORH). These centers are required to improve understanding of challenges faced by rural veterans, identify disparities in healthcare availability, develop programs to enhance healthcare delivery, and create special practices for rural veterans. The Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (P.L. 99-272) allowed the VHA to bill veterans and insurers for nonservice-connected care to offset medical service costs. However, the VA initially couldn't keep these payments, depositing them into the U.S. Treasury. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33) granted the VHA the authority to retain these funds. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33) allowed the VHA to retain funds in the VA's Medical Care Collections Fund (MCCF) for providing medical services to veterans without fiscal year limitations. It also changed the basis of billing insurers from \"reasonable costs\" to \"reasonable charges\" to increase VA collections. In FY2004, the budget requested consolidating medical collections accounts into the MCCF. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2004 recommended consolidating several medical collections accounts into the MCCF, including funds from the Health Services Improvement Fund, Veterans Extended Care Revolving Fund, Special Therapeutic and Rehabilitation Activities Fund, Medical Facilities Revolving Fund, and Parking Revolving Fund. The VA was granted permanent authority in 2005 to deposit funds from these accounts into the MCCF for medical services. The MCCF consolidates various medical collections accounts for veterans' medical services. The VA must develop a plan to identify and collect billable third-party revenue for the MCCF, including effective billing and collection procedures and employee training. The VA is collecting funds to comply with fee revenue goals and monitoring systems. They provide beneficiary travel payments to eligible veterans and family caregivers. A three-year initiative is assessing treating Vet Centers as VA facilities for travel reimbursement for veterans in highly rural areas. The VA is authorized to provide eligible veterans and beneficiaries with mileage reimbursement, special mode transport, and common carrier transport for travel to and from VA or VA authorized health care. VA Secretary must report to Congress on the initiative's beneficiaries and analysis within 180 days of enactment. The VA is required to reimburse ambulance providers based on local prevailing Medicare rates to save costs, as previous payment authorities resulted in higher rates than allowed by Medicare. The Vow to Hire Heroes Act of 2011 provided VA with this authority. The Vow to Hire Heroes Act of 2011 gave the VA authority to pay ambulance providers based on Medicare rates to save costs. However, the change in law did not have the desired effect as it only applied when VA pays for ambulance service before determining the veteran's eligibility, which rarely happens. The Vow to Hire Heroes Act of 2011 allowed VA to reimburse ambulance providers based on Medicare rates to save costs. A technical correction in P.L. 112-154 authorizes VA to reimburse ambulance providers at the actual charge or local Medicare rate when no contract is in place. This new method applies to all ambulance transportation except for non-VA emergency care for nonservice-connected conditions. The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 established means testing for veterans seeking care for nonservice-connected conditions. Veterans report household income to determine eligibility for VA health care. P.L. 112-154 allows VA to use the veteran's household income for eligibility determination. P.L. 112-154 amends the VA's Specially Adapted Housing Program, providing grants for veterans and servicemembers with service-connected disabilities to purchase or modify homes. There are two grant programs within the SAH Program, one for mobility impairments and another for blindness or loss of use. The Adaptation Grant (\u00a72101(b) grant) assists veterans who are blind or have lost the use of their hands. It can also be used to adapt a family member's home where a veteran lives. The dollar limit for the \u00a72101(a) grant is higher, and both grants are available to veterans with severe burn injuries. Section 202 of P.L. 112-154 expands qualifying disabilities for \u00a72101(a) grants to include veterans or servicemembers who have lost use of one or more lower extremities affecting balance and propulsion, requiring aids for ambulation. The Adaptation Grant (\u00a72101(b) assists veterans with disabilities such as blindness or loss of hand use. Changes in P.L. 112-154 include new vision standards and increased grant assistance to $63,780. The new law increases the maximum assistance for \u00a72101(a) grants to $63,780 and for \u00a72101(b) grants to $12,756. The VA Secretary must adjust the award limits annually based on a cost-of-construction index. P.L. 112-154 aligns the statutory limit with the most recently adjusted limits, effective one year after enactment. Veterans can also use grants to modify family members' homes temporarily. Section 205 of P.L. 112-154 increases the maximum TRA grants for \u00a72101(a) to $28,000 and for \u00a72101(b) to $5,000. The new law also requires annual adjustments based on a cost-of-construction index, aligning the limits with the most recent adjustments. Veterans can use these grants to modify family members' homes temporarily. The TRA grants were extended to December 31, 2022, with exceptions for cases where a previously-adapted home is damaged in a disaster. Disabled veterans or servicemembers may receive funds to acquire another suitable home in such cases. The VA Loan Guaranty Program provides mortgage insurance for eligible veterans, allowing them to enter into mortgages with private lenders. The program guarantees to pay lenders a portion of losses in case of borrower default. Assistance is available for disabled veterans or servicemembers to acquire another suitable home if their previously-adapted home is damaged in a disaster. The maximum benefit is determined by the cost to repair or replace the property exceeding insurance coverage or statutory grant maximums. The VA Loan Guaranty Program pays lenders a portion of losses from borrower default. Veterans must occupy the property as their home to be eligible. Fees are based on factors like down payment amount and military service history. Fees may be waived for veterans with service-connected disabilities. The VA Loan Guaranty Program pays lenders for losses from borrower default. Fees may be waived for veterans with service-connected disabilities and certain surviving spouses. P.L. 112-154 expands loan guaranty eligibility to include surviving spouses of veterans who die while receiving compensation for a service-connected disability rated totally disabling. The VA Loan Guaranty Program pays lenders for losses from borrower default. Fees may be waived for veterans with service-connected disabilities and certain surviving spouses. P.L. 112-154 expands loan guaranty eligibility to include surviving spouses of veterans who die while receiving compensation for a service-connected disability rated totally disabling. Surviving spouses who qualify for the loan guaranty based on this provision will not be required to pay the guaranteed loan fee. Section 207 of P.L. 112-154 amends the housing occupancy requirement to qualify for the loan guaranty. An exception to the requirement that a veteran occupy the house as a home already exists for veterans called away for active duty. P.L. 112-154 expands loan guaranty eligibility to include dependent children of veterans called away for active duty. It also makes permanent the programs for guaranteeing adjustable rate mortgages. Additionally, it modifies the law regarding when veterans with service-connected disabilities may have the loan guaranty fee waived. The new law under P.L. 112-154 allows veterans with service-connected disabilities to have the loan guaranty fee waived based on a pre-discharge examination or review of existing medical evidence. This change aims to expedite the process by using existing medical records for disability determinations. Section 702 of P.L. 112-154 also addresses guaranteed loan fees, maximum guaranty amount, and guaranteed loan sales. Section 702 of P.L. 112-154 extends current loan fees until October 1, 2017, reinstates higher maximum loan guaranty amounts for housing in high-cost areas, and addresses guaranteed loan sales securities. The Freddie Mac statute sets the conforming loan limit at $417,000 for single-family homes, with the possibility of higher limits in high-cost areas. Temporary increases in the maximum guaranty amount were made through P.L. 110-389 and P.L. 112-154, setting the limit at 25% of the higher of the conforming loan limit or 125% of the area median home price, not exceeding 175% of the Freddie Mac statute limit. The VA can guarantee loans up to 175% of $625,500, or $1,094,625 in high-cost areas. The higher maximum limits will be in effect through December 31, 2014. The VA's authority to bundle and sell vendee loans has been extended through December 31, 2016. Prior to P.L. 112-154, the VA used Enhanced Use Lease (EUL) process to lease unused property for VA mission enhancement. Lessees provided housing for homeless veterans, but EULs were also used for non-housing purposes. Prior to P.L. 112-154, the VA used Enhanced Use Lease (EUL) process to lease unused property for VA mission enhancement, including providing housing for homeless veterans. EULs were also used for non-housing purposes such as child development centers, parking facilities, golf courses, senior housing, assisted living facilities, and nursing homes. However, Section 211 of P.L. 112-154 now restricts EUL properties to be used only for \"supportive housing\" for veterans or their families who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. The VA now restricts Enhanced Use Lease properties to be used for supportive housing for homeless veterans or their families. Leases entered before January 1, 2012, are subject to previous laws. The VA may receive cash at fair value for an EUL, and must release an annual report on consideration received. The Grant and Per Diem program, also known as Comprehensive Service Programs, authorizes the VA for various housing options. The Grant and Per Diem program, also known as Comprehensive Service Programs, authorizes the VA to provide grants for transitional housing and services to homeless veterans. Grants are used for facility purchase, rehabilitation, or conversion, while per diem reimburses for housing and supportive services costs. Grantees are reimbursed up to the current per diem rate for care provided. The Grant and Per Diem program authorizes the VA to provide grants for transitional housing and services to homeless veterans. Grants can be used for facility purchase, rehabilitation, or conversion, while per diem reimburses for housing and supportive services costs, not exceeding the current rate of $38.90 per day. P.L. 112-154 allows grants to be used for service centers, transitional housing, and acquisition/rehabilitation of property. Grantees can also use Low Income Housing Tax Credits in conjunction with VA funding, and receive funds from other sources if operated by a private nonprofit organization. The definition of private nonprofit organization is expanded to include for-profit limited partnerships or limited liability companies where the sole general partner or manager is a private nonprofit organization. Section 305 of P.L. 112-154 authorizes the VA Grant and Per Diem program at $250 million for FY2013 and $150 million for each subsequent fiscal year, targeting homeless veterans with special needs. The Special Needs grant program under P.L. 112-154 expands eligibility to include male veterans with dependent children, removes the requirement for grantees to already be Grant and Per Diem providers, allows funds to be used for services to dependents of homeless veterans, and extends the authorization level to $5 million per fiscal year through FY2013. The Health Care for Homeless Veterans program provides outreach, care, and treatment for homeless veterans. The VA medical center staff conduct outreach to homeless veterans, provide care for medical, psychiatric, and substance use disorders, and refer veterans to supportive services. The HCHV program now includes homeless veterans, regardless of mental illness. HUD-VASH is a collaborative program between the VA and HUD to distribute Section 8 housing vouchers for homeless individuals. Housing Authorities distribute Section 8 vouchers for homeless veterans, while VA medical centers provide case management and clinical services. VA may contract with other entities to help veterans find housing and connect them with services. Section 305 of P.L. 112-154 extends the authorization for programs serving homeless veterans, including the Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program (HVRP) and Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF). HVRP helps homeless veterans find employment, while SSVF assists very low-income veterans in obtaining housing. The SSVF program assists very low-income veterans transitioning from homelessness to housing or relocating. P.L. 112-154 authorizes SSVF for FY2013 at $300 million, up from $100 million in FY2012. DEA provides educational assistance to servicemembers' dependents affected by military service. The Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) provides educational assistance to eligible servicemembers and veterans who served on active duty after September 10, 2001, and their eligible family members. Section 401 of P.L. 112-154 allows DEA-eligible individuals to combine benefit programs for up to 81 months of entitlement, starting from October 1, 2013. The All-Volunteer Force Educational Assistance Program (MGIB-AD; Title 38 U.S.C., Chapter 30) primarily provides educational assistance to eligible members of the Armed Forces who entered active duty for the first time after June 30, 1985. Section 402 of P.L. 112-154 requires the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress on the Post-9/11 GI Bill and requires the VA Secretary to report to Congress on the Post-9/11 GI Bill and the DEA. The reports are due annually, starting no later than November 13, 2013, through January 1, 2021. The Defense report must include information on the impact of Post-9/11 GI Bill benefit levels on recruitment and retention in the Armed Forces. The VA report must include information on the usage of Post-9/11 GI Bill and DEA benefits, program expenditures, student outcomes, and recommendations for administrative and legislative changes. Section 402 repeals the requirement for biennial reports from the Secretary of Defense. Section 402 repeals the biennial report requirement for the Secretary of Defense and the VA Secretary on the MGIB-AD. Claimants appealing decisions can submit additional evidence, which may cause delays as the BVA waits for the local VA office to review it. Under Section 501 of P.L. 112-154, the local VA office's initial review of newly submitted evidence will be waived unless requested by the claimant. If no request is made, the BVA will review the evidence. Section 502 of P.L. 112-154 grants the VA authority to allow court-appointed representatives or caregivers to sign applications on behalf of claimants for benefits adjudication. Section 502 of P.L. 112-154 authorizes the VA to allow court-appointed representatives, caregivers, or attorneys to sign claim applications on behalf of the claimant. The VA's duty to assist claimants in gathering medical records can be waived under Section 505 of P.L. 112-154. Section 507 of P.L. 112-154 allows the VA to waive its duty to assist requirement when there is sufficient evidence for maximum benefits. It also encourages claimants to submit relevant private medical records to prevent unnecessary resource expenditure. If a veteran receiving benefits passes away, the surviving spouse is entitled to the same benefits. The VA provides benefits to surviving spouses of veterans who pass away, including the amount the veteran would have received for the month of their death. The Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 requires the VA to notify claimants of evidence needed for their claims. The VCAA notice, provided after a claim is filed, contains information about disability compensation and how ratings are determined. Section 504 of P.L. 112-154 allows the VA to print the notice on claims forms and removes the requirement to send it on subsequent claims if an issue was covered before. The VA can send notices on subsequent claims if an issue was covered in a previous claim within the past year, use efficient means like electronic communication for notifications, and waive VCAA requirements for granting the highest evaluation to veterans. The Fully Developed Claim (FDC) process was developed under P.L. 110-389 to expedite disability claims processing. The Fully Developed Claim (FDC) process under P.L. 110-389 allows veterans to establish an effective date for their disability claim up to one year before the VA receives the claim application, by filing a notice and developing evidence prior to submission. The Fully Developed Claim (FDC) process allows veterans to establish an effective date for their disability claim by filing a notice and developing evidence prior to submission. The change in effective date for original FDC disability claims is available for three years. A joint application form is required for VA survivor benefits and Social Security, considered an application for benefits with both agencies. Section 503 of P.L. 112-154 permits the development of the joint form. The Improved Disability Pension program provides monthly cash benefits to low-income elderly or disabled veterans with active military service during a period of war. Section 508 of P.L. 112-154 increases the maximum annual benefit for married veteran couples under this program. The Disability Pension program for married veteran couples has increased the maximum annual benefit to $32,433. Income received by the veteran or surviving spouse will reduce the maximum cash benefit amount for both the Improved Disability Pension and the Improved Death Pension. Reimbursements for casualty losses and expenses for replacement or repair are excluded when calculating income for benefit purposes. The VA provides financial assistance for replacement or repair of equipment, vehicles, or property due to accidents, theft, or casualty loss. Disabled veterans may also receive assistance for purchasing automobiles or adaptive equipment. VA Secretary can offer aid for a second automobile if the first one was destroyed by a disaster not caused by the veteran. The VA's Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E) Program offers employment services for veterans with disabilities. Section 701 of P.L. 112-154 expands provisions for veterans affected by disasters. Section 701 of P.L. 112-154 extends the subsistence allowance for veterans in the VR&E program by two months after program completion, with an additional two months for those displaced by disasters. The limit on annual participation in IL services for veterans is waived in cases of displacement due to disasters. Section 601 of P.L. 112-154 increases restrictions on demonstrations at veterans' funerals, amending 38 U.S.C. \u00a72413 to include time, place, and manner restrictions at Arlington National Cemetery and VA-controlled cemeteries. Section 601 of P.L. 112-154 increases restrictions on demonstrations at veterans' funerals at Arlington National Cemetery and VA-controlled cemeteries. Demonstrations are limited 120 minutes before and after a funeral, with increased minimum distance requirements. Violations can result in statutory damages ranging from $25,000 to $50,000. Section 602 of P.L. 112-154 prohibits reserving gravesites at Arlington National Cemetery before an individual's death, with the President able to waive this rule. The Secretary of the Army can designate areas in the cemetery to honor missing veterans. Section 604 of P.L. 112-154 establishes requirements for establishing monuments at Arlington National Cemetery, with a 25-year waiting period after the last day of service or military event. The Secretary of the Army can waive this requirement after notification. A monument sponsored by a nongovernmental entity can be established after providing an independent study of other locations. Section 604 of P.L. 112-154 mandates requirements for monuments at Arlington National Cemetery, with a 25-year waiting period after service. The Secretary of the Army can waive this after notification. A nongovernmental entity must provide an independent study for a monument. The Secretary consults with the Commission of Fine Arts and the Advisory Committee. Congressional committees must be notified of proposed monuments, and Congress can pass a joint resolution of disapproval within 60 days. The VA provides certificates with the President's signature to eligible survivors of deceased veterans. The Presidential Memorial Certificate is available to eligible survivors of deceased veterans who were discharged under honorable conditions. Eligibility has been expanded to include persons who die in active military, naval, or air service. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act provides protections for servicemembers whose military service affects their financial obligations. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) protects servicemembers from financial obligations incurred before entering active military service by suspending civil claims, preventing eviction, capping interest at 6%, and safeguarding against cancellation of life insurance. The SCRA provides various protections for servicemembers, including safeguarding against the cancellation of insurance policies, allowing professionals to suspend insurance while on active duty, and preventing taxation in multiple jurisdictions. Amendments have been made to the SCRA since its passage in 2003, with recent changes extending protections related to mortgages and foreclosures until December 31, 2014. Specifically, Section 710 of P.L. 112-154 amended Section 303 of the SCRA to address mortgages and trust deeds for servicemembers. The SCRA provides protections for servicemembers related to mortgages and trust deeds. If a servicemember is unable to make payments due to military service, the vendor cannot take action to rescind or terminate the contract until one year after active duty ends. Sale, foreclosure, or seizure of property during military service or one year after is prohibited. The SCRA prohibits the sale, foreclosure, or seizure of property during a servicemember's military service and for one year after, except under a court order or agreement. Section 701 requires a report to Congress on SCRA protections, and Section 703 mandates a plan to evaluate VBA employees' skills and capabilities. The Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) aims to assess and improve the skills of employees processing disability compensation and pension benefit claims. Special authority granted by the Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006 allows competitions for small businesses owned by service-disabled and other veterans. The 2006 act allows competitions for small businesses owned by service-disabled and other veterans, with contracting preferences and potential debarment for firms misrepresenting their status. The VA's \"Veterans First\" contracting program allows for debarment of firms that willfully and intentionally misrepresent their status. Debarments are imposed for punishment and clarified under Section 706 of P.L. 112-154. Section 706 of P.L. 112-154 amends Section 502 to specify a minimum debarment period of five years for firms that intentionally misrepresent their status. It sets time frames for initiating and completing debarment actions, requiring the VA to start within 30 days of a determination and finish within 90 days. Additionally, it outlines how principals of debarred firms should be treated. Section 706 of P.L. 112-154 mandates a minimum five-year debarment for firms that intentionally misrepresent their status. The VA must initiate debarment actions within 30 days and complete them within 90 days. Principals of debarred firms are also included in the debarment. Additionally, Section 707 requires the VA Secretary to report on conferences costing $20,000 or more attended by 50 or more people within 30 days of each fiscal quarter. The report must detail final costs by category. Federal contractors and subcontractors with contracts over $100,000 must report annually to the Department of Labor on total employment, new employees, and qualified veterans. P.L. 112-154 requires the DOL Secretary to maintain a public website for this information. The VA Secretary is directed to establish the VetStar program to recognize businesses' contributions to veterans' employment."
