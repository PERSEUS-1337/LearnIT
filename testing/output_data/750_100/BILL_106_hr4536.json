    "content": "Title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section called \"Physical Education for Progress Act.\" This part aims to provide grants and contracts to local educational agencies to enhance physical education programs for students from kindergarten to 12th grade. Congress finds that physical education is crucial for children's development, improving their health, self-esteem, relationships, behavior, and independence. Children who participate in high quality daily physical education programs tend to be healthier and more physically fit. The percentage of overweight young people has more than doubled in the 30 years preceding 1999, with low activity levels contributing to obesity. Obesity-related diseases cost the US economy over $100 billion annually, and inactivity and poor diet lead to at least 300,000 deaths each year in the United States. Children are not as active as they should be, with fewer than 1 in 4 getting 20 minutes of vigorous activity daily. The Surgeon General's 1996 Report recommends daily physical education for all students in kindergarten through grade 12. Resolution 97, 100th Congress, passed in 1987, urges State and local governments to provide high-quality daily physical education programs for all K-12 students, but little progress has been made in achieving this goal. Every student should have the opportunity to participate in quality physical education to develop health-related fitness, physical competence, and cognitive understanding about physical activity. Every student in our Nation's schools should have the opportunity to achieve the goals established by Healthy People 2000 and Healthy People 2010, promoting physical activity for all students to adopt healthy lifestyles. \"Program authorized under SEC. 10999D for promoting physical activity in schools.\" The Secretary can award grants to local educational agencies for physical education programs for K-12 students, including equipment, curriculum development, and staff training. \"SEC. 10999E. APPLICATIONS; PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS.\" Each local educational agency must submit an application to the Secretary outlining a plan to enhance physical education programs in schools to meet national goals and state standards. Physical education programs may include fitness education, motor skills instruction, and cognitive concepts to promote lifelong healthy lifestyles. Physical education programs promote a healthy lifestyle, social skills, and nutrition education. Teachers receive professional development opportunities. Extracurricular activities like team sports and ROTC are not included. The ROTC program activities are not considered part of the physical education curriculum assisted under this program. The Secretary ensures equitable distribution of grants and contracts between urban and rural local educational agencies, as well as between those serving large and small student populations. Private school and home-schooled students are also included in the provisions. Private school and home-schooled students can participate in activities funded under this part, based on the number of students in the school district. A report is required for continued funding. \"Continued funding for multiyear grants or contracts under this part requires an annual report on activities and progress towards goals. A report to Congress is also mandated.\" The Secretary must submit a report to Congress by June 1, 2003, detailing the programs assisted under this part, their success in improving physical fitness, and recommendations for their continuation and improvement. Additionally, no more than 5% of grant or contract funds can be used for administrative costs, and the federal share should supplement, not supplant, funding. The Federal share for projects under this part is capped at 90% for the first year and 75% for subsequent years. Funds must supplement, not replace, other Federal, State, and local funds for physical education activities. Authorization of appropriations is also addressed. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2000 to 2004 totaling $30,000,000, $70,000,000, and $100,000,000 respectively, to support physical education activities."
