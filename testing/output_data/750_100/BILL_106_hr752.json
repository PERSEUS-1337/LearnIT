    "content": "The \"Airline Passenger Fairness Act\" may be cited as the short title of this Act. The findings of the Act are also outlined. The Congress finds that the number of airline passengers on US carriers is expected to grow to 1 billion by 2008. The number of certified large air carriers has decreased, with 6 of the largest carriers forming 3 large networks. Only 2/3 of communities that had scheduled air service in 1978 still have it today. The Department of Transportation's report in 1997 showed 75 city pairs with fare increases of 30% or more, leading to a decrease in traffic by over 20%. In 1998, a study found that major US airlines charge double at hub airports without low fare competition. The General Accounting Office found that fares are significantly higher at hub airports dominated by one carrier or a consortium, ranging from 12% to 71% higher. Complaints about airline travel have increased by over 25% from the previous year, with complaints against large US air carriers rising from 6,394 in 1997 to 7,994 in 1998. The 1997 National Civil Aviation Review Commission highlighted the issue of delays in air travel. The problem of flight delays is worsening, with a nearly 20% increase in daily aircraft delays of 15 minutes or longer in 1996 compared to 1995. Forecasts show a 52% increase in passenger enplanements between 1996 and 2006, with an average annual growth of 4.2% in revenue passenger miles. Large US air carriers charge about 60% more, as per a 1998 Department of Transportation study. The Congress has directed the Secretary of Transportation to prohibit unfair and deceptive practices in the airline industry, where large United States air carriers charge about 60 percent more to passengers traveling to or from small communities compared to those traveling between large communities. SEC. 3. FAIR PRACTICES FOR AIRLINE PASSENGERS. Section 41712 of title 49, United States Code is amended to include specific practices for certificated air carriers, such as informing passengers about oversold flights and allowing confirmed reserved passengers to board. The amended Section 41712 of title 49, United States Code includes provisions for certificated air carriers, such as allowing passengers with confirmed reserved space on a flight to use portions of their ticket for travel, ensuring timely delivery of checked baggage, and providing consumers with full access to all fares. The amended Section 41712 of title 49, United States Code includes provisions for certificated air carriers, such as informing passengers of flight delays, providing accurate reasons for delays, offering refunds for unused tickets within 48 hours, and disclosing fare information to consumers. The amended Section 41712 of title 49, United States Code requires certificated air carriers to disclose information on frequent flyer programs, including the number of redeemable seats and redemption success rates. Violations of these requirements will be included in the Department of Transportation's monthly Air Travel Consumer Report. The term 'confirmed reserved space' refers to a space on a specific date, flight, and class of service that has been requested by a passenger and verified by the carrier for accommodation."
