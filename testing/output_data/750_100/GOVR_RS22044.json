    "content": "The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) provides federal funding to states for education of children with disabilities, requiring states to offer a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) to all such children. Prior to P.L. 105-17 in 1997, states had to ensure participation of children with disabilities in private schools. Prior to P.L. 105-17 in 1997, states had to ensure participation of children with disabilities in private schools by providing comparable program benefits to those offered in public schools. The vague \"equitable participation\" standard led to differences among states, localities, and courts. The IDEA Amendments of 1997 replaced the \"equitable participation\" standard with a new provision that ensured children with disabilities in private schools would receive services consistent with the number and location of enrolled students. The IDEA Amendments of 1997 replaced the \"equitable participation\" standard with a provision ensuring children with disabilities in private schools receive services consistent with enrolled students. Private schools provided special education and related services to these children, funded proportionately by federal funds under Part B of IDEA. Services could be offered on private school premises, including parochial schools, with \"child find\" requirements applicable to identify children with disabilities. The 2004 reauthorization made changes to provisions applicable to children in private schools, clarifying LEAs' responsibilities to ensure fair services. Changes reflected current policies from IDEA regulations and the No Child Left Behind Act. The bill clarified local educational agencies' responsibilities to children with disabilities in private schools. The 2004 reauthorization made changes to provisions for children with disabilities in private schools, clarifying LEAs' responsibilities. Children with disabilities can be placed in private schools by parents or the LEA, with costs covered by the LEA. IDEA requires certain findings for LEAs to cover costs of private school placement. The 2004 reauthorization made changes to provisions for children with disabilities in private schools, clarifying LEAs' responsibilities. Children with disabilities can be placed in private schools by parents or the LEA, with costs covered by the LEA. IDEA requires certain findings for LEAs to cover costs of private school placement, including services for children in private schools unilaterally placed by parents. The 2004 reauthorization clarified LEAs' responsibilities for children with disabilities in private schools, including specific requirements for parentally placed children. The addition of the requirement that children be located in the school district served by the LEA aimed to protect LEAs from working with private schools in multiple jurisdictions, but has sparked controversy. The 2004 reauthorization clarified LEAs' responsibilities for children with disabilities in private schools, including specific requirements for parentally placed children. This provision has sparked controversy due to its disproportional effect on LEAs with large concentrations of private schools, lack of change in funding formula, and potential conflicts with state laws. Five requirements exist for children parentally placed in private schools, ensuring equal funds expenditure by LEAs. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA added provisions regarding direct services for children with disabilities in private schools. It emphasized the importance of providing instructional activities and related services directly to these children. Additionally, a new provision was added for calculating the proportionate amount of federal funds for private school children, requiring thorough child find processes by LEAs after consultation with private school representatives. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA added provisions for direct services to children with disabilities in private schools, emphasizing the importance of providing instructional activities and related services. The final regulations discuss the proportionate share calculation and allow services to be provided on the premises of private, including religious schools. A provision on supplementing funds, not supplanting them, was added to ensure state and local funds do not replace federal funds required for children with disabilities in private schools. Each LEA must maintain records and provide the SEA with the number of children evaluated, determined to have disabilities, and served under private school provisions. The requirement for finding children with disabilities is the same as previous law. The new law replaces \"parochial\" with \"religious\" for private schools. It includes provisions for equitable participation, activities, cost, and completion period for parentally placed private school children with disabilities. Child find must ensure accurate count and completion time comparable to public school students. Cost of child find activities cannot be used to meet spending obligations. The new law (P.L. 108-446) adds requirements for LEA consultation with private school officials and parents of parentally placed private school children with disabilities. This includes discussions on child find process, equitable participation, federal funding allocation, and consultation process among the LEA, private school officials, and parents. The new law (P.L. 108-446) adds requirements for LEA consultation with private school officials and parents of parentally placed private school children with disabilities. This includes discussions on how special education and related services will be provided for parentally placed private school children with disabilities, including types of services, apportioning of services with insufficient funds, and providing written explanations for not providing services. The new law (P.L. 108-446) requires LEAs to consult with private school officials regarding the provision of services for parentally placed private school children with disabilities. Consultation procedures are similar to those in the No Child Left Behind Act, with written affirmation needed from private school representatives. Non-compliance procedures are also outlined in the law. Compliance procedures under P.L. 108-446 allow private school officials to submit complaints to the SEA if they feel consultation was not meaningful. If dissatisfied with the SEA's determination, complaints can be escalated to the Secretary of Education. The 2004 reauthorization of P.L. 108-446 includes provisions for equitable services for pupils attending private schools, ensuring services are secular, neutral, and nonideological. Funds for private school pupils are controlled and administered by a public agency. If a child with a disability is unilaterally placed in a private school, the cost is not covered by the LEA unless determined by a hearing officer. The cost of private school placement is not covered by the LEA unless certain findings are made by a hearing officer or court. Reimbursement may be reduced or denied if parents did not provide notice, but exceptions exist in the law. The new law specifies that reimbursement cannot be denied if the school prevented notice, parents were unaware of the requirement, or compliance would harm the child physically. The new law (P.L. 108-446) allows reimbursement not to be reduced or denied if a parent is illiterate, cannot write in English, or if compliance with the notice requirement would likely result in serious emotional harm to the child. It does not address whether parents of a child with a disability are entitled to private school reimbursement if the student never received special education. In a recent Supreme Court decision, parents of a child with a disability were granted private school reimbursement, even though the student had not received special education services from the school district. This ruling, in Board of Education of the City School District of the City of New York v. Tom F., was upheld by a divided 4-4 Court. The decision does not establish a precedent for lower courts, leaving the issue unresolved."
