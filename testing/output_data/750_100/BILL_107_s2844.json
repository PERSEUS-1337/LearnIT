The No Child Left Behind Act requires States to recruit qualified teachers by 2006, especially in rural and high-poverty schools. Rural education is crucial for overall education performance. The recruitment and retention of teachers is crucial for overall education performance in 25 States. A 2000 study by the Education Trust shows that high poverty schools are twice as likely to lack certified teachers in their fields. The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards was established in 1987 in response to the 1983 report \"A Nation at Risk\". The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, established in 1987 in response to the report \"A Nation at Risk\", aims to set high standards for accomplished teachers. Over 16,000 teachers nationwide have completed the rigorous certification process by the Board. Recent data from the Accomplished Teaching Validation Study shows that National Board certified teachers outperform non-certified peers on 11 of 13 teaching expertise measures. Teacher salaries have stagnated over the past decade, with 2/3 of states below the national average of $40,582. The Act aims to encourage teachers through a refundable tax credit. To incentivize teachers to work in rural or high-poverty schools, a refundable tax credit is proposed. Additionally, a tax credit is suggested for teachers who achieve certification from the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards to attract and retain highly qualified educators in public schools. A refundable tax credit is proposed for individuals teaching in elementary and secondary schools located in high poverty or rural areas, as well as for certified teachers. This tax credit aims to attract and retain highly qualified educators in public schools. A refundable tax credit is proposed for eligible teachers in public schools in rural areas or high poverty schools. The credit allows for an amount equal to the applicable academic year to be deducted from the tax imposed for that year. A refundable tax credit of $1,000 is available for eligible teachers in public schools with at least 75% of students receiving free or reduced-cost lunches. The tax credit amount for certified teachers in schools with a School Locale Code of 7 or 8 is $1,000, and for teachers in rural areas or high-poverty schools, it is $2,000. The tax credit amount for eligible teachers in public elementary or secondary schools is $2,000. An eligible teacher is defined as a full-time kindergarten through grade 12 classroom teacher. Additional definitions include the terms 'elementary school' and 'secondary school' as defined by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, and the term 'eligible academic year'. The term 'eligible academic year' refers to any academic year ending in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002. Amendments are made to section 1324(b) of title 31, United States Code, and the table of sections for subpart C of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Tax credit for individuals teaching in high poverty or rural areas and certified teachers. Overpayments of tax.
