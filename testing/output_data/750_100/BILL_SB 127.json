    "title": "SB 127",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges that many areas in California are disproportionately affected by drought due to heavy reliance on overdrafted groundwater basins or contaminated basins. There are state grant and loan programs to help communities with water needs, but individual homeowners with groundwater wells lack similar assistance for water supply and wastewater improvements due to affordability issues. The program created by this act aims to provide low-interest loans, grants, or both to individual homeowners for safer, cleaner, and more reliable drinking water and wastewater treatment. This includes actions like digging deeper wells, improving existing wells, addressing water contaminants, or connecting to a local water system. The Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Program established by the board provides low-interest loans and grants to local agencies and eligible applicants for purposes such as extending service lines, connecting to water systems, closing abandoned septic tanks and wells, and deepening groundwater wells. The Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Program offers low-interest loans and grants for various purposes, including extending service lines, connecting to water systems, closing abandoned septic tanks and wells, and improving groundwater wells with treatment systems if needed to meet drinking standards. The board has the authority to adopt regulations necessary for the program without following standard rulemaking procedures. The Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund is established in the State Treasury for board expenditure. Moneys deposited include repayments from grants or loans and interest earned. Eligible loan applicants must meet specific criteria. An eligible applicant for a loan must have a household income below the statewide median, own the residence, be unable to get financial assistance from private lenders, and demonstrate the ability to repay the loan. Any loan granted must be secured by a mortgage on the residence, repaid within 20 years with a maximum 1 percent interest rate. The loan recipient must maintain homeowner's insurance on the residence while the balance is outstanding to protect the state's interest. The board may contract with a private financial institution to provide loans for eligible applicants with low income who own their residence and cannot obtain financial assistance from private lenders. The loans must be repaid within 20 years with a 1 percent interest rate and secured by a mortgage on the residence. SEC. 3. Ten million dollars ($10,000,000) is transferred from the General Fund to the Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund. SEC. 4. This act is an urgency statute for the immediate preservation of public peace, health, or safety and shall go into immediate effect. The act aims to provide access to cleaner drinking water and wastewater treatment during California's drought. It defines a \"water project\" as one funded by the Water Quality, Supply and Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2014. The procedures established for challenging the certification of an environmental impact report or approvals for a water project apply to actions brought against them. On or before July 1, 2016, the Judicial Council must adopt a rule of court for procedures regarding challenges to the certification of environmental impact reports or project approvals for water projects. The draft and final reports must include a notice in at least 12-point type. The EIR is subject to Section 21168.6.7 of the Public Resources Code, which states that the lead agency is not required to consider comments filed after the public comment period. Any legal challenge to the EIR certification or project approval must follow the procedures outlined in the Public Resources Code. The full text of this section must be included in the draft and final environmental impact reports. The lead agency must conduct an informational workshop within 10 days of releasing the draft environmental impact report and hold a public hearing within 10 days before the close of the public comment period. A transcript of the hearing will be included in the final environmental impact report. Within five days after the public comment period, a commenter on the draft environmental impact report can request nonbinding mediation. The mediation must involve the lead agency, applicant, and all commenters who requested it, ending within 35 days of the comment period. The request for mediation should specify the disputed areas raised in the commenter's submission. The lead agency must choose experienced mediators for disputes in land use and environmental law. The applicant is responsible for covering the mediation costs. Each dispute area must undergo a mediation session with all involved parties. The lead agency must adopt agreed-upon measures as a condition of approval, with input from the applicant and commenters who requested mediation. Commenters cannot challenge the decision based on issues addressed in agreed-upon measures. Written comments after the public comment period will only be considered if they address new issues raised in the response to comments by the lead agency. The lead agency must consider new issues raised in response to comments, new information released after the draft report, changes to the project post-public comment period, and proposed conditions or mitigation measures. The lead agency must file the notice required within five days of the last initial project approval and prepare the record of proceedings, with the applicant covering all costs. The lead agency must make the draft environmental impact report and related documents available to the public in an electronic format within three business days of its release. Any additional documents prepared or submitted after the draft report's release must also be accessible electronically within five business days. The lead agency must provide the draft environmental impact report and related documents in an electronic format within three business days of release. Copyright protected documents not prepared specifically for the project do not need to be electronically accessible, but an index of these documents must be available electronically by the release of the draft report or within five business days if received later. The index should specify where hardcopies of the copyrighted materials can be reviewed by the public. The lead agency must convert non-electronic comments into electronic format within seven days and make them available to the public. Comments not considered by the lead agency will be indicated in the record of proceedings. Within five days of filing the required notice, the lead agency must certify the record of proceedings and provide an electronic copy to a party upon request. A reasonable fee may be charged for the copy. Within 10 days of receiving a complaint or petition, the lead agency must lodge a copy of the certified record with the superior court. The superior court resolves disputes over the record of proceedings. A party disputing the content must file a motion to augment the record. The court may grant relief without staying construction unless there is an imminent threat to public health and safety. The water project site may contain important Native American artifacts or historical, archaeological, or ecological values that could be adversely affected by the project's construction or operation. The court will only enjoin specific activities of a water project if they pose a threat to public health, Native American artifacts, or historical values. Any challenge to a decision on project approval must follow specific requirements. No reimbursement required by this act as local agencies or school districts can levy charges to cover mandated services."
