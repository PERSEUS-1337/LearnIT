    "content": "The House and Senate Armed Services Committees annually review national defense authorization bills with provisions affecting military personnel, retirees, and their families. Differences between the two versions are resolved by a conference committee after passage by both chambers. Congressional staff receive numerous requests for information on these bills, and this report highlights personnel-related provisions. The report summarizes key personnel-related issues in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (FY2016 NDAA), comparing differences between House and Senate versions. The bill was passed by both chambers and signed by the President after an earlier version was vetoed. The President vetoed H.R. 1735, an earlier version of the FY2016 NDAA, due to concerns about exceeding defense spending caps. He later signed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-74) to address the issue. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-74) raised FY2016 spending caps for defense and nondefense. The revised NDAA, based on H.R. 1735, complied with the new spending caps and included military personnel provisions. The amended version of S. 1356 (revised FY2016 NDAA) was passed by Congress and signed by the President. The Budget Office issued cost estimates for bills on various dates in 2015. Related CRS products provide detailed background information and analysis. Some issues were previously addressed in the FY2015 National Defense Authorization Act. The authorized active duty end-strengths for FY2001 were Army (480,000), Navy (372,642), Marine Corps (172,600), and Air Force (357,000). Congress increased Army and Marine Corps personnel strength in response to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but began reversing these increases in anticipation of U.S. forces withdrawal from Iraq in 2011. The drawdown of U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, along with budget constraints, led to decreases in end-strengths for the Air Force and Navy since 2001. In FY2015, authorized end-strengths were: Army (490,000), Navy (323,600), Marine Corps (184,100), and Air Force (312,980). The Army plans to reduce active personnel to 420,000-450,000 by FY2017, while the Marine Corps plans to reduce to 175,000-182,000 by FY2019 due to budgetary constraints. The Administration's proposed end-strength reductions for the Army in FY2017-2019 are between 175,000 and 182,000. The Navy's proposed strength increases by 5,600, the Marine Corps decreases by 100, and the Air Force increases by 4,020 compared to FY2015 levels. The final bill authorizes end-strengths identical to the Administration's request, except for the Air Force, which is 3,715 higher. Section 402 of the initial Senate-passed bill aimed to repeal 10 U.S.C. 691, which sets minimum end-strengths for the armed forces. The initial Senate-passed bill (H.R. 1735) aimed to allow the Secretary of Defense to reduce personnel numbers in the armed forces below authorized end-strength levels. The final bill (P.L. 114-92 / S. 1356) allowed the Service Secretaries to decrease personnel numbers by up to 10% for certain purposes. It adjusted minimum end-strengths downward and expanded the Secretary of Defense's authority to reduce these minimum strengths by up to 2%. The overall authorized end strength of the Selected Reserves has declined by about 5% over the past 14 years, with reductions in Navy Reserve strength being a significant factor. Between FY2001 and FY2015, there were notable shifts in authorized end strengths for the Selected Reserves, with significant reductions in Navy Reserve (-35.5%), Air Force Reserve (-9.8%), and Coast Guard Reserve (-12.5%). Smaller changes occurred in the Air National Guard (-2.8%) and Army Reserve (-1.6%). For FY2016, the Administration proposed reductions in authorized Selected Reserve end strength for Army National Guard, Army Reserve, and Marine Corps Reserve, while increases were proposed for Navy Reserve, Air National Guard, and Air Force Reserve. No changes were proposed for the authorized strength of the Marine Corps Reserve. The administration proposed no change in the authorized strength for the Coast Guard Reserve, with end-strengths identical to the enacted bill. Congressional interest in recruiting and retaining high-quality personnel in the all-volunteer military remains a priority. The military pay raise is a focus of interest due to the annual increase in basic pay indexed to the Employment Cost Index. The FY2016 President's Budget requested a 1.3% raise, lower than the statutory formula of 2.3%. The Department of Defense plans to limit increases in basic pay through FY2020, with estimated ECI increases of 2.3% per year. The DOD Budget Request Overview stated that pay raises will be limited, with increases of 1.3% in FY 2017, 1.5% in FY 2018 and FY 2019, and 1.8% in FY 2020. The initial House bill did not specify the rate of increase in basic pay. The committee supports a 2.3 percent military pay raise for fiscal year 2016 to keep pace with private sector pay increases, as measured by the Employment Cost Index. The initial Senate version contained a provision setting the pay increase at 1.3% for servicemembers below the O-7 paygrade. The final bill for fiscal year 2016 contained no general pay raise provision, maintaining the 1.3% increase set by President Obama. The pay of generals and admirals was frozen at 2014 levels. The pay of generals and admirals was frozen at 2014 levels. Military retirement system provides monthly annuity after 20 years of service. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2013 established a Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission to provide recommendations for modernizing pay and benefits for the armed services. The Commission's final report was delivered to Congress on January 29, 2015, and many proposed changes were included in the enacted bill. The military retirement system is a significant incentive for retaining a career military force, and any changes are closely monitored by active duty military and veteran's groups. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) will change the military retirement system to a blended defined-benefit, defined-contribution system with reduced benefits and continuation pay at 12 years of service. Existing servicemembers and those entering before January 1, 2018 will be grandfathered into the current system. The military retirement system will be changed to a blended defined-benefit, defined-contribution system with reduced benefits and continuation pay at 12 years of service. Existing servicemembers prior to January 1, 2018 will be grandfathered into the current system, and those with less than 12 YOS on December 31, 2017 will be given the option to elect the new system. Cost of Living Allowance adjustments enacted by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 are repealed by this Act. The issue of sexual assault in the military has received significant attention from Congress and the media in recent years. The FY2014 DOD Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military revealed that 4.3% of women and 0.9% of men in the military experienced unwanted sexual contact in 2014. The final version of the bill included provisions on legal procedures, policies, programs, and data collection for military sexual assaults. In 2014, 4.3% of women and 0.9% of men in the military experienced unwanted sexual contact. Of those who reported it, 53% faced social retaliation, including adverse administrative action, professional retaliation, and punishment. The Government Accountability Office highlighted the need for the DOD to improve care for male sexual assault victims. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) addresses concerns about retaliation and male victims of sexual assault. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) addresses concerns about retaliation and male victims of sexual assault, enhancing the Special Victims' Counsel Program and modifying requirements for judicial proceedings, reporting, and sentencing in sex-related offenses. On January 24, 2013, the Department of Defense rescinded the 1994 Direct Combat Exclusion Rule to allow women in combat roles. By December 3, 2015, all military occupations were open to women with no exceptions. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 allowed women in combat roles, and subsequent legislation emphasized gender-neutral occupational performance standards for all military occupations. The FY2016 NDAA adds criteria for developing performance standards related to combat unit readiness, requiring DOD to validate unit-level performance. DOD must notify Congress of changes to assignment policies affecting females under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7652. The FY2016 NDAA shortens the waiting period for implementing changes to 30 days, providing a more definitive timeline for DOD and reducing Congress' review time. This change is related to combat unit readiness and assignment policies affecting females. The Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission found weaknesses in financial literacy programs for military servicemembers. Improving financial literacy could save the DOD between $13 million and $137 million annually and reduce troops involuntarily separated due to financial distress. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) includes provisions for financial literacy training for servicemembers at various career points due to life changes or transitions. This is in response to the need for improved financial management to prevent troops from being involuntarily separated due to financial distress. Enlistment requirements for the active component differ slightly from those for the reserve components. To enlist in the active component, an individual must be a U.S. national, lawful permanent resident, or covered under the Compact of Free Association. Service secretaries can make exceptions as needed. The MAVNI program allows exceptions for enlistment if deemed vital to national interest. Enlistment requirements for the active component include being a U.S. national, lawful permanent resident, or covered under the Compact of Free Association. Service secretaries can make exceptions as necessary. In 2004, Congress established the Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) to provide enhanced educational benefits to reservists called to active service. Four years later, the Post\u20109/11 GI Bill provided more generous benefits, leading to a recommendation to terminate REAP. The Commission recommended terminating REAP, allowing current recipients to exhaust benefits. The Senate bill established a sunset date for REAP and limited eligibility to those enrolled prior to enactment. The enacted bill contained the Senate provision. The Senate provision established a sunset date for REAP and limited eligibility to those enrolled prior to enactment. For more information on REAP and the Post 9/11 GI Bill, see CRS Report RL30802 and CRS Report R42785. Veterans and advocacy groups have requested an official ID card to verify military service. The Senate bill would provide a \"Recognition of Service ID Card\" to individuals leaving the Armed Forces, identifying them as veterans with a photo. The Secretary of Defense can negotiate discounts with national retail chains for cardholders. The enacted bill did not include a provision for a \"Recognition of Service ID Card\" for veterans. Instead, honorably discharged veterans can use state-issued ID cards to show their veteran status. This option is available in 44 states and the District of Columbia through driver's licenses or state ID cards. Additionally, since January 2014, separated members of the Uniformed Services can obtain an ID card for proof of military service through the DOD-VA eBenefits web. President Obama signed the Veterans Identification Card Act of 2015 into law, requiring the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide identification cards to veterans who demonstrate their military service. This law allows veterans to obtain ID cards through the joint DOD-VA eBenefits web portal. Congress is interested in recruiting and retaining high-quality personnel for the armed forces, using incentives like educational benefits and recruiting bonuses. Incentives like bonuses and educational benefits help attract qualified applicants to the military services. Chapter 5 of Title 37 of the United States Code contains a variety of bonus and incentive pay authorities. The House bill (H.R. 1735) authorizes service secretaries to develop additional recruitment incentives for officers, warrant officers, and enlisted personnel, subject to congressional review and approval. Section 522 of the enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) includes this provision. Section 522 of the enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) incorporated the House provision regarding recruitment incentives for military personnel. Reservists called into active federal service are eligible for legal protections, including the right to reemployment under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) of 1994. More information can be found in CRS Report RL32965. The USERRA of 1994 grants reemployment rights to those leaving civilian jobs for military service, with a five-year limit on cumulative service. Certain types of duty, such as reservist activations under Full Mobilization, Partial Mobilization, and Presidential Reserve Call-Up, are exempt from this limit. New mobilization authorities were created in 2011, allowing 120-day activations for reservists. The new activation authorities (10 U.S.C. 12304a and 12304b) allow 120-day activations for disaster response and 365-day activations for preplanned missions. Activations under these authorities are not currently exempt from the five-year cumulative limit on military service. Section 565 of H.R. 1735 would exempt military duty under these authorities from counting towards the limit for reemployment protection under USERRA. By statute, a veteran is defined as a person who served in the active military, naval, or air service under conditions other than dishonorable. Active military, naval, or air service is required for most VA benefits. Not all types of service are considered active. For more information on USERRA and mobilization authorities, refer to CRS Report RL30802. Active service for VA benefits includes full-time service in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, Public Health Service, or National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It also covers periods of active duty for training resulting in injury or death, as well as inactive duty for training leading to disability or death from an injury incurred. Members of the National Guard and reserves who are not activated for active duty military service do not meet the statutory definition of a veteran, even if they qualify for reserve retirement after 20 years of service. Reservists who complete the requirement for reserve retirement are eligible for retired pay but may not be considered veterans unless they have completed the required active service. The House-passed bill initially honored reservists as veterans without additional benefits, but this provision was not included in the enacted bill. The curr_chunk provides information on resources for veterans, including eligibility for benefits, burial benefits, retirement benefits for Reserve Component personnel, and points of contact for further assistance. The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act is mentioned in the background. The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 established a Career Intermission Program (CIP) allowing servicemembers to take up to 3 years off for personal reasons or career development without impacting their military progression. The Career Intermission Program (CIP) was initiated by the DOD to provide career flexibility for high-performing servicemembers and increase retention rates. Participants accept additional service obligations and DOD must report to Congress by March 1, 2016. The enacted bill would remove prohibitions on servicemembers taking time off without negatively impacting their military career progression. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) removes restrictions on program participation by Armed Forces members serving under an agreement or receiving a retention bonus. It eliminates limits on the number of participants in the program. Congress aims to improve recruitment, retention, and career management for the acquisition workforce. Improving the quality of the acquisition workforce requires additional incentives for high-performing military personnel and enhanced professional military education in acquisition. Military acquisition professionals oversee funding for defense programs, and there is interest in ensuring qualified personnel for acquisition duty assignments. The Goldwater-Nichols Act created incentives for officers to be educated and experienced in joint matters. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) extends joint duty credit to include service in acquisition-related assignments and allows officers to pursue a dual career track in combat arms and acquisition fields. The NDAA encourages the inclusion of acquisition matters in Phase II joint professional military education for successful performance in acquisition fields. Section 1585 of Title 10, United States Code authorizes the Secretary of Defense to regulate carrying firearms for DOD civilian employees and military servicemembers on military bases. Current DOD policies restrict carrying government-issued firearms to personnel on assigned duties, prohibiting military servicemembers from carrying personal firearms on military bases. Following recent active shooter incidents on military installations, there is a discussion about allowing military servicemembers to carry personal firearms on bases for enhanced force protection. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) would broaden servicemembers' authority to carry firearms for force protection. This initiative aims to give commanders more flexibility in establishing protocols for servicemembers to carry appropriate firearms. On April 19, 1995, a domestic terrorist bomb attack in Oklahoma City killed 168 people and injured over 650, including six servicemembers. These servicemembers are ineligible for the Purple Heart based on specific criteria. Servicemembers killed in the Oklahoma City bombing are ineligible for the Purple Heart. Supporters argue they should be eligible as victims of terrorism, while opponents say they were victims of domestic terrorism and do not qualify under current law. Eligibility was expanded in 2015 to include servicemembers wounded and killed in the 2009 terrorist attacks at Little Rock, AR and Fort Hood, TX. The 2009 shootings at Little Rock and Fort Hood were initially considered criminal acts, not terrorism. However, the NDAA for FY2015 expanded Purple Heart eligibility by redefining attacks by foreign terrorist organizations. This change addressed concerns about anti-Muslim implications. The NDAA for FY2015 expanded Purple Heart eligibility by redefining attacks by foreign terrorist organizations. The provision in Section 583 of the initial House-passed bill was not adopted, thus servicemembers who were victims of the Oklahoma City bombing will not be eligible for the Purple Heart under the enacted bill. The issue of military working dogs (MWDs) has received congressional and media attention over the years with Congress enacting laws related to the transfer and adoption of MWDs. In November 2000, Congress passed \"Robby's Law\" (P.L. 106-446) to end the euthanizing of military working dogs and facilitate their adoption by law enforcement agencies. The NDAA for FY2012 and FY2013 expanded eligibility for adopting military working dogs to include handlers, family members, and limited liability claims. Military working dogs were classified as \"equipment,\" and interested individuals paid for transportation of the dogs stateside. Congress passed the NDAA for FY2013 with a provision allowing retiring Military Working Dogs (MWDs) to be transferred to Lackland, Texas or another location for adoption. The current law does not require DOD to transfer retired MWDs overseas back to the United States. The enacted bill includes provisions requiring DOD to transfer retiring MWDs located overseas to the United States and give adoption priority to former handlers. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) requires all military working dogs to be retired only after they are returned to the United States, giving adoption priority to former handlers. Critics argue that the transfer of retiring MWDs from abroad will be costly without appropriated funds. The President's FY2015 budget proposed $1 billion in cuts to the Defense Commissary System over three years, starting with a $200 million reduction in FY2015. However, commissary funding was fully restored. The FY2015 NDAA added $100 million to the commissary budget to reverse the Administration's proposed $200 million reduction. The President's FY2016 budget suggested cutting $300 million in subsidies for commissaries, potentially reducing operating days and hours for patrons. Authorized patrons, including active duty military members, retired personnel, disabled veterans, and DOD civilians stationed overseas, receive reduced costs for goods and services at commissaries. The enacted bill requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a budget-neutral plan for the Defense Commissary Agency and military exchange system by March 1, 2016. The Secretary of Defense is required to submit a budget-neutral plan for the Defense Commissary Agency and military exchange system by March 1, 2016. The plan aims to achieve budget-neutrality by meeting set benchmarks such as customer service satisfaction, product quality, and sustaining discount savings for eligible patrons by October 1, 2018. It includes potential modifications like privatization, closure of redundant commissaries, pricing changes, and impact on Morale, Welfare, and Recreation programs. The Defense Secretary is required to consider the impact of modifications on Morale, Welfare, and Recreation programs, including reviewing management, food, and pricing options for the Defense Commissary Agency. This includes using variable pricing, offering more private label products, converting the system to a non-appropriated fund instrumentality, and reducing costs. The enacted bill requires a report on the Commissary Surcharge, Non-appropriated Fund, and Privately-Financed Major Construction Program to be submitted to the Committees on Armed Services within 180 days. In FY2015, the Authorization Act was authored by [author name scrubbed]. The Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission (MCRMC) released its Final Report on January 29, 2015. TRICARE is a health care program for uniformed servicemembers, retirees, dependents, and survivors. The Administration proposed changes in the FY2016 budget request, including replacing TRICARE Prime, Standard, and Extra with a consolidated plan and increasing copays for pharmaceuticals. The Administration proposed changes in the FY2016 budget request for TRICARE, including a consolidated health plan, increased copays for pharmaceuticals, and a new enrollment fee for future enrollees in the TRICARE-for-Life program. However, these proposals were not adopted, and recommendations for changes to TRICARE were not endorsed by the President or included in the final report of the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission. The Senate and House did not adopt proposed changes to TRICARE in H.R. 1735. Congress may consider future reforms cautiously to understand implications. The committee recommended improvements to ensure better access to healthcare in the Department of Defense. The Department of Defense is urged to improve access to care, deliver better health outcomes, enhance the care experience for beneficiaries, and control healthcare costs through provisions in the Act. This sets the foundation for future TRICARE modernization and reform legislation. Comprehensive reform of the military health care system is deemed essential, with a commitment to begin reforming it in fiscal year 2017 to improve access, quality, and care experience for all beneficiaries. The current military healthcare system needs to be reformed to improve access, quality, and cost effectiveness. Reevaluating all elements of the system and increasing fees and co-pays are necessary for comprehensive reform. The TRICARE pharmacy program allows outpatient prescriptions to be filled through military pharmacies, TRICARE mail-order pharmacy, and TRICARE retail network and non-network pharmacies. Active duty servicemembers have no pharmacy copayments when using military pharmacies or TRICARE retail network pharmacies. The TRICARE pharmacy program offers prescriptions through military pharmacies, TRICARE mail-order, and retail network pharmacies. Military pharmacies provide a 90-day supply of formulary medications for free. Generic medications are preferred over brand-name drugs. The 2015 NDAA allowed a one-time $3 increase in pharmacy copays and mandated refills for maintenance drugs to be filled through mail order or military pharmacies. The FY2016 budget proposed annual increases in pharmacy copayments. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) includes smaller copayment increases, with a one-time increase for retail and mail order prescriptions. Retail copays for generic drugs increased from $8 to $10, and for formulary brand name drugs from $20 to $24. Mail order copays increased from $16 to $20 for formulary drugs and for non-formulary drugs. The copay for formulary drugs increased from $16 to $20 and for non-formulary drugs from $46 to $49. CBO estimates that section 702 would reduce direct spending by about $1.5 billion over 10 years. Military health system quality was recently scrutinized in news articles. Last year, Secretary of Defense Hagel ordered a review of the military health system resulting in an action plan. Some Members of Congress are interested in its implementation. The initial Senate bill required actions to increase visibility of health quality metrics, costing $95 million over 2016-2020. The enacted bill is less demanding. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) is less demanding and presumably less costly. TRICARE covers various forms of birth control when prescribed by a TRICARE-authorized provider, addressing concerns about access to contraception for Service members. TRICARE covers various forms of birth control when prescribed by a TRICARE-authorized provider, including intrauterine devices, prescription contraceptives, and surgical sterilization. The enacted bill requires the Secretary of Defense to establish clinical access to contraception within one year. The bill (H.R. 1735) mandates the Secretary of Defense to establish clinical practice guidelines for DOD health care providers on contraception methods and counseling within one year. It also ensures that all women in the Armed Forces have access to comprehensive counseling on contraception methods."
