    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Detection Canine Augmentation Act of 2005\". The Congress recognizes the importance of detection canines in homeland security for detecting explosives, narcotics, concealed humans, and cadavers in various locations such as airports, ports, and stadiums. Detection canines are crucial in homeland security for detecting explosives, narcotics, concealed humans, and cadavers. They are used in situations where detection technologies are unavailable or not cost-effective. There is a shortage of detection canines available to assist law enforcement personnel, despite the authorization of 2,000 new Border Patrol agents each year without a corresponding increase in deployed canines. Detection canines are essential for homeland security, used in various agencies like Border Patrol, TSA, and urban search and rescue teams. Canines were effective during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Agencies like Customs and Border Protection, Secret Service, Coast Guard, and Federal Protective Service regularly utilize detection canines. The Subcommittee on Management, Integration, and Oversight of the Committee on Homeland Security held a hearing on the use of detection canines for homeland security activities. Various Federal agencies, a local transit police department, a private canine security company, and a university-based organization provided information at the hearing. There is a shortage of trained detection canines in a private canine security company and a university-based canine training center. SEC. 3. INCREASING THE NUMBER OF TRAINED DETECTION CANINES. In fiscal years 2007 through 2011, the Secretary of Homeland Security must increase the number of trained detection canines. This includes a 25% increase in trained canine detection teams at ports of entry, airports, and mass transit systems. Increase by at least 25% the number of trained detection canine teams for Coast Guard, Secret Service, Federal Protective Service, and FEMA to ensure availability during emergencies. SEC. 4. COORDINATION AND ENHANCEMENT OF CANINE TRAINING PROGRAMS. The Secretary of Homeland Security is responsible for coordinating canine training programs for various missions, utilizing existing resources efficiently, and exploring the use of canines trained by other entities. The Secretary of Homeland Security is tasked with coordinating canine training programs to increase the number of trained detection canines available to law enforcement agencies. A report must be submitted within 120 days detailing the Department's plan to consolidate and coordinate its training programs with other federal agencies. The Secretary of Homeland Security is responsible for coordinating canine training programs with other federal agencies like the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives in the Department of Justice. The Secretary of Homeland Security is tasked with increasing the use of domestically bred canines for counter-terrorism efforts, consulting with other agencies to encourage domestic breeding and consolidate procurement to reduce costs."
