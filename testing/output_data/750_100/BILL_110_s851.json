The term 'qualified tuition and related expenses' includes tuition and fees necessary for enrollment at an eligible educational institution for the taxpayer, spouse, or dependents eligible for a deduction under section 151. The qualified tuition and related expenses at an eligible educational institution include 50 percent of amounts paid for books, not exceeding $250 per taxable year.

If a taxpayer pays qualified tuition and related expenses for an academic period that begins during the calendar year, the expenses are treated differently if another taxpayer claims a deduction for the same individual in that year. For an academic period starting in the first 3 months after the taxable year, it will be considered as part of that taxable year. No double benefit is allowed for expenses eligible for both a credit and a deduction. Married individuals filing separately are not eligible for the credit unless they file a joint return. If the taxpayer and their spouse file a joint return for the taxable year, the section applies only if the taxpayer is a nonresident alien individual treated as a resident alien of the United States. Inflation adjustments affect the dollar limitation on the credit amount for taxable years after 2008. For taxable years after 2008, dollar amounts under subsection (a) will increase based on the cost-of-living adjustment determined for the calendar year, using 2007 as the base year for calculation. \"In taxable years after 2008, dollar amounts in subsection (b)(1)(B) will be rounded to the nearest multiple of $100. Income limits will be increased by the cost-of-living adjustment determined under section 1(f)(3).\" \"In taxable years after 2008, dollar amounts in subsection (b)(1)(B) will be rounded to the nearest multiple of $100.
