    "content": "Irrigation has been crucial for the development and economy of the United States, especially in the settlement of the West and agricultural recovery after the Dust Bowl. Technological advancements have revolutionized modern irrigated agriculture with tools like pumps, plastics, computers, and sensors. While irrigation has brought extensive benefits to the agricultural industry, there are also associated costs such as infrastructure like dams and conveyance facilities, as well as federal assistance programs. Irrigation in the United States involves dams, conveyance facilities, federal assistance programs, and impacts on water users and the environment. Water withdrawals and consumption are key measurements of irrigation water use. Irrigation is the second-largest source of water withdrawals in the US after thermoelectric power. Since 2005, irrigation withdrawals in the United States have decreased by 23% since their peak in 1980, with a 9% drop from 2005 to 2010. However, it is uncertain if this decline in withdrawals has led to reduced water consumption due to improved irrigation efficiency. Changes in irrigated land vary by region, with only four western states seeing an increase since 2003 while the rest have experienced reductions. Since the 1980s, farmers in the United States have shifted from gravity irrigation to pressurized sprinklers and microirrigation. This change has been especially notable in 17 western states, where gravity irrigation decreased from 62% to 30% of irrigated acres by 2013. Seven eastern states, including Delaware, Georgia, and Tennessee, saw a 50% increase in irrigated acres. In the West, irrigated land increased by 1.7 million acres while applied irrigation water decreased by over 1.37 million acre-feet. Since the 1980s, farmers in the United States have shifted from gravity irrigation to pressurized sprinklers and microirrigation. In the West, irrigated land increased by 1.7 million acres while applied irrigation water declined by over 1.37 million acre-feet. There have been fluctuations in irrigation water application over time, with a decline in water application starting in 1998. Groundwater withdrawals have increased by over 740,000 AF, while irrigation withdrawals remain highest in the western-most portions of the United States. Since 1984, irrigated land in eastern states has grown by over 8.7 million acres, with groundwater being the primary source for irrigation. Withdrawals peaked in 2008, increasing by 4.3 million AF since 2003. This growth is attributed to higher commodity prices, droughts, and easy access to groundwater, leading to environmental concerns due to declining aquifer levels. \"Irrigation efficiency refers to the beneficial use of applied water, considering factors like system performance, water application uniformity, and crop response. Evapotranspiration rates, influenced by climate conditions, play a key role in determining irrigation efficiency.\" Efficient irrigation systems are crucial for crop water requirements, influenced by factors like wind speed and canopy development. Water conveyance systems also impact irrigation efficiency, with poorly constructed canals leading to significant conveyance losses. While efficient systems aim to conserve water, studies have shown that they may actually increase water consumption in some cases. Subsidies for drip irrigation have been studied to understand their impact on water conservation. Increasing water conservation subsidies for drip irrigation in the Upper Rio Grande Basin would boost water consumption, crop yield, and irrigated acreage. It is uncertain if this expanded irrigation trend is nationwide. Microirrigation is more efficient than gravity irrigation, but the latter typically uses less water due to water return through runoff and deep percolation. Efficient irrigation technologies may not always lead to less water consumption overall, as they could encourage farmers to grow more profitable, water-intensive crops. Irrigation systems are classified into pressure systems and gravity systems based on energy and pressure requirements. Pressure requirements categorize irrigation methods into pressure systems and gravity systems, delivering water to crops. Precision technologies enhance efficiency and reduce costs in modern irrigation systems. Best management practices focus on water management, conveyance, scheduling, and application methods on farms. The BMPs discussed are based on select practices identified by USDA's NRCS for irrigation systems. Not all technologies are considered BMPs, and success depends on various factors and multiple practices may be needed. Pressure systems pump water through tubing or pipes to apply water to crops through sprinklers or perforated pipes. Pressure irrigation systems, including sprinkler and microirrigation systems, are commonly used in the United States, making up roughly 58-65% of irrigation systems. Sprinkler irrigation uses high- to medium-pressure systems to spray water through applicators, while microirrigation applies water directly to the root zone of crops. Major pressure systems include center pivot, linear move tower, solid set, slide roll, big gun, hand move, and drip systems. Pressure irrigation systems like sprinkler and microirrigation are efficient for growing crops. An irrigation water management plan is essential to maintain soil moisture levels, reduce erosion, and increase water efficiency. This plan may include various irrigation BMPs such as microirrigation, sprinkler irrigation, ditch lining, and land leveling. Initial investment costs for these systems can be high, but they require low operational labor. Sprinkler and microirrigation are efficient pressure irrigation systems for crops. They include various BMPs like ditch lining and land leveling. Sprinkler systems spray water over crops for soil moisture, cooling, frost protection, and dust control. Microirrigation is a low-pressure, efficient method with types like surface drip and sub-surface drip irrigation. LEPA irrigation systems enhance standard center pivot systems by applying water directly to crop root zones through nozzles placed close to the soil surface, reducing evaporation losses and energy consumption. Gravity irrigation systems divert water to flood crop areas via land-forming measures like canals, ditches, basins, and furrows. Gravity irrigation systems utilize various land-forming measures such as canals, ditches, basins, and furrows to flood crop areas. While controlled flooding methods like basin, border, and furrow irrigation increase efficiencies, uncontrolled flooding is the simplest form of irrigation. Gravity systems are generally less efficient than pressure systems, with varying initial investment costs and operational labor requirements. These systems are suitable for close-growing crops like rice, while furrow irrigation can be used for row crops such as potatoes and corn. Land leveling is the process of reshaping a field for irrigation purposes. Land leveling reshapes fields for uniform water application to crops, increasing irrigation efficiency and preventing soil water logging. Irrigation ditch lining limits water loss during transit to crop areas. Canal linings improve conveyance efficiency based on soil type. Canal linings, such as concrete, PVC, and polypropylene, increase conveyance efficiency based on soil type. Tailwater recovery systems reuse excess water from gravity irrigation to prevent water contamination. Irrigation reservoirs store water for irrigation use. Irrigation reservoirs are built to store water for irrigation purposes. Precision technologies like satellite data and drones have improved irrigation efficiency and reduced input costs in agriculture. Technology companies are increasingly involved in the agricultural sector. Technology companies are collaborating with NASA and USDA to gather soil moisture data worldwide using the SMAP satellite, which transmits data through a functioning radiometer despite radar issues. This data can help governments and farmers make informed decisions. Governments and agricultural producers can use data from unmanned aerial vehicles, sensor networks, and data analytics to make informed decisions on irrigation water management. This information can be used to adjust irrigation practices and automate irrigation systems. The use of data from unmanned aerial vehicles, sensor networks, and data analytics can improve irrigation decisions. Information gathered can be used for automated irrigation systems, adjusting water application based on weather data. Remote monitoring systems transfer real-time information to optimize irrigation operations and reduce water usage. Poly-pipe is utilized in furrow irrigation for flexibility. Poly-pipe in furrow irrigation uses computer software to optimize hole sizes, reducing water usage and runoff. Implementing irrigation BMPs increases efficiency and precision, lowering production costs and ensuring even watering. Irrigated yields are typically double that of non-irrigated crops, allowing for higher value crops and extended growing seasons. Irrigation BMPs optimize water usage, reduce costs, and prevent overwatering issues, allowing for the production of higher-value specialty crops. The controlled environment of irrigation systems also enables the simultaneous application of nutrients and pesticides, further enhancing crop yields. Efficient irrigation systems can reduce costs and provide precise application of nutrients and pesticides. Implementation choices in the United States are influenced by factors like cost, crop type, climate, soil, labor, and water quality. Adoption of these systems is often driven by potential economic gains from increased crop yield rather than water conservation. Efficient irrigation systems can lead to economic gains through increased crop yield. High-value crop growers are more likely to adopt costly drip irrigation systems, while low-value crop growers may not invest in such systems due to financial constraints. The USDA's 2013 Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey found that some respondents couldn't finance system improvements, and others felt the costs wouldn't be covered. High-efficiency systems like micro sprinklers and sub-surface drip can be more expensive than gravity systems like furrow irrigation. The cost of developing a water supply for irrigation systems can be significant, impacting producers' decisions on adopting efficient pressure systems. Groundwater supply development is generally more expensive than surface water, leading to the prevalence of high-efficiency pressure systems in groundwater-reliant areas. Areas with heavy reliance on groundwater tend to adopt efficient irrigation systems, while areas with adequate surface water supplies may opt for gravity irrigation due to lower development costs. Growers in drought-prone regions relying on surface water are more likely to use efficient systems. The type of crop also influences irrigation system choice, with high-pressure sprinklers better for perennial tree crops and drip systems for close-growing crops like rice. Recent survey data in the United States reveals that many farmers face challenges in adopting more efficient irrigation systems due to factors like crop type, physical field conditions, and local climate. For example, drip and surface irrigation are more effective in windy conditions, while sprinkler irrigation is subject to high evaporation levels in arid climates. In arid climates, sprinkler irrigation faces high evaporation levels and subsurface irrigation can lead to soil salinity issues. Climate conditions impact crop evapotranspiration rates, influencing the choice of irrigation system. Soil type also plays a role, with sandy soils requiring sprinkler or microirrigation due to high infiltration rates, while loam and clay soils can accommodate various irrigation methods. Clay soils, however, have low infiltration rates, making them ideal for certain irrigation systems. Irrigation water management planning utilizes soil surveys to evaluate soil characteristics for designing irrigation systems. Gravity irrigation is ideal for clay soils with low infiltration rates, but it can be labor-intensive compared to pressure systems. Highly automated sprinkler and drip systems require technical knowledge and less labor than gravity systems. Water quality and quantity are key factors in choosing an irrigation system. Gravity irrigation is best for sediment-heavy water, while sprinkler or drip systems are better for managing salinity and selenium levels. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act addresses water quality concerns in various bodies of water. The Clean Water Act aims to improve water quality in the nation's bodies of water. Agriculture benefits from these efforts, although water rights laws largely determine water availability for farmers. The federal government offers financial and technical assistance to agricultural producers. The federal government provides financial and technical assistance to agricultural producers for adopting irrigation Best Management Practices (BMPs) through programs like EQIP, CSP, and AMA. These programs support producers in implementing conservation practices according to predefined guidelines. Between 2009 and 2014, $564 million out of $1.2 billion in funding for irrigation BMPs went towards sprinkler and microirrigation systems. California and Texas received the most funding, with several southeastern states also in the top 10. Increasing irrigation efficiency may impact groundwater recharge and aquifer depletion. The High Plains, Mississippi Embayment, and Central Valley aquifers in the United States are being depleted at unsustainable rates, accounting for 93% of groundwater depletion from 2000 to 2008. It is unclear if irrigation BMP funding is helping to reduce groundwater depletion or exacerbating the problem. The Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) provides financial and technical assistance for irrigation BMPs. The Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) funds BMPs, CAPs, and CIG for irrigation water management. CSP provides funding for irrigation BMPs based on conservation performance, including precision technologies like regional weather networks. The USDA provides financial and technical assistance for the adoption of irrigation technologies, including precision technologies like regional weather networks, irrigation system automation, and remote monitoring. Agricultural Management Assistance (AMA) funds similar irrigation BMPs as EQIP but is limited to 16 states with low participation in the Federal Crop Insurance program. Conservation Technical Assistance (CTA) helps irrigators adopt conservation plans through a national network of conservationists. While CTA does not provide financial assistance, the plans developed can qualify for financial assistance programs. CTA is available to farmers and supporting groups. USDA provides information resources to irrigators through the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), Economic Research Service (ERS), and National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), with ARS focusing on scientific research related to irrigation BMPs. The Economic Research Service (ERS) and National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) are key sources of economic information and funding for agricultural research, including irrigation management and water conservation studies in the United States. NIFA-funded grant programs related to irrigation include the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) Water for Agriculture Challenge Area and the National Water Quality Program (NWQP). Limited national-level monitoring and reporting efforts exist for irrigation. The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) provide comprehensive data on irrigation water use, but comparisons are challenging due to different methodologies and reporting schedules. NASS conducts surveys of producers to compile data on the U.S. agriculture industry, including the Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey every five years. The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) and the United States Geological Survey (USGS) conduct surveys every five years to assess irrigated agriculture and water use in the United States. The USGS evaluates trends in water use categories, including irrigation. Additionally, irrigation practices eligible for funding from the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) are outlined in appendices. Sprinkler systems like center pivot, side roll, and linear move tower irrigation qualify for funding from NRCS EQIP. These systems spray water over crops for soil moisture, cooling, frost protection, and dust control. Microirrigation involves low-pressure, low-volume irrigation near plant roots. A pipeline is used to convey water for irrigation. A pipeline is built to convey water to an irrigation system or storage area with minimal water loss. A pumping plant delivers water at a set pressure and flow rate based on conservation needs. Irrigation land leveling reshapes land to increase irrigation efficiency and prevent erosion. Water wells extract groundwater from aquifers. In planning irrigation systems, neighboring wells, groundwater overdraft, and impacts on cultural, archaeological, or scientific resources should be evaluated. Structures for water control include flashboard risers, check dams, division boxes, water measurement devices, and pipe drop inlets. Irrigation reservoirs are built to provide a reliable water supply for irrigation, and efficient water management is essential for planning. Irrigation Water Management involves planning efficient irrigation volume, frequency, and application rate to manage soil moisture and promote plant growth. Irrigation scheduling is crucial for water management. An Irrigation System, Surface and Subsurface, includes earthwork, pipelines, and water-control structures to convey water while reducing water loss, erosion, energy use, and water quality issues. Irrigation Ditch Lining is a lining made of impervious material to improve water conveyance, reduce water loss, prevent erosion, and maintain water quality. Tailwater Recovery facilities capture irrigation runoff for reuse, while Diversion Dams redirect surface water. Irrigation Field Ditches convey water to irrigation areas, and Irrigation Canals deliver water efficiently. Code 320 involves creating a permanent channel to deliver water efficiently to irrigation areas, with lining required for soil of rapid permeability. Code 118 implements an irrigation water management plan to optimize crop yield, reduce water contamination, and conserve energy. Code 134 focuses on transitioning to dryland farming for sustainable crop yield and water conservation. The Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) offers funding for irrigation practices focused on crop yield sustainability and water conservation. Regional Weather Networks provide data for irrigation scheduling based on crop evapotranspiration, precipitation, and soil moisture. Irrigation System Automation utilizes GPS-guided technology to adjust water application rates according to field conditions. The Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) offers funding for irrigation practices focused on crop yield sustainability and water conservation. Water application rates are adjusted based on field conditions like soil, topography, and crop type. Irrigation Pumping Plant Evaluation assesses energy efficiency and suggests modifications to reduce energy consumption and water use. Remote Monitoring Notification system provides real-time information to operators for maintenance prioritization. Decrease Irrigation Water Quantity or Conversion to Nonirrigated Crop Production is also a recommended practice. Irrigation practices in the Conservation Stewardship Program focus on water conservation and energy efficiency. Practices include reducing irrigation water quantity, using mulch for moisture conservation, high-level irrigation water management, and removing end guns from center pivot irrigation systems. End Gun Removal \u2014 WQT10 involves removing an end gun sprinkler from a center pivot system to improve irrigation coverage. Low Energy Precision Application Irrigation \u2014 WQT11 converts standard systems to LEPA systems for water conservation. Computerized Hole Selection for Poly-Pipe \u2014 WQT12 optimizes hole sizes for poly-pipe used in furrow irrigation. Resource Conserving Crop Rotation (RRCR) \u2014 CCR99 includes a perennial grass to reduce erosion, improve soil fertility, interfere with pest cycles, and reduce water application. Improved Resource Conserving Crop Rotation \u2014 CCR98 enhances RRCR. Enhanced Resource Conserving Crop Rotation (CCR98) further reduces erosion, improves soil fertility, interferes with pest cycles, and reduces soil moisture depletion and water application.
