    "content": "Prior to 1996, health insurance coverage for mental illness was historically less generous than for physical illnesses, with lower limits, fewer covered services, and increased cost sharing. Mental health parity aims to equalize insurance coverage for mental health services with medical and surgical benefits. Policymakers have developed approaches to achieve parity, focusing on mandating coverage and requiring equal coverage. Mental health parity laws may mandate coverage for certain mental illnesses and require parity coverage. Policies can take a full parity approach with both mandates and parity coverage, a minimum mandated benefit approach with mandates but no parity coverage, or a mandated offering parity approach with parity coverage but no mandates. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements by mandating offering parity approach, ensuring compliance with coverage of mental health and medical benefits. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements by creating a mandated benefit for coverage of certain mental health and substance abuse disorder services in specific financing arrangements. It does not include an explicit coverage mandate for mental health services at the federal level but contains provisions that mandate coverage for certain plans. Additionally, the ACA does not modify the federal mental health parity requirements themselves but expands their applicability to specific financing arrangements. The federal mental health parity requirements were established by two laws, MHPA and MHPAEA, which mandate parity in various aspects of coverage. These laws do not require coverage of specific mental health conditions but ensure parity in treatment limitations, financial requirements, and covered benefits for mental health services. Recent data shows that many employers have adjusted their benefits in response to MHPAEA, with some choosing to eliminate limits on mental health coverage while others have increased utilization management. The ACA also mandates coverage of mental health and substance use disorder services for certain plans. The MHPA (P.L. 104-204) was the first federal mental health parity law, employing a mandated offering parity approach with no coverage mandates but requiring partial parity. It mandates that annual and aggregate lifetime dollar limits on mental health services coverage be no less than those for medical and surgical services under group health plans and health insurance issuers offering group health coverage. The impact of these requirements on plans' decisions to retain or drop mental health and substance use disorder services coverage once fully implemented in 2014 is uncertain. The MHPA mandates that mental health coverage must be on par with medical and surgical services under group health plans. It amends federal laws to ensure parity in coverage, with exemptions for small employers and cost increases. MHPAEA expands mental health parity requirements at the federal level, including substance use disorders. It requires parity in treatment limitations, financial requirements, and in- and out-of-network benefits. MHPAEA expands federal mental health parity requirements, including substance use disorders, and amends small employer exemptions and cost parameters. These requirements do not apply to the individual market or Medicaid managed care. The ACA extends federal mental health parity requirements to Medicaid managed care and CHIP plans, but not to Medicare. It mandates coverage of specified mental health services by certain plan types. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to include qualified health plans, Medicaid non-managed care benchmark plans, and individual market plans. It also modifies existing parity law to ensure compliance with federal mental health parity requirements for plans offered through the individual market. The small employer exemption in federal parity law remains in effect and was expanded under the ACA. Starting in 2014, QHPs purchased through an Exchange must cover mental health services and comply with federal mental health parity requirements. The interaction between this requirement and the small employer exemption raises considerations for rulemaking. Medicaid benchmark plans offering mental health services must also comply with parity requirements. The ACA mandates compliance with federal mental health parity requirements for plans offering mental health services. This includes QHPs, Medicaid benchmark plans, and new plans in the individual and small group markets. The applicability of parity requirements to CHIP plans is also explained. The ACA mandates coverage for mental health and substance abuse services in QHPs, Medicaid benchmark plans, and new plans in individual and small group markets. The federal mental health parity law requires full parity for these services when offered, but does not include a coverage mandate. The ACA mandates coverage for essential health benefits (EHB) in various types of plans, including QHPs, Medicaid benchmark plans, and plans in the small and individual group market. QHPs are defined in Section 1301 and are required to provide EHB as defined in Section 1302. The ACA mandates coverage for essential health benefits (EHB) in various types of plans, including QHPs, Medicaid benchmark plans, and plans in the small and individual group market. The EHB are broadly defined by ACA Section 1302(b) to include mental health and substance abuse services as a category of covered services. Coverage must be provided for services within all 10 broad categories outlined in the statute. The ACA mandates coverage for essential health benefits (EHB) in various plans, including QHPs, Medicaid benchmark plans, and small/individual group market plans. EHB include mental health and substance abuse services within 10 broad categories. Plans must offer EHB by January 1, 2014, as required by ACA Section 2001(c) and PHSA Section 2707(a). The ACA mandates coverage of essential health benefits, including mental health services, in various plans by January 1, 2014. While not a comprehensive federal mandate, these provisions create a requirement for mental health benefits coverage by a significant portion of insurers. Some states also mandate coverage of certain mental health conditions through parity laws. The ACA mandates coverage of essential health benefits, including mental health services, in various plans by January 1, 2014. States can require additional benefits beyond EHB, but must cover the cost. Requiring mental health and substance abuse services in QHPs is separate from parity coverage, which is mandated by ACA Section 1311(j) for all QHPs. The ACA mandates mental health parity requirements for all Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) in the small group and individual markets. Large group plans may have less incentive to participate in Exchanges due to risk pooling benefits. Small employers are exempt from federal mental health parity requirements, impacting some Exchange plans. The ACA mandates mental health parity requirements for all Qualified Health Plans in the small group and individual markets. Small employers are exempt from federal mental health parity requirements, impacting some Exchange plans. The interaction between ACA Section 1311(j) and the small employer exemption in federal mental health parity law is discussed in detail. The ACA extends federal mental health parity requirements to the individual market, including self-employed individuals. The small employer exemption in federal mental health parity law may still apply despite the ACA conforming amendment. The small employer exemption under federal mental health parity law may still apply despite the ACA conforming amendment, which extends federal mental health parity requirements to the individual market, including self-employed individuals. The definition of \"small employer\" at PHSA Section 2791(e)(4) has been clarified. The small employer exemption under federal mental health parity law may still apply to a wider range of employers, with the definition of \"small employer\" expanded to include those who employed an average of at least 1, but not more than 100, employees. States have the option until 2016 to use the previous definition for plans offered through an Exchange. The small employer exemption under federal mental health parity law may apply to a wider range of employers, with the definition of \"small employer\" expanded to include those who employed an average of at least 1, but not more than 100, employees. Questions may arise regarding compliance with federal mental health parity requirements for plans offered to individuals seeking coverage on the individual market versus plans offered to single individuals seeking group coverage as an employer. The ACA does not specify if small employer QHPs are exempt from federal mental health parity requirements under Section 1311(j). Medicaid can be offered in traditional state plan benefits or by enrolling state-specified groups in benchmark plans. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements for Medicaid managed care plans, including those offered through traditional Medicaid or benchmark plans. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to certain Medicaid benchmark plans, requiring compliance with parity requirements for treatment limitations and financial requirements. Medicaid benchmark plans must comply with federal mental health parity requirements for treatment limitations and financial requirements, excluding aggregate lifetime and annual limits. Plans offering EPSDT services meet the parity requirement, but Medicaid managed care plans do not automatically comply. Plans that are not Medicaid managed care plans are not required to comply with federal mental health parity requirements for limits and covered benefits, unlike Medicaid managed care plans. It is unclear if these requirements extend to non-managed care plans under traditional Medicaid. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to all \"newly eligible\" Medicaid populations, including those enrolled through benchmark or benchmark-equivalent non-managed care plans. The CHIP statute contains provisions extending federal mental health parity requirements to CHIP plans, which may need to be updated to align with the ACA. Specifically, SSA Section 2103(c)(6) requires compliance with PHSA Section 2705 for plans offering mental health/substance abuse and medical/surgical benefits. The CHIP statute requires compliance with PHSA Section 2705 for plans offering mental health/substance abuse and medical/surgical benefits, similar to ACA Section 2001 for Medicaid non-managed care benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans. SSA Section 2103(c)(6)(B) deems CHIP plans offering EPSDT as satisfying the parity requirement. The CHIP statute requires compliance with PHSA Section 2705 for plans offering mental health/substance abuse and medical/surgical benefits. SSA Section 2103(c)(6)(A) raises uncertainty about whether offering EPSDT services fulfills the full set of federal mental health parity requirements. Additionally, SSA Section 2103(f)(2) mandates compliance with all requirements of subpart 2 of part A of Title XXVII of the PHSA for coverage under SSA Section 2103. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to plans in the individual market, QHPs, and certain Medicaid plan types. It mandates coverage of specific mental health services for certain plan types, although not a comprehensive federal-level coverage mandate. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to plans in the individual market, QHPs, and certain Medicaid plan types, but maintains the small employer exemption. Federal mental health parity requirements are extended to all qualified health plans, with questions about the impact on small employer plans in the Exchange. Certain requirements are also extended to Medicaid non-managed care benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to plans in the individual market, QHPs, and certain Medicaid plan types. It is unclear if federal mental health parity requirements extend to non-managed care plans offered under traditional Medicaid. The CHIP statute contains two separate parity-related provisions, with one having a more limited reach and the other applying requirements in their entirety to CHIP plans."
