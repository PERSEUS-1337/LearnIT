    "content": "Under the OCSLA, the DOI must create five-year programs for oil and gas lease sales in U.S. waters, balancing energy supply and environmental protection. The BOEM leads this process, which involves multiple drafts for public review and comment. The DOI creates five-year programs for oil and gas lease sales in U.S. waters under the OCSLA. The process involves examining all available leasing areas, narrowing down based on economic and environmental analysis, and submitting the final schedule to the President and Congress for approval. The planning process includes a programmatic environmental impact statement (PEIS) as required by NEPA to assess potential environmental impacts from oil and gas exploration and development. The PEIS addresses potential environmental impacts from oil and gas exploration, considers alternatives, and incorporates public comments. The Administration cannot revise a finalized program without restarting the development process, but scheduled sales could potentially be canceled during implementation based on environmental review requirements. The final oil and gas leasing program for 2017-2022 was approved by former Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell on January 17, 2017. The program includes 11 lease sales on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), with 10 in the Gulf of Mexico region and 1 in the Alaska region. Sales in the Atlantic and Pacific regions were not included in the final program. The leasing decisions in BOEM's five-year programs may impact the economy and environment of coastal states and the nation. Congress is typically involved in the planning process, although they do not have approval authority. Members of Congress can influence the program by submitting public comments during formal comment periods. Members of Congress can influence BOEM's five-year offshore oil and gas leasing programs by submitting public comments, evaluating the program in oversight hearings, and introducing legislation to set or alter program terms. The 114th Congress pursued these types of influence with respect to the proposed program for 2017-2022. The report discusses the history and legal framework of the programs, BOEM's development process, previous programs, and the analysis of the program for 2017-2022. Congress plays a role in oversight and legislation related to the program. In 1953, Congress enacted laws addressing jurisdiction and rights off the US coasts, including regulation of oil and gas exploration. The Submerged Lands Act grants coastal states rights up to 3 geographical miles from their coasts, while the OCSLA defines offshore jurisdiction. The OCSLA defines offshore jurisdiction as all submerged lands lying seaward of state coastal waters subject to US jurisdiction. Its primary purpose is to expedite OCS resource development while ensuring environmental protection and meeting national energy goals. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments of 1978 added new provisions to the OCSLA, including Section 18 mandating the creation of an OCS leasing program to meet national energy needs for a five-year period. These programs, starting in 1980, set schedules for lease auctions, shaping OCS oil and gas exploration and production. The OCSLA has undergone amendments since 1978, with Congress taking actions to alter offshore oil and gas exploration. Acts like the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995 and the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 aimed to encourage exploration and production in specific regions. The OCSLA has undergone amendments since 1978, with Congress taking actions to alter offshore oil and gas exploration. Acts like the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995 and the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 aimed to encourage exploration and production in specific regions. Congress also placed a moratorium on leasing in certain regions and created a mechanism for revenue sharing with Gulf states and the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Legislative actions removed barriers to leasing in certain OCS regions, shaping subsequent five-year programs. The statutory framework governing BOEM's development of offshore oil and gas leasing programs includes OCSLA, NEPA, and CZMA. Section 18 of the OCSLA mandates the Secretary of the Interior to prepare and maintain an oil and gas leasing program that aligns with national energy needs for a five-year period. The program must consider economic, social, and environmental values of the OCS resources, as well as the potential impact of oil and gas activities. The OCSLA mandates the Secretary of the Interior to consider economic, social, and environmental values of OCS resources and the impact of oil and gas activities. Section 18 directs the scheduling of exploration and production based on various factors, including geographical, geological, and ecological characteristics, environmental considerations, and state laws and policies. The OCSLA mandates the Secretary of the Interior to consider economic, social, and environmental values of OCS resources and the impact of oil and gas activities. Leasing under the five-year program must assure fair market value and include estimates on appropriations and staffing needs. Consultation requirements include input from interested Federal agencies and State Governors. The OCSLA mandates consultation with the Federal Trade Commission and State Governors for proposed programs. The Secretary may also consult with local government officials. The proposed program must be submitted to the governor of each affected state for comments at least 60 days prior to publication in the Federal Register. The Attorney General, in coordination with the Federal Trade Commission, can submit comments on potential effects. The OCSLA requires consultation with the Federal Trade Commission and State Governors for proposed programs. The Secretary must submit the proposed program to Congress and the President at least 60 days before approval, along with an explanation for any rejected recommendations. The Secretary can then approve a final five-year program and revise it at any time with a mandated review process. The OCSLA mandates consultation with the Federal Trade Commission and State Governors for proposed programs. The Secretary must submit the program to Congress and the President 60 days before approval, with an explanation for rejected recommendations. BOEM carries out the Secretary's responsibilities for the five-year program, including consultation requirements with affected states. BOEM must request input from governors on laws, goals, and policies to consider. Regulations also require publication of the proposed program in the Federal Register. The five-year planning process for the OCSLA involves consultation with the Federal Trade Commission and State Governors, submission to Congress and the President, and publication in the Federal Register. NEPA and CZMA also play a role, requiring detailed environmental impact statements and consideration of alternatives for major federal actions. The agency prepares an environmental impact statement (EIS) for major federal actions without conducting an Environmental Assessment (EA). BOEM assumes the significance of the impact of its five-year programs on the environment and prepares a programmatic EIS (PEIS) concurrently with the program. States under the CZMA are encouraged to enact coastal zone management plans for protection coordination. The CZMA encourages states to enact coastal zone management plans for habitat and resource protection. Approved state programs can receive federal assistance and must address water pollution sources. Federal activities must comply with state programs. The BOEM regulations governing the five-year program require consideration of coastal zone management programs developed by affected states. BOEM requests information on the relationship between state programs and OCS oil and gas activities from governors and the Secretary of Commerce before developing the leasing program. The development of a five-year program by BOEM typically spans two to three years with multiple drafts published for review. The BOEM regulations governing the five-year program require consideration of coastal zone management programs developed by affected states. The development of a five-year program typically spans over two or three years with successive drafts published for review and comment. The program goes through various stages of consultation with state governors, federal agencies, Congress, and the President. Each step involves public comment and environmental review. Individual lease sales and companies' exploration and development plans also undergo environmental review and public comment. Figure 1 outlines the steps from program development to oil and gas production in an individual well. The five-year program for oil and gas leasing undergoes multiple drafts and reviews, with the initial draft examining all planning areas and public input to develop a schedule of proposed lease sales. Subsequent drafts focus on analyzing and reviewing specific areas listed in the initial schedule, with the possibility of removing proposed sales based on targeted analysis by BOEM. BOEM may remove proposed sales in the final version of the five-year program but will not add new sales without additional environmental reviews. The process begins with a Request for Information in the Federal Register to gather input on energy needs, leasing interests, and environmental concerns. The BOEM published a Request for Information (RFI) for the 2017-2022 leasing program, receiving over half a million comments. Based on this feedback, they released a draft proposed program (DPP) outlining lease sales for the next five years. The DPP is the first step towards the final program, with BOEM analyzing all OCS planning. The BOEM published a Draft Proposed Program (DPP) for the 2017-2022 leasing program, which includes a preliminary list of areas proposed for lease sales over the next five years. The DPP also outlines a schedule for the proposed sales and seeks public input through a scoping process. BOEM received over 1 million comments on the DPP. The BOEM published a Proposed Program (PP) for the 2017-2022 leasing program, refining lease sale areas based on required factors and public comments. The PP was submitted to Congress, state governors, and federal agencies for review and public feedback. The BOEM published the Proposed Program (PP) for the 2017-2022 leasing program, accompanied by a draft PEIS for OCS areas. The final document, the Proposed Final Program (PFP), is based on analysis of OCSLA factors and public comments, submitted to the President and Congress for review. The BOEM published the Proposed Program (PP) for the 2017-2022 leasing program, accompanied by a draft PEIS for OCS areas. The final document, the Proposed Final Program (PFP), is submitted to the President and Congress for review for a period of at least 60 days. The Secretary of the Interior may approve the PFP after the review period. The Secretary of the Interior may approve the PFP, which becomes final and is published as a record of decision. Former Secretary Sally Jewell approved the final program for 2017-2022 on January 17, 2017. Since 1980, eight five-year programs have been submitted to Congress and have taken effect after the 60-day review period required by the OCSLA. The 2012-2017 offshore oil and gas leasing program reflected Obama Administration policies post-Deepwater Horizon spill. It included 15 proposed lease sales, with 12 in the Gulf of Mexico and 3 in Alaska (2 later canceled). The 2007-2012 offshore oil and gas leasing program was prepared by the George W. Bush Administration and later resubmitted by the Obama Administration in 2010. It included 21 sales initially, with a revised schedule following a court order in 2009. The 2002-2007 OCS oil and gas leasing plan was submitted to Congress in 2002 under former Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton. It consisted of a schedule of 20 lease sales, 15 of which were held before the program expired in June 2007. The 1992-1997 program for oil and gas leasing was presented to Congress in 1992 under former Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujan. It included a schedule of 18 sales, with 12 sales held before the program expired in June 1997. The 1997-2002 program was submitted to Congress in 1996 under former Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt, listing 16 sales, with 12 held before the program expired in June 2002. The 1980-1992 oil and gas leasing programs were presented to Congress under different administrations, reflecting their energy policies. The programs included multiple lease sales, with a total of 106 sales held before the last program expired in June 1997. The 1980-1992 oil and gas leasing program, presented to Congress in April 1980 under President Carter's \"Energy Message,\" included 36 proposed sales, with 12 held. This program succeeded the pre-1980 leasing program that spanned almost 30 years. The BOEM released the final offshore oil and gas leasing program for 2017-2022, scheduling 11 lease sales in specific regions of the OCS. The program includes four OCS regions - Gulf of Mexico, Alaska, Atlantic, and Pacific. Lease sales are planned for the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions. U.S. offshore crude oil production declined from 31% to 16% of total production between FY2010 and FY2015, while total crude production increased by 73% to 9.4 million barrels per day. Offshore natural gas production also decreased from 9.5% to 4% of total production during the same period. The surge in total U.S. crude oil and natural gas production between FY2010 and FY2015 was driven by increased production of shale gas and shale oil in various onshore formations. This rise in production helped reduce imports, particularly from OPEC countries. The onshore shale oil plays have lower production costs than deepwater plays currently being explored offshore. As of November 1, 2016, there were 917 producing offshore oil and natural gas leases on 4.5 million acres of the OCS, out of a total of 3,431 active leases on 18.3 million offshore acres. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) anticipates lower domestic investment in offshore leases due to soft demand in a low oil and natural gas price environment, potentially impacting future production levels. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects decreased domestic investment in oil and gas projects from 2015-2020. The Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) forecasts lower bonus bid revenues from offshore leasing in the next five fiscal years compared to previous periods. ONRR's estimates for offshore bonus bid revenues have decreased from around $1 billion annually for FY2015-FY2019 to closer to $500 million annually for FY2017-FY2021. The Office of Management and Budget's crude oil price estimates have also decreased from $80-$90 per barrel to $50-$60 per barrel. The FY2015 budget request had estimates of $80-$90 per barrel, which decreased to $50-$60 per barrel in the FY2017 budget request. Low oil prices will impact new investment, but offshore crude oil production in the Gulf of Mexico is expected to reach record levels of 1.91 mbd in 2017 due to new deepwater projects. Energy diversification, including oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico, remains a priority according to the 2017-2022 PP. Oil and natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) is crucial for meeting the country's energy needs. Exploration and production stages provide certainty about resource volumes. Discovered oil and gas reserves are measured within pools or fields via well penetration. Reserves are reported to the Securities. The U.S. OCS has 4.3 billion barrels of proven oil reserves and 16 Tcf of dry gas, mainly in the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico. No reserves have been reported along the Atlantic OCS due to no discoveries. Only modest oil reserves are on the Alaska OCS. The U.S. OCS has significant undiscovered oil and gas resources, with the Gulf of Mexico holding the majority. Alaska's resources are mainly in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas. BOEM considers resource potential, environmental, and socioeconomic impacts when planning OCS programs. Some portions of the U.S. OCS were unavailable for leasing consideration in the 2017-2022 program due to presidential withdrawals, congressional moratoriums, or protected status. This included areas in the Eastern and Central Gulf of Mexico affected by the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006. President Obama withdrew certain ocean areas in the Alaska region from leasing disposition, including the North Aleutian Basin, Hanna Shoal in the Chukchi Sea, and the Barrow and Kaktovik whaling areas in the Beaufort Sea. National marine sanctuaries and marine monuments are also withdrawn from future oil and gas leasing. President Obama withdrew certain ocean areas in the Alaska region from leasing disposition, including parts of the Chukchi Sea, Beaufort Sea, and North Bering Sea. Protected areas in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans are also withdrawn from future oil and gas leasing activities. The President's December 2016 withdrawals did not directly affect the 2017-2022 leasing program, but would impact future leasing considerations in certain areas of the Atlantic Ocean. BOEM's tailored leasing strategy evaluates each U.S. ocean region based on criteria set out in the OCSLA, considering factors like oil and gas resource potential. BOEM considered various factors for the 2017-2022 leasing program, resulting in 11 lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions. No lease sales are planned for the Atlantic and Pacific regions. Previous proposals for an Atlantic lease sale and two Alaska lease sales were not included in the final program. The 2017-2022 leasing program includes 11 lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions, with no sales planned for the Atlantic and Pacific regions. The Gulf of Mexico is the most mature region with abundant oil and gas resources, accounting for 97% of U.S. offshore production. The majority of lease sales in the program are in this region. The majority of lease sales in the 2017-2022 program are scheduled in the Gulf region, with 10 out of 11 proposed sales. The region includes the Western Gulf, Central Gulf, and Eastern Gulf planning areas. The Eastern Gulf and a small portion of the Central Gulf are closed to oil and gas leasing due to congressional moratorium. BOEM has replaced area-specific sales with a different approach for this program. BOEM has replaced area-specific lease sales in the Gulf with region-wide sales for the 2017-2022 program, offering all available lease blocks in each sale. This change aims to provide more flexibility to industry and fewer lease sales overall compared to previous programs. The 2012-2017 program had 12 Gulf sales, while the revised 2007-2012 program also had 12 Gulf sales. Concerns were raised about the lower number of lease sales in the 2017-2022 program, attributed to consolidation of area-specific sales in the Gulf. Interest in offshore oil and gas exploration in the Alaska region has increased due to decreasing summer polar ice extent, allowing for a longer drilling season. Interest in offshore oil and gas exploration in the Arctic region has grown due to decreasing summer polar ice extent, allowing for a longer drilling season. Estimates of substantial undiscovered resources in Arctic waters have also fueled this interest. Challenges such as severe weather, perennial sea ice, and lack of infrastructure for extraction and transportation remain. The Beaufort and Chukchi Seas are the only areas with existing federal leases, with the Beaufort Sea having producing wells in federal waters. Stakeholders, including the State of Alaska and some Members of Congress, aim to expand offshore oil exploration. In the Arctic region, there is a debate over expanding offshore oil and gas activities. Some stakeholders, including the State of Alaska and some Members of Congress, support this expansion, while others, including environmental groups and some Members of Congress, oppose it due to concerns about oil spills and climate change. The Obama Administration expressed support for offshore oil exploration in the Arctic while implementing safety regulations to prevent oil spills. The Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea, and Cook Inlet were included in the five-year program for offshore lease sales from 2012-2017. BOEM canceled Chukchi and Beaufort Sea lease sales for 2016 and 2017 due to market conditions. Alaska lease sales were removed from the final program, except for Cook Inlet. BOEM considered significant hydrocarbon resources in Beaufort and Chukchi planning areas. BOEM decided against Chukchi and Beaufort Sea lease sales due to various factors, including declining industry interest, low oil prices, and sufficient existing domestic energy sources. Industry interest in the Arctic OCS declined significantly between February 2016 and November 2016, with a more than 90% decrease in active leases. Companies relinquished leases due to low oil prices and the costs of continued investment. BOEM predicts stronger interest in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas post-2017-2022, as the domestic energy supply remains strong. President Obama withdrew large portions of the Arctic OCS from future leasing consideration for an indefinite time period after the final program for 2017-2022 was published by BOEM. The final program excludes a lease sale in the Atlantic region that was proposed in the DPP version, which would have been the first offshore oil and gas lease sale in the Atlantic since 1983. The first offshore oil and gas lease sale in the Atlantic since 1983 was made possible by changes in legislation and presidential actions. Despite the lifting of moratoriums and administrative withdrawals, no Atlantic lease sale has occurred in the years following these changes. As of December 2016, parts of the Atlantic are under presidential moratorium, but some areas are available for leasing. BOEM analyzed factors for the Atlantic region in the 2017-2022 program, including resource potential, ecological concerns, and competing uses by the Department of Defense and NASA. The initial analysis for the DPP resulted in a planned lease sale in a combined portion of the Mid- and South Atlantic planning areas in 2021. However, after further analysis, BOEM removed the Atlantic sale in the PP due to strong local opposition, conflicts with other ocean uses, and current market dynamics. BOEM cited conflicts with existing uses, including ocean-dependent tourism, commercial, and recreational activities. BOEM cited conflicts with existing uses in the Atlantic, including ocean-dependent tourism, fishing, shipping, and Department of Defense and NASA activities. The agency noted that the lack of offshore mineral production history in the Atlantic raised concerns about drilling. BOEM also considered the U.S. energy situation and decided not to hold an Atlantic lease sale in the 2017-2022 period. The BOEM decided not to hold an Atlantic lease sale in the 2017-2022 period due to conflicts with existing uses in the region and concerns about drilling. The agency observed that onshore oil and gas production increases have reduced national energy needs, making additional production from a potential lease sale in the Atlantic unnecessary. No lease sales are scheduled for the Pacific region in the 2017-2022 program, with no federal oil and gas lease sales held in the region since 1984. The governors of California, Oregon, and Washington oppose offshore oil and gas leasing in the region. Congress can influence the Administration's development of a five-year program through public comments, oversight hearings, and legislation. Congress reviews each finalized five-year program under the OCSLA. The OCSLA does not require Congress to approve the final five-year program for offshore oil and gas leasing. The 114th Congress tried to influence the 2017-2022 program, and the 115th Congress could also address it through legislation. Members of Congress, state governors, agencies, and the public can submit comments on draft programs. BOEM received 15 comments from Members of Congress on the 2017-2022 program. BOEM received 15 comments from Members of Congress on the 2017-2022 program, with some opposing certain regions in the program and others supporting lease sales. Comments also addressed issues like seismic testing in the Atlantic, influencing successive drafts of the program. After releasing successive drafts of a five-year program, BOEM includes an appendix summarizing comments received, including those from Members of Congress. Oversight hearings by the House or Senate evaluate the proposed oil and gas leasing program, informing legislative decision-making and allowing BOEM to hear Members' views. The House held a hearing on the 2017-2022 program on April 15, 2015. The House and Senate held hearings on the 2017-2022 DPP, discussing lease sales in the Atlantic and Arctic, seismic surveying, and targeted lease sales in Alaska. Congress may direct specific terms through legislation. Legislation from the 114th Congress could have impacted the 2017-2022 oil and gas leasing program, including bills like H.R. 1487 and S. 791 which aimed to use an earlier-proposed program for FY2015-FY2020 with 31 lease sales. The bills H.R. 1487 and S. 791 aimed to use an earlier-proposed program for FY2015-FY2020 with 31 lease sales. They directed that 3 lease sales would not be part of the program and required BOEM to conduct a previously proposed sale in the Atlantic region. The bills also mandated BOEM to conduct lease sales every 270 days for areas with commercial interest and approved the program under NEPA without further environmental review. H.R. 1663 would have approved BOEM's DPP for 2017-2022 under NEPA and added lease sales for various regions, including the Chukchi Sea, Beaufort Sea, Bristol Bay, Virginia coast, and other OCS areas with significant oil or gas reserves. The bill also included state revenue-sharing provisions and declared the final program approved under NEPA. H.R. 3682 would have amended the OCSLA to require BOEM to make at least 50% of available unleased acreage in OCS planning areas with significant oil and gas resources available for leasing. It aimed to increase oil production by 3 million barrels per day and 10 billion cubic feet of natural gas. The bill aimed to increase oil production by 3 million barrels per day and 10 billion cubic feet of natural gas by 2032. It would have allowed the Secretary to add additional areas to an approved leasing program under certain conditions and required BOEM to conduct lease sales in the Atlantic region, South Carolina, and Southern California. Other provisions included revenue sharing with the states. H.R. 4749, S. 1276, and S. 2011 aimed to amend the OCSLA to direct lease sales in specific areas with large undiscovered resources, including off North Carolina. Military protections and revenue sharing with coastal states were included in the bills. The bills aimed to direct lease sales in specific areas with oil and gas resources, including the Eastern Gulf of Mexico. They also included state revenue-sharing provisions and required lease sales in Alaska's Cook Inlet and Beaufort Sea planning areas. The bill aimed to direct lease sales in specific areas with oil and gas resources, including the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas, and required revenue sharing with the state of Alaska. It also included provisions for extending existing leases and conducting lease sales in the South Atlantic planning area. The bill addressed lease sales in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas, revenue sharing with Alaska, and lease terms for the Alaska region. It also included provisions for lease sales in the Cook Inlet planning area. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held a hearing on S. 3203, a bill that would have made changes to lease terms for the Alaska region under the OCSLA. Congress has the opportunity to introduce legislation to alter the final version of each five-year program before the Secretary of the Interior can approve it. In the 114th Congress, Representative Doc Hastings introduced H.R. 6082 to replace the current five-year leasing program with a congressionally developed plan including additional lease sales in various regions. The bill passed the House but did not become law. Potential changes to the lease sale schedule for the 2017-2022 program could be considered in the 115th Congress."
