    "content": "Many machine learning algorithms use vector embeddings or discrete codes to represent input data. Evaluating compositionality in these representations is important, but the machine learning literature lacks tools for this. A procedure for measuring compositionality in vector-valued representation spaces is described. The procedure evaluates compositionality in vector-valued representation spaces by approximating the true model with a composed model. It explores the relationship between compositionality, learning dynamics, human judgments, representational similarity, and generalization. The success of representation learning techniques has sparked interest in understanding the structure of learned codes, particularly in relation to compositionality. This involves the capacity to represent complex concepts by combining simple parts, a feature common in human-designed representation systems. Many machine learning approaches utilize compositional analyses for representation and prediction. The text discusses the use of human-designed compositional analyses for representation and prediction in machine learning. It questions whether compositionality arises in learning problems where compositional structure is not initially built in. It presents a hypothetical character-based encoding scheme for a communication task and explores its compositional nature. The text discusses the need for a standardized and quantitative technique to evaluate claims about compositional structure in learned representations. It aims to address the limitations of existing solutions that rely on manual or subjective analysis, and proposes a more systematic approach. The paper introduces a formal framework for evaluating how well representations reflect compositional structure in model inputs. It proposes an evaluation metric called TRE for graded judgments of compositionality in (input, representation) pairs. The paper introduces a formal framework for evaluating compositionality in model inputs by treating primitive meaning representations as hidden and optimizing over them to find an explicitly compositional model. It proposes an evaluation metric called TRE for graded judgments of compositionality in (input, representation) pairs. The paper presents a survey of applications for assessing the compositionality of representations through experiments and analyses. It aims to answer questions about the evolution of compositionality, its correlation with human judgments, its impact on distances between representations, and its comparison with other similarity-based methods. The curr_chunk discusses the debate on whether distributed representations can model compositional phenomena and the various approaches proposed for compositional representation learning. It also mentions possible applications and generalizations of TRE-based analysis. Numerous approaches for compositional representation learning have been proposed, with or without explicit composition operations built into the model. The main question is when and how compositionality arises in models without predefined structures. Existing proposals from linguistics and philosophy evaluate compositionality in formal and natural languages, specialized in linguistic representations. Machine learning research has responded to the absence of procedures for answering questions about compositionality in general cases. Evaluations derive judgments from manual analyses of representation spaces, providing insight but are time-consuming and non-reproducible. Our work aims to provide a standard and scalable alternative to model-and task-specific evaluations for measuring compositionality directly. Other authors base analysis on related phenomena, such as correlation between representation similarity and oracle compositional analyses, and generalization to structurally novel inputs. Our approach aims to validate surrogate measures for compositionality in natural language processing by examining similarity and generalization to novel inputs. This work complements existing research on learning composition functions for modeling phrases and sentences. Representation learning in NLP is seen as complementary to the framework presented here. The approach is flexible regarding the choice of composition function, with well-motivated options available for evaluating data from various sources. The work demonstrates the ability to adapt existing NLP techniques for compositional representation learning to different models, even in non-linguistic settings. The resulting training loss can measure the compositionality of the representation system. The speaker model sends a message to a listener model for a downstream task. The messages represent input objects, and the goal is to determine if these representations are compositional. Inputs can be identified through a composition of shape and color attributes. The section proposes an automated procedure for analyzing the compositional structure of input representations in a learning problem defined by a dataset X, representations \u03b8, and a model f. It assumes prior knowledge of input structure and focuses on determining if the representations reflect this structure. The section proposes an automated procedure for analyzing the compositional structure of input representations in a learning problem. It assumes prior knowledge of input structure and focuses on determining if the representations reflect this structure. Additionally, it assumes inputs can be labeled with tree-structured derivations defined by a set of primitives and a bracketing operation. The model is considered compositional if it is a homomorphism from inputs to representations. The section proposes an automated procedure for analyzing the compositional structure of input representations in a learning problem. It assumes prior knowledge of input structure and focuses on determining if the representations reflect this structure. A homomorphism from inputs to representations is required, where inputs are natural language strings and representations are logical representations of meaning. To argue that a language fragment is compositional, a lexicon mapping words to meaning representations and a grammar for composing meanings are needed. Learning algorithms for grammars and lexicons from data are essential. The text discusses the challenges in identifying lexicon entries and dealing with languages lacking a clearly-defined syntax in semantic parsing approaches. The text discusses challenges in identifying lexicon entries and dealing with languages lacking a clearly-defined syntax in semantic parsing. It explores the issue of regular structures that do not fit the homomorphism condition. The example in Figure 1 illustrates the process of identifying primitive representations and composing them to produce full representations. The speaker model is compositional as long as there is an assignment of representations to primitives that reproduces the speaker's prediction. In Figure 1, there is no assignment of strings that satisfies this condition. The text discusses challenges in identifying lexicon entries and dealing with languages lacking a clearly-defined syntax in semantic parsing. It explores the issue of regular structures that do not fit the homomorphism condition. Derivation reproduces the speaker's prediction by approximating model predictions with primitive assignments like xx for blue and aa for square. The quality of the approximation measures the compositionality of the true predictor. This suggests measuring compositionality by searching for representations allowing a compositional model to closely approximate the true function f. The evaluation procedure involves Tree Reconstruction Error (TRE) to assess the compositional approximation of the true function f using parameter vectors \u03b7. Datum-and dataset-level evaluation metrics are computed to measure compositionality. The evaluation procedure involves Tree Reconstruction Error (TRE) to assess the compositional approximation of the true function f using parameter vectors \u03b7. Each term in Equation 2 measures how well the best compositional prediction matches the true model prediction. The choice of \u03b4 and * in the definition of TRE is left to the evaluator, allowing for flexibility in defining the composition function. The composition function is defined with free parameters to optimize jointly with \u03b7 i. Care must be taken to avoid trivial solutions when choosing * to achieve TRE(X) = 0. Pre-commitment to a restricted composition function is necessary to prevent trivial results. The paper discusses experiments with fixed and learned composition functions. Implementation details for differentiable models are provided, including the use of gradient descent for solving equations. An SGD-based solver for TRE is included in the software release. Task-specific optimizers may be used for other problems. The paper discusses using task-specific optimizers for various problems and highlights ways of using TRE to address questions about compositionality in machine learning. It explores the relationship between compositionality and learning dynamics, focusing on the information bottleneck theory proposed by BID45. The paper explores the relationship between compositionality and learning dynamics, focusing on the information bottleneck theory. It investigates the compression phase in finding a compositional representation of input distribution, isolating decision-relevant attributes. In a meta-learning framework, classifiers predict whether a test image matches a given visual concept. The model computes the logistic loss between logits and ground-truth labels y* to minimize error. Visual concepts used are single attributes or conjunctions of attributes like background color, digit color, digit identity, and stroke type. The composition function is addition and the distance is measured using cosine similarity. The training dataset consists of 9000 image triplets evenly balanced between positive and negative classes, with a validation set of 500 examples. The model achieves a validation accuracy of 75.2% on average over ten training runs. The relationship between the information bottleneck and compositionality is explored by comparing TRE(X) to the mutual information I(\u03b8; x) between representations and inputs during training. The relationship between TRE(X) and mutual information I(\u03b8; X) is examined on the validation set. Both quantities increase during training, with mutual information reaching a maximum before decreasing. This pattern indicates a high degree of compositionality in the representations. The mutual information reaches a maximum during training, indicating compositional representations. High-dimensional embeddings of words and phrases are important for natural language processing applications. The focus is on how phrase vectors are compositional in aggregate. The focus is on exploring how compositional individual phrase representations are, using low reconstruction error to identify compositional bigrams. This approach differs from traditional methods by searching for atomic representations rather than relying on pre-trained word embeddings. The goal is to validate this approach in natural language processing. The current study aims to validate a new approach in natural language processing by training word and bigram embeddings using the CBOW objective. The focus is on understanding the compositional structure of phrase embeddings and their relation to constituent word embeddings. The study validates a new approach in natural language processing by training word and bigram embeddings using the CBOW objective. It focuses on understanding the compositional structure of phrase embeddings and their relation to constituent word embeddings. The composition function involves vector addition and cosine distance. Bigram-level judgments of compositionality are compared with human judgments about noun-noun compounds. The study validates a new approach in natural language processing by training word and bigram embeddings using the CBOW objective. It focuses on understanding the compositional structure of phrase embeddings and their relation to constituent word embeddings. Results show that TRE(x) is anticorrelated with human judgments of compositionality, with specific collocations rated as most or least compositional. The next section aims to provide a formal characterization of the relationship between TRE and another perspective on representation analysis. The BID7 approach introduces topographic similarity in learned representations, correlating distances between representations with distances between their derivations. This provides weak evidence for compositionality, as edit distance is expected to correlate with derivational similarity. The section aims to clarify the relationship between the two evaluations. The section introduces a distance function for derivations using tree edit distance BID3. Proposition 1 states that the tree edit distance is an approximate upper bound on any distance on \u0398 satisfying certain properties. The section introduces a distance function for derivations using tree edit distance BID3. Proposition 1 states that the tree edit distance is an approximate upper bound on any distance on \u0398 satisfying certain properties. \u2206 is an approximate upper bound on \u03b4, demonstrating that compositionality imposes constraints on similarity judgments between representations. In the final set of experiments, the relationship between compositionality and generalization is investigated through communication games. Existing work suggests that agents require compositional communication protocols to generalize to unseen referents. By training numerous agents from random initial conditions, the compositional structure of the language that emerges is measured to evaluate its impact on performance with familiar and novel objects. The experiment focuses on a reference game BID20 where a speaker model describes target objects to a listener model using a discrete code. The listener reconstructs the targets and receives rewards for correct predictions. Two policies, a speaker, and a listener, are trained to communicate and predict attribute sets of objects. The experiment involves a reference game where a speaker describes objects to a listener using a discrete code. Both speaker and listener receive rewards for correct predictions. Policies are trained using a policy gradient objective, with RNNs implemented for communication. Target referents consist of two objects with two attributes each, forming a compositional structure. Object pairs are held out during training for generalization evaluation. In a reference game, object pairs are held out during training for generalization evaluation. Representations are fixed-length discrete codes with complex semantics. Agent messages are represented as sequences of one-hot vectors. The composition function in agent messages uses one-hot vectors and error function \u03b4 as 1 distance. Matrices redistribute tokens in input string but do not affect token choice, allowing modeling of non-commutative aspects of string production. Compositional languages have lower absolute performance, even in successful training runs with rewards > 0.5 on held-out referents. The analysis focuses on successful training runs where agents achieve a reward > 0.5 on held-out referents. Two languages resulting from multiagent training runs are compared, showing different Total Reward Efficiency (TRE) but similar listener performance. The approach allows for arbitrary vectors in computing TRE, rather than restricting to one-hot indicators. Results show that Total Reward Efficiency (TRE) is correlated with generalization error and absolute model reward in the context of training speaker-listener pairs. This suggests a more nuanced relationship between compositionality and generalization than previously argued in the literature. \"Compositional languages are often a result of poor communication strategies, with low Total Reward Efficiency (TRE) corresponding to trivial strategies. However, good generalization performance can still be achieved at both low and high levels of compositionality.\" The curr_chunk discusses the introduction of a new evaluation method called TRE for assessing compositional structure in representation learning problems. It involves inferring primitive meaning representations that approximate observed representations and measuring the quality of this approximation. The method has been applied to various problems in representation learning, exploring compositionality in learning dynamics, linguistic compositionality, similarity, and generalization. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges of generalizing TRE to settings without oracle derivations and the potential for new research in understanding machine learning models and data distributions.
