    "content": "The electric utility industry is a major source of air pollution, including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, and carbon dioxide. The EPA released an analysis comparing costs and benefits of controlling this pollution through market-oriented mechanisms. The analysis compared different proposals, including the Administration's \"Clear Skies\" proposal and bills introduced by Senators Jeffords and Carper. The Administration initially resisted conducting a study on more stringent air pollution requirements proposed by Senators Jeffords and Carper but relented after the Clear Skies bill failed to advance in the Senate. Concerns were raised about the lack of analysis comparing the different bills' provisions. Electric utility generating facilities are a major source of air pollution, emitting gases like particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury. EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson conducted a cost-benefit analysis of Clear Skies and Senate bills. Electric utility generating facilities emit particulate matter (PM), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and mercury. SO2 and NOx emissions have decreased due to regulations, while CO2 emissions continue to rise. Fossil-fuel-fired electric plants are the main source of SO2 emissions. Electric generating plants in the U.S. are major contributors to air pollution, emitting significant amounts of SO2, NOx, CO2, and Hg. These emissions have led to the implementation of various pollution control measures over time. The impacts of power plant emissions have led to a complex system of controls, including measures for NOx, SO2, PM 2.5, and Hg pollutants. The US has voluntary limits on CO2 emissions but rejected mandatory limits under the Kyoto Protocol. The Senate passed a resolution in 2005 calling for mandatory controls on greenhouse gases. The Senate resolution in 2005 called for mandatory controls on greenhouse gases, including a \"multi-pollutant\" approach targeting SO2, NOx, Hg, and CO2 emissions from utilities to balance environmental goals with industry stability. The new regulatory approach includes finalized rules like the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR), and Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR) to reduce emissions of pollutants like SO2, NOx, and Hg from coal-fired power plants. More reductions are planned with new ambient air quality standards for ozone and fine particles. With new ambient air quality standards for ozone and fine particles in effect nationwide in 2005, further reductions in emissions of NOx and SO2 are needed. Mercury emissions are also a concern, with 44 states issuing fish consumption advisories for mercury contamination in water bodies. Mercury enters water bodies from air emissions, either directly or through precipitation runoff. Legislation addressing power plant emissions is supported by industry, environmental groups, Congress, and the Administration. Legislation addressing power plant pollution, supported by industry, environmental groups, Congress, and the Administration, aims to control SO2, NOx, and Hg emissions through a system of tradeable allowances. Multiple bills in the 109th Congress propose multi-pollutant controls on utilities, with the Administration's version known as \"Clear Skies.\" Some proposals also include addressing CO2 emissions. Legislation aims to control power plant pollution through tradeable allowances, with key questions in congressional debate focusing on the stringency of caps for CO2, NOx, SO2, and mercury emissions. Bills propose 70%-90% reductions in emissions, with the Clear Skies bill being the least stringent and phased in over a longer period. Final deadlines for all pollutants under Clear Skies would be 2018. The Clear Skies bill aims to reduce CO2, NOx, SO2, and mercury emissions by 70%-90% with final deadlines set for 2018. However, due to \"banking\" provisions, actual 70% reduction targets may be delayed for up to a decade after the deadline. Utilities are likely to overcomply in the early years, accumulating credits for future emission reductions. The Administration sees this overcompliance as a benefit, achieving reductions sooner than traditional regulatory approaches. The Clear Skies bill aims to reduce CO2, NOx, SO2, and mercury emissions by 70%-90% with final deadlines set for 2018. However, overcompliance in the early years may lead to delays in achieving emission reductions, with large holdings of banked emission allowances to be used later. The Jeffords and Carper bills have earlier and more stringent caps on emissions, allowing utilities to reach full compliance at least a decade sooner than under Clear Skies. Clear Skies does not impose controls on carbon dioxide, unlike the Jeffords and Carper bills. The Clear Skies bill does not impose controls on carbon dioxide, unlike the Jeffords and Carper bills. This difference in approach may lead to varied compliance strategies, potentially preserving a market for coal and reducing the reliance on natural gas or renewable fuels for power production. The EPA's cost-benefit analysis considered various options, including those aligned with Clear Skies and alternatives proposed by Senators Carper and Jeffords. The EPA's analysis compared the Clear Skies, Carper, and Jeffords options, with little difference found between the Clear Skies variations. The chosen version was the Managers' Mark version offered at the Senate markup of S. 131 on March 9, 2005. EPA assumed no additional action would be taken without new legislation. The EPA and states will not take further action on emissions without new legislation, despite recent rules on SO2, NOx, and Hg. EPA's decision to exclude these rules is unclear. The report uses the CAIR/CAMR/CAVR case as a baseline for emissions control. The CAIR/CAMR/CAVR case is used as a baseline for clean air regulation. Uncertainty exists regarding future rules and legislation, such as S. 843 introduced in the 108th Congress, with no guarantee of deadlines being maintained in future versions. Regulations supporting passed legislation would be subject to change. The regulations supporting passed legislation may face uncertainties and delays similar to finalized regulations not included in EPA's baseline. EPA's cost analysis focuses on Electric Demand Price Elasticity, analyzing scenarios with different levels of demand response to increasing electricity prices. The EPA analyzes scenarios with constraints on construction and electricity demand growth, as well as natural gas supply, in their cost analysis. The EPA developed scenarios based on assumptions regarding electricity demand growth, natural gas prices, and price elasticity, leading to different price projections under proposed legislation. The EPA developed scenarios based on assumptions regarding electricity demand growth, natural gas prices, and price elasticity, leading to different price projections under proposed legislation. This report uses EPA's Demand Response Scenario as the benchmark analysis, which assumes very inelastic short-term price elasticity and short-term construction constraints. Each scenario raises questions, but the strongest case can be made for the Demand Response Scenario. The EPA's Demand Response Scenario, with short-term price elasticities within the literature range, is the strongest case for inclusion in modeling scenarios. It is unclear why EPA did not include this refinement in all scenarios, but CRS chose to incorporate it in the one scenario containing the demand function. The EPA's Demand Response Scenario includes assumptions about boilermaker labor availability for constructing control equipment until 2010, which has been questioned by some, including the Institute of Clean Air Companies. The Institute of Clean Air Companies (ICAC) conducted their own analysis on boilermaker labor availability for the air pollution control industry. They found no constraints on construction, even if the 2015 deadline of CAIR was moved to 2010. ICAC stated that the industry has shown the ability to install significant amounts of air pollution control equipment quickly, citing recent installations in Germany and Japan. The resources needed for projected installations under the IAQR will also be available. The projected installations under the IAQR will require air pollution control installations, but resources are not expected to be limiting. Factors like modular construction methods and non-union labor will reduce demand for union boilermakers. In case of a shortage, additional boilermaker labor can be sourced from Canadian boilermaker union, ship builders, and iron workers. There will be sufficient boilermaker capacity. The projected IAQR installations will have sufficient boilermaker capacity to meet the requirements for 2010 and 2015. Limited availability of boilermakers only affects certain scenarios, with one scenario assuming zero price elasticity for electricity demand. This raises questions about the demand elasticity assumption. The lack of an EPA alternative with both demand elasticity and no boilermaker constraint makes it crucial to include a demand elasticity function in the benchmark analysis. Choosing EPA's demand response scenario as the base case is emphasized. Sensitivity analysis is vital for understanding cost estimate robustness due to uncertainties in future natural gas supply. EPA's model projects increased natural gas availability at lower costs. The EPA's supply curves project more natural gas availability at lower prices compared to EIA's curves. The EIA curves may be more representative of future supplies, considering the current market climate and historical volatility of natural gas supply. However, the 15-year timeframe of the analysis leaves room for debate. Based on the analysis using the Demand Response Scenario, Clear Skies is the most cost-effective option with minimal costs and benefits compared to other bills. This is due to its less stringent requirements and later deadlines, resulting in lower annual costs. In comparison to other bills, Clear Skies has weaker provisions for Hg and no provisions for CO2. It aims to revamp the Clean Air Act with a more cost-effective approach. Clear Skies' benefits are significantly lower than the Carper and Jeffords bills, providing $6 billion in annual benefits in 2010 compared to $51 billion (Carper) and $83 billion (Jeffords). According to the EPA, Clear Skies has weaker pollution caps and a more relaxed implementation schedule compared to the Carper and Jeffords bills. The benefits of Clear Skies almost merge with the baseline increase in later years, lagging behind the other bills which have higher annual benefits. Adjusting the baseline to reflect current Clean Air Act requirements shows that Clear Skies falls short in comparison. Clear Skies has minimal incremental cost and relatively small benefits compared to other regulations. EPA successfully incorporated market-based regulatory scheme into new rules. Senator Jeffords' bill would have the greatest benefits in 2010. Senator Jeffords' bill would have the greatest benefits in 2010 and 2020, with estimated annual benefits of $83 billion and $66 billion respectively, surpassing the benefits of the Carper bill and Clear Skies by significant margins. EPA's cost and benefit estimates show the substantial advantages of Senator Jeffords' bill compared to existing laws. The Jeffords bill is projected to have the highest costs among three multi-pollutant proposals, with potential limitations due to short-term construction constraints. EPA predicts a significant reduction in coal production and coal-fired electric generation by about 40% if the bill is implemented. The Jeffords bill would significantly reduce coal production and coal-fired electric generation by 40%, requiring a shift to natural gas and renewable fuel generators at a high cost. It would lead to a substantial increase in renewable energy generation and oil- and gas-fired capacity. Despite being perceived as costly, the net benefits of the Jeffords bill far exceed those of other proposed options. S. 843 aims to achieve substantial emission reductions beyond the Clean Air Act, with lower costs than S. 150 and higher than Clear Skies. The bill's phased-in schedule helps mitigate short-term constraints, while developing a flexible CO2 requirement to reduce emissions at a nominal cost. EPA analysis shows the bill's benefits and costs fall between S. 150 and Clear Skies. The EPA conducted sensitivity analyses on various bills to reduce carbon dioxide emissions at a nominal cost. Three key variables examined were price elasticity, short-term construction constraints, and electricity growth with constrained natural gas supply. Different combinations were analyzed, including one with no construction constraints. The EPA analyzed different scenarios for reducing carbon dioxide emissions, including the No Construction Constraint Scenario, EPA Base Case Scenario, and Higher Electricity Growth and Natural Gas Scenario. These scenarios varied in terms of price elasticity, short-term constraints, and electricity growth assumptions. The analysis compared different scenarios for reducing carbon dioxide emissions, with varying assumptions on price elasticity and construction constraints. The removal of zero demand price elasticity had a significant impact on the cost of S. 150, increasing it by 36% in the short term and 157% in the long term. This change outweighed the savings from removing EPA's short-term construction constraints in S. 843. The EPA Base Case Scenario replaced the short-term price elasticity estimate with zero elasticity, maintaining construction constraints. This led to a significant cost increase for S. 150, with a 63% increase in 2010 and a 147% increase. The removal of short-term price elasticity has a significant impact on the costs of S. 150, with increases of 63% in 2010 and 147% in 2020 compared to the benchmark analysis. This suggests that demand response and construction constraint assumptions heavily influence EPA's cost estimates for S. 843 in 2010. EPA's assumptions have little effect on S. 843 cost estimates in the long-term or for the Managers' Mark. Electricity Growth and Natural Gas Scenario combines zero demand response, higher electricity growth, and tighter natural gas supply, leading to increased costs, especially for S. 150. Compared to the EPA Base Case, this scenario removes demand price elasticity and uses EIA assumptions for electricity growth and natural gas supply. The impact of higher growth and natural gas costs on S. 150 is significant, especially without demand response. This challenges EPA's assumption of zero demand price elasticity, particularly for 2020. In contrast, S. 843 and the Managers' Mark are less affected. A more thorough analysis of future natural gas availability is needed for multi-pollutant legislation. EPA's assumption greatly influences short and long-term cost estimates for S. 150. EPA's assumptions significantly impact short and long-term cost estimates for S. 150, especially with higher electricity growth and natural gas costs. The effect decreases over time for S. 843 due to its less aggressive time frame. EPA's assumptions have little effect on the Managers' Mark cost estimates. The EPA's assumptions have minimal impact on the cost estimates of the Managers' Mark, which is based on the Clear Skies regulations. Two bills analyzed by the EPA, S. 150 and S. 843, aim to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. S. 150 sets an emissions cap of 2.05 billion tons annually starting in 2010. S. 843 proposes an emissions cap starting at 2.655 billion tons in 2009, decreasing to 2.454 billion tons in 2013, with lower costs for CO2 allowances compared to S. 150. S. 150 aligns more closely with the Kyoto Protocol requirements. The estimated cost for carbon dioxide reduction in S. 150 is $19 per metric ton in 2010 and $33 per metric ton in 2020, aligning with the EU market prices. The current EU price for a metric ton of carbon dioxide reduction is about $25. EPA did not develop new data on control technologies cost for the study due to time constraints. The analysis of emission control technologies in the Carper bill may overstate the cost of mercury controls due to advancements in technology since 2003. The cost of activated carbon injection controls is now one-fourth of what it was in 2003, according to the air pollution control industry. EPA did not update cost assumptions for mercury control technologies in their study. The cost of mercury controls in the Carper bill may be overstated due to advancements in technology, with activated carbon injection controls now only one-fourth of the cost in 2003. EPA's analysis shows benefits outweighing costs for both S. 150 and S. 843, mainly from reduced mortality due to decreased emissions of SO2 and fine particles. Reductions in SO2 emissions could have significant environmental benefits, such as reducing acid deposition and harm to aquatic life and forest growth. These benefits were not estimated in the analysis. The analysis did not estimate the environmental benefits of reducing emissions, including the formation of regional haze and mercury deposition's impact on fish consumption advisories. Additionally, the economic benefits of reducing mercury health effects were not modeled, with potential impacts ranging from millions to billions of dollars per year. The analysis did not estimate the benefits of reducing emissions, including regional haze and mercury deposition's impact on fish consumption advisories. Omitting these benefits would significantly affect bills with aggressive Hg control schemes. The analysis did not consider the benefits of controlling CO2 emissions, which may understate the potential benefits of the Jeffords and Carper bills. The Jeffords bill is the most aggressive in controlling CO2 emissions. After analyzing EPA's analysis, it is evident that the Jeffords and Carper bills propose more stringent standards than the promulgated rules of Clear Skies legislation. The analysis shows that the benefits of these bills far outweigh the additional costs, especially in terms of controlling CO2 emissions. The cost of reducing carbon dioxide emissions depends on the proposed reductions' amount and schedule. The cost of reducing carbon dioxide emissions depends on the amount and schedule of proposed reductions. As requirements increase and schedules tighten, costs rise. Mercury control costs are dependent on timely data, but EPA's analysis lacks current data on Hg controls. The benefit analysis is limited and incomplete, disadvantaging alternatives to Clear Skies with more stringent standards. EPA's analysis, while a step towards understanding legislative impacts, falls short of being as useful as hoped. The EPA's analysis of Clear Skies alternatives is criticized for overstating costs, penalizing short-term pollution reduction, and not considering natural gas price volatility. The analysis is based on outdated 2003 assumptions, limiting its relevance for current congressional debate."
