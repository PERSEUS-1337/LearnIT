Eligibility criteria apply. The two groups eligible for the HCTC are recipients of benefits under the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program and individuals aged 55-64 receiving payments from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). TAA provides assistance to workers who lose their jobs due to international trade. If a DOL investigation confirms workers' claim, they are certified for TAA benefits and services, including the Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC).

Workers become eligible for HCTC on the first day of a month if they received an eligible TAA benefit.
