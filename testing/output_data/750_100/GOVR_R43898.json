    "content": "Recent legislation has extended certain expiring provisions in the Internal Revenue Code, making some temporary provisions permanent. The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) reduced tax policy uncertainty by permanently extending most tax cuts and indexing the alternative minimum tax (AMT) for inflation. However, ATRA did not eliminate uncertainty in the tax code, as several provisions were temporarily extended through 2013. The tax provisions that expired at the end of 2011 or 2012 were temporarily extended through 2013. Most of the provisions that expired at the end of 2013 were retroactively extended for one year, through 2014. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 made permanent or temporarily extended all tax provisions that had expired at the end of 2014. These temporary tax provisions, often referred to as \"tax extenders,\" have been extended multiple times. The research tax credit and other temporary tax provisions have been extended multiple times since being enacted. In the 114th Congress, the debate focused on whether expired tax provisions should be made permanent or temporarily extended. Ultimately, in P.L. 114-113, all expired tax provisions were extended, either temporarily or permanently, reducing uncertainty in the tax code. The report provides an overview of tax extenders, with some provisions set to expire at the end of 2016. Debate in the 114th Congress may address whether these provisions should be extended. Additional information on specific extender provisions can be found in other CRS reports. The Consolidated Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113) included the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015, which addressed recently expired individual, charitable, community assistance-related, and housing-related tax provisions. The Consolidated Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113) included the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (PATH Act), which extended or made permanent various tax provisions that had expired in 2014. It also made permanent enhancements to certain tax credits and included a two-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax. The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 extended expiring tax provisions for one year, retroactively through 2014, including a one-year moratorium on the health coverage excise tax and annual fee on health insurance providers. Other legislation proposed extensions for wind and solar energy tax credits, and changes to the Section 199 deduction for oil refineries. Tax reform legislation in the 113th and 114th Congress aimed to make certain tax provisions permanent, including the R&D tax credit and increased expensing allowances under IRC Section 179. Legislation such as the Jobs for America Act and America Gives More Act were introduced for this purpose. The Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 aimed to extend temporary tax provisions that expired in 2014 for two years, including dozens of provisions and one that expired in 2013. The term \"tax extender\" refers to expiring tax provisions temporarily extended by Congress, often for a short period of time. The number of provisions considered \"tax extenders\" has grown over time due to routine extensions. Congress may choose temporary tax provisions for various reasons. Enacting temporary tax provisions allows Congress to evaluate their effectiveness before extending further. Temporary provisions can provide relief during economic weakness or natural disasters, and may be enacted for budgetary reasons. Examining why a provision is temporary helps in evaluating whether it should be extended. Enacting tax provisions on a temporary basis allows for evaluation of effectiveness before extension. However, the rationale for temporary provisions is undermined if they are regularly extended without review. An expiration date can force policymakers to consider costs and benefits, but this has not been effective in practice. The extenders, temporary tax benefits, are typically passed as a package without thorough analysis. While most provisions are extended, some like ethanol tax incentives were not renewed after 2011. The Government Accountability Office found issues with ethanol tax credits and the renewable fuel standard mandate. Tax policy can address temporary circumstances like economic stimulus or disaster relief through measures such as bonus depreciation or enhanced casualty loss deductions. Congress may choose not to extend provisions if benefits do not exceed costs. Temporary tax provisions, like mortgage forgiveness exclusion and payroll tax cuts, are enacted to address special economic circumstances. These provisions should expire once the situation is resolved, or if policymakers decide for budgetary reasons. It is easier to find resources to offset short-term revenue reductions. The Congressional Budget Office assumes temporary tax cuts expire as scheduled, leading to an overstatement of projected revenues in the long term. Making tax provisions temporary rather than permanent has a smaller effect on the long-term fiscal outlook. Temporary tax provisions, known as extenders, have a smaller effect on the long-term fiscal outlook. These provisions act as federal subsidies, favoring certain activities and directing economic resources. They impact economic behavior and resource allocation, with their efficiency, equity, and simplicity being key factors for evaluation. Policymakers may need to prioritize economic objectives when considering extenders. Tax extenders may improve economic welfare by addressing market failures. Economic efficiency is reduced if extenders do not target specific markets. Policymakers must prioritize economic objectives when considering extenders. A tax extender reduces economic efficiency if it does not address a specific market failure and may be less effective than direct spending programs. Tax benefits like extenders can lead to differential tax treatment for individuals with similar incomes, depending on their participation in tax-subsidized activities. The tax extender system can lead to differential tax treatment for individuals based on their participation in tax-subsidized activities, deviating from the standard of horizontal equity. This inequity also affects vertical equity by disproportionately benefiting those with higher incomes, reducing the progressivity of the tax system. The benefit of tax expenditures to individuals with higher incomes reduces the progressivity of the tax system, impacting vertical equity. For example, two teachers claiming a deduction for classroom expenses will receive different benefits based on their income tax brackets. This disparity in benefits affects equity by favoring higher-income individuals. The complexity of extenders in the tax code raises administration costs and burdens individual taxpayers. Temporary tax provisions expired at the end of 2014, impacting both government and individuals. Several temporary tax provisions expired at the end of 2014, but were all extended in P.L. 114-113. These provisions fall into categories such as individual, business, charitable, or energy. The cost of the extension in P.L. 114-113 is included in Table 1. The above-the-line deduction for classroom expenses incurred by school teachers was made permanent in P.L. 114-113, along with other individual provisions like the deduction for state and local sales taxes, tuition expenses, mortgage insurance premiums, and employer-provided mass transit and parking benefits. The business provisions that expired at the end of 2014 were made permanent in P.L. 114-113, including the research tax credit, rum excise tax cover-over, Work Opportunity Tax Credit, QZAB allocation limitation, and active financing exception under Subpart F. The New Markets Tax Credit, enacted in 2000, promotes investment in low-income communities. The New Markets Tax Credit, first enacted in 2000 to promote investment in low-income communities, expired at the end of 2014. Bonus depreciation and enhanced expensing allowances, viewed as economic stimulus measures, also expired at the end of 2014. Some business-related extender provisions were made permanent in P.L. 114-113, including the research tax credit, enhanced expensing under Section 179, and the active financing exception under Subpart F. Other provisions, such as the New Markets Tax Credit and bonus depreciation, were extended through 2019. The charitable provisions that expired in 2014 were made permanent in P.L. 114-113, with the enhanced deduction for noncorporate businesses donating food inventory enacted in 2005. The renewable energy production tax credit (PTC) was extended through 2016. The production tax credit (PTC) was extended through 2016 as part of P.L. 114-113, with a phase-down for wind energy starting in 2017. Several energy-related tax provisions from the Energy Policy Act of 2005 were also extended, including credits for energy efficient homes and buildings, and incentives for alternative technology vehicles. The alternative motor vehicle credit for qualified fuel cell vehicles expired at the end of 2014, along with incentives for other alternative motor vehicles like hybrids and advanced lean-burn technology vehicles. The credit for two-wheeled plug-in electric vehicles expired in 2013 and was not extended. The alternative motor vehicle credit for qualified fuel cell vehicles expired at the end of 2013 and was not extended, but would be extended in the Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015. The credit was first enacted as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and was previously extended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act. Congress has regularly acted to temporarily extend expired tax provisions, and certain provisions were made permanent in P.L. 114-113. The Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 extended the alternative motor vehicle credit for qualified fuel cell vehicles. In contrast, P.L. 114-113 made certain provisions permanent, resulting in higher costs for tax extenders. The total cost of tax extenders in P.L. 114-113 is estimated to reduce federal revenues by $628.8 billion between 2016 and 2025, with a significant portion attributed to provisions scheduled to expire in 2017. The cost of extending tax extender provisions in P.L. 114-113 is estimated at $426.8 billion between 2016 and 2025. 89% of this cost is associated with permanent extensions, totaling $361.4 billion. Only a small portion, less than 3%, was for a two-year extension of provisions that had expired in 2014. Before P.L. 114-113 was passed, legislation was considered in the House in the 114th Congress that would have made certain temporary tax provisions permanent. The Senate Finance Committee reported legislation in 2015, the Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 (S. 1946), to retroactively extend expired tax provisions for two years through 2016, with an estimated revenue reduction of $97.1 billion. The proposed tax extenders in S. 1946 would have reduced revenue by $97.1 billion between 2016 and 2025. The cost of the proposal, including revenue raising provisions, was $96.9 billion. With macroeconomic effects included, the cost was $86.6 billion over 10 years. Extending certain expired provisions, like the provision allowing businesses to expense 50% of investments, is expected to boost economic growth in the near term. The cost estimate for S. 1946, including macroeconomic effects, is lower than without them. The JCT's analysis shows increased economic growth, offsetting the federal debt increase. The CBO provides estimated costs for extending tax provisions expiring before 2025. According to CBO's estimates, extending expiring tax provisions before 2025 would reduce revenues by $897.9 billion over the 2016-2025 budget window. This includes costs for bonus depreciation, Section 179 expensing, and expansions to various tax credits. Extending expiring tax provisions before 2025 would cost $202.8 billion. Most of the revenue cost is for provisions that were either extended or made permanent in P.L. 114-113. CBO's revenue projections are higher than actual revenue levels likely to occur, leading to smaller projected budget deficits under the current law baseline. The cost of providing a short-term extension for expiring tax provisions is less than extending them through the budget window. CBO scores may offer a more accurate measure of the long-term budget impact, while JCT scores reflect the temporary extension's impact on the budget relative to current law. The cost of extending provisions temporarily may be lower than in 2015, as many are tax deferrals. Bonus depreciation, a timing provision, had a one-year cost of $1.2 billion in the 10-year budget window, but $45.3 billion in 2015. The extension through 2019 cost $11.3 billion. Bonus depreciation was extended through 2019 in P.L. 114-113 at a cost of $11.3 billion over the 10-year budget window. The estimated cost in 2016 is $90.6 billion, with revenue losses in earlier years recovered later. Making bonus depreciation permanent would cost $223.6 billion over 10 years. Legislation passed in December 2015, part of P.L. 114-113, made certain tax provisions permanent and extended others temporarily. Earlier in the 114th Congress, the House and Senate considered proposals to address expired tax provisions. Before P.L. 114-113 was signed into law, the Senate Finance Committee reported the Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 (S. 1946) to address extenders. The Senate Finance Committee reported the Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 (S. 1946) to retroactively extend expired tax provisions through 2016. The House had passed legislation to make eight temporary tax provisions permanent. The America's Small Business Tax Relief Act of 2015 (H.R. 636) aimed to make permanent enhanced expensing allowances under Section 179 and extend expired S corporation provisions. The America Gives More Act of 2015 (H.R. 644) included three expired charitable provisions: enhanced deduction for food inventory contributions, tax-free distributions from IRAs for charity, and special rules for contributions of capital gain real property for conservation. The American Research and Competitiveness Act of 2015 (H.R. 880) aimed to make the research tax credit permanent. Legislation like H.R. 622 sought to make the option to deduct state and local sales taxes permanent. The Committee on Ways and Means reported legislation during the 114th Congress to make permanent expired tax provisions, costing $317.5 billion over 10 years. Various bills in the 113th Congress aimed to extend or make permanent certain tax extender provisions, leading to the passing of a one-year \"tax extenders\" bill. The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 was signed into law on December 19, 2014, enacting a \"tax extenders\" bill. The Senate Finance Committee had proposed a two-year extenders package, while the House passed legislation to make certain expiring tax provisions permanent. Permanently extending nine provisions in the tax extenders would reduce revenues by $511.4 billion over 10 years. Six provisions were in the Jobs for America Act (H.R. 4) and three in the America Gives More Act of 2014 (H.R. 4719). Legislation in the 113th Congress aimed to make two international-related extender provisions permanent. Several expired provisions were not extended. The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-295) did not extend certain provisions that expired in 2013, such as the health coverage tax credit and the credit for electric-drive motorcycles and three-wheeled vehicles. These provisions were later extended in subsequent legislation after not being included in P.L. 113-295. The health coverage tax credit was first enacted in 2002 without an expiration date but was given a termination date of January 1, 2014, in a later act. The health coverage tax credit was modified and extended through December 31, 2019, as part of the Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-27). Incentives for plug-in electric vehicles are currently available. Incentives for plug-in electric vehicles are currently available, while most other alternative technology vehicle incentives have expired. The credit for two-wheeled electric plug-in vehicles was extended through 2016, but other energy-related provisions like partial expensing of certain refinery property and credit for energy efficient appliances were not extended. Additionally, two disaster-related provisions expired at the end of 2013. The EXPIRE Act did not extend incentives for plug-in electric vehicles and other alternative technology vehicle incentives that had expired. Additionally, two disaster-related provisions were not extended, including those for facilities in the New York Liberty Zone and nonrecognition of gain for areas damaged by the 2008 Midwestern storms."
