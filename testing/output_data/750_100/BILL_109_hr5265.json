The Act titled the \"Community Hazard Assessment and Mitigation Program Act\" acknowledges the devastating impact of the 2004 Southeast Asia earthquake and tsunami, highlighting the potential risk of a similar event along the Cascadia Subduction Zone on the west coast of the United States in the next 50 years. The earthquake and tsunami caused significant damage to infrastructure and emergency services. Coastal communities are unprepared for such geological events, as demonstrated by numerous false alarms in the past year. The purpose and goals of the document are outlined in Section 3. The Community Hazard Assessment and Mitigation Program (CHAMP) awards grants to emergency management departments for tsunami warning infrastructure and post-tsunami needs. The program aims to assist departments lacking resources in tsunami preparedness, mitigation, and response to protect public health and safety. Improving warning systems for coastal communities will enhance all hazard capabilities for response personnel in the aftermath of a tsunami. The grant program outlined in Section 4 aims to enhance warning systems for coastal communities to improve response capabilities in the event of a tsunami. The Secretary of Homeland Security may provide grants to certain areas to prepare for tsunamis, prioritizing areas with a 10% or greater likelihood of a tsunami in the next 50 years. Grants will be awarded competitively based on financial need, community benefit, and cooperation with other emergency service providers. The Secretary of Homeland Security may provide grants to areas at risk of tsunamis based on likelihood and community benefit. An emergency management department receiving a grant under this Act can use funds to establish warning systems, purchase rescue equipment, and reinforce critical service buildings and facilities. The grant funds can be used for establishing warning systems, purchasing rescue equipment, reinforcing critical service buildings and facilities, fire stations, emergency management facilities, hospitals, shelters, endangered sewer sanitation systems, post-tsunami shelters and supplies, and developing outreach programs for tsunami education. SEC. 6. MATCHING FUNDS. To be eligible for a grant under this Act, emergency management departments serving areas with different population sizes must provide a percentage of the total project cost with non-Federal funds. Emergency management departments serving areas with a population under 20,000 must contribute 5 percent of the project cost with non-Federal funds to be eligible for a grant under this Act. The Secretary can consider in-kind contributions, not exceeding 50 percent of the department's non-Federal funds, when determining the total project costs. SEC. 7. EVALUATION AND REPORT.\n\nThe Director will assess if emergency management departments meet tsunami readiness standards and evaluate program effectiveness within 180 days of grant awards. A report on the findings will be submitted to Congress within 90 days of the evaluation completion.\n\nSEC. 8. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Director\" refers to the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Administration. The term \"emergency management department\" refers to an agency responsible for planning and managing emergencies. The term \"State\" includes all 50 states. The term \"State\" refers to each of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and several US territories. Authorization of Appropriations: $100,000,000 is authorized annually from 2007 to 2012 for the Community Hazard Assessment and Mitigation Program under the Department of Homeland Security. 5% may be reserved for administrative costs, and the funds remain available until expended."
