    "content": "The quality of instruction is crucial for student learning, and federal policies emphasize the importance of good pre-service preparation for teachers. Title II, Part A of the Higher Education Act of 1965 provides financial support and accountability measures to improve teacher preparation programs. Title II-A includes a competitive grant program for teacher preparation reforms and reporting requirements for program quality. The 115th Congress is considering a reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, with one bill proposing to repeal Title II provisions and another to amend them. The bill introduced by the committee's ranking minority member (H.R. 6543) would amend and extend Title II, which includes a competitive grant program for teacher preparation reforms. The authorization of appropriations for Title II-A expired in FY2011 but has been funded through various appropriations legislation. Congressional action to reauthorize the Higher Education Act is ongoing. The report describes current programs and provisions in Title II-A of the HEA and highlights key issues for its reauthorization. It discusses the historical focus on teacher preparation at institutions of higher education and the challenges posed by alternative approaches. The shift to alternative teacher preparation programs challenges long-standing federal policies on program quality. Historically, most teachers were trained at institutions of higher education, evolving from normal schools to schools and colleges of education. The professionalization of teacher educators and the split between pedagogy and subject-matter disciplines have shaped teacher preparation programs. The emphasis on subject-area knowledge by departments contrasts with the focus on pedagogy in schools of education. The rise of alternative routes to teacher certification has widened the gap between teaching practice and subject-matter expertise. Alternative routes to teacher certification have become more prevalent, focusing on candidates' prior subject knowledge and classroom training. The Higher Education Amendments of 1998 require annual reports on teacher preparation, with the most recent data from the Secretary's Tenth Annual Report covering the 2012-2013 academic year. Subsequent years have seen limited data releases. In the 2015-2016 academic year, 2,106 teacher preparation providers offered 26,459 programs enrolling 441,439 teaching candidates and producing 159,598 program completers. The Secretary's Tenth Annual Report provides detailed national statistics on teacher preparation. In the 2012-2013 academic year, there were 26,589 teacher preparation programs across the US, enrolling 499,800 teaching candidates and producing 192,459 program completers. 69% of providers were traditional, 22% were alternative route providers at IHEs, and 9% were alternative route providers not based at IHEs. Among the programs, 70% were traditional, 20% were alternative route programs at IHEs, and 10% were alternative route programs not based at IHEs. In the 2012-2013 academic year, 499,800 teacher candidates were enrolled in various teacher preparation programs. Among them, 89% were in traditional programs, 5% in alternative route programs at IHEs, and 6% in alternative route programs not based at IHEs. Five states, including Texas, New York, California, Pennsylvania, and Illinois, prepared 35% of the 192,849 program completers. The top 10 states for teacher preparation program completion are New York, Texas, California, Pennsylvania, and Illinois. New York led in traditional program completion, while Texas led in alternative route completions. The Secretary's Tenth Annual report highlights that traditional programs typically require 100 hours. The typical traditional teacher preparation program requires 100 hours of supervised clinical experience and 600 hours of student teaching. The two largest programs, Grand Canyon University and the University of Phoenix, enroll over 30,000 prospective teachers, which is 10 times more than the next 10 largest programs combined. The majority of enrollees in teacher preparation programs are white, non-Hispanic. The majority of teacher preparation program enrollees are white, non-Hispanic. Completion rates vary between traditional and alternative programs, with elementary education being the most common subject area. The national average scaled score is 74.4%, with over 95% of candidates passing state assessments. Title II-A of the HEA includes a competitive grant program. Title II-A of the HEA includes a competitive grant program to support identified models and reporting requirements for teacher preparation programs. The Teacher Quality Partnership program aims to enhance teacher preparation and improve the quality of prospective and new teachers. The Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program aims to improve teacher preparation and support new teachers through grants totaling about $42 million annually. It supports traditional pre-baccalaureate or fifth-year programs, teacher residency programs, and school leadership activities. About 30% of projects are pre-baccalaureate/fifth year programs, 48% are residency programs, and 23% are a combination of both types. Four teacher preparation programs received TQP grants in FY2016, with a total of 64 grants awarded between FY2009 and FY2016. Eligibility for a TQP award requires a partnership with a high-need local educational agency, an institution of higher education, a school of education within the institution, and a school of arts and sciences within the partner institution. TQP grantees must match 100% of their award with non-federal funds and collaborate with other federally funded programs. Grants support various reforms in teacher preparation programs, including curriculum changes to enhance teaching skills. The curr_chunk discusses improving teaching skills through research-based practices, high-quality mentoring, induction programs for new teachers, increased compensation for educators with degrees, professional development for teachers, and alternative routes to education. The curr_chunk focuses on developing effective mechanisms to recruit qualified individuals into teaching, strengthening literacy instruction skills, and providing grants for teacher residency programs based on successful models. Grant funds support rigorous graduate-level coursework for a master's degree and guided teaching apprenticeships. While undertaking a guided teaching apprenticeship, programs must place graduates in targeted schools as a cohort to facilitate collaboration. A one-year living stipend or salary is provided, to be repaid if recipients fail to teach full time for at least three years in a high-need school. Grants are given to develop effective school leadership programs for superintendents and principals. School leadership programs prepare individuals for careers as superintendents, principals, or early childhood education program directors. These programs focus on developing strong leadership skills, promoting professional development for teachers, assessing classroom instruction, using data to drive learning, managing resources effectively, engaging parents and community stakeholders, and understanding student learning to improve academic achievement. Grant funds are used to develop these programs. The Title II (Section 205) of the HEA authorizes the TQP program to improve academic achievement through various programs for school leaders. States and IHEs operating teacher preparation programs must report program performance to receive HEA funds. IHEs receiving federal assistance under the HEA must issue report cards to the state and the public. States must issue report cards to ED and the public. ED uses state-reported information to issue an annual report on teacher qualifications and preparation in the United States, derived from the Title II reporting system. States are required to evaluate teacher preparation programs and identify low-performing programs. In 2014, states evaluated teacher preparation programs based on teaching skill indicators and pass rates on credentialing assessments. Other criteria included improving student achievement, raising entry standards, providing professional development, and increasing highly qualified teachers. 12 states and Puerto Rico reported low-performing or at-risk programs. In 2014, 12 states and Puerto Rico identified low-performing or at-risk teacher preparation programs based on various criteria. A total of 45 programs were classified as such, representing less than 3% of all programs. On February 8, 2018, the House Committee on Education and the Workforce ordered reported the H.R. 4508 Act. The H.R. 4508 Act, approved on a party-line vote, would amend the HEA by repealing all current provisions in Title II. The Aim Higher Act (H.R. 6543) was introduced as a comprehensive HEA reauthorization bill, retaining and amending current Title II provisions, including changes to the TQP program and expansion of accountability provisions. The H.R. 4508 Act, approved on a party-line vote, would amend the HEA by repealing all current provisions in Title II. The Aim Higher Act (H.R. 6543) was introduced as a comprehensive HEA reauthorization bill, retaining and amending current Title II provisions, including changes to the TQP program and expansion of accountability provisions. The proposed changes include the expansion of accountability provisions for institutions and states, with requirements for report cards and criteria for designation of low-performing programs. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions has held hearings on HEA during the 115th Congress. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions has held hearings on HEA reauthorization but has not introduced a bill to amend Title II. The President signed a resolution nullifying regulations that would have added new elements to accountability requirements. Congress may still consider legislation to reauthorize the HEA, including Title II provisions. Legislation for reauthorizing the HEA, including Title II provisions, is being considered. Key issues include the federal role in supporting teacher preparation programs, TQP activities, and program quality accountability. Some argue for a broader federal role in teacher preparation beyond current demonstration projects. The TQP program supports demonstration projects, with debate over federal involvement in teacher training. Some argue for expanding federal support for quality programs, while others believe it should remain a state and local responsibility. There is also discussion on the optimal mix of activities under the TQP program. Some argue for greater support for enhancements to teacher training programs, including supervised clinical practice and assessments. Others advocate for fewer restrictions on TQP partners and more emphasis on in-service supports like induction and mentoring for teachers. Expansion of federal policy on program quality is also suggested, as current reporting and accountability measures are seen as inadequate. Less than 3% of teacher preparation programs meet high standards. Some argue for greater accountability in teacher preparation programs, with less than 3% identified as low-performing. There are differing views on tying program evaluations to student performance outcomes, with some opposing federal-level accountability requirements due to existing reporting burdens on state and local administrators."
