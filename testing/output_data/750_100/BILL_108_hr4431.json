    "content": "The Act may be cited as \"One Church, One Child Act of 2004\". The Congress finds serious shortages of qualified foster and adoptive parents, with a decrease in foster parents despite an increase in children in foster care. In 2001, only 50,000 children were adopted out of foster care while 126,000 children were awaiting adoption. As of 2001, there were 126,000 children waiting for adoption, with an average of 44 months in foster care. The increase in adoptions from foster care has led to a greater need for post-adoption services and skilled service providers. One Church, One Child is a national organization focused on foster care and adoption. One Church, One Child is a community-based foster care and adoption ministry founded in Chicago in 1980 by Father George Clements. Their mission is to provide services for at-risk children and support adoptive, foster, and kinship families. Over 140,000 children have been placed in adoptive families through their programs. The federally-funded grant program supports programs for recruiting foster and adoptive parents based on the One Church, One Child concept, benefiting abused and neglected children by increasing the pool of qualified parents. SEC. 479B. ONE CHURCH, ONE CHILD GRANTS are added to Part E of title IV of the Social Security Act to support programs for recruiting foster and adoptive parents, benefiting abused and neglected children.

Religious organizations must not face discrimination when receiving awards. The Secretary will consider religious organizations equally for grants under this section, as long as they comply with the Establishment Clause. State or local governments cannot discriminate against religious organizations seeking funding for programs under this section. The organization with a religious character cannot be required to change its internal governance or remove religious symbols to receive a grant or participate in a funded program. Funds provided to religious organizations for programs must not be used for sectarian activities. Religious organizations must adhere to fiscal regulations similar to other non-governmental organizations when using the funds. Religious organizations receiving funds must keep the money separate from other funds. SEC. 479C.
