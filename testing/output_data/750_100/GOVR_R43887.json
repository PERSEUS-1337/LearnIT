    "content": "The Older Americans Act (OAA), enacted in 1965, provides social services and programs for individuals aged 60 and older. Services include nutrition programs, caregiver support, employment services, and programs to prevent abuse. The OAA has seven titles, with most programs administered by the Administration on Aging (AOA). The Older Americans Act (OAA) provides social services for individuals aged 60 and older. Programs are administered by the Administration on Aging (AOA) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). OAA has seven titles, with funding provided in annual appropriations. Congress has reauthorized and amended the act multiple times, with past reauthorizations extending appropriations for five years. The Older Americans Act (OAA) provides social services for individuals aged 60 and older, with programs administered by the Administration on Aging (AOA) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The last OAA reauthorization in 2006 extended appropriations for five years. Despite the authorizations expiring in FY2011, Congress has continued to fund OAA programs. This report discusses OAA funding, starting with an overview of FY2015 funding and a breakdown of current-year funding for each program. It also reviews funding history since FY2001 and summarizes legislative activity in FY2015. The curr_chunk reviews OAA's funding history since FY2001, summarizes FY2015 legislative activity, and discusses FY2015 funding decisions for selected OAA programs. Appendixes provide detailed funding information and history. For more information about the Older Americans Act, refer to CRS Report R43236. The FY2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act (P.L. 113-235) funded OAA programs at $1.878 billion, a slight increase from FY2014. Title III programs received the largest proportion of funding, with 70.7% allocated to nutrition, supportive services, family caregivers, and health promotion activities. Almost one-fourth of OAA funding was allocated to Title V, the CSEOA Program, with the remaining funds distributed among AOA-administered activities under Titles II and IV, grants to Native Americans under Title VI, and elder rights protection activities under Title VII. FY2015 funding for most OAA programs remained the same as FY2014, except for Aging Network Support Activities and Elder Rights Support Activities which received new funding for services for Holocaust survivors and an Elder Justice Initiative, respectively. In FY2015, $4.0 million in new funding was allocated for an Elder Justice Initiative under the OAA programs. Total discretionary funding for OAA programs increased slightly from FY2001 to FY2002, remained flat through FY2006, then increased annually from FY2006 to FY2010. OAA funding rose from $1.783 billion in FY2006 to $2.328 billion in FY2010, a 31% increase over that period. Funding levels have since remained below the FY2010 level. Total discretionary funding for OAA programs increased slightly from FY2001 to FY2002, remained flat through FY2006, then rose to $2.328 billion in FY2010, a 31% increase over that period. Additional funding was provided in FY2009 under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Funding declined in FY2011 through FY2013, with FY2013 funding falling below the FY2007 level. Sequestration led to a 5.5% reduction from FY2012 to FY2013. Funding for FY2014 and FY2015 was above the FY2013 level but slightly below the FY2012 level. President Obama signed the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-235) on December 16, 2014, providing $1.878 billion in FY2015 funding for OAA programs. The FY2015 appropriations law reflected the new consolidated ACL account structure, with FY2014 and FY2015 funding for OAA Title II \"Program Administration\" now reflecting program administration. Prior to P.L. 113-235, FY2015 discretionary funding for OAA programs was provided through three continuing resolutions, with temporary government-wide funding extended multiple times in late 2014. The temporary funding for FY2015 Labor-HHS-Education programs was extended through December 17, 2014, with a slight reduction in funding. The House Appropriations Committee did not hold a markup for a FY2015 appropriations bill, but a bill was introduced by the ranking Member of the Subcommittee. Introduced H.R. 5464, the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015. The bill aimed to provide increased funding for OAA Title V (CSEOA) and OAA Title III senior nutrition programs, but did not specify amounts for other OAA programs. The bill did not progress further in the legislative process. The subcommittee approved an FY2015 appropriations bill funding OAA programs at $1.871 billion, similar to FY2014 levels. The bill proposed increases in family caregiver funding and decreases in funding for the Nutrition Services Incentive Program. Additionally, $10.0 million was proposed for a new Elder Justice Initiative. The bill did not advance further in the legislative process. President Obama's FY2015 budget proposed $1.819 billion for OAA programs, with some programs funded at FY2014 levels and exceptions for new funding for ADRCs, CSEOA Program, Holocaust Survivor Assistance Fund, and a decrease in discretionary funding. The FY2015 budget proposed $5.0 million for a Holocaust Survivor Assistance Fund and $3.0 million for the White House Conference on Aging. Additionally, $25.0 million was requested for an Elder Justice Initiative. The budget also suggested transferring the administration of the CSEOA program from DOL to ACL. The FY2015 budget proposed funding for various programs including the CSEOA program, Holocaust survivors' support, ADRCs, and the White House Conference on Aging. The CSEOA program aims to provide part-time community service opportunities for older Americans. The SCSEP program was created to offer part-time community service opportunities for unemployed low-income individuals aged 55 and older with poor job prospects. The FY2015 budget proposed transferring CSEOA program administration from DOL to ACL, with a funding decrease of 13% compared to FY2014. Out of 56 grantees, 17 operate CSEOA programs in state labor departments, while the rest are in aging or health departments. The FY2015 proposal suggested transferring CSEOA program administration from DOL to ACL to consolidate oversight and streamline operations. Congressional legislation would be required for the transfer to take effect. The FY2015 proposal recommended transferring the CSEOA program from DOL to ACL to improve efficiency and target funds to areas with the greatest impact. ACL also proposed restructuring CSEOA as a community service program separate from the Workforce Investment Act framework. The CSEOA program did not align well with the Workforce Investment Act framework as older SCSEP workers are focused on increasing income and community contribution. The Senate bill proposed funding CSEOA at the FY2014 level, while H.R. 5464 suggested funding it under the DOL account at $448.3 million for FY2015. The program remained funded and administered under DOL for FY2015 with no changes. The President's FY2015 budget proposed $5.0 million in OAA Title IV funding to establish a Holocaust Survivor Assistance Fund, providing supportive services for approximately 130,000 Holocaust survivors in the United States, with 25% living in poverty. The Fund would offer services like legal assistance and case management, receiving matching dollars from private philanthropy. The Senate and H.R. 5464 bills did not allocate funding for the Holocaust Survivor Assistance Fund due to budget constraints. However, FY2015 included $2.5 million in new discretionary funding to provide supportive services for aging Holocaust survivors. Aging and Disability Resource Centers aim to be single entry points for information on public and private services. Aging and Disability Resource Centers (ADRCs) serve as centralized hubs for information on long-term services and supports (LTSS), including counseling on public and private options, access to programs like Medicaid, and discharge planning services. With over 500 sites nationwide, ADRCs aim to help individuals stay in their homes post-hospitalization. In FY2012, ADRCs had 5.2 million client contacts. In FY2012, ADRCs had 5.2 million client contacts. ADRCs received $10 million in mandatory funding under the ACA from FY2010 to FY2014, in addition to discretionary funding authorized under OAA Title II. The President's FY2015 budget proposed no FY2015 discretionary funding for ADRCs but $20.0 million each year for five years in renewed mandatory funding. AOA and CMS have provided $100 million since 2003 to develop ADRC services. The Senate bill proposed $6.1 million in discretionary funding for ADRCs to improve coordination among ADRCs, AAAs, and CILs for consumer access to long-term services and supports. H.R. 5464 did not specify a dollar amount for ADRCs, but final FY2015 funding provided $6.1 million in discretionary funding, the same as FY2014. The White House Conferences on Aging have historically focused on concerns of older individuals and provided direction to federal policymakers. The first conference was held in 1961, with subsequent conferences in 1971, 1981, 1995, and 2005. The FY2015 funding for ADRCs remained at $6.1 million, the same as in FY2014, without additional mandatory funding as requested by the President. The White House Conferences on Aging have been held in every decade since 1971. The President's FY2015 budget proposed $3.0 million for a conference in 2015, but no dedicated funding was provided in the final appropriations. The White House plans to hold the conference in Washington, DC. The White House Conference on Aging in 2015 in Washington, DC will utilize technology to engage more people. It will commemorate the anniversaries of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the Older Americans Act, focusing on retirement security, healthy aging, long-term services and supports, and elder justice. Regional forums will also be held. The White House Conference on Aging in 2015 will utilize technology to engage more people and commemorate the anniversaries of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the Older Americans Act. Regional forums and listening sessions will be held to gather input for the conference. For more information, visit http://www.whitehouseconferenceonaging.gov.
