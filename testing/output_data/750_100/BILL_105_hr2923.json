    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Early Hearing Loss Detection, Diagnosis, and Intervention Act of 1997\" with the purpose of promoting early detection and intervention for hearing loss. The Act, known as the \"Early Hearing Loss Detection, Diagnosis, and Intervention Act of 1997,\" aims to establish programs for early detection, diagnosis, and intervention for hearing loss in babies. It includes goals such as screening all babies born in hospitals for hearing loss before discharge and screening babies not born in hospitals within the first 3 months of life. Diagnostic audiologic testing should be done promptly for infants to ensure timely referral for treatment before 6 months of age. Newborn hearing screening programs should include a component for linking to diagnosis and early intervention services. Public policy on early hearing detection, diagnosis, and intervention should be research-based, recognizing the unique needs of deaf or hard-of-hearing infants and children. Deaf or hard-of-hearing individuals have unique language, learning, and communication needs that should be addressed through consultation with relevant public and private sectors. STATEWIDE EARLY DETECTION, DIAGNOSIS, AND INTERVENTION NETWORKS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will award grants to develop statewide networks for early detection, diagnosis, and intervention for newborn hearing loss. This includes supporting newborn hearing detection in hospitals and monitoring the extent of detection statewide. The grants aim to establish statewide networks for early detection, diagnosis, and intervention for newborn hearing loss, including implementing detection programs in birthing hospitals and nonhospital sites, developing models for effective screening and referral, and collecting data for research and policy development. Technical assistance, data management, and applied research are key components outlined in Section 4. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will provide grants for technical assistance to State agencies for infant hearing detection, diagnosis, and treatment. This includes data collection, standardized procedures for quality monitoring, and applied research. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will provide grants for technical assistance to State agencies for infant hearing detection, diagnosis, and intervention programs. The study aims to assess the costs and effectiveness of hearing detection programs, identify causes and risk factors for congenital hearing loss, and evaluate the effectiveness of early detection and intervention programs for children at school age. Sharing of data regarding early hearing is also promoted. The National Institutes of Health will conduct research on new screening techniques and technology for hearing loss, including clinical trials and intervention studies. Sharing data on early hearing loss with State monitoring programs is encouraged. SEC. 5. COORDINATION AND COLLABORATION. In carrying out programs under this Act, the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Director of the National Institutes of Health shall collaborate with other agencies, state and local agencies, consumer groups, individuals who are deaf and hard-of-hearing, their families, and qualified professionals proficient in deaf or hard-of-hearing. The professional personnel proficient in deaf or hard-of-hearing children's language possess specialized knowledge to serve infants, toddlers, children, and their families. The Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Director of the National Institutes of Health collaborate on policy development recommendations at Federal and State levels. The Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration and the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collaborate with various organizations on early hearing detection, diagnosis, and treatment. They also assist States in establishing networks for early detection and intervention, as well as developing a data collection system. SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of appropriations for statewide early detection, diagnosis, and intervention networks is set at $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1999, $8,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, and as needed for fiscal years 2001 through 2003. Additionally, funding for technical assistance, data management, and applied research by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is authorized at $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1999, $7,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, and as necessary for fiscal years 2001 through 2003. For the National Institutes of Health, $3,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 1999, $4,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, and necessary funds for fiscal years 2001 through 2003."
