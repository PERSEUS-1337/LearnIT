    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Travel America Now Act of 2001\". Prior to September 11, 2001, over 19 million Americans were employed in travel and travel-related jobs, with an annual payroll of $171.5 billion. The travel and tourism industry grew to be the third largest industry in the US, with over $582 billion in expenditures in 2000, generating $99.6 billion in tax revenues. In the same year, the industry created a $14 billion trade surplus for the US. Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, efforts are being made to ensure safe travel and maintain traveler confidence. Urgent measures are needed to support the travel industry and boost consumer spending. Increased consumer spending on travel and tourism is crucial for revitalizing the US economy by encouraging both personal and business travel to keep people working and stimulate cash flow. SEC. 3. PERSONAL TRAVEL CREDIT. An amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 introduces a new section for a Personal Travel Credit. The new section allows individuals to claim a credit for qualified personal travel expenses incurred between the enactment date and January 1, 2002, not exceeding $500 ($1,000 for joint returns). Expenses for qualifying personal trips include travel and lodging expenses, excluding meals and entertainment. A qualifying personal trip is defined as travel within the United States with a destination at least 100 miles away from the taxpayer. The term \"qualifying personal trip\" refers to travel within the United States that is at least 100 miles away from the taxpayer's residence, involves an overnight stay at a commercial lodging facility, and is taken after the enactment of this section. This term excludes travel expenses that are deductible for a trade or business or income-producing activity. The term \"commercial lodging facility\" includes hotels, motels, resorts, rooming houses, or campgrounds. Special rules include denying the credit to dependents and requiring expenses to be substantiated for the tax credit. The taxpayer must substantiate expenses to claim deductions under subsection (a). No double benefit is allowed for expenses eligible for a credit. A conforming amendment is made to the Internal Revenue Code. Sec. 25C: Personal travel credit. The amendments apply to taxable years after the enactment date. Temporary increase in deduction for business meals and entertainment under SEC. 4. The amendment to section 274 of the Internal Revenue Code allows for a temporary increase in the deduction for business meals and entertainment expenses, changing the limitation from 50 percent to 100 percent for expenses incurred between the enactment date and January 1, 2002. This amendment applies to taxable years ending after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 5. Net operating loss carryback for travel and tourism industry. Net operating loss carryback for travel and tourism industry for taxable years including September 12, 2001, to before January 1, 2002, allows losses to be carried back for 5 years. The new subsection allows for operating loss carryback to the 5 taxable years preceding the year of the loss, with special rules for the travel and tourism industry. The new subsection allows for operating loss carryback to the 5 taxable years preceding the year of the loss, with special rules for the travel and tourism industry, including the provision of commercial transportation or lodging.

The new subsection allows for operating loss carryback to the 5 taxable years preceding the year of the loss, with special rules for the travel and tourism industry. Applying subsection (b)(2), a travel or tourism loss for any taxable year shall be treated similarly to a specified liability loss. Taxpayers entitled to a 5-year carryback under subsection (b)(1)(H) may elect to have the carryback period determined without regard to subsection (b)(1)(H). The new subsection allows for operating loss carryback to the 5 taxable years preceding the year of the loss, with special rules for the travel and tourism industry. Taxpayers entitled to a 5-year carryback under subsection (b)(1)(H) may elect to have the carryback period determined without regard to subsection (b)(1)(H). Additionally, regulations allow for the crediting of travel or tourism losses against taxable income earned during the 5-year carryback period by related taxpayers within a controlled group of corporations. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years ending before, on, or after the date of the enactment of this Act. The Act is based on Congress's power to levy taxes as outlined in article I, section 8 of the US Constitution."
