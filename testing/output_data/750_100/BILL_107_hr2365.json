    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Electricity and Environmental Technology Research and Development Act.\" Congress finds that reliable, affordable, increasingly clean electricity is crucial for powering the growing US economy. The use of electrotechnologies, environmental concerns, competitive electricity markets, and rising energy prices highlight the importance of clean electricity. Coal, currently generating over half of US electricity, is the most abundant fossil energy resource in the country. Coal comprises over 85 percent of all fossil resources in the United States, with enough supply to last 250 years at current usage rates. Investments in emissions control technology have reduced pollutants from coal-based generating facilities by 21 percent in the past 30 years, despite a nearly tripled use for electricity generation. Continuous improvements in efficiency and environmental performance are possible for electricity generating facilities. New technologies for converting coal into electricity can eliminate emissions and improve efficiency by up to 50%, but there are risks in deploying them commercially in a competitive market. Continued research and development are needed for environmental improvement in coal-based generation. Continued research and development towards near-zero emissions in coal-based generation is important and desirable. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"cost and performance goals\" refers to those established under section 4. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy. The Secretary will assess cost and performance goals for technologies enabling cost-competitive coal use for electricity, chemical feedstocks, and transportation fuel in 2007, 2015, and 2020. Consultation with various industry representatives is required. The Secretary will issue draft cost and performance goals for public comment within 120 days of the Act's enactment. This includes input from manufacturers of advanced coal technologies, worker organizations, coal promotion and environmental protection groups, and relevant Federal and State agencies. The Secretary will issue draft cost and performance goals for public comment within 120 days of the Act's enactment, and submit the final goals to Congress within 180 days after considering public feedback. SEC. 5. STUDY. The Secretary, in cooperation with other agencies, must provide a report to Congress every 2 years identifying technologies and assessing costs for achieving specific goals. The Secretary, in cooperation with other agencies, must provide a report to Congress every 2 years identifying technologies and assessing costs for achieving specific goals. The report should include recommendations for technology development programs and additional authorities needed to achieve cost and performance goals. When carrying out the requirements of the section, the Secretary must consider the expert advice of representatives from specified entities. The Secretary is mandated to conduct a technology research and development program focused on coal-based technologies under various Acts. The program aims to achieve cost and performance goals. Authorization of appropriations totaling $100,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2002 to 2012 is granted to the Secretary for sections 4, 5, and 6. This funding is in addition to existing authorizations and does not limit Department of Energy fossil energy research and development. Additionally, a Clean Coal Power Commercial Applications Initiative is established. The Secretary will establish a clean coal power commercial applications initiative to demonstrate advanced coal-based technologies for power plants. The technologies must advance efficiency, environmental performance, and cost competitiveness beyond current standards. This initiative may include new technologies not previously demonstrated. The Secretary will transmit a plan to Congress within 120 days of the Act's enactment, outlining program elements, management structure, technical milestones, and demonstration activities for advanced coal-based technologies. The plan will focus on improving efficiency and environmental technology at coal-based electric generation units with at least 50 megawatts nameplate rating. The plan aims to implement alternative technologies to improve environmental performance by reducing sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and mercury emissions at coal-based electric generation units. It also includes recycling or reusing a significant portion of coal combustion or gasification wastes. The Act requires a cost-effective method to capture and reuse carbon dioxide, different from current technologies. SEC. 9. FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. The Secretary must solicit proposals for projects at new or existing facilities to achieve specified performance levels within 180 days of transmitting the plan to Congress. Proposals may include projects demonstrating a 3 percentage point efficiency improvement compared to current levels. The Act requires existing facilities to operate without increasing emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, particulate matter, mercury, or carbon monoxide. It also mandates a reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions based on the potential combustion concentration of coal. The Act mandates existing facilities to operate without increasing emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, particulate matter, mercury, or carbon monoxide. It also requires a reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions based on the potential combustion concentration of coal. For coal with a potential combustion concentration of less than 1.2 pounds per million British thermal units of heat input, sulfur dioxide emissions should be limited to 15 percent of the potential combustion concentration. Nitrogen oxide emissions should not exceed 0.1 pound per million British thermal units of heat for boilers other than cyclone-fired boilers. The emission levels for pollutants in existing facilities are mandated to be limited based on the Clean Air Act standards in effect at the time. This includes restrictions on sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and particulate matter emissions per million British thermal units of heat input. The Clean Air Act mandates emission limits for pollutants in existing facilities based on current standards. Financial assistance is provided by the Secretary for the production of coal combustion byproducts with increased economic value and no additional emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, particulate matter, mercury, or carbon monoxide. The Secretary provides financial assistance for projects that reduce coal utilization costs, enhance coal competitiveness for energy generation, meet specific criteria cost-effectively, and apply to 25% of coal-based electricity facilities. The Federal government will fund up to 50% of project costs under this Act. $100,000,000 is authorized annually from 2002 to 2012 for the Secretary to carry out this section, with the option to use unobligated funds. The Secretary can use unobligated funds for fossil energy programs and clean coal technology projects, reducing appropriations for the fiscal year by the amount used."
