    "content": "The Act titled \"Veterans Medicare Reimbursement Demonstration Act of 1997\" establishes a demonstration project. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Health and Human Services will jointly carry out a three-year demonstration project to provide reimbursement from the medicare program for health care services to targeted medicare-eligible veterans in VA facilities. During a three-year demonstration project starting on January 1, 1998, the Secretary of Health and Human Services may waive certain Medicare requirements to facilitate the project. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will select up to three geographic service areas for facilities to participate in the project. During a three-year demonstration project starting on January 1, 1998, the Secretary of Health and Human Services may waive certain Medicare requirements to facilitate the project. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall establish a plan for the selection of facilities under the jurisdiction of the Secretary and located within a designated geographic service area to participate in the project. The selection plan shall favor facilities suited to serve targeted Medicare-eligible individuals. Facilities selected to participate in the project must serve targeted Medicare-eligible individuals based on demand, billing capability, quality of care indicators, and other relevant factors. At least one facility in the same catchment area as a closed military medical facility under specific laws must be selected for participation in the project. The demonstration project for targeted medicare-eligible veterans is voluntary, with cost-sharing requirements similar to nongovernmental facilities. Payments received will be credited accordingly. Payments received under the demonstration project will be credited to the Department of Veterans Affairs medical appropriation. SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF REIMBURSEMENT AMOUNTS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will reimburse the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for services provided under the demonstration project at a rate equal to 95 percent of regular Medicare payment rates. The Secretaries will establish rules for computing payment amounts when not readily computed. Payments will be made periodically from Medicare trust funds, as determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Annual limit on Medicare payments for the demonstration project under the Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund is $50,000,000. Payment amounts under the project will be reduced if the Department of Veterans Affairs fails to maintain its effort to avoid shifting costs onto the Medicare program for hospital care and medical services for targeted Medicare-eligible veterans. The VA must maintain a certain level of medical expenditures for targeted veterans each fiscal year, or face reduced payments under a Medicare demonstration project. Maintenance of effort levels are determined based on previous fiscal years. In fiscal year 1998, VA medical expenditures for targeted veterans must increase or decrease in line with the percentage change in the medical care appropriation for the Department of Veterans Affairs compared to the previous fiscal year. Additionally, any decrease in VA medical expenditures for targeted veterans must be accounted for. In fiscal year 1998, VA medical expenditures for targeted veterans must increase or decrease in line with the percentage change in the medical care appropriation for the Department of Veterans Affairs compared to the previous fiscal year, accounting for any decrease in expenditures resulting from a lower rate of increase in health care costs and reduced priority in service delivery to targeted medicare-eligible individuals. In fiscal year 1998, VA medical expenditures for targeted veterans must align with the percentage change in the medical care appropriation for the Department of Veterans Affairs, considering any decrease in expenditures due to lower health care cost increases and reduced service priority for targeted medicare-eligible individuals. In fiscal year 1998, the Department of Veterans Affairs must align its medical expenditures for targeted medicare-eligible veterans with the percentage change in the medical care appropriation. This excludes expenditures for medical examinations for claims adjudication and services reimbursed under a demonstration project. The VA must ensure no increase in costs to the Medicare program by monitoring the impact on costs. The Secretaries, in consultation with the Comptroller General, will monitor expenditures under the medicare program for targeted medicare-eligible veterans during a demonstration project to compare costs with and without the project. The Comptroller General will audit these expenditures annually. The Comptroller General will submit an annual report to Congress on the increase in costs of the Secretary of Health and Human Services under the medicare program as a result of the demonstration project. If costs increase, the Secretaries must respond accordingly. If expenditures under the medicare program increase due to a demonstration project, the Secretaries must recoup the amount of the increase and prevent future increases. The Comptroller General will report to Congress annually on cost increases, and the Secretaries must take necessary steps in response. The Secretaries must recoup increased expenditures under the medicare program by using funds from the Department of Veterans Affairs. They may also suspend or terminate demonstration projects or adjust the percentage under subsection (a)(1). SEC. 4. EVALUATION AND REPORTS. An independent entity will evaluate the health services demonstration project annually and submit reports to the Secretaries and Congress by March 1 each year. The reports will include assessments of the project's results. The evaluation of the health services demonstration project will include assessing the cost to the Department of Veterans Affairs, compliance of participating facilities with quality measures, comparison of costs with reimbursements, and any savings or costs to the medicare programs. The evaluation of the health services demonstration project will assess the impact on access to care and quality of care for targeted medicare-eligible veterans. A report on the extension and expansion of the project will be submitted to Congress within six months of the final report. The Secretaries will report to Congress by March 1, 1999 on whether to extend or make permanent the demonstration project, expand it to cover more sites and increase reimbursement amounts, and whether to continue or modify project terms if extended or expanded. Additionally, a new demonstration project for payment to Managed Health-Care Plans will be evaluated for feasibility and advisability. A report will be submitted to Congress on the feasibility of reimbursing the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for health care services provided to targeted Medicare-eligible veterans in managed health-care plans.
