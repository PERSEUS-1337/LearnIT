    "content": "The \"Hospital Cooperative Agreement Act\" aims to promote collaboration among hospitals to reduce costs and enhance efficiency in healthcare delivery by avoiding unnecessary duplication of expensive medical services. Additionally, it introduces a Hospital Technology and Services Sharing Demonstration Program under the Public Health Service Act to facilitate this cooperation. The Secretary will establish a demonstration program to award grants to hospitals for collaboration on expensive medical technology. The program aims to reduce costs, increase access to care, and improve quality of care. Eligible applicants must collaborate with two or more hospitals. To be eligible for a grant, a hospital must apply to the Secretary with a desire to collaborate with other hospitals for sharing medical technology or services. The hospital applying for a grant must provide details of the activities planned under the cooperative agreement, any consideration passing to other hospitals, and additional information as required by the Secretary. Evaluation guidelines will be developed by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, and the Secretary will evaluate the applications. The Secretary, in consultation with the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, evaluates grant applications based on guidelines developed under paragraph (2) to enhance the quality of hospital care and preserve hospital facilities. The Secretary evaluates grant applications to enhance hospital care quality and preserve facilities by improving cost-effectiveness, resource utilization, and avoiding duplication. Amounts provided under the grant shall only be used for these purposes. The grant funds can only be used for collaboration among hospitals, not for purchasing facilities or equipment. Permissible uses include expenses for personnel, administrative services, support services, and instructional programs. At least three grants must demonstrate how cooperative agreements can improve care in rural areas. Cooperative agreements under this section aim to share medical technology and services among hospitals in rural areas outside metropolitan statistical areas. Medical technology includes drugs, devices, and medical procedures used in care. Eligible services for sharing must have high capital or operating costs and potential for cost savings through shared ownership. The demonstration program for shared ownership of medical services aims to reduce excess capacity in the community, including mobile clinic services. The program will run for 5 years, with a report due to Congress at the end of the term on the effectiveness of cooperative agreements in cost-saving. The section aims to reduce healthcare costs, increase access to medical services, and improve healthcare quality. The Secretary will provide recommendations for future cooperative agreements. It clarifies that hospitals can enter into cooperative agreements without violating antitrust laws. The section allows hospitals to enter into cooperative agreements without violating antitrust laws, defined as the Sherman Act, Federal Trade Commission Act, and other related laws. The Clayton Act and State antitrust laws are referenced in the authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 1994 through 1998 to carry out cooperative agreements for hospitals without violating antitrust laws."
