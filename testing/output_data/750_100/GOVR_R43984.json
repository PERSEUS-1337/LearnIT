However, they do not have complete control over their music, as demonstrated by Taylor Swift's music being available on Spotify through a cover version despite her withdrawal. Taylor Swift can withdraw her own recorded music from Spotify as a singer who owns the rights to her sound recordings. However, as a songwriter who owns the rights to her musical works, she cannot control how the music service uses other recorded versions of her songs. The payment she receives for her music depends on market forces, contracts, and federal laws. Congress wrote laws governing copyright and competition policy at a time when music was primarily accessed through radio and physical media. In the 1990s, laws were updated to address music distribution on the internet, balancing copyright protection and combating unauthorized use. The music industry has seen a shift in copyright laws as digital services have evolved. Music consumption has changed with the rise of streaming services, blurring traditional lines of exploitation. Recording industry revenues peaked at $21.3 billion in 1999. In 1999, recording industry revenues peaked at $21.3 billion. The introduction of Napster in the same year revolutionized file-sharing. Apple's iTunes Music Store launched in 2003, offering legal song purchases online. By 2012, digital downloads surpassed physical media sales, with Apple dominating the market. However, digital download sales started declining after 2012 due to the rise of streaming services. The rise of streaming services like Spotify led to a decline in digital download sales, prompting Apple to launch Apple Music in 2015. Subscription music services now account for a significant portion of total U.S. recording industry retail spending, increasing from 9% in 2011 to 67% in 2017 according to the RIAA. Consumer spending on music saw a significant shift from declining revenues to flat growth between 2014 and 2015, followed by a 10% increase between 2015 and 2016, and a 14% increase between 2016 and 2017. Despite these changes, annual spending on music by U.S. consumers remains nearly two-thirds below its 1999 peak, impacting how performers and music creators are compensated under copyright law. Owners of musical works have legal rights and typically license them to third parties. These rights include the right to reproduce and distribute the work, known as a \"mechanical right.\" The term \"mechanical right\" dates back to the 1909 Copyright Act, where music publishers issued licenses for the reproduction of musical compositions. Despite changes in technology, such as vinyl records and digital copies, the term has remained to refer to reproduction and distribution rights for music. The Copyright Act provides federal protection for sound recordings fixed after February 15, 1972. Owners of musical works and sound recordings have the right to perform works publicly, but for sound recordings, this right only applies to digital audio transmissions. Some music services have agreements to pay royalties for pre-1972 recordings. Sound recording public performance rights under federal copyright laws are granted only to recordings fixed after February 15, 1972, for digital audio transmissions. Examples include webcasting, digital subscription services, and music streaming services like Pandora and Spotify. Consumers of compact discs purchase rights to listen to songs as often as they wish. Retail outlets selling digital or physical sound recordings pay distribution subsidiaries of major record labels. Radio listeners have less control over song playback compared to purchasing the song. Broadcast radio stations are not required to pay public performance royalties to record labels and artists under the Copyright Act. The Copyright Act does not require broadcast radio stations to pay public performance royalties to record labels and artists, but they must pay royalties to music publishers and songwriters for notes and lyrics. Congress determined in 1995 that the promotional value of radio airplay outweighs revenue lost by record labels and artists. Digital services must pay both record labels and music publishers for public performance rights. Interactive music streaming services allow users to choose songs they want to hear, making temporary copies known as \"ephemeral recordings.\" These services also offer on-demand listening experiences similar to playing a CD or listening to a radio broadcast, where digital files are downloaded to consumers' devices for multiple listeners to select songs. These digital reproductions are called \"conditional downloads.\" The music industry comprises three categories: songwriters and music publishers, recording artists and record labels, and music licensees. These entities receive royalties for reproducing and distributing musical works and sound recordings. Songwriters work with music publishers to promote songs and license intellectual property. Publishers may pay advances to songwriters in exchange for a portion of the copyright in their compositions. The publisher's role is to monitor, promote, and generate revenue from music in various formats requiring mechanical licensing rights. They often contract with performing rights organizations to collect payment for public performances. Songwriters and publishers share royalty income with subpublishers and coauthors. Music publishers in the music industry have standardized contract terms with a 50-50 income division between publisher and songwriter. Major publishers like Sony/ATV, Universal Music, and Warner Music account for over half of U.S. music publishing revenue. Independent publishing companies handle the creative aspects of songwriting management. Independent publishers manage their own music catalogs and are not affiliated with major publishers. Some songwriters control their own publishing rights and may hire individuals to administer their royalties. Record labels are responsible for finding musical talent. Record labels, including the three major ones, are responsible for discovering talent, recording music, and promoting artists. They also distribute physical and electronic copies of sound recordings through large networks. The distribution role of record labels is evolving due to the decline in physical music consumption. Record labels handle various functions related to selling digital copies of songs, including adding data for royalty identification, negotiating with streaming services, and monitoring sales. Recording artists can either contract with a label or distribute their own recordings. Contracts often involve transferring copyrights to the label for specific periods and regions in exchange for services. Record labels sign recording artists to contracts for defined periods and regions, providing financial support and guidance in exchange for a share of royalties. Major record labels like Sony, Universal, and Warner dominate the industry's revenue. The music industry is dominated by major record labels like Sony, Universal, and Warner. Many smaller record labels rely on these majors for distribution. For example, Taylor Swift is signed to Big Machine Records, which has a distribution agreement with Universal Music Group. Chance the Rapper, a recording artist, retains his copyrights and distributes his music independently. He gives away his music for free, earns from tours and merchandise sales. Apple Music paid him $500,000 for exclusive streaming rights to his album, Coloring Book. The album made history by ranking among the top 10 U.S. albums in a week on Billboard. A record producer is responsible for bringing the creative product into tangible form, involving creative and administrative tasks. Record labels used to hire producers for entire albums, but now artists contract with producers directly, allowing them to control compensation terms. Producers with negotiating power may demand royalties. Sound engineers run recording sessions under the producer's oversight. A sound engineer runs recording sessions under the producer's oversight, while a mixer pieces together polished finished products. Mixers typically receive one-time payments per track, but some may negotiate for a share of the artist's royalties. The 1909 Copyright Act recognized the copyright owner's exclusive right to make mechanical reproductions of music. A mechanical license allows for audio-only reproduction of music on mechanical devices like player pianos, phonograph records, and CDs. Concerns arose during the 1909 Copyright Act about a player-piano manufacturer, Aeolian Company, potentially creating a monopoly by acquiring exclusive rights from music publishers. In response to concerns about a potential monopoly by Aeolian Company, Congress established the first compulsory license in U.S. copyright law. This allows music publishers to withhold the right to reproduce a musical work, but once a sound recording is distributed to the public, others can use it upon payment of a royalty. For example, when Ryan Adams covered Taylor Swift's album 1989 in 2015, he did not need her permission but paid a specified rate. The 1909 Copyright Act established a compulsory mechanical license where Recording Companies paid a set royalty rate without needing permission. The rate was initially $0.02 per \"part manufactured\" and later changed to a \"per song\" basis. Congress later codified this license in the Copyright Act of 1976. The Copyright Act of 1976 codified the compulsory mechanical license as 17 U.S.C. Section 115, specifying rates payable for each distributed record. Congress amended the law multiple times, changing the rate-setting process and defining \"phonorecord\" as audio-only recordings. Procedures for obtaining mechanical licenses are outlined in regulations by the Register of Copyrights. Licensees must serve a notice of intention (NOI) to license music on the copyright owner or the Copyright Office if the owner's address is unknown. The NOI must be filed within 30 days of making a new recording or before distribution. Licensees unable to locate owners must set aside money owed until they can pay them. The 1976 Copyright Act made it easier for owners to sue by removing liability limitations and making potential licensees ineligible for a compulsory license if they fail to provide the required NOI. The potential licensee's failure to obtain a negotiated license for musical works constitutes infringement under copyright law. The requirement for copyright holders to file a \"notice of use\" has been removed, affecting their ability to receive royalties under a compulsory license. This lack of public record may impact the enforcement of copyright ownership. The distribution of copyrighted works triggered the NOI requirements, leading to controversy between rights holders and licensees. Adjusting the statutory mechanical royalty rate periodically was suggested in a 1967 hearing by a representative of the National Music Publishers Association. In 1967, the National Music Publishers Association proposed adjusting the statutory mechanical royalty rate periodically to reflect accepted standards. In 1975, Barbara Ringer suggested simplifying the administration of compulsory licenses by establishing a separate royalty tribunal. This tribunal, created by Congress in the 1976 Copyright Act, considers four policy objectives when setting royalty rates for mechanical licenses. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) was established in 2004 to replace the tribunal for determining rates for mechanical licenses. The objectives for setting these rates include maximizing public access to works, ensuring fair returns for copyright owners and users, reflecting contributions of both parties, and minimizing industry disruptions. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB), established in 2004, sets licensing rates every five years for mechanical and certain other services. The CRB rate acts as a ceiling for what an owner may charge, while voluntary licenses can be negotiated. In 1995, the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act amended 17 U.S.C. Section 115 to cover the reproduction and distribution of musical works by digital transmission. In 1995, the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act amended 17 U.S.C. Section 115 to cover the reproduction and distribution of musical works by digital transmission, specifically digital phonorecord deliveries (DPDs). Congress directed that rates and terms for DPDs should distinguish between incidental DPDs and general DPDs, sparking a debate on what constitutes an \"incidental DPD.\" The Copyright Office proposed new rules in July 2008 to address this issue. In July 2008, the Copyright Office proposed new rules for the music industry to survive in the 21st Century. In September 2008, a landmark agreement was reached regarding the applicability of mechanical licenses to music streaming, addressing concerns about declining revenues from mechanical royalties. In 2009, music streaming services agreed to pay publishers a percentage of their revenues for interactive streams and limited downloads. Noninteractive streaming services like Pandora were exempt from obtaining mechanical licenses. The agreement was modified in 2012 and set mechanical royalty rates and standards for five years. The CRB sets mechanical royalty rates and standards for music streaming services, covering 2013-2017 and 2018-2022 periods. Rates for physical deliveries and downloads are flat, while interactive streaming rates are formula-based. The CRB sets mechanical royalty rates for music streaming services based on formulas using revenues or total licensing costs. Rates determine the pool of money for publishers, with minimum per-subscriber payments. Zero rates apply during free trials. The rates for public performance royalties are determined by oversight from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York or through negotiations between publishers and licensees. Songwriters were granted the exclusive right to publicly perform their works in 1897, requiring establishments to obtain permission to perform their music. This right allowed copyright owners to profit from their musical works despite the challenges of public performances. To address the logistical issue of licensing and collecting payment for public performances, composers formed ASCAP in 1914. ASCAP is a performance rights organization that issues public performance licenses on behalf of songwriters and publishers. Licensees typically obtain a blanket license from ASCAP. SESAC was founded in 1930 as a competing PRO to help European publishers and writers collect royalties from U.S. licensees. It later expanded its representation to include U.S. composers as broadcast radio grew in popularity in the United States. In response to the growth of radio and declining sheet music sales, ASCAP negotiated a public performance license with radio broadcasters in 1932. This established rates based on a percentage of each station's advertising revenues. To counter ASCAP's dominance, broadcasters founded BMI in 1939 to attract new composers and secure copyrights of new songs. BMI also convinced publishers to switch from ASCAP. BMI was established in 1939 to counter ASCAP's dominance in music licensing. They convinced publishers to switch from ASCAP to BMI. ASCAP and BMI originally had exclusive rights to negotiate for their members and offered blanket licenses for all songs in their catalogs. When the licensing agreement between ASCAP and radio stations expired in 1940, three-quarters of radio stations prohibited songs by ASCAP composers. The U.S. Department of Justice investigated ASCAP and BMI for antitrust violations in 1941. Both organizations entered consent decrees to avoid lawsuits. The decrees included provisions for nonexclusive licensing rights and granting licenses to any user. ASCAP and BMI must grant licenses to any user without discrimination, accept any songwriter or music publisher that meets minimum standards, and offer alternative licenses. Prospective licensees can seek a reasonable license fee determination from federal district court judges in the Southern District of New York. The public performance of musical works is not subject to compulsory licensing. The public performance of musical works is not subject to compulsory licensing. ASCAP and BMI rates are overseen by federal district court judges, while SESAC and GMR rates are based on marketplace negotiations. Judges must ensure rates are \"reasonable\" and consider the PROs' market power. 17 U.S.C. Section 114(i) prohibits judges from approving rates if they are not reasonable. Current law prohibits judges from considering rates paid by digital services to record labels and artists when setting public performance rates for music publishers and songwriters. This provision was included in the 1995 DPRA to prevent adverse effects on music performance royalties. The concern among writers and publishers is that digital services paying a public performance licensing fee for sound recordings may reduce the money available for public performances of musical works. The DOJ periodically reviews the ASCAP and BMI consent decrees, with the last amendments in 2001 and 1994 respectively. In 2016, the DOJ completed a review of the consent decrees, and in 2017, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld BMI's challenge to the DOJ. The 1971 Sound Recording Act was created to address the unauthorized duplication of sound recordings. It applied to recordings fixed on or after February 15, 1972. The U.S. Supreme Court later ruled on federal copyright law. In 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that California's record piracy law applied to pre-1972 sound recordings. States then passed their own antipiracy laws. In 1975, the U.S. Department of Justice recommended excluding pre-1972 sound recordings from federal copyright laws to preserve antipiracy laws. The House Judiciary Committee noted that without this exclusion, many works would enter the public domain. The 1976 Copyright Revision Act preempted state laws for copyright protection, exempting pre-1972 works. States can protect pre-1972 sound recordings until 2067, after which federal law will preempt state protection and these recordings may enter the public domain. Congress established a license in 1998 for noninteractive digital services to make server reproductions of sound recordings. In 1998, Congress established a license under Section 112 of the Copyright Act for server reproductions of sound recordings. The rates and terms of this license are set by the CRB, and copyright owners receive fees through SoundExchange. Recording artists who do not own the copyrights do not receive Section 112 fees. The Copyright Act did not initially grant public performance rights to record labels and artists for their sound recordings. Income was primarily earned through retail sales of physical products like CDs. Concerns over music piracy arose with the rise of the internet in the 1990s. Amendments in 1995 and 1998, including the DPRA and DMCA, addressed these issues by granting rights and protections to the recording industry. The DPRA in 1998 granted record labels and artists exclusive public performance rights for sound recordings on certain digital audio services. It also created a compulsory license for licensing sound recordings for specific subscription services. Music publishers and writers were concerned about record companies withholding licenses and affecting their ability to earn. The DPRA in 1998 granted record labels and artists exclusive public performance rights for sound recordings on digital audio services. The provision was a compromise between music publishers and record labels. After debates, the DMCA was adopted to address public performance royalties for sound recordings. The DMCA expanded statutory licensing provisions for online music services, setting up a bifurcated system for rate-setting standards. Services existing before July 31, 1998, are subject to one standard, while webcasters and newer music streaming services are subject to different rates and terms. Newer music services entering the market after July 31, 1998, are subject to rate-setting standards that aim to reflect negotiations between a willing buyer and seller. One key difference is the inclusion of minimizing disruptive impacts on industry structure and practices. This standard has led to lower copyright royalty rates in some cases, but its overall effect is hard to predict. The Section 801(b)(1) rate-setting standard aims to prevent disruption of existing services' operations. The DPRA allows negotiation between sound recording rights owners and interactive music streaming services for public performance rights. Interactive services enable individuals to arrange for specific recording transmissions. Certain subscription and interactive audio services may impact sound sales. The impact of subscription and interactive audio services on traditional record sales and copyright owners' control and compensation is a significant concern. Interactive services pose the greatest threat to traditional record sales and livelihoods dependent on revenue from them. Congress does not mandate public performance licenses for broadcast radio stations, aiming to strike a balance among various stakeholders. The Senate Judiciary Committee in 1995 emphasized the importance of maintaining the mutually beneficial relationship between broadcast radio and the music industry. They highlighted the benefits that the radio industry has provided to sound recordings and performers through airplay and promotional activities. The committee stated that legislation should not jeopardize this relationship, distinguishing broadcast radio from other services. The CRB sets statutory rates for broadcasts to fulfill license conditions. Rate determination proceedings involve copyright users, holders, and trade groups negotiating for three months. If no agreement is reached, written statements are submitted, discovery is conducted, and negotiations continue. During rate-setting proceedings, participants may reach agreements on statutory rates, which are then submitted to the CRB for review. If no agreement is reached, the CRB holds an evidentiary hearing and issues a determination published in the Federal Register. Participants can challenge CRB determinations through a rehearing or appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals. RIAA established SoundExchange in 2000 as a common agent for royalties, later becoming independent. SoundExchange deducts costs before distributing payments using the \"willing buyer-willing seller\" standard. The CRB has adopted different royalty rates for public performances of sound recordings based on different standards. Congress has passed legislation allowing SoundExchange to negotiate alternative royalty schemes in response to complaints about excessive rates. SoundExchange had temporary authority to negotiate alternative royalty schemes binding on all copyright owners instead of CRB-set rates. Agreements allowed music streaming services to pay royalties based on revenue percentage. The most recent agreements expired in December 2015. CRB began setting royalty rates for noninteractive music streaming services for 2016-2020. CRB was prohibited from considering agreements negotiated under the Webcaster Settlement Acts. During the CRB rate proceeding, there was a dispute over whether direct agreements based on the Pureplay settlement could be used as evidence. SoundExchange argued for a broad rule of exclusion to prevent this, while Pandora Media and Clear Channel disagreed, stating that it would require disregarding every benchmark. The CRB rate proceeding involved a dispute over using direct agreements based on the Pureplay settlement as evidence. SoundExchange argued for exclusion, while Pandora Media and Clear Channel disagreed, stating it would require disregarding every benchmark. The CRB referred novel material questions of law to the Register of Copyrights for resolution. The Register ruled that the CRB may consider directly negotiated licenses reflecting provisions in a Webcaster Settlement Act agreement. The CRB issued its decision on rates for the 2016-2020 period in December 2015. The CRB issued its decision on rates for the 2016-2020 period on December 16, 2015. Streaming services must pay $0.17 per 100 streams in 2016. Rate increases from 2017-2020 are tied to the Consumer Price Index. Ephemeral royalties fees are set at 5% of total Section 114 royalties for the same period. The CRB issued rate decisions for digital subscription services and satellite radio for 2018-2022. Public performance rates vary based on music service type and start date. Royalties under Section 114 are distributed to copyright owners, featured artists, nonfeatured musicians, and vocalists. Record producers are not included in the distribution. The act does not include record producers in the split of royalties for public performances by noninteractive digital services. Producers can be compensated via SoundExchange if the artist provides a letter of direction. The distinction between interactive and noninteractive services is debated. The distinction between interactive and noninteractive services for setting rates for public performance rights is defined by 17 U.S.C. Section 114. This section specifies that interactive services allow users to receive specially created programs or specific sound recordings upon request. In contrast, 17 U.S.C. Section 115 does not differentiate between interactive and noninteractive services when determining digital service requirements. The CRB distinguishes between interactive and noninteractive services for obtaining mechanical rights from music publishers. In 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that a music streaming service using user feedback to play personalized songs within a genre is not interactive, aiming to protect sound recording copyright holders from sales cannibalization. The court's decision on the cannibalization of record sales focused on the predictability of songs in an interactive service like LAUNCHcast offered by Launch Media, Inc. The LAUNCHcast online radio service by Launch Media, Inc., owned by Yahoo!, Inc., created unique playlists for users. The court determined LAUNCHcast was noninteractive due to the unpredictability of playlists. Noninteractive services must limit features to be eligible for compulsory licensing under the Copyright Act. This includes not announcing in advance when specific songs, albums, or artists will be played. The Launch Media decision affirmed that personalized music streaming services like Pandora and iHeartRadio can obtain statutory licenses for public performances of sound recordings. The CRB-established rates do not currently differentiate between customized services and other radio-style internet services. Spotify allows users access to specific albums, songs, and artists. Spotify offers users access to albums, songs, and artists on demand. Users can have limited free access with ads or pay a monthly fee for ad-free listening on multiple devices and offline music playback. Congress granted antitrust exemptions in 1995 for statutory licensees and copyright owners to negotiate collectively with SiriusXM and subscription services over royalties. The DPRA allows agents to negotiate royalty rates with SiriusXM and subscription services for public performance rights on a nonexclusive basis. The exemption ensures that common agents are nonexclusive, preventing copyright owners from demanding high rates. However, the DPRA does not provide an antitrust exemption for negotiating rates for interactive services. In 1998, Congress added Section 112 to the DMCA to address ephemeral server reproductions by webcasters and online services, providing an antitrust exemption for negotiating royalty payments. Unlike Section 114(e)(1), Section 112(e)(2) does not require a nonexclusive designation for common agents. The House Judiciary Committee report states that the designation must be on a nonexclusive basis, following existing antitrust exemptions in copyright law. In 2004, Congress created the CRB with provisions regarding licensees' obligation to make payments, including returning any excess amounts previously paid. In 2006, the CRB designated SoundExchange as the sole \"collective\" to receive royalties, allowing parties to continue making payments while appealing CRB decisions. The CRB designated SoundExchange as the sole \"collective\" for receiving royalties on an interim basis. Royalty Logic, a subsidiary of Music Reports, Inc., requested recognition as a collective to compete with SoundExchange. The CRB argued that Sections 112(e) and 114(e) did not allow for additional collectives. The CRB designated SoundExchange as the sole \"collective\" for receiving royalties on an interim basis, rejecting Royalty Logic's request for recognition as a collective to compete with SoundExchange. The CRB argued that Sections 112(e) and 114(e) did not allow for additional collectives, stating that copyright owners and performers are designated agents. The CRB also emphasized that in the statutory licensing context, the \"willing buyer/willing seller\" standard applies to royalty rate-setting. The CRB designated SoundExchange as the sole \"collective\" for receiving royalties, based on the \"willing buyer/willing seller\" standard. The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld this decision in 2009, rejecting Royalty Logic's argument against a single entity receiving payments. The CRB designated SoundExchange as the sole entity to receive royalty payments, based on the \"willing buyer/willing seller\" standard. The court ruled that the CRB's authority to set royalty payment terms did not preclude designating a single entity to receive payments. SoundExchange was designated as the sole collective by the CRB for royalty payments from licensees, based on economic and administrative efficiency. In 2015, agreements were reached with public and college radio stations on webcast sound rates. The CRB approved agreements with public and college radio stations on webcast sound rates, making them binding on all copyright owners and performers. SoundExchange was designated as the sole collective for collecting and distributing royalties for the period January 1, 2016-December 31, 2020, with an antitrust exemption created by Congress. In 2004, Congress extended an antitrust exemption for owners and licensees of musical works to designate common agents for negotiating mechanical licenses. Music publishers in the US collect mechanical royalties through third-party administrators like the Harry Fox Agency. In 2015, SESAC acquired the Harry Fox Agency from the National Music Publishers Association. The CRB has not specified an agent for administering mechanical licenses. Music publishers may issue and administer mechanical licenses themselves. In 2006, Royalty Logic, Inc. raised concerns about competition among agents for licensing musical works and collecting mechanical royalties. Noncash considerations, like equity stakes, can influence the prices paid by interactive services for music access. Sony acquired an 18% equity stake in Spotify, granting Spotify rights to use their sound recordings. Sony sold a portion of its stake when Spotify went public and announced sharing proceeds with artists and independent labels. Rates paid by interactive services to music publishers are linked to rates paid to record labels for performance rights, which are negotiated in the free market. Music publishers can participate in deals with digital music services for mechanical royalties by assigning value to equity stakes or advertising revenues. Concerns have been raised by songwriters and recording artists about payments from direct deals with digital music services. Music publishers and record labels are not receiving fair shares of performance royalty revenues from streaming, potentially resulting in lower payments than under statutory licensing schemes. ASCAP and BMI represent about 90% of songs available for licensing in the US, while SESAC and Global Music Rights handle a smaller share. Publishers can affiliate with multiple PROs, but songwriters can only choose one. Music publishers alleged they have not received a fair share of performance royalty revenues from streaming services due to ASCAP and BMI consent decrees inhibiting their ability to negotiate market rates. Publishers pressured ASCAP and BMI to allow them to withdraw digital rights to negotiate directly with digital services. ASCAP and BMI amended rules in 2011 and 2013 to allow music publishers to license public performance rights for new media uses, including digital streaming services. The major music publishers and PROs challenged the publishers' partial withdrawal of rights before the ASCAP and BMI rate courts in New York, where it was ruled that publishers must either have their entire song catalog \"all in\" or \"all out\" of the PRO. Following the rulings, they asked the Department of Justice to propose modifications. The music publishers and PROs requested modifications to the consent decrees from the Department of Justice, including allowing partial grants of rights, expedited arbitration for rate-setting, and bundled licenses. DOJ began evaluating the consent decrees in June 2014 and sought comments on \"100% licensing\" versus \"fractional licensing\" in 2015. The Department of Justice completed its review and announced that the consent decrees required PROs to issue 100% licenses for all songs in their catalogs, promoting competition. DOJ did not propose modifications but called on Congress to reconsider how copyright law is applied to music. The Department of Justice completed its review of the consent decrees, calling for 100% licensing for all songs in PROs' catalogs. Congress was urged to reconsider copyright law in the music industry. BMI filed a lawsuit in New York, where Judge Stanton ruled in favor of fractional licensing. The Second Circuit Court upheld this decision in December 2017. In December 2017, Judge Stanton ruled that licensees must serve a Notice of Intention (NOI) to the copyright holder before distributing phonorecords and paying royalties. The Copyright Office allows bulk electronic filing of NOIs for up to 100 songs at once. The Copyright Office allows bulk electronic filing of NOIs for up to 100 songs at once, reducing filing costs significantly. Licensees like Spotify, Amazon, and Google began filing NOIs in bulk one week after the procedural change. According to Billboard, digital music service companies contacted the U.S. Copyright Office in late 2015 to digitize the compulsory licensing process for proper compensation to songwriters and publishers. Lawsuits were filed against Spotify and other online music services for illegally streaming copyrighted works, some settled while others are pending. In April 2018, the House of Representatives unanimously passed the Music Modernization Act, encompassing provisions from various bills. The Music Modernization Act, encompassing provisions from various bills, would create a new nonprofit \"mechanical licensing collective\" funded by online music services to offer broad blanket mechanical licenses. It also changes the process of suing for infringement of mechanical licenses and sets new standards for royalty rates for musical works used by subscription services and satellite digital audio services. The Music Modernization Act would extend federal copyright protection to sound recordings made before February 15, 1972. It also establishes procedures for producers, mixers, and sound engineers to receive royalty payments for sound recordings. Online music services could obtain a broad blanket mechanical license under the bill. The Register of Copyrights would designate a new nonprofit entity as a \"Mechanical Licensing Collective\" within nine months of enactment. The Music Modernization Act establishes a new nonprofit entity called the Mechanical Licensing Collective (MLC) and a digital licensee coordinator. The MLC would have a 17-member board of directors and be funded by online music services through assessments set by the CRB. The MLC's duties include maintaining a musical works database. The Register of Copyrights would review the designations every five years. The MLC's authorized duties include maintaining a musical works database, administering blanket licenses, identifying musical works, locating copyright owners, administering ownership claims, providing administrative services for voluntary licenses, and collecting/distributing royalties. The Mechanical Licensing Collective (MLC) is responsible for collecting and distributing royalties from online music services to rights holders. Songwriters receive at least 50% of royalties for unmatched works. The MLC is prohibited from negotiating royalty rates, granting licenses for public performances, or engaging in government lobbying activities. Authorized duties include establishing governance structure, membership criteria, and collecting dues from members. The digital licensing collective is responsible for enforcing notice and payment obligations, establishing assessment rates, and maintaining records of activities. It is prohibited from government lobbying. Failure to provide reports or royalties puts online music services in default of the blanket license, allowing them to seek review in federal court. An online music service can seek review in federal court if they believe the digital licensing collective improperly terminated a blanket license. Copyright owners are prohibited from suing a music service with a valid blanket license for infringement. If unresolved, a claim can be brought to federal court. The Music Modernization Act limits the remedies available to copyright owners for unauthorized reproduction or distribution of musical works before the \"license availability date\". Online music services must comply with specified requirements to avoid damages or other remedies for infringement. The CRB would use the \"willing buyer/willing seller\" standard to set royalty rates for musical works and sound recordings for preexisting subscription services and satellite digital audio services. Judges in the Southern District of New York could consider rates for public performances of sound recordings when setting rates for online services and digital subscription services. The CRB would use the \"willing buyer/willing seller\" standard to set royalty rates for musical works and sound recordings for preexisting subscription services and satellite digital audio services. Judges in the Southern District of New York could consider rates for public performances of sound recordings when setting rates for online services and digital subscription services. The current system of assigning judges in the Southern District of New York to oversee cases related to the ASCAP and BMI consent decrees would change, with a random process used to determine which judge hears rate setting cases. The House Judiciary Committee report proposes a change in assigning judges for rate proceedings related to consent decrees. Judges overseeing consent decrees would not handle rate proceedings to ensure impartiality. Sound recording creators from specific dates would be entitled to payments from digital music services for public performances. The proposed change in assigning judges for rate proceedings related to consent decrees would ensure impartiality. Rights owners of pre-1972 sound recordings must file information with the Copyright Office to be entitled to statutory damages or attorney's fees. Regulations will be issued for filing sound recording identification information and contact information by licensees. The bill provides federal protection for pre-1972 sound recordings until February 15, 2067. Producers, mixers, and sound engineers can seek royalties through a nonprofit collective designated by the CRB with a letter of direction from a featured artist. The entity distributing royalties must be a nonprofit collective designated by the CRB, and it modifies 17 U.S.C. \u00a7114(g) by replacing \"agent\" with \"nonprofit collective.\" The CRB stated that a collective does not need formal recognition before involvement in royalty distribution. Copyright owners and performers can designate collectives for royalties. In 2017, Senator Barrasso and Representative Conaway introduced resolutions supporting the Local Radio Freedom Act. Conaway introduced H.Con.Res. 13, Supporting the Local Radio Freedom Act, which opposes new fees on radio stations for playing sound recordings. In contrast, Representative Issa introduced the PROMOTE Act of 2017, giving copyright owners the right to withdraw their music from radio stations. In July 2017, Representative Jim Sensenbrenner introduced the Transparency in Music Licensing and Ownership Act, H.R. 3350, which aims to create a searchable database for musical works and sound recordings. Broadcast radio stations can play sound recordings without permission under certain conditions, such as paying royalties or broadcasting religious, educational, or low-power FM content. The Copyright Alternative in Small-Claims Enforcement (CASE) Act of 2017, H.R. 3945, introduced by Representative Hakeem Jeffries, aims to establish a Copyright Claims Board for copyright owners to address infringement cases outside of U.S. district courts. The board, housed within the Copyright Office, would handle civil copyright cases with damages capped at $30,000. The Accessibility for Curators, Creators, Educators, Scholars, and Society (ACCESS) to Recordings Act, S. 2933, introduced by Senator Ron Wyden in May 2018, aims to provide federal copyright protection for pre-1972 sound recordings. This bill would allow rights holders to receive payments from digital services for public performances of their works and preempt state copyright protection. Owners of pre-1972 sound recording copyrights would need to give timely notice during a three-year window to be eligible for statutory damages or attorney's fees for infringement. Pre-1972 sound recording copyright owners must provide timely notice of federal copyright registration and infringement to the alleged infringer. If infringement has ceased when action is taken, owners cannot receive statutory damages or attorney's fees. Sound recordings made before February 15, 1972, enter the public domain 95 years after release or 120 years after recording. Works recorded between 1923 and 1930 are protected until December 31, 2025. Works recorded between 1923 and 1930 are protected until December 31, 2025, if the copyright owner engages in normal commercial exploitation, complies with regulations, and notifies the Register of Copyrights; otherwise, the recordings enter the public domain."
