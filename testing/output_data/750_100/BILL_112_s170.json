    "content": "The Act titled \"Helping Responsible Homeowners Act\" allows for affordable refinancing of mortgages owned or guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The \"Helping Responsible Homeowners Act\" defines key terms such as Director, Enterprise, and Qualified mortgage, which are essential for the Act's implementation. The \"Helping Responsible Homeowners Act\" defines terms like cooperative ownership housing, Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, and refinancing mortgage. The \"Helping Responsible Homeowners Act\" outlines requirements for refinancing qualified mortgages, including using the loan amount to pay off existing debt and closing costs, ensuring the property remains the same, and specifying a fair interest rate. The mortgage must have a fair interest rate not exceeding 40 basis points above the required net yield for a 60-day commitment to purchase a prime conventional conforming fixed rate mortgage. Loan-to-value ratio is not limited, and prepayment penalties are waived. The mortgage refinanced must have prepayment penalties and fees waived, with a term to maturity not exceeding 40 years. The Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation have the authority to carry out the program. The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation will implement a program to refinance qualified mortgages on single-family housing it owns through a refinancing mortgage. The program will also involve the purchase and securitization of these refinancing mortgages by the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. The Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation will refinance qualified mortgages upon request, without charging any upfront fees beyond the standard guarantee fee. Servicers holding second liens on qualified mortgages must allow for lien resubordination to enable refinancing. Qualified mortgages originated by a servicer or creditor will be ineligible for purchase or guarantee by the Federal National Mortgage Association or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. The requirement to refinance qualified mortgages does not apply after one year from the enactment of this Act, but the Director may extend the program in one-year increments at their discretion. The Director will issue regulations or guidance for the program established under this section, which may be extended in 1-year increments. The Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation will require mortgage servicers to inform borrowers about the refinancing program. The Director will include information on the program's progress in the monthly report on Foreclosure Prevention & Refinance."
