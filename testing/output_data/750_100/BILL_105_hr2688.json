Congress finds that accurate and timely information on economic development programs is essential for maintaining the national economy and addressing unemployment and underemployment in regions and communities. Congress finds that economic development information is crucial for addressing unemployment and underemployment. Previous efforts by the Economic Development Administration have successfully provided information to communities affected by military or Department of Energy closures. In furtherance of maintaining the national economy, Congress declares the need to expand the provision of economic development information. The expansion of economic development information is essential to help areas facing economic distress. This information should offer access to various government and economic resources in a user-friendly format for those seeking to utilize it for economic development purposes. The Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section on the Office of Economic Development Information. This aims to provide easy access to government and economic resources for areas in economic distress. The Secretary will establish an Office of Economic Development Information within the Economic Development Administration. The Office will serve as a central information hub for economic development programs at the federal, state, and local levels, assisting applicants in accessing financial and technical assistance. The Office of Economic Development Information will develop electronic links to databases from various government and private entities to assist in identifying and applying for assistance under economic development programs. The Office of Economic Development Information will provide relevant information on available economic development programs at the Federal, State, and local levels, including contact personnel, application process details, eligibility requirements, selection procedures, and economic data and trends. The Office of Economic Development Information offers data on economic trends, trade impacts, defense spending, and technology changes. It includes case studies, best practices, technology programs, and compilations of economic development resources. The Office of Economic Development Information provides resources for economic development, including revolving loan funds, venture capital, and sustainable development initiatives. Public access to data services is ensured by the Office. The Office of Economic Development Information ensures public access to its information clearinghouse through various means, including an Internet website with sorted key locations by economic development topics. The Office of Economic Development Information provides public access to resources through a toll-free number, online access, printed materials, workshops, and information specialists. Coordination with other federal departments and agencies is also emphasized. The Secretary will coordinate with other federal departments and agencies to achieve the objectives of this section. \"Economic development\" in this context includes economic adjustment, disaster recovery, industrial retention, and defense reinvestment.
