    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Artists' Rights and Theft Prevention Act of 2004\" or the \"ART Act\". Congressional findings are also included in the Act. Congress finds that intellectual property is crucial for innovation and economic development, deserving protection under the law. Music, film, software, and other forms of intellectual property are vital sectors of the US economy. The industries accounted for over 5% of the US GDP in 2001, nearly 6% of US employment, and led in foreign sales and exports. Congress passed the \"No Electronic Theft (NET) Act\" to address illegal reproduction and distribution of copyrighted materials online. President Clinton signed the \"No Electronic Theft (NET) Act\" in 1997 to strengthen copyright and trademark laws for prosecuting individuals involved in large-scale illegal reproduction or distribution of copyrighted works. The Act's economic harm requirement makes investigations resource-intensive and challenging, aiming for broader deterrence and easier prosecution. The distribution of prerelease commercial works can cause significant economic harm, especially through the use of camcorders in movie theaters to make illegal copies of films. Online theft of copyrighted works remains a challenge for enforcement. Online theft of music, film, software, and intellectual property is on the rise, causing a significant negative impact on the US economy. Sales in the music industry dropped by almost 31 percent from 2000 to 2003. Federal legislation is needed to combat online theft and its economic consequences. Article 1, section 8 of the United States Constitution grants Congress the power to protect the rights of authors and inventors for their creations. This includes regulating commerce with foreign nations and among states. The music, film, software, and other intellectual property industries are crucial for the US economy.
