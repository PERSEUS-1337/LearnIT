    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Environmental Improvement Timber Contract Extension Act\" and involves the modification of a long-term contract regarding the Tongass National Forest. The \"Environmental Improvement Timber Contract Extension Act\" modifies a long-term contract for the Tongass National Forest. Definitions include board feet, contract, contracting officer, and mid-market criteria. The \"Environmental Improvement Timber Contract Extension Act\" aims to ensure an average profit and risk margin of at least 60% in a mid-market situation based on recent market data. It defines terms like proportionality, high volume stands, low volume stands, and purchaser. Congress found that a contract was entered into on July 26, 1951, between the Forest Service and the Ketchikan Pulp Company. The contract between the Forest Service and a purchaser aims to harvest timber from the Tongass National Forest in Alaska. The legislation is needed to ensure a continued timber supply for the purchaser's facilities. A pulp mill is deemed necessary in southeast Alaska for year-round operations. The purchaser plans to optimize year-round, high-paying jobs in southeast Alaska by using low-grade wood and by-product material from sawmilling operations. They will make environmental and operational improvements to their pulp mill, including converting to a chlorine-free bleaching process and expanding wastewater treatment facilities. Total capital expenditures are estimated to be $200 million. The purchaser plans to invest $200 million in environmental improvements and energy efficiency projects, with $25 million already invested. Extending the contract for 15 years is necessary for amortization. Ketchikan heavily relies on the contract for year-round employment. The purchaser plans to invest $200 million in environmental improvements and energy efficiency projects, with $25 million already invested. Extending the contract for 15 years is necessary for amortization. Ketchikan heavily relies on the contract for year-round employment. The commitment includes maintaining a stable Alaskan workforce, utilizing Alaskan contractors, vendors, and suppliers, and adhering to sound principles of multiple-use and sustained yield of forest resources. The purchaser commits to investing $200 million in environmental improvements and energy efficiency projects, with $25 million already spent. Extending the contract for 15 years is crucial for amortization and maintaining year-round employment in Ketchikan. The commitment includes utilizing Alaskan workforce, contractors, vendors, and suppliers, and ensuring sustainable forest resource management. Additionally, there is a focus on protecting air, water, land, fish, and wildlife habitats through compliance with laws and exploring new technologies for timber utilization. The national interest is served by a policy that ensures proper stewardship of publicly owned assets in the Tongass National Forest, fair return for public timber, and a balance among multiple use interests to enhance forest health, sustainable harvest, and economic growth in southeast Alaska and the United States. The national interest is best achieved by fostering domestic forest product markets and modifying the contract to extend the term by 15 years from June 30, 2004, and include a sale offering plan for timber volume, location, and schedule. The contract term is extended by 15 years, with timber volume requirements provided in 5-year increments of 962,500,000 board feet. The Forest Service must supply at least 192,500,000 board feet per year until the next increment in 1999. The contract requires the purchaser to harvest 192,500,000 board feet of timber each year. The contracting officer must ensure road construction in advance of the 5-year operating period to facilitate orderly harvest. The contracting officer must perform appraisals and designate rates for timber increments to be provided, ensuring they do not disadvantage the purchaser. The rates set will be the sole charges for the timber provided. The Forest Service measures proportionality for timber provided by groups of contiguous management areas, by acres, and over the entire rotation age. The purchaser can convert or replace its pulp mill with a facility producing other value-added products using pulp logs. The Forest Service measures timber proportionality by acres and rotation age. The purchaser can convert their pulp mill to produce other products using pulp logs. The contract's unilateral termination clause is eliminated, and modifications require mutual agreement without further congressional action. Effective date for modifications is 45 days after enactment. The contracting officer must modify the contract to align with the changes made by the Act within a specified timeframe. Conforming adjustments must be made to ensure implementation of the modifications. Timber volume available under the existing contract is also addressed. The existing timber contract will be modified to include additional timber volume to meet the annual requirement of 192,500,000 board feet."
