    "title": "AB 451",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 21107.8 of the Vehicle Code is amended to allow cities or counties to declare privately owned offstreet parking facilities open for public use, subject to certain regulations. If a city or county enacts an ordinance allowing privately owned offstreet parking facilities to regulate unauthorized parking, the owner must include contest instructions in parking fee invoices. If a city or county allows privately owned offstreet parking facilities to regulate unauthorized parking, the owner cannot submit parking fee invoices to the Department of Motor Vehicles to collect unpaid fees. An ordinance or resolution does not apply to offstreet parking facilities unless a notice is posted at each entrance warning of public moving vehicle laws and potential parking invoice fees for violators. Parking receipts must also include language about potential parking invoice fees for violators. No ordinance or resolution can be enacted without a public hearing and prior notice to the owner and operator of the offstreet parking facility. Section 22507.8 can be enforced without the need for an ordinance or resolution, or posting notices at each entrance to the parking facility. The department is not required to patrol or enforce provisions of this code on privately owned offstreet parking facilities, except for provisions applicable to private property. Cities or counties authorizing private parking regulation must include dispute resolution procedures in their ordinance, following Section 40215. The dispute resolution policy for private parking regulation must include specified time periods for notifications, review, and appeal. The administrative hearing process should offer options for in-person or mail hearings, administrative review, and a hearing by a trained third-party examiner. The examiner's decision must be delivered personally or by mail, with the authority to allow payment in installments for those unable to pay in full. The private parking regulation should include a prohibition on incentives based on the number of invoices or disputed invoices, a cap on parking invoice fees, and measures to prevent misrepresentation as a government agency."
