    "content": "Section 1 introduces a new section, SEC. 1260, in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 regarding gains from constructive ownership transactions. The new section SEC. 1260 in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 addresses gains from constructive ownership transactions, treating such gains as short-term capital gain if they exceed the net underlying long-term capital gain. The capital gain rate applicable is determined based on the respective rates that would have been applicable. The new section SEC. 1260 in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 addresses gains from constructive ownership transactions, treating gains as short-term capital gain if they exceed the net underlying long-term capital gain. If gain is treated as short-term capital gain, the taxpayer's tax for the year will be increased by interest charges under section 6601. The new section SEC. 1260 in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 addresses gains from constructive ownership transactions, treating gains as short-term capital gain if they exceed the net underlying long-term capital gain. Any increase in tax under this section shall not be treated as tax imposed by this chapter for purposes of determining credits. The new section SEC. 1260 in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 defines financial position as any position related to stock, debt instrument, partnership interest, or investment trust interest. A position includes interests like futures contracts, short sales, or options. The taxpayer is treated as having entered into a constructive ownership transaction if they hold a long position under a notional principal contract, enter into a forward or futures contract, or are the grantor of a put and holder of a call with respect to the same or similar property. The taxpayer is treated as having entered into a constructive ownership transaction if they hold a long position under a notional principal contract, enter into a forward or futures contract, or are the grantor of a put and holder of a call with respect to the same or similar property. This section does not apply if all positions in the transaction are marked to market. A person is considered to hold a long position under a notional principal contract if they have the right to receive the investment yield on the property for a specified period and are obligated to provide credit for any decline in the property's value. The term 'forward contract' and 'related person' are defined in specific sections. 'Net underlying long-term capital gain' refers to the total capital gain if a financial position was acquired and sold on specific dates. The net underlying long-term capital gain is treated as zero unless proven otherwise. An exception applies if the taxpayer elects to have the subsection apply, in which case certain rules do not apply, and gain or loss must be recognized. The taxpayer must recognize gain or loss on any open constructive ownership transaction at the close of the taxable year as if the financial position was sold at fair market value. Any gain or loss should be accounted for in that year, with adjustments made for subsequent realized gains or losses. Any gain or loss from a constructive ownership transaction is treated as ordinary income or loss. If gain or loss is recognized before the close of the taxable year, and the transaction would have applied if open at year-end, special rules apply for dispositions. The taxable year gain or loss is treated as ordinary income or loss. An election can be made without the Secretary's consent and applies to the current and future taxable years unless revoked. The Secretary will prescribe necessary regulations. Subchapter P of chapter 1 is amended by adding a new item at the end. The amendments in this section apply to gains recognized after the enactment of this Act."
