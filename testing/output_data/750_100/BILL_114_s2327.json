The amendments apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2014. The Earned Income Tax Credit is being strengthened by increasing the credit percentage for eligible individuals with 3 or more qualifying children. The Earned Income Tax Credit is being enhanced by raising the credit amounts for individuals with no qualifying children. The table in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to increase the credit from $4,220 to $8,820 and from $5,280 to $10,425. Inflation adjustments are also made to further improve the credit.

The Internal Revenue Code is amended to increase credit amounts for individuals with no children and lower the eligibility age for certain childless individuals and youth formerly in foster care to age 21 (or age 18 for youth formerly in foster care). Additionally, a new provision defines \"youth formerly in foster care\" as an individual who was in foster care on or after the age of 16. Subchapter A of chapter 61 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a new section after section 6050W. \"New section 6050X requires returns related to youth in foster care.\" The new section 6050X mandates reporting by State, local, or tribal agencies on individuals in foster care aged 16 and above.

The IRS code is amended to include returns for youth in foster care, effective for taxable years after December 31, 2014. Additionally, there is a section simplifying the Earned Income Tax Credit.

The IRS code is amended to simplify rules regarding the presence of a qualifying child for the tax credit for workers. The IRS code is amended to allow taxpayers to claim a credit for a worker without a qualifying child if the child is claimed by another family member. For a taxable year, if an individual is claimed as a qualifying child by one eligible individual, any other eligible individual not making such a claim can be considered eligible without a qualifying child for the tax credit. If a child is claimed as a qualifying child by one eligible individual, no other custodial parent who does not claim the child can be considered eligible for the tax credit without a qualifying child for that year. The tax credit for a worker without a qualifying child is available to taxpayers if their qualifying children do not have a valid social security number. This amendment affects individuals with qualifying children who are not considered for the tax credit due to certain reasons. The amendments made by this section allow individuals without qualifying children to be considered eligible for the tax credit, effective for taxable years starting after December 31, 2014."
