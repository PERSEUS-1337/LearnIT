The United States Fish and Wildlife Service manages the James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge to promote the recovery of 4 endangered Hawaiian waterbirds. They lease 240 acres of wetland habitat and manage it according to the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service is looking to purchase 800 acres of additional wildlife habitat adjacent to the James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge from the estate of James Campbell to protect endangered species and improve refuge management. The land features coastal dunes, wetlands, and coastal strand that promote biological diversity. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service aims to expand the James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge by purchasing 800 acres of wildlife habitat to protect endangered species like Hawaiian waterbirds, migratory shorebirds, waterfowl, seabirds, native plant species, monk seals, and green sea turtles. The refuge's habitats are rare due to coastal development, and the expansion will increase opportunities for wildlife observation. The expansion of the James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge includes acquiring land to create a large, ecologically-intact unit with buffer land to reduce impacts on the Refuge. This acquisition is also necessary to reduce flood damage in the town of Kahuku. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Director refers to the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, Refuge means the James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge, and Secretary means the Secretary of the Interior.

The Secretary will publish a notice in the Federal Register and local publications to inform the public about the availability of the map.

Sums necessary to carry out this Act are authorized to be appropriated."
