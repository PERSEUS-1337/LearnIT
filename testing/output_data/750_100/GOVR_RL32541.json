    "content": "The 9/11 Commission found that al Qaeda terrorists exploited weaknesses in aviation security, including a pre-screening process focused on bombers, lax checkpoint screening, lack of in-flight security measures, compliance with hijackers, and a lack of protocols for the FAA. The 9/11 Commission identified a lack of protocols and capabilities for coordinated responses to hijackings and suicidal hijackers, attributing it to a failure of imagination among senior policymakers and agencies responsible for intelligence, defense, and aviation security. Aviation security experts were slow to consider suicide hijackings as a threat despite concerns from some agencies. Prior to September 11, 2001, aviation security experts underestimated the likelihood of a suicide hijacking scenario, and there were no specific actions taken to defend against this threat. Congressional oversight of aviation security was lacking, with a focus on airport congestion and passenger service instead. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, Congress swiftly passed the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) to address aviation security weaknesses. ATSA established the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to oversee security in all modes of transportation. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) established the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to oversee security in all modes of transportation. ATSA included measures such as federal security screeners at airports, explosive detection screening for checked bags, air marshals on high-risk flights, and cockpit door hardening. It also granted TSA broad authority to assess and address security threats in all transportation modes, with a focus on aviation security. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and placed the TSA within it. The act also allowed arming of airline pilots for security. The Vision 100 Act included measures like an aviation security capital fund for explosive detection systems in baggage conveyers. The TSA has implemented measures to improve baggage screening efficiency and arm pilots, but vulnerabilities in air cargo operations, general aviation, employee access controls, screener performance, and potential terrorist attacks with shoulder-fired missiles persist. The 9/11 Commission also identified these security gaps, emphasizing the need for improvements in cargo and general aviation security. The 9/11 Commission made recommendations for airport passenger and baggage screening, and air cargo security, but did not address concerns about access controls in airports and general aviation operations or shoulder-fired missile attacks on commercial airliners. The 9/11 Commission recommended a multi-layered security system for aviation security, emphasizing the need for effective coordination and redundancies to address possible terrorist tactics. The 9/11 Commission recommended a multi-layered security system for aviation security, emphasizing coordination and redundancies to address possible lapses. This aligns with aviation security mandates and TSA's \"concentric rings of security.\" The Commission focused on persisting vulnerabilities in commercial aviation and made six aviation-specific recommendations, including enhancing passenger pre-screening and improving explosives detection on passengers. The 9/11 Commission issued six aviation-specific recommendations to enhance security, including improving explosives detection on passengers and deploying hardened cargo containers on passenger aircraft. Additionally, an overarching recommendation was made for transportation security policy to prioritize based on risk and implement cost-effective deterrents. On September 11, 2001, passenger pre-screening consisted of three measures. On September 11, 2001, passenger pre-screening measures included CAPPS, security questions, and photo ID. Over half of the hijackers were identified, but with little consequence as pre-screening was focused on preventing bombings like Pan Am flight 103. The CAPPS system is still in use today. The CAPPS system, used for passenger pre-screening, has expanded to screen for possible hijackers. CAPPS II, the follow-on system, has faced controversy over data protection and civil liberties concerns. It would authenticate passenger identity using commercial databases and check names against terrorist profiles. The 9/11 Commission recommended improving passenger pre-screening by utilizing federal watchlists and not delaying implementation. Legislation directed the Department of Homeland Security to address concerns and enhance pre-screening capabilities. The 9/11 Commission recommended enhancing passenger pre-screening by utilizing federal watchlists and not delaying implementation. Legislation directed the Department of Homeland Security to address concerns and limited CAPPS II implementation to system testing until verified by the Government Accountability Office. Airlines' reluctance to provide data for testing due to liability concerns has hindered progress. Recent reports suggest challenges in the implementation of the CAPPS II program. The CAPPS II program has been scrapped over privacy concerns, but a new program may take its place. Congress may increase oversight of the Secure Flight program and debate the best way to proceed. H.R. 10 includes a provision for TSA to take over passenger pre-screening from airlines within 180 days. The TSA is required to take over responsibility for prescreening from airlines within 180 days of enactment and start testing the system by November 1, 2004. The 9/11 Commission highlighted evidence of al Qaeda's interest in bombing airliners, referencing Ramzi Yousef's 1994 bombing of a Philippines Airlines flight as a precursor to a larger operation. The 9/11 Commission highlighted concerns over improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in airline security, referencing incidents involving Ramzi Yousef, Richard Reid, and Nathaniel Heatwole. Persistent weaknesses in detecting IEDs were acknowledged. The 9/11 Commission recommended improving explosives detection on passengers, suggesting all individuals selected for secondary screening undergo explosives screening due to limited capabilities of current screening technologies. New technology can detect bomb-making chemicals. New technology is being tested at various airports to detect bomb-making chemicals on individuals using trace detection methods. Other methods include body scan imaging using low dose x-ray backscatter, which is controversial due to the nude images it produces. The 9/11 Commission recommended implementing more effective passenger screening methods, which may include body scan imaging technology. This technology is controversial due to privacy concerns. Congress may debate funding for these initiatives. The TSA has launched initiatives to address screener performance issues highlighted by a recent DHS Inspector General's audit. These initiatives include expanding the use of threat image projection (TIP) to test screener performance and improve human performance needs in aviation security. The TSA is working on improving recurrent training for screeners and addressing key human factors issues in aviation security, such as screener selection, training, and interaction with screening technologies. However, research and funding for human factors in aviation security are lacking compared to other agencies like the Department of Defense and FAA. There is a lack of a comprehensive strategic plan for addressing human factors in aviation security. Congress may conduct oversight to identify areas where TSA's human factors research efforts may not be addressing concerns over passenger and baggage screening performance. Congress may also consider tasking an independent body with examining human factors needs in aviation security. The National Academy of Sciences addressed human factors in a 1999 assessment of aviation security technologies but has not conducted a focused study on human factors needs in aviation security. H.R. 10 includes a provision for TSA to conduct human factors studies to improve screener performance and evaluate next-generation checkpoint screening technologies. Congress may debate the funding adequacy for installing in-line baggage screening systems recommended by the 9/11 Commission. Vision 100 authorizes up to $500 million annually for aviation security capital fund, but only $250 million was appropriated in FY2004. Only $250 million was appropriated in FY2004 and requested in FY2005 for integrating EDS equipment at passenger airports, with a total cost exceeding $4 billion. It may take several years to complete integration given current funding levels. TSA issued Letters of Intent (LOIs) to airports to leverage federal funding over several years for EDS integration, but implementation has been limited. The TSA has implemented LOIs for EDS integration at airports, but the reimbursement approach may slow progress. The 9/11 Commission recommended that the aviation industry should contribute to the costs of in-line EDS deployment, which has been a point of contention. Airlines already indirectly fund EDS integration through security fees paid by passengers. The TSA has proposed increasing the local share of funding for airport security programs, which airports oppose. The 9/11 Commission recommended that the aviation industry should contribute more to the costs of security measures. The 9/11 Commission recommended that the aviation industry should contribute more to security costs. Congress debates equity of cost-sharing for EDS integration. Legislation seeks to double aviation security fees for capital fund. H.R. 5121 aims to double the security capital fund to $500 million annually for FY2005 through FY2007 and increase TSA's flexibility for checked baggage screening. The 9/11 Commission recommended intensifying efforts to identify and screen suspicious cargo in aviation and maritime operations. The TSA unveiled a strategic plan for cargo security in aviation and maritime operations in November 2003, based on recommendations from the Aviation Security Advisory Committee. The plan includes a multi-layered risk-based approach with four key strategic objectives: enhancing shipper and supply chain security, pre-screening elevated risk cargo, using technology for targeted air cargo inspections, and securing all-cargo aircraft through facility security measures. The goals of the plan involve pre-screening all cargo shipments to determine their relative risk levels. The TSA's strategic plan for cargo security includes pre-screening all shipments to determine risk levels, inspecting items of elevated risk, deploying new technology solutions, and implementing security programs. The 9/11 Commission supports the overall approach but calls for accelerated progress and possibly additional measures. The 9/11 Commission recommends enhancing cargo identification, tracking, and screening. Congress debates the level of physical screening needed for cargo on passenger aircraft, with proposals for 100% screening. TSA's risk-based approach relies on the known-shipper program and database for assessing shipments. The 9/11 Commission recommends improving cargo security by enhancing screening and tracking measures. S. 2845 proposes doubling air cargo screening within one year, while also suggesting the deployment of hardened cargo containers on passenger aircraft. The 9/11 Commission recommends enhancing cargo security by improving screening and tracking measures. A proposal suggests deploying hardened cargo containers on passenger aircraft, estimated to cost $125 million. Industry-wide cost of lost revenue due to reduced payload and increased fuel burn is estimated at $11 million annually. Opposition may arise from airlines due to increased operational costs, with arguments that improved cargo identification, tracking, and screening may negate the need for hardened containers. Proponents argue that deploying hardened cargo containers on passenger aircraft adds a redundant layer of defense. However, using just one container still leaves the system vulnerable to risks tied to cargo assessments. TSA requires proper vetting for all cargo to mitigate potential vulnerabilities. The TSA is working on expanding capabilities to detect high-risk cargo for all-cargo airplanes, but it is unclear how this system could be adapted for passenger airplanes. Congress may debate whether deploying hardened cargo containers on passenger aircraft could provide an effective layer of security. The debate revolves around whether deploying blast-resistant cargo containers on passenger aircraft could enhance security. H.R. 10 includes a provision for a pilot program to assess the use of these containers, while S. 2845 does not. Additionally, legislation passed by the Senate requires a report on blast-resistant cargo container technology. The 9/11 Commission recommended establishing risk-based priorities for protecting transportation assets and developing practical and cost-effective defense approaches. This includes assigning roles to federal, state, and local authorities, as well as private stakeholders, to implement a strategic plan for aviation security. The 9/11 Commission recommended a risk-based approach for aviation security, involving federal, state, and local authorities, as well as private stakeholders. While the TSA initially focused on meeting ATSA mandates post-9/11, there is a need for a unified strategic plan for national aviation security policy. The TSA is poised to develop a formal strategy for national aviation security policy, likely based on a risk-based multi-layered approach. Congress may task the TSA with creating a national strategy that addresses funding, roles of authorities, and industry stakeholders. The need for a formal strategic planning document for aviation security is highlighted, emphasizing the importance of cooperation and integration among various stakeholders. Challenges persist in defining roles and allocating resources for state, local, and industry involvement in airport security programs. The role of local jurisdictions and airport operators involves security oversight, while TSA is responsible for passenger screening. Local governments and state authorities support aviation security through law enforcement presence at screening checkpoints. Passenger air carriers participate in security through procedures and training for controlling access to aircraft and secured areas. Security measures in air cargo and general aviation rely on direct participation. In air cargo and general aviation, security measures rely on direct participation of aircraft owners and operators, with federal oversight and enforcement. However, there is a lack of unified plan for assigning roles and missions to stakeholders and adopting a systems approach for overall security strategy. Congress and TSA may consider improving strategic planning and resource allocation in response to 9/11 Commission recommendations. Congress and the TSA may consider improving strategic planning, resource allocation, and integration of resources for aviation security, including aligning aviation security strategies with a broader transportation security strategy. H.R. 10 mandates the Department of Homeland Security to develop and update transportation security plans, including modal plans for aviation, to prioritize risks and enhance security measures across all modes of transportation. The 9/11 Commission report prompted Congress to focus on aviation security recommendations. The 108th Congress passed two major pieces of legislation related to transportation security. The 108th Congress passed legislation related to aviation security, including Vision 100 and the National Intelligence Reform Act in response to the 9/11 Commission's recommendations. Vision 100 established a redress process for pilots. Vision 100, enacted on December 12, 2003, established a redress process for aviation professionals facing certification issues. It also required justification to Congress for Air Defense Identification Zones and modified security training requirements for airline crew members. Vision 100, enacted in 2003, mandated basic security training for airline crews and a voluntary self-defense program. It also required a study on aviation security effectiveness, recommendations for improvement, and the creation of the Aviation Security Capital Fund. Vision 100, enacted in 2003, mandated basic security training for airline crews and a voluntary self-defense program. It also created the Aviation Security Capital Fund, authorizing up to $500 million per year for aviation security projects through FY2007. The act provided grants for airports to integrate baggage explosive detection systems and deploy them in various areas. Vision 100, enacted in 2003, mandated basic security training for airline crews and a voluntary self-defense program. It also created the Aviation Security Capital Fund, providing grants for airports to integrate baggage explosive detection systems. The act set federal share of costs for security projects at 90% for large and medium hub airports and 95% for all other airports. It required security programs for air charter operators with aircraft over 12,500 pounds and mandated a review of the proposed CAPPS II passenger prescreening system by the Government Accountability Office. The Vision 100 Act mandated security training for airline crews, created the Aviation Security Capital Fund for baggage detection systems, and required a review of the CAPPS II passenger prescreening system. The TSA has replaced CAPPS II with the \"Secure Flight\" program and expanded the Federal Flight Deck Officer Program for armed pilots. Vision 100 Act expanded security measures for aircraft crewmembers, including pilots and flight engineers. It also mandated regulations for the security of foreign and domestic aircraft repair stations. Additionally, the act transferred background check responsibilities for foreign pilots to the DHS from the Department of Justice. The legislation mandates background checks for individuals seeking training in smaller aircraft and larger aircraft, with fee collections authorized to cover costs. The National Intelligence Reform Act includes provisions for aviation security. See CRS Report RL32498 for more details. The National Intelligence Reform Act mandates background checks for individuals seeking aviation training, with fee collections authorized to cover costs. The act requires the Department of Homeland Security to develop a National Strategy for Transportation Security and modal-specific security plans, including a detailed aviation security plan with threat matrix and mitigation strategies. The National Intelligence Reform Act mandates background checks for individuals seeking aviation training. The TSA is required to issue guidance for biometrics in airport access control systems and establish biometric credential procedures for identifying law enforcement officers carrying firearms on passenger aircraft. $20 million is authorized for research on biometric technologies for aviation security, along with $1 million for a center of excellence in biometric technologies. System testing for an advanced passenger prescreening system was required to begin by January 1, 2005. The National Intelligence Reform Act mandates background checks for individuals seeking aviation training and requires the TSA to implement an advanced passenger prescreening system by January 1, 2005. The TSA must assume the role of passenger prescreening within 180 days of completing testing, establish redress procedures for false identifications, and address privacy concerns. The National Intelligence Reform Act mandates background checks for individuals in aviation training and requires TSA to implement an advanced passenger prescreening system by January 1, 2005. The DHS must conduct prescreening of international flights to or from the United States before departure. Individuals seeking FAA certificates and unescorted access to secure airport areas must be screened against the terrorist watch list. TSA must establish a process for prescreening customers using aircraft over 12,500 pounds. The National Intelligence Reform Act mandates background checks for individuals in aviation training and requires TSA to implement an advanced passenger prescreening system by January 1, 2005. The DHS must conduct prescreening of international flights to or from the United States before departure. TSA must establish a process for prescreening customers using aircraft over 12,500 pounds, with a focus on developing technologies to detect various weapons. The National Intelligence Reform Act mandates background checks for individuals in aviation training and requires TSA to implement an advanced passenger prescreening system by January 1, 2005. The DHS must conduct prescreening of international flights to or from the United States before departure. TSA must establish a process for prescreening customers using aircraft over 12,500 pounds, with a focus on developing technologies to detect various weapons. The act also requires the TSA to initiate a pilot program to test advanced airport checkpoint screening systems at five or more airports by March 31, 2005 and authorizes $150 million per year in FY2005 and FY2006 to carry out this pilot. The act requires the TSA to carry out and report on a human factors study to better understand problems with screener performance and take necessary action to improve job performance of airport screening personnel. The National Intelligence Reform Act mandates background checks for individuals in aviation training and requires TSA to implement an advanced passenger prescreening system by January 1, 2005. It also requires the TSA to initiate a pilot program to test advanced airport checkpoint screening systems at five or more airports by March 31, 2005. Additionally, the act mandates the improvement of job performance for airport screening personnel and provides training for law enforcement officers authorized to carry firearms on passenger aircraft in inflight counterterrorism procedures. The DHS is authorized to provide air marshal training to foreign law enforcement personnel. The TSA is authorized to expedite the installation of in-line baggage screening equipment at airports and study cost-sharing options. The aviation security capital fund is increased to $400 million per year through FY2007. The TSA is directed to study the integration of in-line baggage screening systems. The Vision 100 act mandates the use of wireless communication technologies for cabin crew to discreetly notify pilots of security breaches. It also requires tamper-resistant pilot licenses with photos and biometrics. The TSA must develop staffing level standards for airport security. The DHS is studying the integration of screening workforce operations to increase efficiency. $100 million is authorized for research on improved explosive detection systems. TSA is developing guidelines to prohibit certain carry-on items like butane lighters. The act directs the President to pursue international treaties to limit the availability of MANPADSs worldwide and to report on diplomatic efforts for non-proliferation. It also requires the FAA to establish guidelines for inappropriate carry-on items. The act mandates briefings on efforts for missile defense systems on commercial aircraft, expedited certification, assessing aircraft vulnerability to MANPADS attacks, securing airports, evaluating blast-resistant cargo containers, and funding for improved air cargo and airport security. The act allocates $100 million annually through FY2007 for research, development, and deployment of technologies to enhance air cargo security. It establishes a grant program to promote advanced air cargo security technology and requires TSA to issue final regulations for cargo operations security. Additionally, DHS, in collaboration with DoD and FAA, must report on threats from international cargo shipments to the US. The Department of Homeland Security is focused on addressing threats from international cargo shipments to the United States. They are working on establishing secure facilities along international aviation routes to divert and secure aircraft posing security risks. Legislation directs DHS to develop systems for inspecting and screening air cargo on passenger aircraft, with a goal of increasing the percentage of cargo inspected. The 108th Congress addressed many aviation security concerns, including cargo inspection on passenger aircraft. However, general aviation security and air cargo oversight were not adequately addressed. The 9/11 Commission mentioned concerns about general aviation but did not provide formal recommendations. During the 108th Congress, legislation focused on security concerns in general aviation operations, including airport and airspace restrictions. A provision in Vision 100 required the DHS to develop a security plan for general aviation flights at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Temporary flight restrictions over stadiums during major sports events remained in place. Legislation regarding general aviation security during the 108th Congress was seen as less comprehensive compared to other aviation security measures. Concerns have been raised about the risk posed by private planes and helicopters, following a recent assessment by the FBI and DHS. Some argue for comprehensive legislation on air cargo security operations and oversight. During the 108th Congress, air cargo security operations and oversight were not adequately addressed. Specific measures in S. 165 were removed from the final National Intelligence Reform Bill of 2004, with the TSA directed to address these issues through proposed rulemaking. The 109th Congress may need to address these provisions. The 109th Congress may focus on overseeing the TSA's implementation of air cargo security rules and strategic plan to ensure desired objectives are met."
