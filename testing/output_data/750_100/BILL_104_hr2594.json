Subparagraph (A) of section 2(a)(1) of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act is amended to specify the payment of unemployment benefits for qualified employees during periods of continuing unemployment. Benefits are payable for each day of unemployment exceeding 4 days in a registration period, with a waiting period of 7 days for the first registration period. During a period of continuing unemployment, benefits are payable for each day exceeding 4 days in a registration period. If a qualified employee experiences unemployment due to a strike, no benefits will be paid for the first 14 days of unemployment. During a period of continuing unemployment, benefits are payable for each day exceeding 4 days in a registration period. If a qualified employee experiences unemployment due to a strike, no benefits will be paid for the first 14 days of unemployment, with subsequent days of unemployment covered as per the initial clause. If the period of continuing unemployment ends but the work stoppage continues, a waiting period will apply to the employee's first registration period in a new period of continuing unemployment. During a period of continuing unemployment, benefits are payable for each day exceeding 4 days in a registration period. The term 'period of continuing unemployment' includes a single registration period with more than 4 days of unemployment, consecutive registration periods with more than 4 days of unemployment, or successive registration periods with more than 4 days of unemployment starting within 15 days. The succeeding registration period begins within 15 days after the last day of the previous registration period. A period of continuing unemployment ends when an employee exhausts rights to unemployment benefits. No benefits are payable if the total remuneration exceeds the amount for the registration period. The registration period starts 15 days after the previous one ends. Unemployment ends when benefits are exhausted. No benefits are given if total remuneration exceeds the period's amount. SEC. 3. WAITING PERIOD FOR SICKNESS BENEFITS. Subparagraph (B) of section 2(a)(1) of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act is amended to specify the payment of sickness benefits, including a waiting period for the first registration period. The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act is amended to include provisions for sickness benefits, with a waiting period for the first registration period in a period of continuing sickness. A period of continuing sickness is defined as consecutive days of sickness from one or more causes. The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act now includes provisions for sickness benefits, with a waiting period for the first registration period in a period of continuing sickness. A period of continuing sickness is defined as consecutive days of sickness from one or more causes, with a special rule regarding the end of the period. SEC. 4 amends the maximum daily benefit rate calculation under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act. The rate is based on the monthly compensation base multiplied by 5 percent. If not a multiple of $1, it is rounded down. SEC. 5 sets the maximum number of days for benefits. The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act is amended to set the maximum number of days for benefits at 130 for both unemployment and sickness within a benefit year. The maximum amount of benefits paid to an employee for days of unemployment or sickness within a benefit year cannot exceed the employee's compensation in the base year. Money remuneration for services rendered as an employee will be taken into account, not exceeding a certain ratio. The maximum benefits for days of unemployment or sickness in a year cannot exceed the employee's compensation in the base year, calculated based on a specific ratio. Extended unemployment or sickness benefits can be paid for up to 65 days within the extended benefit period, starting from the first day of unemployment. The extended benefit period for unemployment or sickness begins on the employee's first day of unemployment or sickness after exhausting current benefits and lasts for 7 consecutive 14-day periods, not exceeding the start of a new benefit year when the employee qualifies for benefits again. The extended benefit period for sickness benefits ends when the employee turns 65, but can continue for paying benefits for days of unemployment. Employees with 10 or more years of service may be eligible for accelerated benefits. Employees with 10 or more years of service may be eligible for accelerated benefits if they have 14 or more consecutive days of unemployment or sickness and meet certain criteria. Employees with 10 or more years of service may be eligible for accelerated benefits if they have 14 or more consecutive days of unemployment or sickness. The benefits begin on the first day of the month in which the unemployment or sickness starts. There is an exception for sickness benefits after age 65, where benefits are not paid for any day of sickness starting at age 65 and continuing through the day before the next benefit year. The Board may use available evidence to determine age for this purpose. The Board may rely on evidence of age in its records for determining age. Section 2(h) of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act is repealed, as well as Section 17 relating to supplemental unemployment benefits. The amendments made by this Act will be effective on the date of enactment."
