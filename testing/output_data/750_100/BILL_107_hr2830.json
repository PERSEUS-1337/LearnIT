    "content": "The \"Voting Restoration Act\" is the short title of this Act, which aims to restore voting rights. Congress finds that the right to vote is guaranteed in the US Constitution for all citizens and should not be denied based on race, sex, color, or previous servitude. Congress has supervisory power over Federal elections, and there is no uniform eligibility standard for participating in these elections, with different rules in each state regarding ex-felon voting eligibility. Different rules exist in states regarding the voting eligibility of ex-felons. While some states prohibit inmates from voting while serving their sentences, others disenfranchise ex-offenders who have completed their sentences. Even in states that allow ex-offenders to vote, the process to regain that right is challenging, with requirements such as a pardon from the Governor or action from the parole board. Federal offenders in 16 states are unable to regain their voting rights. An estimated 3,900,000 Americans, or approximately 2 percent of the adult population, are ineligible to vote due to felony convictions. Three-fourths of these individuals are on probation, parole, or are ex-offenders. Federal offenders must obtain a Presidential pardon to regain their voting rights. The number of incarcerated individuals has grown due to onerous drug policies. In 1998, 1 in 4 prison inmates were incarcerated for drug offenses, with drug offenders making up 58% of Federal prison inmates. Over one-third of women in prison are also jailed for drug offenses, mostly nonviolent. Racially disparate sentencing laws have led to African-Americans being 31% of those convicted for Federal drug charges. Minorities, specifically African-Americans, are disproportionately impacted by laws that strip felons or ex-felons of their voting rights. Currently, 1,400,000 African-American men, or 13% of the population, are unable to participate in Federal elections due to felony convictions. Congress should address these disparities to ensure all Americans have the right to vote in Federal elections. The purpose of the Act is to restore voting rights to individuals who have completed sentences for criminal offenses and promote their participation in civic life. The Act aims to protect the right to vote and register to vote in federal elections. The Act ensures that individuals cannot be denied the right to vote in federal elections based on felony convictions, except while under state supervision. Private individuals can take legal action for violations of this Act. Individuals aggrieved by a violation of the Act can notify the state's chief election official. If the violation is not corrected within a specified timeframe, the aggrieved person can file a civil action in court for relief. If a violation of the Act occurs within 30 days of a Federal election, the aggrieved person can bring a civil action without notifying the chief election official. Civil actions for compensatory damages can be filed within 3 days of a Federal election. The Attorney General can take legal action in court to address violations of the Act, including seeking compensatory damages.
