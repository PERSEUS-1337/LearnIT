Local educational agencies should collaborate with various organizations, including government authorities like Team Nutrition and community groups, to develop and implement programs promoting healthy eating and nutrition education. Local educational agencies should collaborate with organizations for technical assistance in designing programs to promote healthy eating and nutrition education in schools.
