DOD's spending accounted for 8% of federal spending. Analysts and officials believe that utilizing data more effectively in acquisition decision-making could lead to significant cost savings, improved resource allocation, and enhanced military operations. The National Defense Industrial Association emphasized the importance of data as a critical first step in enhancing defense acquisitions. The Defense Industrial Association emphasized the importance of data as a critical step in improving defense acquisitions. Congress has pursued various approaches to enhance DOD's efficiency, including requiring auditability and provisions for acquisition reform in National Defense Authorization Acts. Congress may consider enhancing oversight and enabling more effective data analysis for better decision-making. The report focuses on how the Department of Defense (DOD) uses data for decision-making in defense acquisitions. It discusses critical elements for DOD to improve data usage, recent efforts in this area, and potential questions for Congress. Related CRS reports are also mentioned. In light of advances in information technology, data analysis is crucial for informed policy decisions and managing government programs. Sufficient data allows decisionmakers to measure program effectiveness, inform policy decisions, and provide transparency. A lack of data can lead to incorrect conclusions. Inadequate data can lead to incorrect policy decisions and wastage of resources. Reports have highlighted the lack of access to data and analytical tools in government agencies, leading to issues such as excess inventories exceeding $1 billion in the military. The Army's audit readiness was at risk due to unreliable data in the appropriations status report. DOD mismanagement in Afghanistan hampered supply distribution and affected operations. DOD lacked databases to track reconstruction and contracting spending in Afghanistan after almost 10 years of war. Despite the lack of databases tracking spending in Afghanistan, there is a consensus that the Department of Defense (DOD) does not effectively use data in decision-making. Major policy decisions, such as economic development programs and weapon system choices, are often made without substantive data, leading to reliance on assumptions. Program reviews may not always incorporate relevant data for measuring success. Retired Air Force General Norman Schwartz highlighted the importance of data in the private sector compared to the military. After leaving the military, the importance of data-driven decisions in the private sector was emphasized. Congress enacted the DATA Act in 2014 to improve government operations by establishing data standards for financial data and enabling better tracking of Federal spending. The DATA Act, enacted in 2014, aims to establish Government-wide data standards for financial data and improve the quality of data submitted to USASpending.gov. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain highlighted the importance of basic data for addressing management problems, particularly within the Department of Defense. Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates described the dilemma of lacking essential data for understanding and diagnosing problems. Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates highlighted the challenges of obtaining accurate information within the Department of Defense, leading to inefficiency, wasted resources, and harm to national security. The lack of essential data hinders the ability to measure the results of national security policies, assess military priorities, and make informed decisions. The Department of Defense faces challenges in using data effectively, with analysts and officials emphasizing the need for information systems, comprehensive and accurate data, and data-informed decision-making. Some decision-makers lack even basic databases, hindering their ability to manage information effectively. For example, the Joint Staff lacked a database for managing weapon system portfolios, as reported by the GAO. The lack of a database for managing weapon system portfolios hinders managers of multibillion dollar programs, leading to manual, time-consuming processes with potential errors. This manual approach also creates separate and conflicting data sources, impeding leaders from fully utilizing valuable program information. The DOD needs effective systems for budgetary accounting, but many current systems are flawed. GAO stated that improvements are ongoing but may not be complete until 2017. Having a single source for data analysis is crucial for accurate decision-making. The DOD is working on improving its data systems for budgetary accounting, with a focus on having a single, agreed source for analyzing specific data sets. Concerns arise from conflicting data in multiple IT systems and databases, leading to calls for better architecture in data systems for collecting, managing, and analyzing DOD acquisition data. The DOD is facing challenges with data reliability and sufficiency in various data sets, including contract obligations, workforce, contractor performance, and costs. The Federal Procurement Data System\u2014Next Generation (FPDS) and Operations and Support costs highlight these issues, impacting government efforts to improve data quality. FPDS is a crucial database for government-wide procurement information relied upon by Congress, agencies, analysts, and the public. The Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) is a vital source of information for the federal government's contracting dollars. Congress, the executive branch, analysts, and the public use this data for policy decisions and analysis. Concerns have been raised about the accuracy and reliability of the data in FPDS, with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) noting limitations in utility, accuracy, and completeness. The Office of Management and Budget has issued guidance to address these concerns. The General Services Administration (GSA) is overhauling data systems, including FPDS, to improve reliability and usefulness. Stakeholder feedback is being sought to enhance the information contained in these systems. The General Services Administration is seeking feedback from stakeholders to improve the reliability, usability, and relevance of data stored in updated systems. The upgrades are expected to be implemented in 2017 or 2018. The Department of Defense has faced challenges in tracking Operations and Support costs due to inconsistent and unreliable reporting to Congress. The Department of Defense (DOD) lacks reliable data to analyze operations and support cost growth for major systems. Inconsistent and incomplete reporting of O&S data hinders the identification of cost drivers and development of cost management plans. DOD components have not consistently tracked O&S costs against final estimates after systems were fielded. The office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (AT&L) is addressing these issues. The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics is working on improving the consistency of using units for calculating O&S costs, but building a data bank for analysis will take time. The Department of Defense faces challenges with data access, quality, and availability throughout the acquisition process, leading to decisions based on perceptions or anecdotal evidence rather than thorough data analysis. According to a recent RAND report, there are institutional and cultural barriers to sharing data within the Department of Defense. These barriers include a stovepiped structure that limits visibility and information sharing, as well as bureaucratic incentives to restrict data access. Policy and guidance also contribute to the protection of information, resulting in challenges for data sharing. The Department of Defense faces challenges in data sharing due to policy restrictions and a conservative bias. Decisionmakers struggle to use existing data effectively, with a lack of personnel capable of complex data analysis. Some senior leaders within DOD are not adept at utilizing data for informed decision-making. Accuracy and relevance of data are crucial, but unchecked statistics and slick presentations can hinder this process. Some officials caution against relying on unchecked statistics and slick presentations for decision-making, emphasizing the importance of understanding data limitations. Concerns include avoiding data collection for its own sake and the tendency to gather data without a clear purpose. Some caution against collecting data without a clear purpose, as it may lead to data being gathered for its own sake. There is a need to ensure that the benefit of data analyses outweighs the cost of collecting and analyzing data. Spending excessive time and resources on data collection and analysis may not always be justified, as data do not need to be perfect to be useful. Decision-makers should focus on whether there is sufficient data to draw reasonable conclusions. When working with data, critical questions to ask include: What useful analysis can be developed now? How can we model correctly? What are the uncertainty bounds of the data? Imperfect data can still be useful, and even perfect data may not yield perfect analysis. Cost estimating, for example, is imprecise but can aid in understanding. Estimates for large programs are imprecise but can help in understanding risks and making decisions. From FY2007 to FY2013, DOD spent over $80 billion on contracts in Afghanistan, yet lacked reliable data for strategic contracting decisions. The Department of Defense (DOD) spent over $80 billion on contracts in Afghanistan from FY2007 to FY2013. However, DOD faced challenges in tracking and managing the supply chain, hindering the distribution of supplies and equipment to the warfighter. This lack of data will likely continue to affect operations in Afghanistan and limit DOD's visibility. The Department of Defense (DOD) faced challenges in tracking and managing the supply chain in Afghanistan, with multiple conflicting IT systems causing wasteful spending and poor data sharing between agencies. The reliability of data in IT systems used by agencies in Afghanistan was questionable, with incomplete and unreliable information often being sent to the central database. Only 14% of records contained all required data elements for reconstruction projects, highlighting the challenges in data tracking and management. Data tracking in Afghanistan was inconsistent and inaccurate, with only about 10% of records making it into the central database. The error rate in the system was around 50%, leading to challenges in data management. Personnel often lacked awareness of existing data due to being assigned tasks outside their expertise. Many military and civilian personnel involved in developing counterinsurgency contracting strategies were unaware of existing data sources, including the Central Command quarterly contractor census and FPDS data related to contracting in Afghanistan. DOD officials acknowledged data shortcomings and worked to improve reliability. DOD has made progress in identifying data for better contract decisions and may leverage existing data systems for future operations. However, there are significant gaps in data availability and reliability, hindering informed decision-making. Multiple efforts are underway to improve IT within the department. DOD is working on improving IT systems and gathering data for policy decisions. Analysts believe that integrating data into the organization's culture is crucial for success. Leadership is seen as key to changing the culture, with a report by IBM emphasizing the importance of using data for decisions transparently. Leadership support is crucial for a successful analytics program, with senior acquisition officials in DOD emphasizing the need for a data-informed decision-making process. This focus is evident in various initiatives, such as the release of the first annual report on the Performance of the Defense Acquisitions System in 2013, which heavily relies on data analysis over a 30-year period. The Defense Department is investing billions in building IT systems and tools to support data-driven decision-making in defense acquisitions. Senior leadership is promoting a more data-driven process for supply chain management, but some argue that more action is needed. The federal government is also working to improve data quality. The government is improving data quality by overhauling data systems like FPDS and working on consistency in operations and support data. The Defense Department established an analytics center in 2013 to analyze data for acquisitions and policy-making. The Cost Analysis and Program Evaluation office (CAPE) launched the CADE project to consolidate historical acquisition data into an online system for decision-makers and cost analysts. The military services are also working on better integrating data into decision-making, with the Navy reassessing IT systems to determine necessary data. The Air Force has set up the Air Force IT Business Analytics Office to identify potential cost savings, amounting to over $500 million. Congress has been credited with helping the Department of Defense improve data usage in decision-making. The Weapon System Acquisition Reform Act focused on using data to inform decisions in the early stages of the acquisition process, leading to improved cost estimates and requiring a root cause analysis of cost, schedule, and performance in DOD. The FY2010 NDAA requires DOD to ensure its financial statements are audit-ready and improve management information accuracy. Auditability aims to enhance awareness and control of operations for greater efficiency in deploying resources, although success is not guaranteed. To improve data-based decision-making in DOD, success is not guaranteed. Past efforts to enhance efficiency and management have had mixed results, with some successes like the Navy's Air System Command but also failures like the Air Force's cancelled ERP system. It will take years for DOD to implement and improve data systems and foster a data-driven decision-making culture. To improve data-based decision-making in DOD, it may take years to affect decisions with data due to sparse historic data. Building a robust historical database is crucial to understand long-term trends and avoid knee-jerk reactions to short-term events. Former Under Secretary of Defense Robert Hale emphasized promoting efficiency in data systems. Former Under Secretary of Defense Robert Hale emphasizes the importance of promoting efficiency in data systems within the Department of Defense. Congressional action, such as allocating resources and passing legislation, plays a crucial role in supporting the use of data for decision-making in defense acquisitions. Congress could further improve defense acquisitions by considering key questions to guide their actions. Congress may need to allocate resources to build analytical capability in defense acquisitions, including investing in IT systems and increasing the capacity of relevant offices within DOD. It is important to consider if DOD has a clear strategy for understanding its data needs and deployment. To what extent does DOD have a clear strategy for data analysis and technology deployment? Does DOD have the capability and personnel for robust data analysis? Is there a strategy in place for hiring qualified personnel or contracting out for data analysis? The importance of a data-driven decision-making culture within the organization is emphasized. The culture of using data for decision-making should be integrated into the organization's routines. Congress could consider legislation to promote data use in DOD. Key considerations include assessing DOD's culture for data use, examining incentives that promote or hinder data use, incorporating data analysis into routine processes, and having a clear strategy for using data analytics in acquisitions. The recent RAND report highlighted inefficiencies in access to acquisition data within DOD, raising questions about the balance between data-sharing for efficiency and information security concerns."
