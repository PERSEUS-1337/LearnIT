    "content": "Each year, Congress funds the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to renew over 2.1 million Section 8 vouchers, which are rental subsidies for low-income families in the private market. These vouchers help cover the difference between rent and the tenant's expected contribution (30% of adjusted income). The Section 8 voucher program covers the difference between a tenant's rent and their expected contribution, which is 30% of their income. Changes in tenant incomes, rents, and payment standards affect this cost. Congress and HUD have made changes to voucher renewal funding distribution, leading to funding uncertainty for many Public Housing Authorities. This has prompted pressure on Congress to adopt a permanent funding formula. The Section 8 voucher program has led to funding uncertainty for many Public Housing Authorities, prompting pressure on Congress to adopt a permanent funding formula. Congress enacted renewal funding formula changes starting in FY2003, which affected PHAs administering the voucher program. Each PHA was funded based on their average annual per-voucher cost from the previous year, adjusted by an inflation factor and multiplied by the number of vouchers authorized for lease. Despite receiving full funding, few Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) were able to lease 100% of their authorized vouchers, leading to low utilization rates of just over 91% in FY2000 and FY2001. This low utilization resulted in PHAs having more money in their budgets than needed and rarely needing to dip into their one-month program reserves. Despite receiving full funding, PHAs rarely needed to dip into their reserves as their budgets had more money than needed. HUD reconciled budgets with PHAs at year-end, recapturing excess funds. HUD used a formula to request funding from Congress for Section 8 vouchers, increasing funding along with costs for PHAs. Unused funds recaptured from PHAs were made available for rescission by Congress. The funding system for PHAs allowed for increased funding with rising costs and the creation of new vouchers through maximized leasing. Congress provided more funds for voucher renewals than needed, recapturing unused funds the following year. In FY2003, Congress changed the funding method to reduce recaptures and align funding levels with actual voucher use. The funding system for PHAs was changed in FY2003 to align funding with actual voucher use, reducing the amount of appropriations needed for the program. HUD was directed to fund PHAs based on their average annual per-voucher cost from the previous year, increased by the inflation factor, and multiplied by the number of vouchers the PHA could reasonably be expected to lease in that year. HUD implemented a provision to base PHAs' budgets on their utilization rates and costs reported on their financial statements, adjusted for inflation factors. This change aimed to align funding with actual voucher use and reduce the amount of appropriations needed for the program. HUD guidance released in 2003 states that renewal calculations for voucher funding will be based on total unit months under lease and actual cost data reported by PHAs. Funding increments will generally be renewed for three-month terms, allowing for more accurate funding calculations. (HUD Notice PIH 2003-23, Issued September 22, 2003) Congress created a Central Reserve fund for the Secretary to replenish PHA reserves in case of increased costs. The fund can be used for contract amendments due to higher voucher costs or increased unit months under lease. The annual contributions contract established the total number of unit months provided. Restrictions were placed on maximized leasing, preventing PHAs from supporting more vouchers than authorized. This caused issues for over-leased PHAs, leading to limitations on reissuing vouchers. The FY2004 appropriations law continued funding based on actual voucher utilization, not total authorized vouchers. The FY2004 appropriations law focused on controlling costs in the voucher program by limiting maximized leasing and emphasizing actual voucher utilization over total authorized vouchers. The Secretary was expected to use administrative authority to manage rising costs of renewing expiring annual contributions contracts. The FY2004 appropriations law aimed to control costs in the voucher program by emphasizing actual voucher utilization and limiting maximized leasing. The Secretary was required to renew expiring section 8 tenant-based annual contributions contracts based on unit months under lease and apply an inflation factor to the per-unit cost. The FY2004 appropriations law aimed to control costs in the voucher program by emphasizing actual voucher utilization and limiting maximized leasing. The Central Reserve fund could only be used to replenish reserves depleted due to increased utilization, not increased costs. HUD issued guidelines to reflect increased per-unit costs in the amount provided for renewals. HUD issued a notice on April 22, 2004 (PIH 2004-7) implementing the FY2004 appropriations law. PHAs' budgets would be based on their utilization rates and costs from their end-of-the-year statements as of August 1, 2003, adjusted by the annual adjustment factor (AAF). PHAs could appeal to the Secretary if rental costs in their areas had risen higher than the inflation factor adopted by HUD. The notice was controversial among housing advocates. HUD issued a notice on April 22, 2004 implementing the FY2004 appropriations law. PHAs could appeal if rental costs had risen higher than the inflation factor adopted by HUD. On August 31, 2004, HUD granted appeals requests of 380 agencies out of approximately 400, distributing $160 million from the Central Reserve. The final FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act moved the program further in that direction. The Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 108-447) directed the Secretary to fund PHAs based on voucher costs and utilization rates as of specific months in 2004, adjusted for new tenant protection vouchers. If data was unavailable, funding was based on year-end financial statements. If funding was insufficient, budgets were prorated. The FY2005 appropriations act directed PHAs to manage voucher programs within their budgets for CY2005, reducing agency reserves and maintaining the prohibition on maximized leasing. HUD was given flexibility to adjust payment standards and portability policies to stay within budgets. Additionally, PHAs received voucher renewal funding differently than before. The FY2005 appropriations act changed how PHAs received voucher renewal funding, shifting to a calendar-year cycle. HUD provided guidance on this change in December 2004, with agencies notified of preliminary budget levels on December 17, 2004. PHAs had to adjust their budgeting process accordingly. In 2004, PHAs were required to report data errors to HUD within 10 days. Appeals were limited to data errors only, not the budget calculation formula. Final funding calculations were published on January 21, 2005, with agencies receiving 4.03% less than their actual costs plus the 2005 AAF. Funding was prorated at just under 96% due to insufficient Congress funding for voucher renewals. The median change in PHA renewal budgets from FY2004 to FY2005 was an increase of 0.17%, with a wide variance ranging from a decrease of 12% to an increase of 14%. HUD published Notice PIH 2005-9 on February 25, 2005, providing PHAs with options to lower costs in 2005. Suggestions included lowering payment standards, reducing utility assistance, and reviewing rents for market reasonableness. The FY2006 HUD Appropriations Act (P.L. 109-115) distributed renewal funding to Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) based on their eligibility in CY2005, adjusted for inflation and prorated to fit within the appropriated amount. Measures included restricting portability, reviewing rents for market reasonableness, suspending voucher reissuance, enforcing minimum rents, monitoring income eligibility strictly, and terminating assistance due to insufficient funds. The FY2006 HUD Appropriations Act provided $45 million for adjusting agency budgets based on low leasing or rising costs. PHAs were directed to respond to projected funding letters by February 3, 2006, but the amount provided by Congress was insufficient to fully fund PHAs in CY2006. The FY2006 HUD Appropriations Act provided $45 million for adjusting agency budgets based on low leasing or rising costs. PHAs were funded at about 94% of their eligibility due to insufficient funding from Congress. Changes enacted in FY2005 and FY2006 incentivized PHAs to reduce costs, leading to a decline in average annual per voucher costs by about 1.5% from 2005 to September 2006. Utilization of funding by Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) declined from over 98% in 2004 to around 90% in September 2006, resulting in fewer households receiving assistance. PHAs had accumulated reserve funds, with unspent balances averaging 10% of their budget authority from January 2005 to September 2006. Nationally, budget utilization dropped to under 92% in 2006. The debate in FY2007 focused on a \"budget-based\" funding formula for PHAs. In FY2007, President Bush requested Congress to fund the voucher program using a budget-based formula similar to FY2005 and FY2006. The budget also asked Congress to lift the prohibition on maximized leasing due to some PHAs receiving more funding than they can use. In FY2007, 168 PHAs had excess funding they couldn't use for additional families due to being at their cap on authorized vouchers. Congress rejected President Bush's proposal and adopted a formula based on PHAs' leasing and cost data from the most recent 12 months. The law allocated funding based on PHAs' leasing and cost data from the most recent 12 months, adjusted for various factors, with a central reserve fund for adjustments in renewal costs or funding decreases. The law allocated funding based on PHAs' leasing and cost data from the most recent 12 months, adjusted for various factors, with a central reserve fund for adjustments in renewal costs or funding decreases. P.L. 110-28 later amended the formula to provide exceptions for three categories of PHAs, including Hurricane Katrina-affected agencies, agencies under receivership, and agencies that spent more in FY2006 than their FY2006 allocations plus unspent voucher funds. Under the FY2007 formula change, PHAs were funded based on their usage in FY2006 rather than what they received. PHAs with higher costs and utilization rates did better under this formula, while those with lower costs did worse. Funding was sufficient to fund all PHAs at more than 105% of their previous funding levels. The FY2007 formula for funding PHAs was a combination of unit-based and budget-based elements. Funding allocations were based on the number of vouchers used, with caps in place. The funding provided was sufficient for agencies to serve the same or more families as long as they stayed within their caps. The FY2007 formula for funding PHAs was a combination of unit-based and budget-based elements, with funding allocations based on the number of vouchers used. Then-President Bush's FY2008 budget request included a proposal for a strictly \"budget-based\" voucher funding formula, adjusted for various costs and pro-rated to fit within the budget. The President planned to update the funding formula in FY2009 using recent data. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act adopted a cost and utilization-based formula for agency funding, with adjustments for various costs and reserves for budget adjustments. The FY2008 Act made adjustments to agency budgets and introduced a new formula for certain categories of agencies. It included a rescission that reduced each PHA's funding level based on their unusable reserves exceeding 7% of their total received in FY2007. The FY2008 Act rescinded $723 million in renewal funding to PHAs with unusable reserves above 7%, freeing up funds for additional vouchers without reducing total funding available. President Bush proposed a budget-based funding formula for FY2009. The FY2009 omnibus funding bill directed HUD to fund PHAs based on the number of vouchers leased in FY2008, adjusted for inflation and other factors, with allocations prorated based on Net Restricted Assets. The FY2009 omnibus funding bill directed HUD to fund PHAs based on the number of vouchers leased in FY2008, adjusted for inflation and other factors, with allocations prorated based on Net Restricted Assets. PHAs were expected to supplement their allocations with unused NRA and a $100 million renewal set-aside was included for adjustments under certain circumstances. HUD based CY2009 allocations on utilization and cost data submitted by PHAs for FY2008. HUD estimated PHAs' CY2009 funding based on utilization and cost data from FY2008. However, inaccuracies in the estimates arose from inaccurately reported data or significant changes in cost and leasing conditions. As a result, some PHAs found their funding insufficient to cover all voucher costs, affecting up to 15% of agencies. HUD estimated that up to 15% of PHAs administering the voucher program faced funding shortfalls in CY2009. The department provided assistance through additional funding from renewal set-asides and administrative fees to help agencies stay within their budgets. If a PHA lacks sufficient funding to renew all vouchers, they may have to stop issuing vouchers, potentially causing families to lose assistance. HUD advised agencies on cost-cutting measures to address the shortfall. In response to concerns about families losing assistance, Congress enacted legislation permitting HUD to access additional funding (up to $200 million) to prevent termination of assistance to families in CY2009. This policy change increased set-aside renewal funding provided to HUD in FY2009 and allowed it to be used for this purpose. The Obama Administration's FY2010 budget requested a funding formula similar to previous years, with the addition of the authority to offset agencies' budgets for excess reserves and reallocate the funding to high-performing or needy agencies. The budget also sought to lift the prohibition on over-leasing. The final FY2010 funding law adopted a funding formula based on FY2009 data, adjusted for inflation. It did not provide the Secretary with the authority to offset agency budgets based on reserves or lift the prohibition on over-leasing. Unlike previous years, there was no offset for unspent agency reserves in the FY2010 allocation formula. Congress directed HUD to allocate Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher renewal in FY2011 and FY2012. In FY2011 and FY2012, Congress directed HUD to allocate Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher renewal funding to PHAs based on costs and utilization. The FY2011 law (P.L. 112-10) had no offset from PHA reserves, while the FY2012 law (P.L. 112-55) included a $650 million rescission offset from PHAs with reserves above a certain level. PHAs were serving more families than authorized and spending almost all federal funds before funding formula changes between FY2003 and FY2006. Since FY2003, funding formula changes led to PHAs serving fewer families and spending a smaller share of federal funding. Low utilization persisted with the FY2007 formula change. Transitioning to a hybrid cost and utilization-based model saw utilization increase from 91% in 2006 to 95% by 2009, serving over 150,000 more families. By 2009, PHAs were serving more families than in 2006, with reserves being spent down due to rescissions in FY2008 and FY2009. Per voucher costs began rising in CY2007 and were expected to continue increasing in CY2012. Congressional members have introduced voucher reform legislation to address funding formula changes. The voucher reform legislation proposes changes to the voucher renewal funding formula, similar to recent appropriations acts. However, the Appropriations Committees can still override the formula with a different allocation formula in the annual appropriations act. Prior to FY2003, the Section 8 voucher program was funded like an entitlement program. The Section 8 voucher program was initially funded like an entitlement program, with Congress determining the amount based on a formula. Concerns about inefficient funding allocations and rising costs led to funding changes starting in FY2003, converting the program's funding structure to a fixed annual sum similar to other discretionary programs. The Section 8 voucher program transitioned from an entitlement program to a fixed annual sum funding structure in FY2003. This change gave Congress more budget control but made program administration more challenging for Public Housing Authorities (PHAs). PHAs had limited control over costs due to statutorily set subsidies, leading to adjustments in payment standards and voucher issuance. Some Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) adjusted payment standards to 100% or less of local fair market rents, leading to rent reductions for landlords. PHAs also selected higher-income families to lower subsidy costs, but still had to target 75% of vouchers to low-income families. Some PHAs intentionally reduced voucher issuance rates to control utilization. Some PHAs intentionally lowered voucher issuance rates to save money, resulting in fewer households receiving vouchers. Data from HUD shows that voucher costs and utilization rates declined from 2005 to 2006. Average voucher costs decreased by around 1.5% and average utilization dropped by over 2% during that period. Some agencies received more funds than allowed, leading to unused funds despite waiting lists for vouchers. Budget-based funding formulas in FY2005 and FY2006 did not decrease funding even if costs decreased. Changes in funding formulas were controversial. The FY2007 funding bill reversed recent trends by enacting a voucher renewal funding formula similar to the one that was in place when the changes first began. PHAs were funded based on the amount of funding they were using in the previous year, rather than the amount of money they had received. The FY2007 funding bill changed the voucher renewal funding formula to be based on the amount of funding PHAs were using in the previous year. This resulted in PHAs with large funding surpluses receiving less funding in FY2007. However, funding was sufficient to serve all PHAs with over 105% of their formula eligibility. FY2008 and FY2009 formulas closely followed the FY2007 formula, with reductions in budgets for agencies with excess reserve funding. Rescissions and offsets were implemented to make unusable funding available. The funding formula for voucher renewals changed in FY2007 to be based on previous year's usage, resulting in PHAs with surpluses receiving less funding. Rescissions and offsets were used to make unused funding available. In FY2010 and FY2011, formulas were similar to FY2009 but without reductions related to reserves. In FY2012, agency reserves were used to offset renewal costs. The new cost and utilization-based funding model incentivizes PHAs to increase utilization, leading to rising costs and utilization, increasing the program's cost to Congress. The rising costs of the program may pressure policy makers to contain costs, which could lead to a reduction in the number of families served and accumulation of unspent funds. Future cost containment strategies should aim to maintain service levels while minimizing unspent funds. Proposed Section 8 voucher reform legislation focuses on maximizing families served without capping future costs. Proposed Section 8 voucher reform legislation aims to maximize families served without firmly capping future cost growth, potentially overridden by future appropriations legislation."
