The Veterans Benefits Administration is responsible for processing claims for veterans compensation and pension. Concerns have been raised about the accuracy of claims processing, despite previous reports of a 95 percent accuracy rate. A new accuracy measurement system called the Systematic Technical Accuracy Review revealed discrepancies in 1998. The Veterans Benefits Administration found that initial reviews of veterans claims were accurate only 64 percent of the time in 1998 and 2000.

More aggressive steps are needed to process veterans claims accurately and timely to prevent delays in providing compensation and pension benefits. In 2001, delays in providing veterans with compensation and pension benefits were evident.
