    "content": "The Act titled \"Commonsense Reporting and Verification Act of 2015\" includes sections on findings, a prospective reporting system, protection of dependent privacy, electronic statements, GAO studies, and an eligibility verification process for ACA subsidies. The Act \"Commonsense Reporting and Verification Act of 2015\" aims to minimize compliance burdens under the Affordable Care Act while protecting individual privacy. It includes a prospective reporting system. The Act \"Commonsense Reporting and Verification Act of 2015\" mandates the implementation of a voluntary prospective reporting system by the Secretary of the Treasury within 180 days of enactment. This system, to be available by September 2, 2016, allows employers to report voluntarily on plan years starting after December 31, 2015. Employers can voluntarily report their name, employer identification number, and certification regarding offering minimum essential coverage to full-time employees, dependents, and spouses. The prospective reporting includes details on coverage for part-time employees, meeting minimum value requirements, and qualifying for affordability safe harbors. The reporting requirements include details on coverage availability for full-time employees, any waiting periods, and secure access to information by Exchanges, the Federal Marketplace Data Services Hub, and the IRS. The process allows agencies to access necessary information for eligibility determinations and follow up with employers for additional details on employees. The system created allows employers to provide updates on employee coverage changes to the Federal Marketplace Data Services Hub. Employers can provide prospective reporting for a calendar year through the system created under subsection (a) to meet certain requirements. This allows the employer to satisfy return requirements of section 6056 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the requirements of section 6056(c) for the calendar year in which the plan year ends. Employees can report enrollment in a qualified health plan through the Exchange to the Internal Revenue Service and employer recipients of notices under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Employers may use third parties for filing tax credits or subsidies under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Employer notification of employee enrollments is required by each Exchange established under the Act. Employers must be notified when an employee or dependent enrolls in a qualified health plan through the Exchange established under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. SEC. 4. PROTECTION OF DEPENDENT PRIVACY. Section 6055(b) of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to allow for the use of an individual's name and date of birth in place of their TIN if the information was not collected before January 1, 2014. This amendment applies to protect dependent privacy. The amendment made by this section applies to returns due after 60 days from the enactment of the Act. SEC. 5. ELECTRONIC STATEMENTS. Section 6056(c) of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to allow individuals to receive statements electronically if they have previously consented to it with their employer. Refusal in writing can override this consent. Section 6055(c) of the Internal Revenue Code now allows individuals to receive health insurance coverage statements electronically if they have previously consented to receive private health information in electronic form. The amendments made by this section apply to statements with a due date after December 31, 2015. SEC. 6. GAO STUDIES. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study evaluating the notification of employers by Exchanges regarding full-time employees eligible for advance payment of premium tax credits under the Affordable Care Act from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2016. The study will evaluate employer notifications by Exchanges regarding employees eligible for premium tax credits under the Affordable Care Act, including data elements, notification process, and employer feedback. The study will assess employer notifications by Exchanges regarding employees eligible for premium tax credits under the Affordable Care Act, including the adequacy of information provided, total number of notifications sent, timeline of notifications, differences between Federal and State-Based Marketplaces. The study will assess employer notifications by Exchanges regarding employees eligible for premium tax credits under the Affordable Care Act, including challenges in the notification process and recommendations to address them. It will also evaluate the establishment of a separate appeals process for employers to challenge eligibility determinations. The Comptroller General will submit a report to relevant committees one year after the enactment of the Act, detailing the results of a study on a prospective reporting system conducted from January 1, 2017, to December. The Comptroller General will report on the functionality and challenges of the prospective reporting system established under section 3 from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2017, by July 1, 2018, to relevant committees. The Comptroller General will report on the results of the study conducted under paragraph (1) to the relevant committees by July 1, 2018. SEC. 7. ELIGIBILITY VERIFICATION PROCESS FOR ACA SUBSIDIES. A marketplace can automatically reenroll an individual in a qualified health plan annually, as long as eligibility for subsidies is redetermined and changes in premiums and the Federal poverty level are considered. The marketplace may not automatically reenroll an individual into a qualified health plan with subsidies if current income information is not provided for redetermination of eligibility. The provisions of this section aim to align with the guidance on annual eligibility redeterminations and reenrollments for marketplace coverage issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on April 22, 2015. The Secretary will apply rules consistent with this section for annual eligibility redeterminations and reenrollments for coverage and for tax credits and cost-sharing reduction. The guidance for annual eligibility redeterminations and reenrollments for marketplace coverage includes provisions for maintaining authorization for disclosure of information, requesting updated income information annually. The term \"marketplace\" refers to State Based Exchanges and the Federally Facilitated Exchange established under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Enrollees must receive timely notices about annual redeterminations and reenrollments."
