    "content": "The Act titled \"Conventional Arms Threat Reduction Act of 2004\" is cited as such. The findings and sense of Congress are outlined in the following sections. The global proliferation of MANPADS, small arms, light weapons, and tactical missile systems poses a direct threat to US national security. Their use by terrorists hampers peace efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the spread of missile systems threatens international peace. The Government Accountability Office estimates there are 500,000 to 750,000 MANPADS worldwide. Many countries have surplus weapons but lack the means to dispose of them. The US lacks a comprehensive program to address conventional arms threat reduction and missile elimination in other countries. The Department of State has not used the Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund for any activity to eliminate tactical missile systems since 2002. Congress believes the US should assist countries in securing, removing, or eliminating MANPADS, conventional weapons, and tactical missile systems that pose a proliferation threat.
