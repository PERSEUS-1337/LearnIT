    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Commission on Probabilistic Methods Act\". The Congress recognizes the wide applicability of probabilistic methods in improving efficiency and reducing overdesign in government programs. Integration of these methods in business practices has saved billions for companies, but Federal use lags behind industry. Probabilistic methods offer better understanding of safety and environmental risks, leading to more business-friendly outcomes. Properly applied probabilistic methods can lead to more business-friendly regulations and reduce overdesign and associated costs in federally funded design efforts. Additionally, the appropriate use of probabilistic methods within the Department of Transportation programs could result in more reliable and less costly components of the transportation system. The use of probabilistic methods in federally funded design efforts can benefit various infrastructure projects and programs of Federal agencies like the Department of Defense, Department of Commerce, and National Institutes of Health. The Administrator of the Research and Special Programs Administration of the Department of Transportation will establish the Commission on Probabilistic Methods to benefit infrastructure projects and Federal agencies. The Commission on Probabilistic Methods will identify ways to help the Department of Transportation, assess how these methods can improve ROI and public safety, evaluate technology, recommend practical techniques, and create models to quantify uncertainties in major programs. The Commission on Probabilistic Methods will recommend guidelines for implementing technology in Department of Transportation programs, identifying key technology areas, setting reliability levels for public safety, creating safety test guidelines, establishing databases, and expediting technology transfer. The Commission on Probabilistic Methods will recommend guidelines for implementing technology in Department of Transportation programs, identifying legal and cultural barriers, making recommendations for institutionalizing probabilistic methods values, and recommending pilot projects for evaluation. The Commission on Probabilistic Methods will recommend pilot projects for evaluating technology. SEC. 5. MEMBERSHIP. The Commission shall consist of 19 members, including a chairperson from an engineering society with experience in probabilistic methods, representatives from higher education, government, industry, labor, environmental community, public interest, and a Department of Defense appointee. The Commission consists of 19 members appointed by various entities including the Department of Defense, Department of Commerce, and National Institutes of Health. Members serve for life and vacancies are filled in the same manner as the original appointment. Members serve without pay. The Commission consists of 19 members appointed by various entities.

It can also obtain necessary information directly from US departments or agencies. Additionally, the Commission is authorized to use the United States mails. The Commission is authorized to use the United States mails for communication, similar to other government departments and agencies. SEC. 7.
