    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. Congress finds that the tax treatment of section 529 college savings plans was changed in 2001 to exempt qualified distributions from income tax. These plans help middle-class families save for college, with 11.83 million accounts totaling $244.5 billion in assets. States have made 529 plans accessible by allowing low minimum contributions. The average 529 account size is $20,671, with states setting minimum contributions as low as $25 per month to encourage participation. The President's proposed tax on 529 plans may discourage their use, leading to more student debt. The Act aims to strengthen and modernize 529 plans to better serve students today. The Act aims to allow computer technology and equipment as qualified higher education expenses for Section 529 accounts. This amendment applies to taxable years starting after December 31, 2014. Additionally, distribution aggregation requirements are eliminated. SEC. 3 eliminates distribution aggregation requirements in Section 529(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, effective for distributions after December 31, 2014. SEC. 4 allows for the recontribution of refunded amounts. The amendment allows beneficiaries to recontribute refunded qualified higher education expenses to a qualified tuition program within 60 days after the refund, not exceeding the refunded amount. Effective for refunds after December 31, 2014.
