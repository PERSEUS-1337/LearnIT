    "content": "Under the OCSLA, the DOI must create five-year programs for oil and gas lease sales in U.S. waters, balancing energy supply and environmental protection. The BOEM leads this process, which involves multiple drafts, economic and environmental analysis, and approval by the Secretary of the Interior and Congress. The NEPA requires a programmatic planning process. The Secretary of the Interior must submit each program to the President and Congress for a 60-day review period. The planning process includes a programmatic environmental impact statement (PEIS) as required by NEPA. Public comments from stakeholders are addressed in both the PEIS and the five-year program. The Administration cannot revise a finalized program without restarting the process, but scheduled sales could potentially be canceled during implementation based on environmental review requirements. The Administration cannot revise a finalized program without restarting the process, but scheduled sales could potentially be canceled during implementation based on environmental review requirements. BOEM released the final version of its oil and gas leasing program for 2017-2022, which includes 11 lease sales on the OCS. Former Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell approved the final program, which was revised from earlier proposed programs. Some sales proposed in earlier versions were not included in the final program. The leasing decisions in BOEM's five-year programs may impact the economy and environment of coastal states and the nation. The leasing decisions in BOEM's five-year programs may impact the economy and environment of coastal states and the nation. Congress is actively involved in the planning process for these programs, influencing them through public comments, oversight hearings, and legislation. The 114th Congress engaged in various forms of influence regarding the proposed program for 2017-2022. The 114th Congress influenced the proposed program for 2017-2022 through oversight hearings and legislation. The report discusses the history and legal framework for BOEM's offshore oil and gas leasing programs, development process, previous programs, and analysis of the 2017-2022 program. Congress plays a role in oversight and legislation related to the program, with a focus on jurisdiction and rights off the coasts of the United States. The 114th Congress influenced the proposed program for 2017-2022 through oversight hearings and legislation related to jurisdiction and rights off the coasts of the United States. They enacted two laws, the Submerged Lands Act and the OCSLA, to address regulation of subsurface oil and natural gas exploration and production. The OCSLA aimed for expedited development of OCS resources while ensuring environmental safeguards and maintaining competition. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act was created to allow for expedited exploration and production while also providing for environmental protection, opportunities for state and local governments to have a say, and a competitive bidding process. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments of 1978 added new provisions to expedite exploration and production for national energy goals while ensuring environmental protection. Section 18 mandates the creation of a leasing program to meet energy needs for a five-year period. These programs, starting in 1980, set schedules for lease auctions. Congress has made other changes since 1978, like the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995 to encourage deep-water exploration. The DOI adopted the OCSLA in 1980. Congress has made various changes since then, such as the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995 and the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006, which directed leasing in certain regions and revenue sharing with Gulf states. Congressional actions have influenced subsequent five-year offshore oil and gas leasing programs. The statutory framework for BOEM's development of these programs includes the OCSLA, NEPA, and other federal statutes. The OCSLA, along with other federal statutes like NEPA and CZMA, governs BOEM's development of a five-year offshore oil and gas leasing program. Section 18 of the OCSLA mandates the Secretary of the Interior to prepare and revise a leasing program that considers economic, social, and environmental values of the OCS, as well as the impact of exploration on marine and coastal environments. This program includes a schedule of proposed lease sales to meet national energy needs for a five-year period. Section 18 of the OCSLA directs the Secretary of the Interior to manage the OCS by considering economic, social, and environmental values, as well as the impact of oil and gas exploration on marine and coastal environments. The leasing program must balance various factors, including geographical, geological, and ecological characteristics, environmental considerations, producer interests, and state laws. Fair market value must be ensured for leased lands, and estimates on appropriations and staffing needs are required. The OCSLA requires the Secretary of the Interior to manage the OCS by considering economic, social, and environmental values. Leasing programs must balance various factors and ensure fair market value for leased lands. Consultation with federal agencies, state governors, and local officials is mandatory. Proposed programs must be submitted to affected state governors for comments at least 60 days prior to publication in the Federal Register. The OCSLA mandates consultation with local government officials in affected states before submitting a proposed program to state governors for comments. The Secretary must also submit the program to Congress and the President, along with explanations for any rejected recommendations. The Secretary can approve a final five-year program and revise it at any time, with significant revisions requiring the same process as the initial program. The OCSLA allows the Secretary to approve a final five-year program and revise it as needed, with significant revisions requiring the same process as the initial program. BOEM carries out the Secretary's responsibilities, including consultation with affected states and publication of the proposed program. NEPA and CZMA also play a role in the program's formation. The OCSLA allows the Secretary to approve and revise the five-year program, with NEPA and CZMA guiding the process. NEPA requires federal agencies to assess environmental impacts and alternatives to major actions, leading to the preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS). BOEM assumes the significance of the program's impact and prepares a programmatic EIS (PEIS) concurrently with the five-year program. The BOEM prepares a programmatic EIS (PEIS) concurrently with the five-year program, as required by NEPA and CZMA. States are encouraged to enact coastal zone management plans under CZMA to coordinate protection of habitats and resources in coastal waters. Approved state programs must address conservation measures, permissible land and water uses, and water pollution sources. The federal government and federally permitted activities must comply with these state programs according to BOEM regulations. The CZMA requires state programs to designate conservation measures and permissible land and water uses, as well as address water pollution sources. BOEM regulations mandate that federal activities comply with state coastal zone management programs. BOEM develops a five-year leasing program, considering state coastal zone management programs. The program goes through multiple drafts for review and comment by state governors, federal agencies, Congress, and the President. BOEM's five-year program development involves multiple drafts for review by state governors, federal agencies, Congress, and the President. Each stage includes public comment and environmental review, leading to a winnowing process. The initial draft analyzes planning areas for leasing, considering public input to propose lease sales. The five-year program development by BOEM involves multiple drafts for review, with each stage including public comment and environmental review. The initial draft analyzes planning areas for leasing, considering public input to propose lease sales. The successive drafts represent a winnowing process where only selected areas undergo further analysis and environmental review. The final version of the plan may remove proposed sales but cannot add new sales without reverting to an earlier stage of the process. Step 1 - Request for Information is the first step in developing a new five-year program. BOEM publishes a request for information in the Federal Register to gather input on energy needs, leasing interests, environmental concerns, and more. The RFI for the 2017-2022 leasing program was published on June 16, 2014, and received over half a million comments. Step 2 - Draft Proposed Program is the next stage where BOEM publishes a draft proposed program based on analysis and public comments from the RFI. The DPP identifies areas proposed for lease sales over the next five years and includes a preliminary schedule for the sales. The Draft Proposed Program (DPP) represents the initial proposal for lease sales in the upcoming five-year period. It analyzes all OCS planning areas available for leasing, identifies areas proposed for lease sales, and includes a preliminary schedule for the sales. BOEM published the DPP for 2017-2022 on January 29, 2015, and received over 1 million comments. Following the DPP, BOEM publishes a Proposed Program (PP) after further analysis and public input, which is the second version of the program. The Proposed Program (PP) for the five-year period refines the locations and timing for OCS oil and gas lease sales. It is submitted to Congress, state governors, and relevant federal agencies for public comment. The PP for 2017-2022 was published on March 15, 2016, with a comment period closing on June 16, 2016. The Final Program (PFP) is based on additional analysis of factors in the OCSLA and public comments on the PP, submitted to the President and Congress for review. The 2017-2022 draft PEIS closed on May 2, 2016. The Proposed Final Program (PFP) is based on additional analysis of factors in the OCSLA and public comments on the PP. The PFP is announced in the Federal Register and submitted to the President and Congress for review. The final PEIS for the 2017-2022 program was released on November 18, 2016. The Secretary of the Interior may approve the PFP at least 60 days after submission, and it becomes final. Former Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell issued a record of decision for the final program. The final PEIS for the 2017-2022 program was approved by the Secretary of the Interior on January 17, 2017. Since 1980, eight five-year programs have been submitted to Congress, reflecting different presidential administrations' offshore oil and gas leasing policies. The 2012-2017 program was submitted under former Secretary Ken Salazar, reflecting Obama Administration policies. The 2012-2017 offshore oil and gas leasing program reflected Obama Administration policies post-Deepwater Horizon spill. It included 15 proposed lease sales, with 11 held by late November 2016. The 2007-2012 program under the Bush Administration had 21 sales and was revised in 2009. The 2007-2012 five-year program was submitted to Congress under the Bush Administration's direction, with 21 sales initially scheduled. The Obama Administration later resubmitted the program in 2010 with a revised schedule of 16 sales, of which 11 were held before the program expired in June 2012. The 2002-2007 program had 20 lease sales, while the 1997-2002 program had 15 lease sales before expiring. The submission for the 1992-1997 program under the George H. W. Bush Administration included a schedule of 18 lease sales, with 12 sales held before the program expired in June 1997. The program reflected Reagan Administration policies and had 42 approved lease sales, with 17 held before expiring in June 1992. The 1980-1982 program for domestic oil and gas leasing was presented to Congress in 1980 under former Secretary of the Interior Cecil D. Andrus. It consisted of 36 sales, with 12 held before the program expired in June 1982. The 1980-1982 domestic oil and gas leasing program, presented to Congress under former Secretary of the Interior Cecil D. Andrus, consisted of 36 sales, with 12 held before the program expired in June 1982. In November 2016, BOEM released the final version of its offshore oil and gas leasing program for 2017-2022, scheduling 11 lease sales in specific regions of the OCS. The program includes lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions. The BOEM identifies four OCS regions with a total of 26 planning areas. The regions are the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska, Atlantic, and Pacific. The 2017-2022 final program schedules lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions. Offshore crude oil production accounted for 16% of U.S. total production in FY2015, a decline from FY2010. Offshore natural gas production also declined during the same period. The surge in total U.S. crude oil and natural gas production is due to increased production of shale gas and shale oil in unconventional onshore formations. Offshore natural gas production volumes fell by nearly 50% between FY2010 and FY2015, while U.S. total annual natural gas production rose by more than 30%. The increased U.S. oil production has reduced imports, primarily from OPEC countries. As of November 1, 2016, there were 917 producing offshore oil and natural gas leases on 4.5 million acres of the OCS. Offshore oil and gas leases on the OCS have lower production costs compared to deepwater plays. As of November 1, 2016, there were 917 producing leases on 4.5 million acres, with most located in the Central Gulf of Mexico. The Energy Information Administration anticipates lower domestic investment in oil and gas projects, impacting future production levels. Bonus bid revenues from offshore leasing are expected to decrease significantly in the next five fiscal years. The Office of Management and Budget's crude oil price estimates have decreased significantly from $80-$90 per barrel to $50-$60 per barrel in recent years. Despite this, offshore crude oil production in the Gulf of Mexico is expected to reach record levels in 2017 due to new deepwater projects. Energy diversification, including oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico, remains vital for the U.S. energy supply. Offshore crude oil production in the Gulf of Mexico is expected to reach record levels of 1.91 mbd in 2017, driven by new deepwater projects. Energy diversification, including oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico, is crucial for meeting the country's energy needs. Reserves of oil and gas are measured within pools or fields via well penetration, with no reserves reported along the Atlantic OCS. The U.S. OCS has 4.3 billion barrels of proven oil reserves and 16 Tcf of dry gas, mostly in the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico. The Gulf of Mexico holds 54% of the estimated undiscovered technically recoverable resources for oil and 43% for natural gas. Alaska's UTRR estimates are mainly in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas. BOEM must consider the resource potential when preparing its five-year programs under the OCSLA. The Gulf of Mexico and Alaska hold significant amounts of oil and natural gas reserves. BOEM must consider resource potential, environmental, and socioeconomic impacts when preparing OCSLA programs. Some areas were unavailable for leasing consideration in the 2017-2022 program due to presidential withdrawals, congressional moratoriums, or protected status. This included parts of the Eastern and Central Gulf of Mexico. Areas in the Eastern and Central Gulf of Mexico, Alaska Withdrawal Areas, and National Marine Sanctuaries and Marine Monuments were unavailable for oil and gas leasing consideration in the 2017-2022 program due to various restrictions and withdrawals. Protected areas designated by the Secretary of Commerce and national marine monuments established by U.S. Presidents are withdrawn from future oil and gas leasing activities in parts of the Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean, and Gulf of Mexico. President Obama made additional withdrawals in December 2016 under the OCSLA, including much of the U.S. Arctic and certain areas of the Atlantic Ocean. These withdrawals do not directly impact the 2017-2022 program but will affect future leasing considerations. BOEM's \"tailored leasing strategy\" evaluates each U.S. ocean region separately for leasing criteria. The withdrawals of protected areas in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf of Mexico do not impact the 2017-2022 program but will affect future leasing considerations. BOEM's leasing strategy evaluates each U.S. ocean region separately based on various criteria. The final program includes 11 lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions, with no sales scheduled for the Atlantic and Pacific regions. The 2017-2022 program includes 11 lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions, with no sales scheduled for the Atlantic and Pacific regions. The Gulf of Mexico region is the most mature and accounts for 97% of all U.S. offshore oil and gas production. Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, and Alabama are supportive of offshore activities in this region. The majority of lease sales in the 2017-2022 program are scheduled in the Gulf region, including the Western Gulf, Central Gulf, and Eastern Gulf areas. The Eastern Gulf and a portion of the Central Gulf are closed to oil and gas leasing due to congressional moratorium. BOEM has replaced area-specific sales with region-wide sales to provide greater flexibility to industry and facilitate better planning for exploration. The final program for 2017-2022 schedules fewer lease sales in the Gulf, with all available blocks offered at each sale to provide greater flexibility to industry. Interest in exploring for offshore oil and gas in the Alaska region has grown due to decreases in summer polar ice extent. Interest in exploring for offshore oil and gas in the Alaska region of the U.S. OCS has grown due to decreases in summer polar ice extent, allowing for a longer drilling season. Stakeholders, including the State of Alaska and some Members of Congress, seek to expand offshore oil and gas activities in the region, while others oppose drilling in the Arctic due to environmental concerns. Stakeholders, including the State of Alaska and some Members of Congress, are divided on the issue of expanding offshore oil and gas activities in the Arctic region. The Obama Administration supported exploration but also implemented safety regulations to prevent oil spills. Despite initial plans for lease sales in the Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea, and Cook Inlet, BOEM canceled some sales due to market conditions and low industry interest. BOEM canceled scheduled Chukchi and Beaufort Sea lease sales for 2016 and 2017 due to market conditions and low industry interest. Despite support from the State of Alaska, sales were removed based on factors like existing leases, Arctic ecosystem concerns, industry interest decline, and sufficient domestic energy sources. BOEM noted declining industry interest in Arctic OCS due to low oil prices and Shell's unsuccessful drilling in Chukchi Sea. Active leases decreased by over 90% between Feb 2016 and Nov 2016. BOEM stated that Arctic lease sales were not immediately necessary for US energy needs. Industry interest in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas is expected to increase after 2017-2022. BOEM concluded that Arctic lease sales are not urgently needed due to the current strength of domestic energy supply. President Obama withdrew parts of the Arctic OCS from future leasing, excluding them from BOEM's scheduled Alaska lease sale. The final program for 2017-2022 does not include a lease sale in the Atlantic region, which had been proposed in the DPP version. Congressional bans and presidential moratoria have limited oil and gas activity in the Atlantic region since 1983. Since 1983, congressional bans and presidential moratoria have restricted oil and gas activity in the Atlantic region. Despite changes allowing for potential lease sales, none have occurred. Certain parts of the Atlantic are currently under presidential moratorium, while other areas remain available for leasing. BOEM analyzed various factors for the Atlantic region in the 2017-2022 program, including resource potential, infrastructure needs, ecological and safety concerns, and competing uses. BOEM analyzed factors for the Atlantic region in the 2017-2022 program, including resource potential, infrastructure needs, ecological and safety concerns, and competing uses. Initially, a lease sale was planned for a portion of the Mid- and South Atlantic planning areas in 2021, but it was later removed due to strong local opposition, conflicts with other ocean uses, market dynamics, and feedback from affected states. BOEM decided not to hold an Atlantic lease sale in the 2017-2022 period due to strong local opposition, conflicts with existing ocean uses, market dynamics, and feedback from affected states. The agency noted that the Atlantic lacks a history of offshore mineral production, unlike the Gulf of Mexico. Additionally, the increase in onshore oil and gas production over the past decade has lessened the urgency for additional energy sources from the Atlantic. The 2017-2022 lease sale program by BOEM does not include lease sales for the Pacific region, which has not had federal oil and gas lease sales since 1984. Despite lifting leasing moratoria in 2009, California, Oregon, and Washington governors still oppose offshore oil and gas leasing in the Pacific region. Congress can influence the five-year program development through public comments and oversight hearings. Congress can influence the Administration's development of a five-year program in various ways, such as submitting public comments, holding oversight hearings, and introducing legislation. The 114th Congress utilized these methods for the 2017-2022 program, and the 115th Congress could also address it through legislation. Members of Congress, along with other stakeholders, can submit comments on draft programs, as seen with the 2017-2022 program where BOEM received 15 comments from Members of Congress. Members of Congress, stakeholders, and the public can submit comments on draft five-year programs. For the 2017-2022 program, BOEM received comments from Members of Congress on various aspects, including lease sales and seismic testing in the Atlantic. BOEM considers these comments when revising the program. BOEM considers public comments, including those from Members of Congress, when developing five-year programs. Drafts include summaries of comments and BOEM's responses. Oversight hearings by the House or Senate evaluate proposed programs. Hearings address issues like lease sales, seismic testing in the Atlantic, and Arctic leasing. The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee discussed key issues regarding the proposed oil and gas leasing program, including targeted lease sales in Alaska and the removal of the Atlantic lease sale. Legislation in the 114th Congress aimed to impact the 2017-2022 program, but none of the bills were enacted. Legislation in the 114th Congress aimed to impact the 2017-2022 oil and gas leasing program. Bills such as H.R. 1487, S. 791, and H.R. 1663 proposed changes, including using a previous draft program, requiring more lease sales, and declaring the program approved under NEPA. However, none of these bills were enacted. H.R. 1663 proposed adding lease sales for various regions, including the Chukchi Sea, Beaufort Sea, Bristol Bay, and off the coast of Virginia. It also aimed to declare the final program approved under NEPA and included state revenue-sharing provisions. Additionally, H.R. 3682 sought to amend the OCSLA to require at least 50% of available unleased acreage in each OCS planning area to be made available for leasing. H.R. 3682 aimed to amend the OCSLA by requiring at least 50% of available unleased acreage in each OCS planning area to be made available for leasing. It also aimed to increase oil and gas production by 3 million barrels of oil and 10 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day by 2032. Additionally, the bill allowed the Secretary to add additional areas to approved leasing programs and required BOEM to conduct specific lease sales in the Atlantic region, South Carolina, and Southern California. The bill aimed to amend the OCSLA by requiring leasing of at least 50% of available unleased acreage in each OCS planning area. It also aimed to increase oil and gas production and conduct specific lease sales in the Atlantic region, South Carolina, and Southern California. Additionally, the bill directed the Secretary to conduct lease sales off North Carolina and included provisions for military protections and revenue sharing with coastal states. S. 2011 and S. 1278 aimed to amend the OCSLA by requiring lease sales in areas with large undiscovered resources, reducing leasing moratoriums, and adding lease sales to the program. S. 1278 specifically focused on lease sales in Alaska's Cook Inlet and Beaufort Sea planning areas, with provisions for extending existing leases and revenue sharing with Alaska. The bill aimed to require lease sales in the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea planning areas, extend existing leases for 20 years, and include revenue sharing with Alaska. It also proposed adding the South Atlantic planning area to the program and conducting lease sales in that area. Additionally, the bill addressed conflicts with military operations, consultations with state governors, and geological surveys. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held hearings on S. 1279 and S. 3203, which aimed to require lease sales in the Beaufort, Chukchi, and Cook Inlet planning areas. The bills also included increased revenue sharing with Alaska and changes to lease terms for the Alaska region. Congress has the opportunity to introduce legislation to alter the final version of each five-year leasing program before the Secretary of the Interior can approve and implement it. During the 60-day review period for the current five-year leasing program, Congress could introduce legislation to alter the program. For example, in the 112th Congress, Representative Doc Hastings introduced a bill to replace the submitted program with a congressionally developed plan containing additional lease sales in various regions. Similar bills in the 114th Congress aimed to make changes to the lease sale schedule for the 2017-2022 program, with potential for further alterations in the 115th Congress."
