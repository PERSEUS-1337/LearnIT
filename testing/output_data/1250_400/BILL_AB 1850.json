Section 13000 of the Education Code is amended to establish the California Civil Liberties Public Education Act, aimed at educating the public about the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. The federal Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians (CWRIC) was created by Congress in 1980 to review Executive Order 9066's impact on American citizens and recommend remedies. The CWRIC issued reports in 1983 based on hearings with over 750 witnesses, including evacuees, government officials, and historians. The federal Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians (CWRIC) concluded that Executive Order 9066, which led to the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II, was not justified by military necessity. The decisions made were driven by race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership. President Ronald Reagan signed the federal Civil Liberties Act of 1988, acknowledging the grave personal injustice done to American citizens and resident aliens of Japanese ancestry.
