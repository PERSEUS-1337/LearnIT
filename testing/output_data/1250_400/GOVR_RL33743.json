    "content": "The 112th Congress used TPA authority to pass implementing bills for U.S. FTAs with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea in 2011. Other trade negotiations that may require TPA include the Doha Development Round, TPP, TTIP, and TISA. TPA grants the President fast track authority to negotiate trade agreements with limited Congressional input. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) grants the President fast track authority to negotiate trade agreements with limited Congressional input. TPA strikes a delicate balance between Congress's constitutional authority over trade policy and giving the President negotiating leverage. The expiration of TPA raises questions about its renewal and form, as trade negotiations have become more complex and partisan. The expiration of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) raises questions about its renewal and form, as trade negotiations have become more complex and partisan. TPA is the result of decades of debate and cooperation between Congress and the executive branch, with a focus on the constitutional powers granted to each branch and the need for cooperative flexibility in negotiating trade agreements. The evolution of TPA shows that the partnership between Congress and the President on trade policymaking can be strengthened or strained based on political and economic conditions. Congress has the authority to regulate foreign trade, while the President has exclusive authority to negotiate. Congress has authority over the regulation of foreign trade, while the President has exclusive authority to negotiate treaties and international agreements. Both legislative and executive branches play a role in developing and executing U.S. trade agreements. Congress historically set tariff rates on imported products, with tariffs being the main trade policy instrument and a source of federal revenue. The President's primary role in trade policy was to negotiate agreements using foreign affairs authority. In the 1930s, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act drastically changed U.S. trade policy by imposing high tariff rates during the Great Depression. This led to retaliatory tariffs from trade partners, causing severe trade restrictions and worsening the economic downturn. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of the 1930s set high tariff rates in response to the Great Depression, leading to retaliatory tariffs and severe trade restrictions. In contrast, the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 authorized the President to reduce tariffs through reciprocal trade agreements, aiming to lessen political pressure from special interests. The RTAA delegated trade agreements authority to the President to reduce tariffs within predefined ranges, aiming to lessen political pressure from special interests. The Smoot-Hawley tariffs now only apply to imports from Cuba and North Korea without MFN status. Congress renewed presidential trade agreements authority for tariff reductions 11 times until 1962. The Trade Expansion Act of 1962 granted the President authority for five years to negotiate tariff reductions and enter into agreements. This act also increased Congress's role in the negotiating process by requiring the President to submit each agreement for review. The GATT Kennedy Round (1963-1967) focused on tariff reduction in trade negotiations. The Trade Expansion Act of 1962 granted the President authority to negotiate tariff reductions and enter agreements. The GATT Kennedy Round focused on tariff reduction, with agreements in two areas related to nontariff barriers. Congress concluded that the President had exceeded his authority, leading to a resolution in 1966 instructing the Johnson Administration. The Trade Expansion Act of 1962 granted the President authority to negotiate tariff reductions and enter agreements. Congress passed a resolution in 1966 instructing the Johnson Administration against negotiating \"nontariff commitments.\" Concern over presidential encroachment on legislative authority led to the creation of fast track authority for trade agreements. The Nixon Administration sought new authority to negotiate. The Trade Expansion Act of 1962 granted the President authority to negotiate tariff reductions and enter agreements. Congress debated renewing this authority for seven years before granting new authority in the Trade Act of 1974. This act allowed the President to enter into trade agreements that reduced tariffs, with Congress required to pass implementing legislation for agreements requiring changes beyond tariff modifications. Some in Congress argued that subjecting implementing legislation to ordinary debate and amendment procedures would defeat the purpose of delegating trade agreement authority to the President. Some in Congress argued that subjecting implementing legislation to ordinary debate and amendment procedures would defeat the purpose of delegating trade agreement authority to the President. U.S. trading partners would be reluctant to negotiate agreements subject to unlimited congressional debate and amendment. Congress agreed that each chamber would suspend its ordinary legislative process. The Trade Act of 1974 established fast track trade negotiating authority, allowing expedited treatment for trade agreements in Congress. This included limited time for committees to consider implementing bills, time-limited debate on the floor with no amendments, and consultation requirements for the executive branch. Additionally, 10 Members of Congress were accredited as advisers to the U.S. delegation of negotiators. The Trade Act of 1974 expanded fast track trade negotiating authority by accrediting 10 Members of Congress as advisers to the U.S. delegation of negotiators. This authority led to the conclusion of the Tokyo Round of the GATT in 1979, resulting in agreements on various trade issues. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 was the first implementing bill passed under this authority, with expedited legislative procedures that have remained unchanged since 1974. These provisions, found in Sections 151-154 of the Trade Act of 1974, have been revised over the years but do not have sunset provisions. Expedited legislative procedures under the Trade Act of 1974 have not changed since 1974. These provisions, located in Sections 151-154, do not have sunset provisions but are subject to time limits. The initial grant of \"fast track trade negotiating authority\" and tariff modification authority lasted until 1980, with a residual presidential authority extended to 1982. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 extended presidential authority to enter into agreements on nontariff barriers until 1988. This act also added trade agreements authority for bilateral free trade agreements. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 extended presidential authority to enter into agreements on nontariff barriers until January 2, 1988. This act added trade agreements authority for bilateral free trade agreements, allowing for negotiation and implementation of agreements that reduced or eliminated tariffs and addressed nontariff barriers. Congress considered the U.S.-Israel and U.S.-Canada FTAs during this time. The legislation waived the 90-day notification requirement for the U.S.-Israel FTA but required the President to notify Congress 60 days prior to entering negotiations with other countries. Agreements leading to tariff modifications beyond a certain threshold required congressional approval through implementing legislation. The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act (OTCA) extended the President's authority to enter into trade agreements before June 1, 1993. It allowed for expedited procedures for agreements entered into before June 1, 1991, and required congressional approval for agreements leading to significant tariff modifications. Congress could withhold fast track consideration by passing a resolution of disapproval if the U.S. Trade Representative failed to consult. The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act (OTCA) extended the President's authority to enter into trade agreements before June 1, 1993. Congress could withhold fast track consideration by passing a resolution of disapproval if the U.S. Trade Representative failed to consult adequately. The authority was extended until April 16, 1994, solely for the Uruguay Round, with strong congressional support in both the House and the Senate. After the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act extended the President's trade agreement authority until April 16, 1994 for the Uruguay Round, Congress did not approve new authority until the Trade Act of 2002. Despite support from both Republican leadership and the Clinton Administration, disagreements led to the failure to renew fast track authority in 1998. In September 1998, the House failed to pass fast track authority legislation (180-243). Reasons for this included disagreements between Republican leadership and the Clinton Administration on negotiating objectives for labor and environmental issues. The WTO's failure to launch new negotiations in 1999 also contributed to the lack of urgency for renewing trade agreements authority. President George W. Bush later requested a renewal of fast track authority, which was renamed as \"trade promotion authority (TPA)\" in the Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002. In 2001, President George W. Bush requested a renewal of fast track authority, which was renamed as \"trade promotion authority (TPA)\" in the Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002. The renewed authority included new language for labor and environmental provisions, but did not mandate minimal enforceable labor standards in trade agreements, leading to opposition from labor groups and some Members of Congress. The act also established the Congressional Oversight Group (COG) for congressional consultation. The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002 established the Congressional Oversight Group (COG) for congressional consultation. The legislation passed in the House and Senate, allowing for the approval of implementing legislation for various Free Trade Agreement countries. The proposed Bipartisan Congressional Trade Promotion Authority (BCTPA) was introduced in 2015 by Senators Hatch and Wyden and Representative Ryan. TPA, Congress approved implementing legislation for FTA Free Trade Agreement countries. The proposed BCTPA was introduced in 2015 by Senators Hatch and Wyden and Representative Ryan. TPA-2015 contains updated negotiating objectives on trade in goods, services, agriculture, and intellectual property rights. TPA-2015, a substitute amendment to H.R. 1314, was passed on May 22 by a vote of 62-37. It includes updated negotiating objectives on trade in goods, services, agriculture, intellectual property rights, regulatory practices, and digital trade. The legislation also addresses currency manipulation, localization, state-owned enterprises, and human rights. TPA-2015 may be used for ongoing negotiations such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP), and Trade in Services Agreement (TISA). TPA-2015 can be used for various trade negotiations, including TPP, T-TIP, TISA, EGA, and Doha Round agreements. Congress aims to set trade policy priorities, ensure adherence to objectives, and define terms and conditions through TPA/fast track authority. Congress has four major goals in supporting trade negotiations: defining trade policy priorities, ensuring adherence to objectives, defining terms and conditions for trade agreements, and reaffirming Congress's constitutional authority over trade. The process for implementing trade agreements changed when negotiations expanded to include nontariff barriers. The process for implementing trade agreements changed when negotiations expanded to include nontariff barriers. Congress tightened its control over trade agreements negotiation and implementation by establishing \"fast track trade negotiating authority\" under the Trade Act of 1974. This authority requires passage of implementing legislation for NTB agreements to enter into force for the United States. The expedited procedures outlined in Section 151 of the Trade Act of 1974 have been used for nearly all reciprocal trade agreements. Under Section 2103 of the Trade Act of 2002, Congress makes these expedited procedures available only for qualifying trade implementing bills. Under the Trade Act of 2002, Congress established expedited procedures for qualifying trade implementing bills. These procedures require the trade agreement to meet negotiating objectives and for the President to fulfill notification and consultation requirements. The implementing bill must only contain provisions necessary to implement the agreement, with Congress retaining the right to change the rules at any time. This reflects Congress's priority in controlling the approval and implementation of trade agreements. Congress has established expedited procedures for trade implementing bills under the Trade Act of 2002, giving priority to controlling the approval and implementation of trade agreements. The President can proclaim an agreement into force after notifying Congress and meeting specific requirements outlined in Section 2105 of the Act. The Trade Act of 2002 outlines specific requirements for the President to notify Congress and implement trade agreements, including providing advance notice, listing required changes to U.S. law, transmitting the final legal text of the agreement, and enacting the implementing bill into law. Congress has established expedited procedures for trade implementing bills to prioritize approval and implementation of trade agreements. The Trade Act of 2002 outlines requirements for implementing trade agreements, including notifying Congress, making necessary changes to U.S. law, and enacting the implementing bill. Congress has established expedited procedures for trade bills, requiring mandatory introduction, limited debate, and no amendments. Congress exercises its trade policy role through Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation, which includes defining trade negotiation objectives. These objectives are important for U.S. foreign economic and security policy, as they generate benefits for the United States and the global economy. Congress defines the objectives for the President to pursue in trade negotiations, which are definitive statements of U.S. trade policy that the Administration is expected to honor. Trade negotiating objectives are central to the congressional debate on TPA. Trade negotiating objectives are crucial for U.S. trade policy and are defined by Congress in three categories: overall objectives, principal objectives, and other priorities. These objectives guide trade negotiations by setting broad and specific goals such as reducing trade barriers, protecting intellectual property rights, and enforcing environmental and labor laws. Congress expects the Administration to honor these objectives for expedited consideration of trade agreement implementing legislation. Trade negotiating objectives are crucial for U.S. trade policy, guiding negotiations by setting goals like reducing trade barriers, protecting intellectual property rights, and enforcing environmental and labor laws. The language defining these objectives has been contested in the past, reflecting their importance as a template for future trade agreements. Labor provisions are emphasized in all objectives, illustrating their significance in trade negotiations. The language of trade negotiating objectives can be contentious and controversial, especially regarding labor provisions. The decision not to include enforceable standards in Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) led to debates over TPA and subsequent trade agreements. The structure of trade agreements mirrors TPA objectives, and disputes over FTAs based on those objectives have survived challenges. Renewing TPA/fast track authority is a critical trade vote in Congress. The President must consult regularly with Congress, including the Congressional Advisory Groups (CAG). The renewal of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) is a critical trade vote in Congress. The President must consult regularly with Congress, including the Congressional Advisory Groups (CAG), before negotiations begin. Consultation and notification requirements have been revised in each renewal of authority. The Trade Promotion Authority requires the President to consult with Congress and relevant committees before negotiations begin. Specific notifications and consultations are also required before agreements are signed, including notifying Congress 90 days prior to entering into an agreement and consulting on the nature and potential effects of the agreement. Additionally, notifications to revenue committees are required 180 days prior to any potential changes to U.S. trade remedy laws. The Trade Promotion Authority mandates consultations with Congress and relevant committees before negotiations and agreements are signed. Specific notifications and consultations are required, including notifying revenue committees 180 days prior to any potential changes to U.S. trade remedy laws. The consultation process is crucial for Congress to influence trade policy and ensure oversight. The consultation process under Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) allows Congress to influence trade policy, but its effectiveness has been questioned. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that despite extensive consultations by the USTR, congressional staff felt they did not have enough time to provide input and that the process often felt more like briefings than consultations. Staff expressed concerns that the consultation process may need to be amended. Staff expressed concerns about the consultation process under Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), stating that meetings with USTR officials did not allow for sufficient input into negotiations and were more like briefings than consultations. There were also worries about last-minute changes to draft FTA texts and the need for greater congressional input. Congress adopted TPA procedures to prevent delays in trade implementing bills and protect fragile consensus between trade partners, but did not surrender its constitutional authority over trade matters. Trade agreements can be delayed in Congress with extended debate, but Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) procedures were designed to protect consensus between trade partners. Congress retains its constitutional authority over trade matters and has provisions in TPA to limit expedited procedures. Each renewal of TPA provides expedited procedures for a limited time, with the 2015 statute allowing them for agreements entered into before July 1, 2021. There is no deadline for submitting implementing legislation for agreements entered into before the authority expires. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) procedures allow for expedited legislative procedures for trade agreements entered into before July 1, 2021. There is no deadline for submitting implementing legislation for these agreements, as seen with past FTAs like Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. The TPA legislation requires the President to request an extension of authority, which can be granted unless a disapproval resolution is passed by either House of Congress. This process serves as a reminder to the executive branch that expedited procedures are a congressional prerogative. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) procedures allow for expedited legislative procedures for trade agreements. Resolutions must be reported out of the House Ways and Means or Senate Finance Committees. Congress can deny expedited procedures if dissatisfied with the President's trade agreement negotiations. The President must fulfill consultation and reporting obligations to preserve the congressional role in trade agreements. Failure to meet these requirements may result in the implementing bill not being eligible under TPA rules. The CCR procedure in TPA-2015 allows either chamber to withdraw TPA procedures for failure to notify or consult with Congress on a trade agreement. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) procedures allow for expedited legislative procedures for trade agreements. Congress can deny expedited procedures if dissatisfied with the President's trade agreement negotiations. The CCR procedure in TPA-2015 allows either chamber to withdraw TPA procedures for failure to notify or consult with Congress on a trade agreement. The Trade Act of 1974 reserves Congress's right to withdraw or override expedited procedures for trade implementing bills. Cooperation and partnership between the legislative and executive branches are crucial for the long-term success of TPA. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) allows for expedited legislative procedures for trade agreements, with Congress reserving the right to withdraw or override these procedures. Cooperation between the legislative and executive branches is crucial for TPA's success, with a lack of bipartisan agreement noted since 1993. Additionally, certain procedures during the consideration of trade agreement implementing bills have been integrated into the congressional approval process. Congress has integrated certain procedures into the process of approving trade agreements, including reviewing the agreement before introducing the implementing bill, holding hearings, informal markup sessions, and mock conferences to test congressional response. The White House sent an informal draft of the trade agreement to Congress for review and feedback. Committee members can raise concerns, offer amendments, and signal changes they would like to see in the final implementing bill. The mock conference helps reconcile differences in markups and clarify key points without altering the basic agreement. The Administration has discretion in accepting suggested changes from Congress. The Administration has discretion in accepting suggested changes from Congress regarding trade agreements. Congress can make key points in the final implementing bill, but the Administration may decline certain changes. Side agreements or side letters can be added to trade agreements to address additional obligations, such as environment and labor agreements. Side agreements and side letters can be added to trade agreements to address additional obligations, such as environment and labor agreements. Side agreements involve additional obligations accepted by all parties after the original trade agreement is signed, while side letters act as clarifying devices for specific issues. Both require official signatures of all negotiating parties to be considered in force, although their enforceability is untested. Some Members of Congress have relied on informal commitments from the executive branch to address issues raised in mock markups, often related to special interests. The Bush Administration made accommodations to secure congressional support for the CAFTA-DR implementing bill. TPA expired on July 1, 2007, and there have been criticisms of delays in requesting its renewal. President Obama requested TPA renewal in 2013 and reiterated the request in his 2015 State of the Union address. The decision to initiate legislative action on TPA may be influenced by Congress's desire to revamp certain aspects. Congress renewed TPA, with some Members criticizing President Obama for delays in the request. The decision to act on TPA may be influenced by the desire to update the 2002 law. TPA helps build consensus on trade policy and signals congressional support for FTAs. The Senate and the House do not need TPA for expedited legislative procedures. TPA helps build consensus on trade policy, signals support for FTAs, and ensures Congress's role in trade policy. The timing of TPA renewal is debated, with some suggesting waiting until negotiations are near completion, while others argue for early action to allow Congress input on negotiation objectives. Congress should consider these aspects when deciding on TPA renewal. The debate over the timing of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) renewal continues, with some advocating for early action to allow Congress input on negotiation objectives. The scope of U.S. trade negotiating objectives has evolved with the changing structure of trade, including new issues like state-owned enterprises, regulatory cooperation, and trade effects on small- and medium-sized businesses. Congress should consider these new aspects when deciding on TPA renewal. The treatment of negotiating objectives in trade agreements is a key issue for TPA renewal, with Democrats dissatisfied with the outcome in the Trade Act of 2002. The \"May 10th Agreement\" in 2007 incorporated changes in labor, environment, and intellectual property rights commitments for trade agreements with Peru, Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. The \"May 10th Agreement\" in 2007 included significant changes in labor, environment, and intellectual property rights commitments for trade agreements with Peru, Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. Some Democrats and Republicans have differing views on incorporating these commitments into future trade agreements. Some Members of Congress have concerns with the trade negotiation consultation process under TPA-2015, especially regarding access to draft texts of agreements. There is a need to define procedures for Congress to influence FTAs early in the negotiation process. Staff and Members argue they have less access to draft text compared to business and NGOs representatives. Congress may seek to clarify negotiation and consultation procedures in the future. Some Members of Congress are concerned about the lack of access to draft texts of trade agreements during negotiations. They argue that they have less access compared to business and NGOs representatives. Congress may seek to clarify negotiation and consultation procedures in the future. There is bipartisan interest in enforcing commitments of trade partners defined in agreements, with separate legislative efforts and the creation of the Interagency Trade Enforcement Center by President Obama. Congress may also consider language on trade agreement enforcement in TPA. The use of TPA expedited procedures in the 112th Congress raised technical issues that may need reevaluation. President Obama has established the Interagency Trade Enforcement Center, and Congress may need to address trade agreement enforcement in TPA. The use of TPA expedited procedures in the 112th Congress raised technical issues that may require reevaluation, such as the interpretation of \"necessary or appropriate\" provisions in implementing legislation. Some Members may want to define this language more precisely, while others argue for flexibility in applying the standard. Some Members may want to define the \"necessary or appropriate\" language more precisely in TPA, while others argue for flexibility. Delays in introducing FTA implementing bills raise the question of time limitations. Changes in FTA text after negotiations may have violated TPA, prompting consideration for addressing this issue in TPA renewal. The current TPA authorization legislation is being considered by Congress, with options for renewal including renewing and revising TPA authority to grant the President new authority with revisions to its structure. The real power of fast track (TPA) lies in the political compact between Congress and the President, with bipartisan understanding needed to pass trade legislation. Options for renewing the current TPA authorization legislation include renewing and revising TPA authority, extending TPA for specific agreements like the TPP, granting permanent TPA authority, or not renewing TPA which could delay future trade agreements. In the 114th Congress, legislation was signed to renew TPA, allowing for fast track procedures for trade negotiations. Some Members oppose TPA due to concerns about giving up congressional authority. The legislation reauthorizes TPA for four years with a possible three-year extension, reflecting previous TPA structures with some changes. In the 114th Congress, legislation was signed to renew TPA, reauthorizing it for four years with a possible three-year extension. The legislation includes new objectives reflecting current trade policy issues such as digital trade and cross-border data flows. The legislation renewed TPA for four years with a possible three-year extension, including new objectives on digital trade, cross-border data flows, currency, and human rights as principal trade negotiating objectives. Congressional committees hold mock markups before formal TPA expedited procedures. The expedited legislative procedures for passage of trade implementing bills under TPA involve mock markups by Congressional committees before the final legal draft text of the trade agreement and implementing bill are sent to Congress for mandatory introduction and referral to relevant committees. The draft bill reflecting amendments adopted in mock markups is sent to Congress for mandatory introduction. Identical bills are introduced in both houses and referred to relevant committees. Committees have 45 days to report the bill or it is automatically discharged. The Senate Finance Committee must act on the House bill for revenue bills subject to TPA procedures. After the bill is reported, debate is limited to 20 hours with no amendments allowed. After the implementing bill is reported or discharged, any Member may offer a non-debatable motion to consider it. Debate is limited to 20 hours evenly divided between those for and against. The measure cannot be amended, and a motion or unanimous-consent request to suspend this restriction is not in order. If the chamber has not completed floor action by the 15th day after the bill is reported or discharged, any Member may bring it to a vote. A bill passes by simple majority under the statute. Whichever House acts second considers and debates its own bill, but takes its final vote on the bill received from the other House. After the implementing bill is signed, under its terms, the agreement enters into force for the United States when the President implements it by proclamation. After the implementing bill is signed, the agreement enters into force for the United States when the President implements it by proclamation, typically after ensuring partner countries have met all obligations under the trade agreement."
