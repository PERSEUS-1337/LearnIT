    "content": "The Bush tax cuts, enacted in 2001 and 2003, were set to expire at the end of 2010. This included lower rates for long-term capital gains and dividends. President Obama proposed to retain lower rates for lower- and middle-income taxpayers, but tax dividends and capital gains at 20% for higher-income individuals. The tax rates were extended through 2012 by the Tax Relief Act of 2010. The final resolution in 2013 was to tax capital gains for higher-income individuals at a higher rate. The Tax Relief Act of 2010 extended tax rates for higher-income individuals with incomes of $200,000 or more through 2012. In 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act increased capital gains taxes for higher-income individuals at incomes of $480,050 for married couples and $453,350 for singles in 2018. The potential revenue gain from increasing capital gains taxes is influenced by behavioral responses assumed by the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Department of the Treasury. Obama's Administration estimated that allowing the Bush tax cuts for capital gains to expire would have raised $16 billion in revenue in FY2019. The potential revenue gain from allowing the Bush tax cuts for capital gains to expire in FY2019 was estimated at $16 billion by Obama's Administration. Some proponents of increasing taxes on capital gains have suggested applying mark-to-market rules to tax capital gains as accrued to eliminate behavioral responses and increase revenue. The potential revenue gain from allowing the Bush tax cuts for capital gains to expire in FY2019 was estimated at $16 billion by Obama's Administration. Assets that are less easily valued could be subject to look-back treatment, increasing taxes to achieve the same after-tax earnings as on an accrual basis. Realizations responses in revenue projections were publicly discussed in the late 1980s, with implications for revenue effects. The analysis suggests that revenue gains from allowing lower capital gains tax rates to expire may be understated. The analysis suggests that the Obama Administration's projections and those of the JCT may understate revenue gains from allowing lower capital gains tax rates to expire. Concerns arise from taxpayers delaying realizations to avoid taxes, potentially leading to a loss in revenue. Elasticities, which measure the response of realizations to tax changes, are expected to be negative. The elasticity of realizations in response to tax changes is crucial for understanding revenue gains or losses from capital gains tax adjustments. A negative elasticity indicates that realizations decrease as taxes increase. The magnitude of the elasticity determines the impact on revenue: if less than one, a tax increase gains revenue; if greater than one, revenue is lost. The ratio of revenue gain projected to the static gain is determined by one minus the elasticity. The elasticity of realizations in response to tax changes is crucial for understanding revenue gains or losses from capital gains tax adjustments. Three types of elasticities are relevant: permanent, short-run, and transitory. The ratio of revenue gain projected to the static gain is determined by one minus the elasticity. The short-term response to a temporary tax increase or decrease is influenced by various factors such as shifting realizations to take advantage of lower tax rates. This short-term effect, although challenging to estimate, can impact responses to tax changes. The discussion on realizations elasticity, particularly in the context of capital gains tax cuts, highlights the potential for increased realizations in the first year or two. In the context of a capital gains tax cut, taxpayers may have a large stock of accrued gains that could lead to increased realizations in the short term. However, recent increases in realizations or unanticipated tax changes may impact the magnitude of this response. It is important to note that short-term responses to tax cuts may not necessarily apply to tax increases that are not pre-announced. In 1990, there is no reason to expect short-run responses to apply to a tax increase that is not pre-announced. A cut in taxes may lead to short-term realizations, but an increase should not cause a similar contraction. The stock of gains that have not been realized due to taxes will simply remain unrealized, with no effect on realizations. Transitory responses occur due to temporary changes in tax rates, with examples in 1986 and 2012. Higher-income taxpayers with significant fluctuations in income and taxes may experience transitory responses even in years when the law does not change. In the period prior to 1987, capital gains were subject to graduated rates, causing transitory responses among individuals even when the law did not change. Statistical estimates of realizations responses are based on various functional forms, with elasticities rising proportionally with the tax rate. Capital gains realizations elasticities are expected to be negative, but are reported in absolute value without the minus sign. The 22% tax rate is crucial for considering tax changes, with elasticities reflecting that rate. Capital gains realizations elasticities are expected to be negative but are reported in absolute value. The revenue-maximizing tax rate is where the most capital gains tax revenue is realized. Current law includes rates of 0%, 15%, and 20%, along with a 3.8% net investment income tax for high-income taxpayers. Estimates show an overall marginal tax rate of around 21% for long-term capital gains. The 2010 health care law imposed a 3.8% net investment income tax on high-income taxpayers. The Congressional Budget Office estimates a 21.2% marginal tax rate for long-term capital gains, while the Department of the Treasury estimates a similar rate of 21.3%. In 1990, the George H. W. Bush Administration proposed to increase the top rate on capital gains from 20% to 28%. Revenue-estimating agencies began to consider behavioral responses and tax variables in forecasting capital gains revenues. In 1990, revenue-estimating agencies began investigating behavioral responses and tax variables for forecasting capital gains revenues. Different elasticities were used, ranging from 0.76 to 0.98, based on various data sources including aggregate time series and micro-data studies. Estimates of the realizations response varied significantly, from 0.3 to almost 4. Estimates of the realizations response varied dramatically, ranging from 0.3 to almost 4. An elasticity of 0.3 would imply a revenue gain of 70% with a small tax rate increase, while an elasticity of 4 would result in a loss three times the projected revenue. The range of estimated responses raised concerns about the reliability of estimation methods, with individual taxpayer data showing a particularly broad range. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) considered results from aggregate time series more reliable and used this methodology to estimate their own elasticity. The range of estimated realizations response varied from 0.55 to 3.8, indicating serious issues with estimation methods. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) favored time series results for more reliable estimates, while the Treasury did not specify their methodology. Using individual taxpayer data for estimation is preferred due to potential biases from aggregation and difficulty in controlling for changing factors over time. Distinguishing between permanent and transitory responses is crucial, especially for high-income individuals who may time realizations to coincide with low tax rates. Individual data is preferred for estimation due to biases from aggregation and difficulty in controlling changing factors over time. Distinguishing between permanent and transitory responses is crucial, especially for high-income individuals who may time realizations to coincide with low tax rates. Panel data studies reported smaller elasticities, but still above one in some cases, using the average of current, previous, and future tax rates as a permanent rate. This method produced more reliable estimates compared to simple cross-section results. The panel studies examined individual tax rates over several years, using the average of current, previous, and future tax rates as a permanent rate. These studies reported smaller elasticities, but some were still above one. The panel results influenced the Treasury to choose a larger elasticity, despite attempts to address transitory effects. However, the last panel study also showed a very large elasticity. Panel studies offered some control over transitory effects, but were limited to a few years.

However, the last panel study also showed a very large elasticity. Panel studies offered some control over transitory effects, but were limited to a few years. Lower income or higher income can continue for several years, with panel estimates possibly reflecting some transitory response elements. Ultimately, proposed tax cuts were not enacted at that time. Researchers focused on producing more precise and reliable estimates, especially after a sharp spike in realizations in 1986. In 1986, there was a significant increase in realizations of capital gains, raising concerns about transitory responses. Subsequent econometric studies from 1990 onwards examined this phenomenon, with estimates provided by CBO, JCT, and Treasury. CBO's estimates were not for revenue purposes but part of a broader statistical study. Several studies on realizations response since 1990 are reported in Table 1, including estimates by CBO, JCT, and Treasury. The coefficient in the second column of the table determines the elasticity. Gravelle's study highlighted a limit to the realizations response, noting that realizations cannot exceed accruals. Gravelle's study found a limit to the realizations response, with a maximum elasticity of 0.5. This implies that without taxes and transaction costs, individuals would sell every asset every year, but in reality, the elasticity is likely to be lower due to various factors like satisfaction with investments and reluctance to sell certain assets. The study conducted in 1991, covering data from 1954 to 1989, estimated a realizations to accruals level of 46% and a tax rate of 18.4%. Recent evidence from 1989-2013 shows a similar ratio of 48% and a tax rate of 17.3%, supporting the limits to realizations elasticities found in the initial Gravelle study. The Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen panel study suggests that if all taxes and costs were eliminated, realizations could increase to 4.25 times their current value, compared to the level of accruals suggesting they could only double. The Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen panel study found that if all taxes and costs were eliminated, realizations could increase to 4.25 times their current value, while the level of accruals suggests they could only double. The study also corrected the elasticity for the most recent panel study of the 1980s, indicating an elasticity of 3.2, similar to cross-section results. The Burman and Randolph study used state tax rates to estimate the permanent elasticity, finding a very small elasticity and a large transitory elasticity. The study used state tax rates to estimate the permanent elasticity, finding a small and statistically insignificant response. Auerbach and Siegel replicated the approach with similar results. Subsequent studies incorporated state tax rates, with Auten and Joulfaian and Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen having the highest elasticities. Their longer panel studies likely influenced the results. The Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen study added state tax rates and had a longer panel, potentially affecting time series effects. Their estimates may still reflect transitory responses, not suitable for measuring permanent response. Sensitivity analysis produced a wide range of estimates, with coefficients ranging from 1.8 to 8.0. Other studies also used aggregate time series data, with varying results. The Gillingham and Greenlees study, along with other time series studies, added more years of data. Time series data with more years added lead to lower elasticities. The two state studies by Bogart and Gentry, and Bakija and Gentry, used aggregate data grouped by state and showed results slightly above the upper limit estimated by Gravelle. The state studies by Bogart and Gentry, and Bakija and Gentry, used aggregate data grouped by state and showed results slightly above the upper limit estimated by Gravelle. The elasticities in Table 1 are closer together and lower than those in the studies of the 1980s. JCT and Treasury estimates appear high and likely understate the revenue to be gained from tax changes. The Treasury and JCT estimates for raising the tax rate on capital gains by five percentage points in 2019 appear high and likely understate the potential revenue gain. Table 2 compares these estimates based on CBO projections, showing a reduction in revenue gain ranging from 26% to 97%. The revenue gain for the tax rate increase ranges from $31.4 billion to $180 billion. The revenue gain for a five-percentage-point tax rate increase on capital gains ranges from $31.4 billion to $180 billion. Adopting measures like accrual-based taxation with a look-back method could increase revenues further by taxing unrealized gains, potentially collecting $222 billion in a steady state. The Auten and Joulfaian panel study is considered reliable despite potential transitory elasticity effects. The Auten and Joulfaian panel study is reliable but may overstate the permanent elasticity of taxing unrealized gains. The Dowd, McClellan, and Muthitacharoen study produced the largest elasticity estimates, indicating fragility in the results. Time series results from Eichner and Sinai suggest a lower elasticity below 0.5, aligning with Gravelle's limit calculations. The Eichner and Sinai time series results suggest a lower elasticity below 0.5, indicating potential revenue gains from increasing the tax rate by five percentage points. Gravelle's limit calculations also support this finding, suggesting that revenue gains may be underestimated. The JCT's projections may likely understate revenue gains from increasing capital gains tax rates, with potential gains three times larger than projected. The JCT's projections may underestimate revenue gains from increasing capital gains tax rates, as indicated by Gravelle's upper limit calculations. The elasticity of realizations with respect to taxes can be estimated using a semi-log function, showing potential gains three times larger than projected. The elasticity of realizations with respect to taxes can be estimated using a semi-log function, showing potential gains three times larger than projected. The revenue maximizing tax rate is where (1-bt) equals zero, equal to 1/b. If the coefficient of b is two, the revenue maximizing tax rate is 50%, and if b equals 5, the revenue maximizing tax rate is 20%. The revenue maximizing tax rate can be calculated by dividing new revenues by old revenues. The rate is where (1-bt) equals zero, which is equal to 1/b. For example, if b is 2, the rate is 50%, and if b is 5, the rate is 20%. The look-back method adjusts basis to achieve the same net on a sale as accrual taxation. Calculations involve variables like growth rate, holding period, sales price, basis, tax rate, and new basis. Elasticities in studies of the 1980s are reported in Table B-1.

Elasticities in studies of the 1980s are reported in Table B-1, with challenges faced in statistical studies relating capital gains realizations to tax rates. Studies comparing capital gains realizations to tax rates face challenges, with debates over using aggregate time series or individual taxpayer data. Aggregate results range from 0.3 to 0.9, while individual data estimates vary from 0.55 to almost 4. Using individual data is preferred due to loss of information with aggregate data and difficulty in controlling for all changes over time affecting realizations. Using individual data is preferred over aggregate data for studying capital gains realizations and tax rates due to the loss of information and biases associated with aggregate data. Challenges include difficulties in controlling for changes over time that can affect realizations, such as transaction costs and disconnects between asset prices and accruals. The use of effective capital gains tax rate as an explanatory variable is problematic as it is endogenous and influenced by realizations themselves. Various techniques can be employed to address these econometric issues. The endogeneity of the effective capital gains tax rate poses a serious econometric problem, especially in individual cross-section data. Various techniques like using first dollar tax rate or instrumental variables can be used to address this issue. In contrast, aggregate time series data is less affected by endogeneity as the major source of variation is changes in the law. Timing realizations to coincide with periods of low tax rates is a common strategy, particularly for high-income individuals. Studies since the 1980s have focused on the issue of distinguishing between permanent and transitory responses in individual data due to fluctuations in income and tax rates over time. Attempts to address this problem with panel studies have been made, but the transitory effect may not be fully corrected. Slemrod and Shobe (1990) used a six-year small panel to replicate the issue. Since the 1980s, studies have focused on differentiating between permanent and transitory responses in individual data regarding income and tax rate fluctuations. Slemrod and Shobe (1990) used a six-year small panel to replicate previous studies, finding large elasticities exceeding 1 and 5 in some cases. Their results suggest potential issues with short panels and significant variability in results over time periods. Studies in the 1980s showed varying results on the relationship between income and tax rates. Slemrod and Shobe's regression analysis yielded statistically insignificant results, suggesting transitory effects. Gillingham and Greenlees extended the analysis to 1989, making changes to the methodology used by CBO. Their use of instrumental variables increased the coefficient and elasticity in the study. The authors made three changes to the standard regression analysis. They used instrumental variables techniques with taxes on predicted gains and maximum tax rate as instruments, which increased the coefficient and elasticity. Differencing the data also produced higher elasticities, but they were not statistically significant. Extending the time period through 1989 showed varying estimates. The authors extended the time period through 1989, finding varying estimates when excluding 1986. Using predicted gains rate or maximum rate as instruments raised concerns due to changes in the law over time. The study concluded that micro-data approaches are superior. The authors found issues with using the maximum rate as an instrument for time-series regression due to changes in the law over time. They reported a coefficient of 3.4 in Table 1. Burman and Randolph conducted an innovative study separating permanent and transitory effects using state tax rates from 1979-1983. The authors included the first dollar current tax rate in their instruments to account for transitory elements in tax rates. Permanent rates varied across taxpayers in different states due to state tax rates. An elasticity of 0.18 at an 18% tax rate and 0.22 at a 22% tax rate was estimated, with a transitory elasticity of 6.45. Subsequent studies also used state tax rates to analyze permanent responses. The study by Bogart and Gentry (1995) analyzed state tax rates from 1979 to 1990, reporting an elasticity of 0.65. Auerbach and Siegel (2000) replicated the results using data from 1985 to 1994, finding an elasticity of 0.33 at the mean tax rate. They also reported a transitory elasticity of 4.9. Based on evidence from various sources, the tax rate is estimated to be around 25%. The coefficient suggests an elasticity of 0.25 at a 22% rate, similar to previous findings. Auerbach and Siegel also found a higher permanent elasticity of 1.75 compared to 0.33, possibly due to the inclusion of additional instruments in their analysis. They also conducted separate regressions for wealthy and sophisticated taxpayers. The coefficient reported in Table 1 is 1.126, indicating a larger elasticity for the tax rate. Auerbach and Siegel conducted separate regressions for wealthy and sophisticated taxpayers, finding essentially no response for these groups. Eichner and Sinai's study extended time series analysis through 1997, with a coefficient of 2.28 when excluding 1986. Excluding both 1986 and 1997 resulted in a coefficient of 2.18. Different specifications led to estimates ranging from 3.8 to 5.13 for the elasticity of the tax rate. The elasticity of the tax rate was estimated at 0.48 using an instrumental variables method. Different specifications led to elasticities ranging from 0.83 to 1.46, but most were not statistically significant. The coefficient of 2.28 is reported in Table 1, reflecting more stable results compared to other approaches. Auten and Joulfaian (2004) used a longer micro-data panel to estimate permanent effects. The 2.28 coefficient reported in Table 1 reflects stable results compared to other approaches. Auten and Joulfaian (2004) used a longer micro-data panel to estimate permanent and transitory effects, finding an elasticity of 0.72 at a 20% tax rate and 0.79 at a 22% tax rate. Evans (2009) conducted a cross-section regression with elasticities typically between 2 and 5. The Evans study by Evans (2009) utilized a cross-section regression with elasticities ranging from 2 to 5, highlighting the limitations of cross-section studies in reflecting permanent realizations of elasticities. Bakija and Gentry (2014) conducted a study using a 50-year panel of state data to analyze changes in combined federal and state tax rates, controlling for state- and time-fixed effects. The curr_chunk discusses a 50-year panel of state data analyzing changes in combined federal and state tax rates, with state- and time-fixed effects controlled for. Various studies are referenced, including one using standard panel methods and another using Australian data from 1988 to 2015. The effects of changing specifications are tested, showing significant impacts on elasticities. The curr_chunk discusses an aggregate time series study with Australian data from 1988 to 2015, including controls for GDP, inflation, and the stock market index. It provides sensitivity analysis with different specifications and time subperiods. Citations to studies from the 1980s on capital gains taxation are also included.
