    "content": "The \"Voting Restoration Act\" is the short title of this Act, which aims to restore voting rights. Congress finds that the right to vote is guaranteed in the US Constitution for all citizens, with Congress having supervisory power over Federal elections. There is no uniform eligibility standard for participating in Federal elections, with different States having varying rules on ex-felon voting eligibility. Some States disenfranchise ex-offenders even after completing their sentences, making it difficult for them to regain their voting rights. In 13 States, ex-offenders face disenfranchisement even after completing their sentences. The process to regain voting rights is challenging, requiring a pardon or order from the Governor in 8 States, action from the parole or pardon board in 2 States, and a Presidential pardon for Federal offenders in 16 States. Approximately 3,900,000 Americans, or 2 percent of the adult population, are ineligible to vote due to felony convictions. The number of incarcerated individuals has increased, with a significant portion incarcerated for drug offenses. In recent years, the number of incarcerated individuals has grown exponentially, largely due to harsh drug policies. 1 in 4 prison inmates in 1998 were incarcerated for drug offenses, with drug offenders making up 58% of Federal prison inmates. Racially disparate sentencing laws have led to African-Americans being disproportionately convicted for drug charges. Additionally, minorities are disproportionately impacted by laws that strip felons of their right to vote. Minorities, particularly African-Americans, are disproportionately affected by laws that disenfranchise felons, with 13% of African-American men unable to vote in Federal elections due to felony convictions. Congress should address these disparities to ensure all Americans have the right to vote. The purpose of the Act is to restore voting rights to individuals who have completed their sentences for criminal offenses. The purpose of the Act is to protect the right to vote and register to vote in federal elections.
