    "content": "The federal parity law aims to ensure that coverage terms for mental health and substance use disorder services are no more restrictive than those for medical and surgical services. It consists of two laws: the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 and the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008. These laws establish coverage terms that must be equal between mental health services and medical services, including limits, treatment restrictions, financial requirements, and covered benefits. The health reform law of 2010 did not change these parity requirements. The ACA expanded federal parity law to include more plan types such as Qualified Health Plans, individual market plans, and certain Medicaid plans. It did not change the specific coverage terms required to be equal between mental health services and medical services. The ACA expanded federal parity law to include Qualified Health Plans, individual market plans, and certain Medicaid plans. It requires compliance with federal parity law for plans offered through Exchanges, small group, and individual markets. Medicaid can be offered through traditional state plans or benchmark coverage. QHPs will be provided through small group and individual markets, and may also be offered outside of an Exchange. Plans offered through the individual market must comply with federal parity law. Medicaid can be offered through traditional state plans or benchmark coverage, including Medicaid managed care plans. Benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans under Medicaid must partially comply with federal parity law for mental health and substance use disorder services. Fully insured and self-insured small plans are exempt from federal parity law compliance. Traditional fee-for-service Medicaid and Medicare are not subject to federal parity law. Federal parity law exempts fully insured and self-insured small plans from compliance. It also does not apply to traditional fee-for-service Medicaid or Medicare. The exemption extends to small employer group health plans and \"groups of one.\" The ACA did not amend the small employer exemption, so it remains in effect. Traditional fee-for-service Medicaid may not be subject to federal parity law due to certain coverage structures. Federal parity law does not apply to traditional fee-for-service Medicaid or Medicare. The law aims to mitigate disparities in coverage terms between mental health and substance use disorder services and medical and surgical services, but does not require the coverage of these services. The federal parity law aims to address coverage disparities between mental health/substance use disorder services and medical/surgical services. It does not mandate coverage for mental health/substance use disorder services but requires parity if covered. The ACA broadened coverage requirements, including mental health/substance use disorder services in health insurance marketplaces. The ACA requires health insurance marketplaces to offer Essential Health Benefits, including mental health and substance use disorder services. The Secretary of HHS defines the items and services included in the EHB, ensuring they are on par with benefits offered under a typical employer plan. The ACA mandates Essential Health Benefits (EHB) to include mental health and substance use disorder services. The Department of Labor conducted a survey to determine benefits covered under a typical employer plan, finding that most plans offer inpatient and outpatient treatment. Specific services for EHB will be determined through the rulemaking process, with the HHS Secretary having discretion to include additional services. The EHB rulemaking process allows for flexibility in determining specific services to be included, with states able to define EHB using benchmark health insurance plans. States can choose from four possible benchmark options to establish essential health benefits. The HHS proposed that states define Essential Health Benefits (EHB) using benchmark health insurance plans. States can choose from four options for the benchmark plan, with services comparable to a typical employer plan. The HHS Secretary requested the Institute of Medicine to study and make recommendations on determining the EHB, which was released in a report on October 7, 2011. The report does not recommend specific services for inclusion in the EHB. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) released a report on the determination of Essential Health Benefits (EHB) on October 7, 2011. The report does not recommend specific services for inclusion in the EHB. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) mandates coverage for mental health and substance use disorder services, among others, by requiring plans to offer either the EHB or the Essential Health Benefits Package (EHBP). The ACA requires certain types of plans to offer either the EHB or EHBP, including new plans in the individual and small group markets, Qualified Health Plans (QHPs), and Medicaid benchmark plans. The ACA mandates coverage for mental health and substance use disorder services by requiring plans to offer either the EHB or EHBP. This requirement applies to new plans in the individual and small group markets, QHPs, and Medicaid benchmark plans. Plans must comply with these requirements by January 1, 2014. Grandfathered and large group plans outside of the Exchanges are not obligated to offer the EHBP. The health reform law changes will likely impact access to mental health and substance use disorder services, with more plans required to cover these services on par with medical and surgical services. The ACA mandates coverage for mental health and substance use disorder services, requiring plans to offer these services on par with medical and surgical services. Plans not obligated to comply may voluntarily offer these services to be more competitive in the market."
