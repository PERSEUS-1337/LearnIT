VideoFlow is a model for conditional video generation that produces high-quality results without common artifacts like blurry predictions.

Unlike other models, VideoFlow directly optimizes the likelihood of training videos, allowing for evaluation based on likelihood values. Previous research focused on deterministic predictive models with architectural changes and different generation objectives. The research on deterministic predictive models has focused on architectural changes and different generation objectives. The next challenge is to address stochastic environments by building models that can reason over uncertain futures in real-world videos. These videos are inherently stochastic due to random events or unobserved factors, requiring models that can generate multiple potential futures. In stochastic environments, predictive models need to account for random events and unknown factors to generate multiple potential futures. Various methods like variational auto-encoders, generative adversarial networks, and autoregressive models have been used to address this challenge. Among these, variational autoencoders have been widely explored for optimizing future predictions. The text discusses the comparison between variational autoencoders and autoregressive models for video prediction. Autoregressive models generate videos pixel by pixel, while VAE models optimize the log-likelihood for better long-term predictions. The proposed VAE model shows faster sampling and higher quality predictions compared to autoregressive models. The proposed VAE model produces better predictions for longer horizons compared to autoregressive models. It exhibits faster sampling and directly optimizes log-likelihood for high-quality long-term predictions using a multi-scale architecture with stochastic variables. The proposed VAE model utilizes a generative flow for video, breaking up the latent space into separate variables per timestep and employing a multi-scale architecture for high-quality long-term predictions. The VAE model breaks up the latent space into separate variables per timestep and uses a multi-scale architecture for high-quality predictions. Invertible transformations are used, including Actnorm for per-channel scale and shift adjustments. The VAE model utilizes invertible transformations such as Actnorm for per-channel scale and shift adjustments. It also incorporates techniques like triangular, diagonal, and permutation matrices for Jacobian determinants, coupling, SoftPermute, and Squeeze operations to manipulate the input data for flow operations.

It also employs techniques such as triangular, diagonal, and permutation matrices for Jacobian determinants, coupling, SoftPermute, and Squeeze operations to manipulate input data for flow operations. The multi-scale architecture described enables flows at higher levels to operate on lower dimensions and larger scales, with a composition of flows at multiple levels to obtain latent variables for each frame of the video. Autoregressive factorization is used for the latent prior, specifying conditional priors for latent variables at previous timesteps and at the same level. The latent prior in the VAE model uses autoregressive factorization, specifying conditional priors for latent variables at previous timesteps and the same level. The architecture includes a factorized Gaussian density and an invertible multi-scale architecture for mapping video frames to latent variables. The log-likelihood objective consists of log Jacobian determinants and a latent dynamics model, which are jointly learned by maximizing the objective. The architecture includes an invertible multi-scale component for mapping video frames to latent variables. The latent dynamics model contributes to the objective by modeling temporal dependencies in the data. Comparison of realism in generated trajectories was done with SAVP-VAE and SV2P. The VideoFlow model was conditioned on the frame at t = 1 to generate trajectories at t = 2 and t = 3 for different shapes. The VideoFlow model uses 2-D convolutions with autoregressive priors to generate trajectories for different shapes at t = 2 and t = 3. This approach allows for synthesizing long sequences without introducing temporal artifacts. The generated videos can be viewed on a website, with blue borders representing conditioning frames and red borders representing generated frames. The model is used to model the Stochastic Movement Dataset. The VideoFlow model uses 2-D convolutions to generate trajectories for shapes in videos. The model predicts movement based on the position of the shape in the previous frame. By conditioning on the first frame, the model achieves a low bits-per-pixel of 0.04 on the holdout set. The generated videos consistently predict the movement of the shapes. VideoFlow model achieves a low bits-per-pixel of 0.04 on the holdout set by predicting movement based on the position of shapes in videos. It outperforms other models in generating plausible trajectories and uses the action-free BAIR robot pushing dataset for evaluation. VideoFlow outperforms baselines in generating realistic trajectories on the action-free BAIR robot pushing dataset. Models are trained to generate 10 target frames based on 3 input frames, with VideoFlow achieving a low bits-per-pixel of 1.87. Realism and diversity are measured using a 2AFC test and mean pairwise cosine distance in VGG perceptual space. VideoFlow outperforms SAVP-VAE and SV2P models in bits-per-pixel on the BAIR action-free dataset. The high values of bits-per-pixel in baselines are attributed to their optimization objective. VideoFlow generates realistic trajectories and is evaluated based on PSNR, SSIM, and VGG perceptual metrics. VideoFlow outperforms SAVP-VAE and SV2P models in bits-per-pixel on the BAIR action-free dataset. The models were trained using ten target frames but tested to generate 27 frames. The BAIR robot-pushing dataset is highly stochastic, and the number of plausible futures is high. Metrics from prior work are used to evaluate the model's accuracy in generating realistic videos. The study evaluates the VideoFlow model using metrics from prior work to generate realistic videos. Different metrics like PSNR, SSIM, and cosine similarity are used to compare generated videos to ground truth. Prior work focused on tuning pixel-level variance and removing noise to improve sample quality. The VideoFlow model can also remove pixel-level noise for higher quality videos at the expense of diversity. The VideoFlow model can improve sample quality by removing pixel-level noise, resulting in higher quality videos. Sampling videos at a lower temperature can achieve this, as shown in previous work. Different temperatures were tested, with the optimal temperature determined through validation set tuning. Low-temperature sampling was found to negatively impact performance in some cases. The study also explored the impact of hyperparameters on model performance, noting that disappearing arms were associated with better results. Our model with optimal temperature performs better or as well as the SAVP-VAE and SVG-LP models on VGG-based similarity metrics and SSIM. PSNR is a pixel-level metric, while VideoFlow models the conditional probability of frame distributions. Diversity and quality in generated samples were assessed by computing the mean distance in VGG perceptual space across different pairs of videos. VideoFlow outperforms diversity values reported in prior work while being competitive in realism. At T = 0.6, it has the highest fooling rate and is competent with state-of-the-art VAE models in diversity. Lower temperatures result in less random arm behavior and clearer background objects, leading to higher realism scores. Higher temperatures lead to more stochastic arm motion, higher diversity scores, and noisier background objects, resulting in a drop in realism. At higher temperatures, the arm exhibits more stochastic motion with noisier background objects, leading to a drop in realism. Interpolations between different shapes in the BAIR robot pushing dataset show cohesive arm motion and background object interpolation at different levels of latent representation. The study explores interpolations between shapes in the BAIR robot pushing dataset using multi-level latent representation. It shows that different levels interpolate background objects and arm motion. The size of shapes smoothly interpolates in the latent space. The colors of shapes are sampled from a uniform distribution during training, and all interpolated colors are from the training set. VideoFlow is used to assess the plausibility of temporally inconsistent frames in the future. The VideoFlow model detects plausibility of future frames and maintains temporal consistency. Generated frames remain in the image manifold even 100 frames into the future. Occlusions can cause background objects to become noisier and blurrier. The model has a bijection between latent state and frame, meaning it can forget objects if occluded for a few frames. Future work aims to incorporate longer memory in the model. In future work, the VideoFlow model aims to address the issue of forgetting objects when occluded by incorporating longer memory. This can be achieved by parameterizing N N \u03b8 () as a recurrent neural network in the autoregressive prior or using more memory-efficient backpropagation algorithms for invertible neural networks. The model is conditioned on 3 frames to detect the plausibility of a temporally inconsistent frame occurring in the immediate future. The likelihood of a frame occurring as the 4th time-step decreases as it is further in the future.

Results are competitive with VAE models, and future work includes incorporating memory for long-range dependencies. The VideoFlow model optimizes log-likelihood directly for faster synthesis, incorporating memory for long-range dependencies in future work. The dataset consists of 8-bit videos with added uniform noise to prevent infinite densities at datapoints, enabling optimization of log-likelihood. Temperature adjustments to latent gaussian priors of SV2P and SAVP-VAE show empirical results. The VideoFlow model optimizes log-likelihood directly for faster synthesis, incorporating memory for long-range dependencies in future work. Adjusting temperature in latent gaussian priors of SV2P and SAVP-VAE affects model performance, with lower temperatures leading to decreased VAE model performance due to reduced stochasticity in arm motion. Training progression correlates with video quality, as shown in Figure 11. Videos generated with different bits-per-pixel values demonstrate varying quality on the test set. The VideoFlow model optimizes log-likelihood directly for faster synthesis, incorporating memory for long-range dependencies in future work. Lowering bits-per-pixel improves the quality of generated videos, with training progression correlating with video quality. Hyperparameters such as learning rate schedules and latent loss multipliers were tuned for model optimization. The study compares different models using various hyperparameters and metrics. A weak correlation is observed between VGG perceptual metrics and bits-per-pixel. A smaller version of the VideoFlow model is evaluated and remains competitive with SVG-LP on VGG perceptual metrics."
