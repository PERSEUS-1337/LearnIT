    "content": "Many machine learning algorithms use vector embeddings or discrete codes to represent input data. Evaluating compositionality in these representations is important, but there is a lack of general-purpose tools for this in the machine learning literature. A procedure is described for evaluating compositionality by measuring how well a model can approximate the true representation-producing model. This procedure is used to explore the relationship between compositionality and learning dynamics, human judgments, representational similarity, and generalization. The procedure described evaluates compositionality in machine learning representations by measuring how well a model approximates the true representation-producing model. It explores the relationship between compositionality, learning dynamics, human judgments, representational similarity, and generalization. The text discusses the concept of compositionality in human-designed representation systems and machine learning approaches. It questions the emergence of compositionality in learning problems where it is not explicitly built in. Various studies aim to analyze if encoding schemes are compositional and how messages are built from smaller pieces. Existing solutions rely on manual or automated analysis of model outputs tailored to specific problem domains. The text introduces a need for a standardized, formal, and quantitative technique to evaluate compositional structure in learned representations. It focuses on an oracle setting where the structure of model inputs is known, aiming to assess if this structure is reflected in model outputs. The paper proposes a formal framework for measuring how well representations reflect the compositional analysis of inputs. The paper introduces a formal framework called TRE to evaluate the compositionality of representations in model outputs. It aims to measure how well a collection of representations reflects an oracle compositional analysis of model inputs by optimizing over primitive meaning representations to find an explicitly compositional model. The paper introduces TRE, a formal framework to assess the compositionality of representations in model outputs. It includes a survey of applications, experiments, and analyses to explore the relationship between compositionality and learning. Key questions addressed include the evolution of compositionality during learning, tracking human judgments, constraints on distances between representations, and the necessity of compositional representations for generalization. Discussions on possible applications and generalizations of TRE-based analysis are also included. The paper discusses how compositionality constrains distances between representations and the necessity of compositional representations for generalization. It also explores the evolution of compositionality during learning and the possible applications of TRE-based analysis. The paper explores the emergence of compositionality in models without explicit composition operations. Existing proposals from linguistics and philosophy evaluate compositionality in formal and natural languages, but applying these techniques to non-string-valued representation spaces is challenging. Machine learning research has addressed this gap through manual analyses of representation spaces, providing insights into their organization. Machine learning research has responded to the absence of a procedure for answering questions about compositionality by using ad-hoc manual analyses and task-specific evaluations. Our work aims to provide a standard and scalable alternative to these evaluations, examining how surrogate measures track stricter notions of compositionality. Our approach aims to provide a standard and scalable alternative to ad-hoc manual analyses and task-specific evaluations in machine learning research. It examines how surrogate measures track stricter notions of compositionality, complementing existing NLP techniques for compositional representation learning. The approach presented here is agnostic to the choice of composition function and focuses on evaluating data from language and other sources. It demonstrates using existing NLP techniques for compositional representation learning in non-linguistic settings. The communication task involves a speaker model sending messages to a listener model for downstream tasks, aiming to assess the compositionality of the representations. The section proposes an automated procedure for determining if the compositional structure of input objects is reflected in the representations produced by a model. It defines a representation learning problem with a dataset of observations, a space of representations, and a model mapping observations to representations. The technique assumes prior knowledge about the compositional structure of inputs labeled with tree-structured derivations.

It focuses on determining if the representations produced by a model reflect the compositional structure of input objects. The technique focuses on determining if model representations reflect the compositional structure of input objects, requiring natural language strings as inputs and logical representations of meaning as outputs. Challenges arise in identifying lexicon entries and handling languages without clearly-defined syntax. The technique focuses on identifying lexicon entries and handling languages without clearly-defined syntax to determine if model representations reflect the compositional structure of input objects. The oracle derivations guide the process of composing primitive representations to produce full representations, ensuring the speaker model is compositional. However, in some cases, there may be no assignment of strings to primitives that reproduces model predictions exactly. The speaker model is compositional as long as there is an assignment of representations to primitives that reproduces the speaker's prediction. Predictions can be approximated by mapping strings to primitives. Compositionality is measured by how well an explicitly compositional model approximates the true predictor. The evaluation procedure involves Tree Reconstruction Error (TRE) to find representations that allow for a close approximation of the true function f. The evaluation procedure involves Tree Reconstruction Error (TRE) to find representations that allow for a close approximation of the true function f by optimizing over parts rather than taking them as given. The Tree Reconstruction Error (TRE) measures how well the best compositional prediction matches the true model prediction. The choice of composition function is left to the evaluator, with caution needed to avoid trivial solutions. If the evaluation procedure selects an arbitrary composition function, the result will be trivial. The Tree Reconstruction Error (TRE) measures compositional prediction accuracy. Pre-commitment to a restricted composition function is necessary to avoid trivial solutions. Experiments with fixed and learned composition functions are featured. Implementation details for differentiable models and solving Equation 2 using gradient descent are discussed. An SGD-based TRE solver is provided in the software release. Task-specific optimizers can be applied to Equation 2 for various problems. The paper explores using TRE to address compositionality questions.

The training dataset consists of 9000 image triplets with a validation set of 500 examples, achieving a validation accuracy of 75.2% on average. The paper compares TRE(X) to the mutual information I(\u03b8; x) between representations and inputs during training. The paper compares TRE(X) to the mutual information I(\u03b8; x) between representations and inputs over the course of training. Both quantities are computed on the validation set, showing a relationship between them. Small TRE indicates high compositionality, with mutual information and reconstruction error initially low and increasing over training.

It introduces a distance function for derivations and discusses the relationship between derivations and representations. The tree edit distance is used as a measure, and an upper bound on the distance between representations is proposed.

It emphasizes that small tree reconstruction error is not enough for topographic similarity and explores the connection between compositionality and generalization in communication games. In the final set of experiments, the relationship between compositionality and generalization in communication games is investigated. Agents are trained from random initial conditions to measure the compositional structure of the language that emerges and its impact on performance with familiar and novel objects. A speaker model describes target objects to a listener model using a discrete code, with the listener reconstructing the targets for rewards. The experiment focuses on a reference game where two policies, a speaker, and a listener, are trained to communicate effectively. The experiment focuses on a reference game BID20 where two policies, a speaker, and a listener, are trained to communicate effectively using a discrete communication protocol. The speaker observes target objects and sends a message to the listener, who reconstructs the targets by predicting attribute sets. Both models receive rewards for correct predictions, and are jointly trained using a policy gradient objective. The compositional structure involves two objects with two attributes each, and generalization is evaluated by holding out a subset of object pairs during training.

The results suggest a nuanced view of the relationship between compositionality and generalization, with TRE significantly correlated with generalization error and absolute model reward. TRE is correlated with both generalization error and absolute model reward, indicating that \"compositional\" languages often result from poor communication strategies. Low TRE is not a necessary condition for good generalization, as some languages achieve good generalization performance at both low and high levels of compositionality. The technique introduced is TRE for evaluating compositional structure in representation learning. It infers primitive meaning representations that approximate observed representations and measures the quality of this approximation. TRE-based analysis has been applied to various representation learning problems, exploring compositionality, learning dynamics, linguistic compositionality, similarity, and generalization. Questions remain on how to generalize TRE without oracle derivations, opening up new avenues for research in understanding machine learning models.
