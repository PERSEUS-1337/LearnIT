The approach utilizes the gradient operator induced by optimal transport in implicit deep generative models, providing a regularizer for parameter updates. Experiments show improved speed and stability in training GANs in terms of wall-clock time and FID learning curves. The generative model aims to recreate the density distribution from the real source by minimizing a discrepancy measure, such as the Wasserstein distance. This approach has been used in defining loss functions for learning generative models like Wasserstein GAN. Additionally, optimal transport can introduce structures for optimization, like the Wasserstein steepest descent flow for deep generative models in GANs. In this paper, the authors derive the Wasserstein steepest descent flow for deep generative models in GANs using the Wasserstein-2 metric function. They propose using the gradient operator induced by the Wasserstein-2 metric due to difficulties with the Fisher-Rao natural gradient in GANs. The proximal operator for the generators of GANs is computed with the regularization being the squared constrained Wasserstein-2 distance. The paper proposes using the gradient operator induced by the Wasserstein-2 metric BID21 for GANs, as an alternative to the problematic Fisher-Rao natural gradient. They compute the proximal operator for GAN generators with the regularization being the squared constrained Wasserstein-2 distance. The constrained distance can be approximated by a neural network, simplifying the computation. The relaxed proximal operator for generators simplifies parameter updates and can be easily implemented as a regularizer for generator updates. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated in experiments with various GANs. The paper introduces the Wasserstein natural gradient as a regularizer for GAN generator updates. It discusses the Wasserstein proximal method and its effectiveness in experiments with various GANs. The focus is on the Wasserstein-2 distance and its dynamical formulation for optimal transport between probability densities. The paper extends the classic theory of the Wasserstein-2 distance to cover parameterized density models, introducing a constrained Wasserstein-2 metric function that considers parameter space constraints. The formulation involves infimum among feasible Borel potential functions and continuous parameter paths. The metric function d W has a formulation involving infimum among feasible Borel potential functions and continuous parameter paths. It can be used for steepest descent optimization schemes and defines a constrained Wasserstein-2 gradient for loss functions. The Wasserstein natural gradient is defined by a matrix representing the Wasserstein Riemannian metric. The steepest descent flow and gradient descent iteration are determined by this metric. The backward Euler method, known as the Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto scheme, provides a numerical scheme for optimization. The parameter update distance acts as a regularization to the loss function. The Semi-Backward Euler method is a first-order scheme for the gradient flow of a loss function, providing an easier approximation compared to the forward Euler method. It does not require computing and inverting G(\u03b8) and is simpler than the backward Euler method (JKO). The method involves a constrained optimization over \u03a6, making it more tractable than the time-dependent constraint in computing d W. The Semi-Backward Euler method in implicit generative models simplifies the approximation process by avoiding the need to compute and invert G(\u03b8). It involves a constrained optimization over \u03a6, making it more tractable than the backward Euler method. The method utilizes a neural network to approximate variable \u03a6 and allows for a simpler formulation of the constrained Wasserstein-2 metric. The constrained Wasserstein-2 metric in implicit generative models simplifies the approximation process by utilizing a neural network to approximate variable \u03a6.

Multiple generator updates before discriminator updates are examined, showing the importance of regularization for lower FID scores. In experiments, it is shown that RWP regularization improves speed and achieves a lower FID, even with multiple generator iterations. The RWP regularization improves GAN training speed and stability, leading to better sample quality. Multiple generator iterations can cause initial learning to fail, but once successful, it remains stable. An experiment with 10 generator iterations per outer-iteration shows convergence and lower FID with RWP, while training without RWP is highly variable.

The training involved approximating three functions and optimizing over three networks. The Wasserstein distance is commonly used as the loss function in GANs due to its statistical properties. In machine learning and GANs, the Wasserstein distance is often used as the loss function due to its statistical properties and ability to compare probability distributions. The Wasserstein-1 distance function is chosen in Wasserstein GAN, where the discriminator must satisfy the 1-Lipschitz condition. Regularization techniques are applied to the discriminator to meet this condition. The Wasserstein-2 metric provides a metric tensor structure for gradient flows in the full probability set. The Wasserstein-1 distance function is used in GANs, requiring the discriminator to satisfy the 1-Lipschitz condition. The Wasserstein-2 metric creates a metric tensor structure for gradient flows in the probability space, forming a density manifold. This gradient flow is linked to transport-related partial differential equations, such as the Fokker-Planck equation.

The Wasserstein gradient operator in (P + , g W ) is used for the gradient flow in minimizing FID for implicit generative models. The Wasserstein-2 metric and gradient operator are then constrained on statistical models defined by a triplet (\u0398, R n , \u03c1), where a Riemannian metric is defined on \u03c1(\u0398) by pulling back the Wasserstein-2 metric tensor. This results in a Wasserstein statistical manifold with a smooth Riemannian structure. The Wasserstein statistical manifold is defined by a metric tensor and a smooth Riemannian structure.
