    "content": "This report provides a comparison of Department of Energy (DOE) funding for renewable energy with funding for other energy technologies over different time periods. Final funding amounts for FY2017 and FY2018 were established by specific acts signed by the President. Funding levels for DOE are included in Energy and Water Development programs. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141) set final funding for DOE in Energy and Water Development programs. Funding levels for DOE in real terms since 1978 are shown in Figure 1 and cumulative funding totals for the past 10, 41, and 71 years are presented in Table 1. Table 2 shows relative shares of spending for each technology or energy source. Figures 2, 3, and 4 display cumulative DOE spending for different time periods. The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 established the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) to focus on R&D for nuclear energy for civilian use, following the Manhattan Project's military research. The AEC's main focus was on developing nuclear power for civilian electric power production, in response to the oil embargo. The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 established the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) to oversee nuclear energy research and development, including nuclear power for civilian use. In response to the 1973 oil embargo, the Federal Energy Administration and Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) were created. The Department of Energy (DOE) was established in 1977, consolidating various energy programs under its administration, focusing on fossil, nuclear, renewable, and energy efficiency R&D. The Department of Energy (DOE) consolidated all energy R&D programs under its administration, including fossil, nuclear, renewable, and energy efficiency. Federal government spending on fossil energy and nuclear power technologies totaled $17.1 billion and $51.6 billion, respectively, from FY1948 to FY1977. The energy crises of the 1970s led to the expansion of R&D programs to include renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies. Since FY1978, DOE has been the primary funder of energy R&D compared to other federal agencies. Since the 1970s, DOE has been the main funder of energy R&D, with funding for renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies peaking in FY1979 at $8.6 billion (2016 dollars). Funding dropped to $2.0 billion per year in the late 1990s but has gradually increased since then, with a spike to $13 billion in FY2009. In FY2018, DOE energy R&D funding was nearly $4.5 billion (2016 dollars)."
