Congress finds that in August 2013, Islamist-led mobs burned and destroyed Christian properties in Egypt after the government led by the Muslim Brotherhood was removed. The succeeding government, under President Sisi, announced that the army would rebuild the damaged churches at government expense. President Sisi has shown support for the Coptic Christian community by attending Christmas liturgies and acknowledging their historical and national role. In January 2015, President Sisi made an appearance at a Coptic Christian Christmas liturgy. In January 2016, he promised to restore all churches damaged in the August 2013 violence.
