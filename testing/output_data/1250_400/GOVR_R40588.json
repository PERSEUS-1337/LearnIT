    "content": "In April 2009, a novel influenza virus emerged, initially called \"swine flu\" due to its genetic makeup. The World Health Organization explained that the virus resulted from reassortment of swine, avian, and human flu viruses. This type of reassortment had been observed in pigs since 1998, and the current influenza A (H1N1) virus is a mix of swine, avian, and human genes. The origin of this reassortment is unknown, but the virus is now spreading among humans. The role of swine in the emergence of the virus is being investigated by WHO. The novel influenza virus, known as H1N1, is a reassortment of genes from swine, avian, and human origins. It is now being transmitted from human to human and is slightly more lethal than seasonal flu. The virus has spread enough to be classified as a pandemic, but researchers are unsure of its full virulence. In April 2009, cases of H1N1 were reported in California and Texas, with gene segments from swine flu viruses found in patients who had no contact with pigs. On April 21, 2009, CDC reported two children in California recovered from a unique influenza strain with gene segments from swine flu viruses. Five more H1N1 cases were reported in California and Texas. Mexico announced a new influenza strain with over 1,000 suspected cases, leading to school closures and event cancellations. By April 27, 2009, WHO reported human cases in Canada and Spain with no deaths. WHO raised the pandemic alert level to Phase 5 due to human-to-human spread of the virus. Two days later, WHO Director-General Dr. Margaret Chan raised the influenza pandemic alert level from Phase 4 to Phase 5, indicating human-to-human spread of the virus into at least two countries in one WHO region. On June 11, 2009, the alert level was raised to Phase 6, the highest level, with over 50,000 confirmed human cases of H1N1 in more than 80 countries and territories, including 231 deaths. Dr. Chan described the H1N1 virus as \"moderately severe\" and emphasized that the spread of the disease, not a change in virulence, was the reason for the shift in classification. As of June 22, 2009, WHO reported over 50,000 confirmed human cases of H1N1 in more than 80 countries, with 231 deaths. It is noted that more cases may have occurred than officially reported. WHO stated that there is no risk of contracting the virus from well-cooked pork products. Travel restrictions are not recommended as they would have little effect on stopping the virus spread. However, ill individuals should delay international travel. Symptoms of H1N1 include sore throat, cough, and runny nose. The WHO advises against travel restrictions to stop the spread of H1N1, but recommends ill individuals delay international travel. Most people with H1N1 experience flu-like symptoms and recover without antiviral treatment. Oseltamivir and zanamivir are effective antiviral drugs against H1N1. WHO has a global stockpile of oseltamivir for treatment. The WHO has a global stockpile of oseltamivir for treating H1N1, with 3 million treatment courses being distributed to developing countries. There is no vaccine available for the current strain of H1N1, but efforts are underway to develop one, which could take five to six months to mass-produce. Once developed, at least 1 to 2 billion vaccine doses could be produced annually. The WHO and CDC are working on developing a vaccine against H1N1, which could take 5-6 months to mass-produce. Sanofi-Aventis and GlaxoSmithKline have pledged to donate millions of vaccine doses to WHO. China has quarantined Mexican nationals, while some countries have advised against nonessential travel to the US and Mexico. Mexico responded by barring all flights to China until concerns about discrimination were addressed. Some countries have warned against nonessential travel to the United States and Mexico, with the European Union Health Commissioner urging Europeans to postpone nonessential travel to these countries. The CDC recommended avoiding nonessential travel to Mexico but later downgraded the recommendation to a travel health precaution. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano defended the decision not to close U.S. borders with Mexico, stating that closing the border would yield only marginal benefits and that the virus strain detected in Mexico was already present throughout the United States. Closing the U.S. border to Mexico would have minimal benefits but high costs, as the virus strain from Mexico is already widespread in the United States. Countries are implementing measures like thermal scanners in airports, while some have banned pork imports. USAID has established a Pandemic Influenza Response Management Team. Egypt ordered the slaughter of pigs due to H1N1 outbreaks, but pigs have not been confirmed as a source of human transmission. Several countries banned pork imports from the US, Canada, and Mexico. USAID established a Pandemic Influenza Response Management Team to coordinate humanitarian aid, providing over $16 million to Latin America and the Caribbean for H1N1 response. CDC, USAID, and DOD are involved in global H1N1 outbreak responses, focusing on commodity delivery and disease surveillance. The U.S. response to global H1N1 outbreaks is mainly led by CDC, USAID, and DOD, focusing on commodity delivery and disease surveillance. USAID donated personal protection equipment kits and disinfectant to Vietnam for H1N1 and avian flu outbreaks. CDC's influenza laboratory in Atlanta plays a key role in identifying and developing testing kits for different influenza subtypes. The CDC influenza laboratory in Atlanta, a WHO collaborating center, receives viral samples from many countries, including Mexico. CDC develops testing kits for influenza subtypes and sends them to public health labs worldwide. HHS Secretary announced sending 400,000 treatment courses to Mexico. CDC has deployed staff to Mexico and Guatemala, including experts in various fields to help control the virus spread. CDC aims to distribute 2 million courses in Latin America and the Caribbean, deploying staff to Mexico and Guatemala with expertise in various fields to control the spread of the H1N1 virus. Teams work under the WHO/Pan American Health Organization Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network to understand illness severity and transmission patterns, improve laboratory capacity, and collaborate with other organizations globally. Additionally, CDC supports pandemic influenza preparedness efforts in over 50 countries through various means. CDC supports pandemic influenza preparedness efforts in over 50 countries by sending experts to work with WHO country offices or foreign ministries of health and providing funding through cooperative agreements. USAID has provided $6.1 million for international H1N1 assistance, with a focus on advanced disease surveillance and control measures in Latin America and the Caribbean. Assistance includes distributing personal protection equipment kits and supporting animal surveillance efforts in Mexico and other parts of the region. USAID provided $5 million in assistance to FAO for animal surveillance efforts in Mexico and Latin America. In May 2009, they distributed over 100,000 PPE kits to protect first responders from contracting the disease. USAID also pre-positioned 400,000 PPE kits in 82 countries for pandemic preparedness. They held a pandemic preparedness exercise in Ethiopia with stakeholders from nine East African countries to develop a response action plan. In East Africa, USAID conducted a pandemic preparedness exercise with stakeholders from nine countries to develop a response action plan. The exercise aimed to test plans, identify weaknesses, and improve preparedness for potential influenza outbreaks. USAID plans to conduct similar exercises in South Africa and Asia in 2009. Additionally, USAID is working with the Department of Defense to provide military assistance in 30 African countries. USAID conducted pandemic preparedness exercises in East Africa and plans to do the same in South Africa and Asia in 2009. They are collaborating with the Department of Defense to provide military assistance in 30 African countries. Congress has funded efforts to train health workers in foreign countries for pandemic preparedness since FY2005. Since FY2005, Congress has funded U.S. technical assistance efforts for global pandemic influenza preparedness and response, totaling $949 million. This funding has supported international efforts in over 100 nations, focusing on preparedness, surveillance, and response. The funds were allocated for bilateral activities and support to international organizations like WHO, FAO, UNDP, and the Red Cross. The $949 million funding for global pandemic influenza preparedness and response included support for bilateral activities, international organizations like WHO and FAO, regional programs, global contingency, technical assistance, research, wild bird surveillance, and stockpiles of supplies. The $949 million funding for global pandemic influenza preparedness and response included support for various activities such as vaccines, wild bird surveillance, stockpiles of supplies, and global communications and outreach. Contributions came from USAID, HHS, USDA, DOD, and DOS, with an additional $1.5 billion requested by President Obama for pandemic preparedness. President Obama requested $1.5 billion for pandemic preparedness. The 2009 Supplemental Appropriations bill allocated $50 million for USAID and $200 million for CDC for H1N1 activities. Concerns about infectious diseases threatening global security have increased due to outbreaks like H5N1 and SARS. Influenza A H1N1 has highlighted the threat of infectious diseases. Infectious disease outbreaks like H5N1 avian influenza and SARS have raised concerns about global security. The emergence of influenza A H1N1 has shown the threat posed by infectious diseases, with 75% originating from animals. Effective responses require a multidisciplinary approach involving stakeholders from various sectors. Investments made by the US and other international players have helped in preparing for pandemics and monitoring infectious diseases. Progress has been made in developing tests, treatments, and a global surveillance system for H1N1, but some concerns remain. Some health experts have concerns about the global response to H1N1, especially in poorer countries lacking monitoring capacity. There are worries about potential gene reassortment and the virus spreading in winter months. Questions remain about maintaining the pandemic influenza phase system. Outbreaks of H5N1 bird flu in countries like Egypt, Vietnam, and Indonesia coincide with the global spread of H1N1. In May 2009, there was a debate on whether WHO should maintain its pandemic phase system based on transmission patterns rather than severity. Some argued for an alert system based on severity to avoid panic. Critics warned of economic and social disruptions if the pandemic threat level was raised to Phase 6. Despite recent cases of human-to-human transmission in Japan, WHO raised the pandemic phase level to 6 on June 11, 2009, emphasizing that it did not indicate a change in severity. On June 11, 2009, WHO raised the pandemic phase level from 5 to 6, citing recent cases of sustained human-to-human transmission of H1N1 in Japan. Director General Margaret Chan emphasized that the shift did not indicate a change in severity. WHO also updated its pandemic influenza preparedness and response guide, outlining steps for governments to plan and prepare for epidemics. USAID announced a new five-year program in collaboration with CDC and USDA to develop a global early warning system for diseases of animal origin that infect humans. USAID announced a new five-year program in collaboration with CDC and USDA to develop a global early warning system for diseases of animal origin that infect humans, such as SARS, H5N1, and HIV/AIDS. The program aims to establish a network of laboratories in Africa to improve the diagnosis of new emergent pathogens. Concerns have been raised about the limited public health and surveillance capacity in most African countries. Some African countries have poor laboratory and surveillance systems, leading to limited reporting of diseases. Efforts by CDC, USAID, and other international experts aim to improve these systems. Access to treatments and vaccines for diseases in poor countries has been a debated issue, especially during past disease outbreaks like HIV/AIDS and H5N1 avian flu. Access to treatments and vaccines for diseases in poor countries has been a debated issue, with concerns raised about affordability and hoarding by wealthier nations. USAID and WHO highlight the lack of access to medicines in certain regions, with most global vaccine development capacity concentrated in Europe and North America. Poorer countries rely on donor countries for assistance, leading to worries that during a pandemic, treatments and vaccines may be hoarded by wealthier nations. Estimates show that over 90% of global influenza vaccine development capacity is in Europe and North America, with richer countries dominating access to treatments and vaccines. Concerns arise about hoarding during a pandemic, as well as the ability of poorer countries to administer mass vaccination campaigns. WHO reported that national authorities, not them, would conduct H1N1 vaccination efforts. Experts worry about the 1.4 million preventable child deaths due to lack of routine vaccinations. Health experts, including the WHO, are concerned about the potential for reassortment of H5N1 bird flu and H1N1 strains, which could create a new strain with the potential to cause human illness. Concerns about a possible influenza pandemic have been raised since 2004 when the first human cases of avian influenza were reported in Thailand and Viet Nam. The H5N1 strain has the potential to cause a pandemic due to its highly pathogenic nature, although efficient human-to-human transmission has not yet been observed. In 2004, Thailand and Viet Nam reported their first human cases of avian influenza, specifically the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain. By 2006, 50 countries worldwide had confirmed outbreaks of H5N1 bird flu. The virus has a high mortality rate of about 60% but is not easily transmissible between humans. Indonesia and Cambodia have not reported H1N1 cases, unlike other countries with H5N1 outbreaks."
