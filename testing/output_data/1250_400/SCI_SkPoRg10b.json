    "content": "We present an approach to understand the generalization properties of deep neural networks by revisiting ideas from statistical mechanics. A Very Simple Deep Learning (VSDL) model with two control parameters is introduced to explain the behavior of neural networks. This model provides insights into overfitting, discontinuous learning, and sharp transitions in generalization properties observed in deep learning algorithms. The text discusses the complex properties of neural networks, particularly deep neural networks, in relation to overfitting, discontinuous learning, and generalization properties. Researchers have conflicting views on the robustness of neural networks to noise in data and the applicability of certain theories in understanding their behavior. The text discusses conflicting views on the properties of neural networks, particularly deep neural networks, in relation to overfitting and generalization. Recent studies highlight the tendency of state-of-the-art DNNs to overtrain when presented with noisy data. Recent studies have shown that state-of-the-art neural networks easily overtrain when presented with noisy data. Popular regularization methods do not effectively prevent this overtraining, except for early stopping. Regularization methods like adding noise or dropout do not effectively prevent overtraining in neural networks, except for early stopping. This behavior is different from SVMs, where tuning regularization parameters can prevent overtraining. The text discusses the challenges of preventing overtraining in neural networks through regularization methods. It highlights the need to rethink generalization in deep learning and suggests revisiting old ideas on capacity control from statistical mechanics. The authors propose using statistical mechanics theory to explain empirical properties of neural networks that are not easily understood through traditional theories like PAC/VC theory. The text discusses using statistical mechanics theory to explain empirical properties of neural networks, providing a qualitative explanation beyond traditional theories like PAC/VC theory. The approach can offer precise quantitative agreement with observed results, particularly suitable for models like DNNs where complexity grows with data points. It also introduces a theory of generalization that naturally accounts for phases, phase transitions, and complex learning behavior based on control parameters of the machine learning process. The text discusses using statistical mechanics theory to explain empirical properties of neural networks, providing a qualitative explanation beyond traditional theories like PAC/VC theory. It introduces a theory of generalization that accounts for phases, phase transitions, and complex learning behavior based on control parameters of the machine learning process. The proposed VSDL model of classification in DNN learning models involves adjusting algorithm knobs based on error plots, phase diagrams, and adding noise to input data. The two parameters used by Zhang et al. are compared to load-like and temperature-like parameters in the traditional SM approach to generalization. The text discusses the VSDL model of classification in DNN learning models, comparing parameters to traditional SM approach. It explains how control parameters affect generalization properties, illustrated in a one-dimensional phase diagram. The text discusses the VSDL model of classification in DNN learning models, comparing parameters to traditional SM approach. Control parameters affect generalization properties, illustrated in a one-dimensional and two-dimensional phase diagram. The critical value \u03b1 c marks dramatic changes in generalization properties, with sharp transitions between phases in the two-dimensional space defined by \u03b1 and \u03c4 parameters. Adding noise and adjusting algorithm knobs can compensate for poor generalization behavior. The text discusses the VSDL model of classification in DNN learning models, comparing parameters to traditional SM approach. Control parameters affect generalization properties, illustrated in a one-dimensional and two-dimensional phase diagram. Adding noise and adjusting algorithm knobs can compensate for poor generalization behavior. The system's properties vary smoothly, and the process of adding noise and adjusting parameters is shown in FIG1. Starting from point A, noise causes a decrease in \u03b1 leading to poor generalization at point B, which can be offset by adjusting the number of iterations to modify the \u03c4 parameter. The VSDL model and consequences are detailed in Sections 3.1 and 3.2. Technical complexities are not the focus of this paper to maintain simplicity. In this paper, the focus is on the basic ideas and qualitative results of the VSDL model of classification in DNN learning models. The technical complexities are left for future work, as the main contribution is to maintain simplicity. It is important to be cautious in interpreting the results and not make broad claims about realistic DNN systems, as they have many control parameters that can interact in complicated ways. The specific details of the model, learning algorithm, data properties, and noise all play a significant role in generalization. The VSDL model of classification in DNN learning models focuses on maintaining simplicity and caution in interpreting results due to the complex interactions of control parameters. The specific details of the model, learning algorithm, data properties, and noise all influence generalization behavior. The paper will review background information and present connections between DNN control parameters and generalization behavior in a VSDL model. The historical background of the SM approach to NNs dates back to the early days of the field, with a focus on generalization properties. Methods like Support Vector Machines gained attention in the 80s/90s for controlling NN generalization. The ML community later shifted towards optimization-based analysis methods like SVMs. The SM approach to NNs, along with PAC/VC theory, was popular in the 80s/90s for controlling generalization properties of NNs. The ML community then focused on methods like SVMs for optimization-based analysis. Recently, there has been a renewed interest in DNNs, with most theoretical work considering the PAC/VC approach over the SM approach for generalization. This paper aims to describe how the SM approach can qualitatively explain observed phenomena, although providing a quantitative description is not within the scope of this paper. The SM approach to NNs explains qualitative properties in learning/generalization curves, highlighting complexities not captured by PAC/VC theory. It shows discontinuities in generalization performance and sensitivity to model details and algorithms. The text discusses the complexity of generalization performance in deep learning systems, highlighting discontinuities and sensitivity to various factors such as model details, algorithms, and data properties. Researchers have observed these counterintuitive properties in recent years, which are not fully captured by traditional theories like PAC/VC theory. The text discusses the limitations of algorithmic optimization questions separate from statistical inference questions, highlighting technical complexities and strong distribution assumptions. It mentions the non-rigorous nature of the approach and the challenges in reproducing results due to insufficient descriptions in publications. The text discusses the challenges in reproducing results due to insufficient descriptions in publications, particularly in the context of phases, phase transitions, and phase diagrams in neural networks. It highlights the non-rigorous nature of the approach and the different phases NNs can exhibit based on control parameters. The text discusses the generalization properties of neural networks, focusing on how the system's behavior changes under different control parameters. It mentions the different phases NNs can exhibit, such as high-temperature ergodic phase, spin glass phase, and low-memory phase, and how the system's retrieval properties can dramatically change with variations in these parameters. The text presents a model of practical deep learning computations, focusing on the generalization properties of neural networks. It introduces the VSDL model, discusses the thermodynamic limit for analyzing the model, and highlights the system's behavior in this limit. The VSDL model is a simple model capturing practical control parameters in DNN systems. It is analyzed in the thermodynamic limit, showing non-trivial learning phases. The model represents DNN training with a function mapping input images to output labels, dependent on parameters \u03b1 and \u03c4. The VSDL model in deep learning systems depends on parameters \u03b1 and \u03c4, similar to control parameters in physical systems like temperature and pressure in water. The model can exhibit different phases based on the values of \u03b1 and \u03c4, analogous to transitions in physical systems with varying control parameters. In deep learning systems, the Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi random graph model is used to understand transitions between regions of control parameter space. Adding noise to training data decreases an effective load, impacting the macroscopic properties of DNN learning systems. The focus is on understanding generalization and deep learning at a macroscopic level. Adding noise to training data decreases an effective load \u03b1, impacting the macroscopic properties of DNN learning systems. This is achieved by randomizing a fraction of the labels or data values, reducing the effective number of training examples. The model capacity remains similar, leading to a decrease in the effective load-like parameter \u03b1. Adding noise to training data decreases the effective load \u03b1 in DNN learning systems. This is achieved by randomizing labels, reducing the number of training examples. The model capacity remains unchanged, leading to a decrease in the load-like parameter \u03b1. The model capacity of realistic DNNs scales with the amount of data, not the effective load. Training a new DNN model on a set of data points with noisy labels results in overtraining due to excessive capacity. Early stopping in training algorithms increases an effective temperature-like control parameter. The iteration complexity in stochastic iterative training algorithms acts as an effective temperature-like control parameter. Early stopping increases this parameter, which corresponds to a temperature \u03c4 in DNN training with SGD-based algorithms. This temperature \u03c4 is related to the annealing rate schedule of the SGD algorithm and depends on the number of steps taken during training. The VSDL model focuses on the parameters \u03b1 and \u03c4, which can be adjusted by practitioners to control the learning process in neural networks. Other factors are assumed to be fixed for simplicity. The model disregards certain quantities like VC dimension and growth function, as they do not offer practical control over learning. The main argument can be extended to handle other control parameters. The VSDL model focuses on parameters \u03b1 and \u03c4 for controlling neural network learning. It disregards quantities like VC dimension and growth function, which do not provide practical control. When analyzing modern DNNs, a thermodynamic limit should be considered where hypothesis space and data points diverge, as opposed to fixing hypothesis space and letting data points diverge. Technical complexities associated with this approach are detailed in referenced materials. The VSDL model focuses on controlling neural network learning using parameters \u03b1 and \u03c4. In the thermodynamic limit, hypothesis space and data points diverge, leading to technical complexities. The SM theory of generalization implies phase diagrams for the VSDL model based on parameters \u03b1 and \u03c4. The VSDL model uses parameters \u03b1 and \u03c4 to control neural network learning. Phase diagrams for the model show how generalization and training errors change with \u03b1 and \u03c4. The transition at a critical value \u03b1 c leads to dramatic changes in error rates. The VSDL model uses parameters \u03b1 and \u03c4 to control neural network learning. The transition at a critical value \u03b1 c leads to dramatic changes in error rates, where adding noise to data and adjusting algorithm knobs can compensate for the increase in generalization error. The VSDL model utilizes parameters \u03b1 and \u03c4 to regulate neural network learning. When the system reaches a critical value \u03b1 c, a transition occurs, causing significant changes in error rates. Adding noise to data and adjusting algorithm parameters can help compensate for the increase in generalization error. The VSDL model uses parameters \u03b1 and \u03c4 to control neural network learning. When \u03b1 < \u03b1 c, generalization properties on new noisy data worsen, but can be improved by adjusting \u03c4. Neural networks can easily overtrain without a global control parameter for generalization. Conclusion 1 states that neural networks can easily overtrain without a global control parameter for generalization. In realistic NNs and DNNs, there is no single parameter like Tikhonov value or number of vectors to prevent overfitting. Conclusion 2 mentions that popular regularization methods may or may not help in preventing overfitting. The only control parameter to prevent overfitting in this model is \u03c4, while the number of iterations (t) acts as a regularization parameter. In an idealized model of realistic DNNs, the only control parameter to prevent overfitting is \u03c4, while the number of iterations must be decreased. Revisiting old ideas in the SM of NNs offers insights into generalization properties and modern DNNs. The VSDL model and SM theory differ from the PAC/VC approach but provide value in understanding neural networks. The VSDL model and SM theory offer a different approach to generalization compared to the PAC/VC method. By simplifying complex DNNs into two control parameters, they provide insights into understanding neural networks and preventing overfitting. The VSDL model and SM theory offer a unique perspective on generalization in neural networks, focusing on two control parameters. Recent related work explores refined analyses and connections with margin-based boosting methods and Information Bottleneck ideas, providing valuable insights that complement the VSDL model's approach. In BID45, authors analyze information compression in stochastic optimization algorithms. They suggest that every DNN has a generalization phase diagram affected by control parameters. This conjecture proposes a phase where generalization changes gradually and a \"low temperature\" phase where learning breaks down. The VSDL model and SM approach provide an explanation for various phenomena observed empirically, such as discontinuities in generalization performance and sensitivity to model details, algorithm properties, and data characteristics. The VSDL model and SM approach explain discontinuities in generalization performance and sensitivity to model details, algorithm properties, and data characteristics. Simple models are used to illustrate these concepts. The VSDL model and SM approach explain discontinuities in generalization performance and sensitivity to model details, algorithm properties, and data characteristics. In Section A, simple models are described to illustrate these concepts and the root of discontinuous generalization properties. Popular mechanisms for regularization are reviewed, highlighting their limitations in certain situations. The text discusses simple network architectures like the fully-connected committee machine, tree-based parity machine, and one-layer reversed-wedge Ising perceptron to understand their representation capabilities in modern DNNs. These architectures showcase the strength of multilayer networks over single layer networks and highlight the importance of non-trivial activation functions for realistic network representation. The fully-connected committee machine and tree-based parity machine are two extreme cases of connectivity in network architectures. The committee machine is a multi-layer network with hidden layers, while the tree-based parity machine is also a multi-layer model. The committee machine uses a majority vote of the hidden layer for output, and the tree-based parity machine has its own unique structure. The curr_chunk discusses different models in neural networks: a fully-connected committee machine, a tree-based parity machine, and a one-layer reversed-wedge Ising perceptron. These models have unique structures and activation functions, with corresponding learning curves showing the generalization error as a function of control parameters. The curr_chunk presents the one-layer reversed-wedge Ising perceptron model, highlighting its non-monotonic activation function and classification based on \u03bb and \u03b3 values. The learning curve in FIG3 demonstrates the discontinuous behavior of the generalization error \u03b5 with respect to the control parameter \u03b1. The curr_chunk discusses the discontinuous behavior of generalization error \u03b5 with different values of \u03b3 and \u03b1. It highlights abrupt changes in the learning curve based on load-like parameters and the observation of basic discontinuous generalization behavior across various parameter values. The mechanism for this behavior is further explained through simpler models in Section A.3. In Section A.2, two approaches to understanding generalization in machine learning are reviewed. The target rule T maps elements of input space X into classes {0, 1}, while hypothesis space F consists of mappings f to approximate T. The goal is for the student to approximate the teacher (T) well, with generalization error \u03b5 representing the disagreement probability between student and teacher on a subset of X. The process involves selecting an element of F to evaluate its approximation of T on the complete input space X. The student aims to approximate the target rule T in input space X. The generalization error \u03b5 measures the disagreement probability between student and teacher on a subset of X. The student iterates the learning process by updating mappings based on teacher's labels. In the realizable case, the version space is the subset of X compatible with the data seen so far. The zero-temperature Gibbs learning rule is sometimes considered in this context. The version space at time step t in the iterative learning algorithm is the subset of X compatible with the data seen so far. The training error \u03b5 t quantifies the performance of the student on the training set, while the generalization error measures the difference between training error and generalization error. The learning curve characterizes the behavior of this difference as a function of control parameters. The PAC/VC approach views training set size as the main control parameter to understand the properties of the learning process. The learning curve analyzes the behavior of the difference between training error and generalization error as a function of control parameters. The PAC/VC approach considers training set size as the main control parameter to understand learning process properties. The text discusses the problem of convergence of frequencies to probabilities in learning theory. It explores different approaches like the law of large numbers, central limit theorem, and Hoeffding-type bounds. The focus is on constructing a uniform bound over the hypothesis space by considering the worst-case scenario. The PAC/VC approach involves minimizing empirical error within a function class F on a random sample to bound generalization error. The text discusses the PAC/VC approach to generalization error, where the empirical error within a function class F on a random sample leads to a bounded generalization error. The focus is on the VC dimension of F, which measures its complexity, and the bounds are universal for any F, input distribution, and target distribution. The text also explores the idea of varying the function class F with the training set size m in practical DNN learning. The text discusses the SM approach to generalization error, where the function class F can vary with the training set size m. This approach, known as the thermodynamic limit, allows for easy computation of quantities related to generalization error. The SM approach is different from its use in associative memory models and provides a basis for generalization in information theory and error correcting codes. The SM approach to generalization error, proposed as an alternative to associative memory models, aims to describe the learning curve of a parametric class of functions. It involves choosing target functions from a sequence of classes of functions, leading to a sequence of target functions. If a limiting behavior exists, the SM approach yields meaningful results, otherwise more sophisticated variants are needed. The SM approach describes the learning curve of a class of functions by selecting target functions from a sequence. If a limiting behavior exists, results are meaningful, otherwise more sophisticated variants are required. The competition between error value and entropy term is key, with a fixed constant \u03b1 representing the load on the network. The generalization error in the SM theory is investigated as the sample size and function class sizes grow, with a fixed constant \u03b1 representing the network load. Two approaches to generalization theory are discussed, along with simpler models to illustrate key issues. The basic single-layer perceptron model is discussed in detail to illustrate key issues in generalization theory. The model involves a set of weights and an output classification rule based on the angle between the input vector and the weight vector. The classification is determined by whether the angle is smaller or larger than \u03c0/2, with normalization applied to the vectors. The perceptron model involves weights represented by vector J \u2208 R N and a classification rule based on the angle between input vector S and weight vector J. The generalization error \u03b5 depends on the overlap parameter R between J and T, with \u03b5 = 0 for R = +1, \u03b5 = 0.5 for R = 0, and \u03b5 = 1 for R = \u22121. There are two basic versions of the perceptron: continuous perceptron where J 2 = N and output \u03c3 \u2208 {\u22121, +1}. The perceptron model has two basic versions: continuous perceptron with continuous weights on an N-dimensional sphere, and Ising perceptron with discrete weights on the corners of an N-dimensional hypercube. The generalization error decreases as the training set size increases. The Ising perceptron model has discrete weights on the corners of an N-dimensional hypercube. The generalization error decreases as the training set size increases, with consequences that are not well-described by PAC/VC theory. The probability of a vector remaining compatible with the teacher when a new example is presented can be quantified by grouping vectors into classes based on their overlap with the teacher. The average volume of compatible students decreases with each example presented. The Ising perceptron model has discrete weights on an N-dimensional hypercube. Generalization error decreases as training set size increases, not well-described by PAC/VC theory. Probability of vector compatibility with teacher quantified by overlap. Average volume of compatible students decreases with each example. Gibbs learning procedure reduces volume by 1-\u03b5 on average per example. Entropy and energy balance control generalization. Continuous perceptron entropy behaves as ln(\u03b5). The continuous perceptron model describes the entropy behavior as ln(\u03b5) for small \u03b5 or large \u03b1. The entropy slowly diverges to -\u221e as \u03b5 approaches 0 or R approaches 1. The energy behaves as e(\u03b5) \u223c -\u03b1 ln(1 - \u03b5) \u223c \u03b1\u03b5 for small \u03b5 or large \u03b1. The generalization error decreases smoothly with increasing number of examples. The maximum is determined by optimizing the difference s(\u03b5) \u2212 e(\u03b5). For the Ising perceptron, the entropy approaches zero as \u03b5 \u2192 0 or as R \u2192 1, indicating one state with R = 1. The energy behaves as e(\u03b5) \u223c \u2212\u03b1 ln(1 \u2212 \u03b5) \u223c \u03b1\u03b5 for small \u03b5 or large \u03b1. The behavior of the continuous perceptron is simple, showing a smooth decrease in generalization error with increasing training set size. However, for large values of \u03b1, the optimal value is at the boundary \u03b5 = 0 (or R = 1), leading to a discontinuous change in \u03b5 as a function of \u03b1 at a critical value \u03b1 c. This behavior is not captured by PAC/VC theory. The behavior of the discrete Ising perceptron is more complex than the continuous perceptron. It exhibits a discontinuous change in generalization error with increasing data, illustrated in FIG5 (c). The learning system can reside in two phases depending on the value of \u03b1, with a one-dimensional phase diagram showing a large and smoothly decreasing generalization error in one phase, and a small or zero error in the other. This discussion focuses on realizable learning with the zero-temperature Gibbs learning rule, but in general, there may be additional control parameters in non-realizable cases. The discussion focuses on the complex behavior of the discrete Ising perceptron, showing a two-dimensional phase diagram with different phases based on \u03b1 and \u03c4 values. The continuous perceptron, on the other hand, has a trivial two-dimensional phase diagram with only one phase. The discrete perceptron exhibits phases of perfect generalization, poor generalization, spin glass phase, and metastable regimes. The continuous perceptron has a trivial two-dimensional phase diagram with only one phase, while the discrete perceptron shows phases of poor generalization, spin glass phase, and metastable regimes. The SM theory of learning characterizes generalization as a competition between entropy-like and energy-like terms, providing intuitive explanations for observed results. The version space V(S) and the -ball around the target function are of interest, containing functions consistent with the target function and with generalization error not larger than \u03b5, respectively. The -ball around the target function and the version space V(S) are sample-dependent and sample-independent subclasses of F, containing functions with generalization error not larger than \u03b5. Lower bounds on the probability of V(S) being in the -ball provide bounds on generalization error of any consistent learning algorithm. If a function h is consistent with random examples of a target function in F, then with probability at least 1 - \u03b4, the generalization error \u03b5(h) is given by a sum. The generalization error of a function h consistent with random examples of a target function in F is given by a sum of quantities over B(). One aims to minimize this expression to improve bounds. For |F| < \u221e, any consistent h satisfies \u03b5(h) \u2264 1 m ln (|F|/\u03b4) with probability at least 1 - \u03b4, independent of the distribution D or target function T. The PAC/VC-like bound is weak and may result in larger values of \u03b5(h). More refined upper bounds can be obtained by tracking errors. The generalization error of a function h consistent with random examples of a target function in F can be minimized by tracking errors and refining upper bounds. By considering a parametric class of functions, a trade-off between entropy and energy can be observed to bound generalization error. In the context of minimizing generalization error, a trade-off between entropy and energy can be observed to bound the error. The equation states that by summing specific terms, the error can be bounded, with the right-most crossing point indicating when the energy term dominates the entropy term. This concept is applied to the continuous perceptron and the Ising perceptron, showing a gradual decrease in error with increasing alpha values. The Ising perceptron shows a gradual decrease in error with increasing alpha values, as seen in the plots of \u2212\u03b1 log(1 \u2212 ) for three different values of \u03b1. The entropy upper bound for the Ising perceptron is s( ) = H(sin 2 (\u03c0 /2)), where H(x) = \u2212x log x \u2212 (1 \u2212 x) log(1 \u2212 x). The entropy density s( ) is very small for values of energy slightly greater than the minimum value. The learning curve corresponding to the energy-entropy competition is plotted in FIG5. The entropy density s( ) is very small for energy values slightly greater than the minimum. The plot in FIG5 shows the learning curve for the energy-entropy competition. The rightmost crossover point decreases gradually as alpha increases. At a critical value of alpha, the plot suddenly decreases to 0, and for larger values, the minimum is at the boundary. This non-smooth decrease of \u03b5 with \u03b1 is not described by PAC/VC theory but is consistent with results from Eqn. BID12. Theoretical and empirical work has focused on loss surfaces of NNs/DNNs, with a connection to spin glasses. Results suggest a link between NNs/DNNs and spin glasses, with consistency to the random energy model. The random energy model (REM) is related to spin glasses and neural networks, showing a transition in entropy density at a critical temperature \u03c4. This phenomenon explains the complex learning behavior in DNNs, where configurations with slightly higher loss have low entropy. The complex learning behavior in DNNs is explained by configurations with loss \u03b5 slightly above the minimum value. This phenomenon is illustrated analytically and pictorially, suggesting that every DNN exhibits this behavior. The connection between early stopping as a regularization mechanism and other regularization methods is discussed in relation to solving ill-posed LS problems using methods like Tikhonov-Phillips and TSVD. The LS problem involves finding a vector x such that Ax = b. If n > p, a solution may not exist. The Tikhonov-Phillips solution introduces a regularization parameter \u03bb to address overfitting. The TSVD method replaces the LS problem with a rank-k approximation to A. The solution involves the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse of A. The value of \u03bb controls the regularization. The LS problem involves finding a vector x such that Ax = b. The Tikhonov-Phillips solution introduces a regularization parameter \u03bb to address overfitting. The TSVD method replaces the LS problem with a rank-k approximation to A using the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse of A. The control parameter \u03bb controls the radius of convergence of the inverse of A T A + \u03bb 2 I, while the control parameter k restricts the domain and range of A k. Increasing \u03bb (or decreasing k) can prevent overfitting but may lead to underfitting due to the linear structure of A T A + \u03bb 2 I. The linear regularization approaches can prevent overfitting by increasing the control parameter \u03bb or decreasing the control parameter k, even if it means fitting the training data poorly. This concept extends to non-linear and arbitrary linear dynamical systems, where increasing a control parameter can prevent overfitting, as seen in statistical learning theory. In the 80s/90s, linear regularization approaches were ineffective on NNs, leading to the use of early stopping as implicit regularization. This approach is based on the idea that increasing control parameters like \u03bb and k can prevent overfitting, even if it results in underfitting. This concept is fundamental in statistical learning theory. Regularization in learning algorithms is viewed as the solution to iterative algorithms or dynamical systems without a specific objective to optimize. While there are connections to Tikhonov-Phillips/TSVD in some cases, it is not always expected. The dynamics leading to generalization in stochastic Langevin type dynamics are well-suited for simple generalization bounds. These dynamics have connections with stochastic dynamics and exploit connections with SM for generalization. The dynamics of stochastic Langevin type dynamics have connections with stochastic dynamics used in training modern DNNs. General dynamical systems have phases, phase transitions, and phase diagrams, but lack the structure needed for obtaining generalization bounds. Control parameters of the dynamical system cannot serve as regularization parameters. For general dynamical systems, obtaining generalization bounds is challenging without the structure provided by the thermodynamic limit. Control parameters of the system cannot act as regularization parameters. Adding noise to a system may not always prevent overfitting, as the quality of generalization may not vary smoothly with changes in the regularization parameter. The regularization parameter can impact generalization in complex systems. The PAC/VC approach may not always provide smooth upper bounds, and assumptions about regularity conditions in ML and mathematical statistics may not hold for nonlinear systems like NNs and DNNs. This challenges traditional intuition and requires further exploration."
