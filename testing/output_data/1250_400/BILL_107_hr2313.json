The \"Crane Tithe Tax Act of 2001\" repeals various provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 related to corporate taxation. SEC. 3. 10 PERCENT INCOME TAX RATE FOR INDIVIDUALS. Amends Section 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to impose a 10 percent income tax rate for individuals. The tax rate for individuals is 10 percent of earned income over the exemption amount, which is $10,000 adjusted for inflation. The cost-of-living adjustment for any calendar year is based on the percentage difference between the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for October of the preceding year and the CPI for October of 2000. The increase is rounded to the nearest multiple of $10. Earned income includes wages, salaries, and other forms of employee compensation. The term 'earned income' includes wages, salaries, net earnings from self-employment, and certain dividends. It does not include pension or annuity payments, or discretionary tips. The definition of earned income excludes pension, annuity, and discretionary tips, and includes fringe benefits valued at the employer's cost. SEC. 4. Amnesty for all prior tax liability is granted for taxable years before January 1, 2000, with exceptions for amounts paid before the enactment of the Act and taxes related to illegal activities.
