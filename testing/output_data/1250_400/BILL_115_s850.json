    "content": "The \"Foreign Medical School Accountability Fairness Act of 2017\" aims to establish consistent eligibility requirements for graduate medical schools outside the US and Canada to increase accountability and protect American students and taxpayer dollars. Congress finds that three for-profit Caribbean medical schools receive a significant portion of Federal funding under title IV of the Higher Education Act, despite being exempt from meeting the same eligibility requirements as other foreign medical schools. The attrition rate at these Caribbean schools is much higher than US medical schools, and residency match rates for foreign-trained graduates are lower. In 2014, the attrition rate at US medical schools was 3.4%, while for-profit Caribbean medical schools had rates as high as 30%. In 2016, residency match rates for foreign-trained graduates were 54% compared to 94% for US medical school graduates. Students at for-profit medical schools outside the US and Canada accumulate more debt than those in the US. SEC. 4. REPEAL GRANDFATHER PROVISIONS. Section 102(a)(2) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to require that at least 60 percent of enrolled and graduated students in a graduate medical school outside the United States were not described in a specific section, and at least 75 percent of students or graduates were not nationals of the United States or Canada. The Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to require that 75 percent of students or graduates from a graduate medical school outside the US or Canada pass exams administered by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates. Additionally, the authority of qualifying medical schools to participate in loan programs expires after a certain period. The authority of a graduate medical school to participate in loan programs under part D of title IV will expire on the first July 1 following the date of enactment of the Foreign Medical School Accountability Fairness Act of 2017. If a graduate medical school loses eligibility for loan programs under part D of title IV due to enacted amendments, enrolled students can still receive loans until they withdraw, complete their program, or the fourth June 30 after the loss of eligibility."
