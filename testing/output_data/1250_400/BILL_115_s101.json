    "content": "The Act titled \"King Cove Road Land Exchange Act\" finds that the land exchange is in the public interest. The Act defines key terms such as \"Federal land\" as the 206 acres within the Refuge and \"non-Federal land\" as the State-owned 43,093 acres. It also clarifies terms like \"Refuge\" as the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge and \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of the Interior. The Act defines key terms such as \"Refuge\" as the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge in the State of Alaska, \"Road corridor\" as the designated road corridor, \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of the Interior, \"State\" as the State of Alaska, and \"Wilderness\" as the Izembek Wilderness designated by the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. SEC. 4. LAND EXCHANGE REQUIRED. The State can convey non-Federal land to the Secretary in exchange for Federal land. The Federal land will be used for a road corridor and a single-lane gravel road. Valuation and appraisals will ensure equal exchange of land. The Secretary and State will select an appraiser to conduct appraisals of Federal and non-Federal land in accordance with nationally recognized standards. If the final appraised value of Federal land exceeds that of non-Federal land in a land exchange, the values shall be equalized. Equalization in a land exchange involves adjusting the values of Federal and non-Federal land. If the final appraised value of Federal land is higher, additional non-Federal land can be conveyed, a cash payment can be made, or a combination of both methods can be used. Conversely, if the final appraised value of non-Federal land is higher, adjustments need to be made to equalize the values. In a land exchange, if the final appraised value of non-Federal land exceeds that of Federal land, the State can adjust the acreage of non-Federal land to be conveyed. The Secretary may accept a payment exceeding 25% of the value of the Federal land. Upon completion of the exchange, the Wilderness boundary will be modified to exclude Federal land and the non-Federal land will be added to the Wilderness. The land exchange under this section must be completed within 180 days of the enactment of the Act. The Wilderness boundary will be modified to exclude Federal land, and the non-Federal land will be added to the Wilderness and administered according to the Wilderness Act and other applicable laws. The road corridor will follow the southern road alignment described in the final environmental impact statement. Requirements for the road construction will adhere to specified regulations. The land exchange and road construction will not be considered a major federal action under the National Environmental Policy Act."
