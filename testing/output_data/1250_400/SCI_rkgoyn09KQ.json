    "content": "In this work, a neural autoregressive topic model is combined with a LSTM-based language model to address challenges in probabilistic topic modeling. The approach aims to incorporate language structure by considering word order and semantics in a unified framework named ctx-DocNADE. The ctx-DocNADE model combines a topic model and a language model to learn the meaning of word occurrences. It addresses challenges in small training corpora by incorporating external knowledge through a LSTM-based language model, resulting in the ctx-DocNADEe extension. The novel neural autoregressive topic model variants with neural language models consistently outperform state-of-the-art generative topic models in terms of generalization, interpretability, and applicability over long-text. Probabilistic topic models like LDA, RSM, and DocNADE are commonly used for topic extraction from text collections. These models learn latent document representations for NLP tasks but ignore word order and semantic information. To address this limitation, there is a need to extend probabilistic topic models to incorporate word order and language structure. Traditional topic models like LDA and DocNADE do not consider language structure or word order, leading to limitations in topic analysis. Recent advancements, such as LSTM-LM, can capture different language concepts effectively. Recent studies have integrated latent topics with neural language models to improve semantics at a document level. While traditional topic models like LDA and DocNADE lack consideration for language structure and word order, advancements like LSTM-LM can effectively capture different language concepts. The text discusses the limitations of traditional topic models like LDA and DocNADE in capturing long-term dependencies and language concepts. It introduces a neural autoregressive topic model, combining LSTM-LM to account for word ordering, semantics, and global and local contexts. This model aims to accurately predict words by incorporating language structure and capturing long-range dependencies. The proposed neural topic model, named ctx-DocNADE, combines joint word and latent topic learning in a unified framework to incorporate language structure and word order for accurate word prediction. It addresses the challenge of learning from contextual information in short texts and few documents due to limited word co-occurrences and significant word non-overlap. The proposed neural topic model, ctx-DocNADE, incorporates language structure and word order for accurate word prediction in short texts and few documents. Distributional word representations like word embeddings capture semantic and syntactic relatedness, showing impressive performance in NLP tasks. Traditional topic models struggle with short texts due to limited word overlap, but distributed embeddings can infer relatedness between words like \"falls\" and \"drops\". The curr_chunk discusses the incorporation of distributed compositional priors in DocNADE by using pre-trained word embeddings via LSTM-LM to enhance the multinomial topic model for learning latent topics and textual representations in short texts. This approach aims to address the limitations of traditional topic models in inferring relatedness between words in short texts. The curr_chunk introduces the ctx-DocNADEe framework, which combines distributed compositional priors with pre-trained word embeddings via LSTM-LM to improve topic and textual representations in short texts. The approach aims to enhance generalizability, interpretability, and applicability in modeling long and short text documents, outperforming existing generative topic models. The curr_chunk discusses the application of modeling approaches to various datasets, showing improved performance in topic coherence, precision, and text classification. The proposed modeling approaches generate contextualized topic vectors named textTOvec for short-text and long-text documents. The code is available at https://github.com/pgcool/textTOvec. Generative models like RBM and RSM are used to estimate probability distributions of multidimensional data. The curr_chunk discusses modeling approaches like RBM, RSM, NADE, and DocNADE for estimating complex probability distributions of multidimensional data. NADE decomposes binary observations into autoregressive conditional distributions using feed-forward networks, while DocNADE models collections of documents as bags of words, focusing on word representations of underlying topics. DocNADE is a modeling approach that focuses on word representations of underlying topics in collections of documents. It uses autoregressive conditional distributions computed through feed-forward networks to estimate complex probability distributions of multidimensional data. The DocNADE model focuses on word representations of topics in documents, using autoregressive conditional distributions. It proposes extensions like ctx-DocNADE and ctx-DocNADEe to incorporate language structure and external knowledge for modeling short and long texts. These models consider word ordering, syntactical and semantic structures, long and short term dependencies, and external knowledge to overcome limitations of Bag of Words representations. The ctx-DocNADE model enhances DocNADE by incorporating language structure and external knowledge to model documents. It considers word ordering, syntactical and semantic structures, long and short term dependencies, and external knowledge to overcome limitations of Bag of Words representations. The conditional probability in ctx-DocNADE is based on two hidden vectors, utilizing LSTM-based components for word prediction. The weight matrix in DocNADE encodes topic information for hidden features, shared between DocNADE and LSTM-LM components for complementary semantics. The embedding layer in the LSTM-LM component represents column vectors and extends DocNADE by considering word ordering and language concepts. The second version adds distributional priors by initializing the LSTM component with a pre-trained embedding matrix E and weight matrix W. Algorithm 1 and Table 1 compare log p(v) for a document v in Doc-NADE, ctx-DocNADE, and ctx-DocNADEe settings. In DocNADE, weights in matrix W are tied, reducing computational complexity to O(HD). In the deep version, DocNADE and LSTM can be extended to a deep, multiple hidden layer architecture by adding new hidden layers as in a regular deep feed-forward neural network. This allows for improved performance, with the computational complexity being O(HD + N) where N is the total number of edges in the LSTM network. In a deep architecture, DocNADE and LSTM can be extended by adding multiple hidden layers, improving performance. The first hidden layer is computed similarly to DocNADE variants, while subsequent layers are computed differently. The conditional probability is computed using the last layer. The modeling approaches are applied to various datasets for evaluating topic models. We apply modeling approaches to short-text and long-text datasets, evaluating topic models with quantitative measures like perplexity and topic coherence. Baselines include word representation with glove, document representation with doc2vec, and various topic models like ProdLDA and DocNADE. Based on various word and document representation methods, as well as topic models like ProdLDA and DocNADE, experimental setups were conducted to evaluate different models. DocNADE was trained on both reduced vocabulary and full text settings to compare its performance, with all models run over 200 topics to assess the quality of learned representations.
