The President can authorize temporary tax reductions for a specified calendar year to stimulate the economy. The tax amounts set forth in tables will be adjusted to reflect the rate reduction.

Effective for taxable years beginning in the first subsequent calendar year for which the economic growth requirements are satisfied, tax rates will be increased by a certain percentage, except for individuals with Adjusted Gross Income below $50,000 and joint filers below $75,000.

The percentage will be published in the Federal Register before the beginning of the relevant calendar year. SEC. 3.
