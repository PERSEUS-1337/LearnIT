Harbor maintenance plays a critical role in facilitating U.S. foreign trade and reducing trade costs. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is responsible for maintaining federal navigation channels, and decisions on harbor maintenance now have a greater impact on the U.S. economy than in 1986. The current harbor maintenance policy, established in 1986, is being considered for changes by Congress due to the increasing importance of merchandise trade, now accounting for 25% of GDP. The policy is funded by a harbor maintenance tax on imported and domestic waterborne cargo and cruise passengers, with revenue going into the harbor maintenance trust fund for dredging channels and maintaining ports. The fund can only be used with congressional appropriation. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) is funded by a tax on waterborne cargo and cruise passengers, with revenue used for dredging channels and maintaining ports. Congress must appropriate funds from the HMTF, which helps reduce the federal budget deficit. The trust fund balance was $8.5 billion in July 2013, with an expected income of $2.05 billion in FY2014. Bills in Congress aim to increase annual spending on harbor maintenance. In FY2014, the Corps expects the HMTF to receive $2.05 billion in total income. Bills in Congress aim to nearly double annual spending on harbor maintenance, with H.R. 3080 proposing to increase HMTF expenditures every year. This increased spending may impact funding for other Corps activities funded under the Energy and Water Development Appropriations acts. Increasing spending from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) has the potential to reduce funding for other Corps activities like harbor construction or flood control. Congress could offset this by allocating more funds to the energy and water development appropriation, but this would require less funding for activities outside this appropriation to stay within total federal budget caps. The HMTF was established in 1986 to pay for eligible operations and maintenance costs of commercial navigation in harbors and inland harbors in the United States. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) was established in 1986 to fund maintenance costs for commercial navigation in harbors and inland harbors. The definitions of \"inland harbors\" and \"commercial cargo\" have remained unchanged since 1986, with a key distinction being that inland harbors must currently handle cargo. The Corps interprets \"commercial navigation\" as any project authorized by Congress with commercial navigation as a purpose. The Corps interprets \"commercial navigation\" as any project authorized by Congress with commercial navigation as an authorized purpose. Most harbor projects are authorized as \"single-purpose\" commercial navigation projects, with all O&M costs payable from the HMTF. High-use ports, handling over 10 million tons of freight per year, accounted for 90% of maritime commerce and received two-thirds of HMTF spending in FY2013. In FY2013, high-use ports handling over 10 million tons of freight accounted for 90% of maritime commerce and received two-thirds of HMTF spending. Moderate and low-use ports received less funding despite handling smaller amounts of cargo, raising allocation debates in legislation like S. 601 and H.R. 3080. The HMTF debate revolves around the allocation of funds for harbor maintenance. While high-use ports receive the majority of funding, moderate and low-use ports receive less despite handling smaller cargo volumes. Legislation like S. 601 and H.R. 3080 address these allocation debates, with differing views on how funds should be distributed among commercial and non-commercial ports. The HMTF debate focuses on funding allocation for harbor maintenance. S. 601 favors funding large commercial cargo ports, but data shows that 75% of eligible waterways handle little to no cargo. The current volume-based metric for funding allocation benefits ports handling oil, chemicals, grains, ores, and coal. A value-based metric could direct more funds to ports handling higher-value cargo like container ships. The debate over Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) funding allocation focuses on whether to use a volume-based or value-based metric. Currently, the volume-based metric benefits ports handling oil, chemicals, grains, ores, and coal. However, a value-based metric could direct more funds to ports handling higher-value cargo like container ships, potentially concentrating funding on the five largest container ports. District engineers' funding requests for high-use, moderate-use, and low-use ports varied in allocation, with small harbors receiving only one-tenth of the funds requested for the busiest harbors. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund allocation debate revolves around volume-based versus value-based metrics. District engineers' funding requests varied, with small harbors receiving only one-tenth of the funds requested for the busiest harbors. Low-use ports received 10% of requested funds, while the total amount requested for low-use harbors almost matched that of the busiest harbors. The Corps' funding allocation strategy faces challenges in providing safe and efficient operation for all infrastructure. The Corps allocates funding based on financial stresses, leading to partial investments across many facilities. Harbor traffic is more concentrated in top ports, with 90% of ship traffic occurring at the top 35 ports. The Corps may justify concentrating funds on high-use harbors for national economic benefit, but this could hinder the development of moderate-use ports. The Corps maintains over 900 coastal channels and harbors, with many requiring maintenance only once every few years. The Corps maintains over 900 coastal channels and harbors, with many requiring maintenance only once every few years. The Corps is authorized to maintain more than 1,400 coastal navigation projects but actively maintains only 360 of them. Funding levels and maintenance needs are unclear factors in the maintenance of these projects. The Corps' lack of systematic reevaluation of harbor projects' economic justification has led to passive stewardship of resources. Current policies and tools are insufficient for identifying inefficient projects, curtailing maintenance, or disposing of projects. Policy guidance is needed to establish explicit requirements for confirming economic viability and reevaluating projects when necessary. The 2003 Corps study highlighted the need for policy guidance on harbors to confirm economic viability and reevaluate projects when necessary. Many harbor projects were authorized decades ago before modern transportation alternatives were available. Some small harbors are now mainly used for pleasure boats, funded by a cargo tax. Congress has allowed the Corps to divest inland waterways projects no longer needed for commercial cargo. The Corps retains responsibility for maintaining protected channels and small harbors, primarily used by pleasure boats, funded by a cargo tax. Congress has allowed the Corps to divest inland waterways projects not needed for commercial cargo. Recent initiatives prioritize harbor maintenance projects based on commercial importance, using data on tonnage, value, and ship transits for dredging needs. The Corps uses objective criteria to allocate funds for projects, focusing on metrics like tonnage and cost per. The Corps prioritizes harbor maintenance projects based on commercial importance, using metrics like tonnage and cost per ton. Criteria for funding allocation include support for commercial fishing, public safety, infrastructure condition, and legal requirements. However, the large number of criteria raises concerns about the eligibility of harbor navigation projects for priority funding. The Government Accountability Office recommended creating an advisory committee to provide input on national harbor maintenance projects. The 2003 Corps study raised concerns about the eligibility of harbor navigation projects for priority funding due to the large number of criteria. The Government Accountability Office recommended creating an advisory committee to provide input on national harbor maintenance projects, but no such committee has been established. Congress is worried that the Corps' criteria for prioritizing projects are not transparent and may not yield the highest return on investment. The Corps' budget process emphasizes anticipated rather than demonstrated performance, but actual performance does influence budget priority, especially in the navigation program. The Corps' budget process emphasizes anticipated performance, but actual performance influences budget priority, especially in the navigation program. Opportunity cost is a significant metric for distributing O&M funds efficiently to harbors, concerning whether providing maintenance to one harbor results in a loss of greater economic benefits from failing to maintain another harbor. Former Secretary of the Army emphasized the importance of defining problems within a national framework for optimal solutions. Costs of operations and maintenance activities funded from the HMTF vary considerably among ports. The Corps must focus on defining problems within a national framework for optimal solutions, rather than justifying individual projects. Costs of operations and maintenance funded from the HMTF vary among ports, with smaller ports showing higher costs per ton and per vessel. The Corps only maintains federally designated channels, with the HMTF covering 100% of costs for harbors up to 45 feet deep. For deeper harbors, a non-federal sponsor is responsible for 50% of the additional costs. Data on O&M expenses and waterway usage have not been jointly analyzed by the Corps, making it difficult for Congress to access comprehensive information. S. 601 proposes changing the non-federal cost share requirement for O&M, with local cost-sharing only required for channels deeper than 50 feet. New construction costs are not covered by the HMTF and are funded from general government revenues. The federal share of construction costs ranges from 40% to 80% depending on harbor depth. Berths and private side channels are the responsibility of port authorities or terminal owners under current law. S. 601 and H.R. 3080 propose expanding the use of the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) to allow ports with high revenue to use funds for dredging berths and removing contaminated sediments. This would benefit deep ports like Los Angeles and Long Beach, potentially reducing funds allocated to other ports. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) could potentially benefit deep ports like Los Angeles and Long Beach by allowing them to use funds for dredging berths and removing contaminated sediments. There is a wide variation in the amount of HMT generated at harbors, with the top 15 harbors collecting more than 75% of total revenue. This disparity raises concerns about equity and efficiency in allocating funds. The Corps prioritizes O&M funding for harbors of refuge, critical harbors, subsistence harbors, and channels used by passenger ferries. They identified 30 harbors as subsistence or critical to justify funding in FY2011-FY2014. In FY2012-FY2014, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees provided an additional $30 million for maintenance of small, remote, or subsistence harbors. They urged the Corps to revise criteria for funding navigation projects to consider economic impact on local economies and national defense or public safety importance. Projects are funded to develop an equitable allocation, with criteria including economic impact on local and regional economies, especially for national defense or public safety. President Clinton proposed phasing out federal funding for harbors not contributing to the HMTF, suggesting state and local governments take over maintenance. President Reagan had also suggested terminating funding for harbors with high federal maintenance costs. The Reagan Administration proposed refocusing the Corps' role on water projects of national significance, including harbor projects contributing tax revenues to the HMTF. They estimated that terminating funding for harbors with federal maintenance costs exceeding $1 per ton of cargo would save about $150 million annually. The HMT was enacted as a user fee during the Reagan Administration after Congress rejected the original proposal to allow local port authorities to assess fees on ships for harbor maintenance. Debate over maintaining harbors with little commercial cargo dates back to the 1950s, with the Corps' policy not to maintain harbors not extensively used for commercial navigation. In 1954, the House Committee on Appropriations endorsed a policy that the federal government has no obligation to maintain waterways and harbors not extensively used for commercial navigation. A 1956 audit by the General Accounting Office found that the Corps was maintaining channels predominantly used by recreational boaters or a single shipper, contrary to their policy. The GAO recommended that Congress establish specific policies and criteria for determining which navigation projects should be operated and maintained at federal expense. In 2011, 11 coastal navigation projects received $12 million in O&M spending, despite being considered of questionable value. In 2011, GAO recommended that Congress establish specific policies for determining which navigation projects should be federally funded. They identified 11 coastal projects of questionable value, receiving $12 million in O&M spending and generating $1.5 million in revenues. One project, the Okeechobee Waterway in Florida, was recommended for reclassification as a flood-control project due to minimal navigation benefits. Despite this, it continued to receive HMTF funds and handled limited cargo in 2012. Another criticized project, the Anahuac Channel and Trinity River project in Texas, received $17 million in HMTF funds but has seen no recent cargo movement. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) allocated about $30 million in 2012, supporting various projects including the Anahuac Channel and Trinity River project in Texas. Despite receiving funds, no cargo has moved on this waterway recently. Recreational harbors have a positive economic impact, with studies showing that recreational boaters on the Great Lakes and in Oregon contribute significantly to local economies. Recreational boaters do not contribute to the HMTF but pay federal fuel taxes for other boating-related purposes. Recreational boating supports jobs and pays federal fuel taxes for fish habitat restoration, boating safety programs, and infrastructure. Some in the industry support using motorboat fuel taxes for harbor dredging. The Corps is exploring local financing for waterways. Key information on HMTF expenditures is not publicly available. Key information on Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) expenditures is not publicly available, including current expenditure reports, data comparing harbor usage with operation and maintenance expenses, and a channel condition and performance report. The Corps has been requested to issue annual reports on HMTF status since 1992, but the most recent report only covers FY2005 and FY2006. Additionally, the Corps has data on cargo tonnage and vessel usage but lacks alignment between its tonnage and expenditure databases. The Corps tracks O&M expenditures for each facility, but the nomenclature in its tonnage database does not match the expenditure database. They do not compare shipping channel dimensions to authorized dimensions or estimate economic losses from deficiencies. The Corps has the Navigation Economic Technologies Program (NETS) for economic evaluation of navigation projects, focusing more on construction dredging projects. The NETS program focuses on economic analysis of construction dredging projects, rather than on maintaining existing harbors and channels. Congress requested estimates on channel availability and funding needed from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) to increase availability to 95%. The Federal Maritime Commission estimated the average HMT payment for a 40-foot shipping container at $109. The Federal Maritime Commission estimated the average HMT payment for a 40-foot shipping container at $109, which is small compared to cargo value but significant against typical freight charges. Shipping a 40-foot container from Asia to the U.S. Midwest costs around $4,000, with an average value of $117,606. Ports near the Canadian and Mexican borders claim that the HMT diverts cargo to those countries due to the lack of a similar tax. The HMT diverts inbound cargo to Canadian and Mexican ports due to the lack of a similar tax. A 2012 FMC study found that various factors influence shippers to use ports in Canada or Mexico, including risk mitigation and rail rate disparities. If the HMT was removed, shippers could divert 59,000 to 72,500 containers per year from Canadian to U.S. ports. Senators Murray and Cantwell plan to introduce legislation to replace the HMT with a maritime goods movement user fee paid by shippers using ports in Canada and Mexico. The FMC concluded that a maritime goods movement user fee should replace the HMT to reduce incentives for shipping through Canada. The HMT may hinder transshipment of cargo by sea, especially for coastal feeder service. CBP and the Corps estimated that up to $500 million in HMT owed by domestic waterborne shippers goes uncollected annually. The Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) may discourage coastal feeder service and impact the price competitiveness of some U.S. exports. Up to $500 million in HMT owed by domestic waterborne shippers goes uncollected annually. Unlike import duties, the HMT is not refundable, affecting the cost-effectiveness of industrial supply chains. The debate over the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) is ongoing in this context. The debate over WRDA is happening in the context of concerns about the cost-effectiveness of industrial supply chains. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations are worried about the President's budget requests for Corps O&M not being enough to maintain competitiveness in the global marketplace. The U.S. Departments of Transportation and Commerce have launched the Competitive Supply Chain Initiative to strategically improve the nation's marine transportation system and overall national competitiveness. The Department of Commerce aims to enhance the nation's marine transportation system to boost national competitiveness. Supply chain competitiveness impacts product costs and global prices, influencing investment decisions. Collaboration between policymakers, leadership, and academics is crucial to align supply chain and transportation infrastructure with strategic priorities. In 2012, the Corps and the U.S. Department of Transportation signed a memorandum to identify opportunities for improvement. In 2012, the Corps and the U.S. Department of Transportation signed a memorandum to improve transportation infrastructure investments by aligning waterside and landside infrastructure with national priorities. President Obama initiated expedited federal permitting for construction projects at five harbors in response to the Panama Canal expansion. A Task Force on Ports was established in the FY2013 Budget to strategically allocate federal investments based on calls from state and local governments and maritime stakeholders."
