A new technique called neuron editing aims to address this issue by learning how neurons encode transformations in a latent space. This allows for complex transformations with simpler distribution shifts, demonstrated in image domain/style transfer and biological applications. Neuron editing involves transforming data by defining editing transformations on neurons in a latent space. This technique simplifies complex transformations and has been applied to image domain/style transfer and biological applications such as removing batch artifacts and predicting drug synergy. Mathematically modeling treatment effects and interactions with background information can provide a powerful tool for assessing treatment outcomes. The proposed neural network-based method aims to learn a general edit function for treatment effects in a biological setting. Unlike traditional approaches, this method focuses on learning an edit function between pre- and post-treatment data versions, allowing for generalization beyond the training dataset. Neuron editing involves learning an edit function between pre-and post-treatment data versions using an autoencoder neural network. This method aims to extract differences in activation distributions and apply them to generate post-treatment data synthetically. The autoencoder neural network decomposes data into abstract features (neurons) for accurate reconstruction. Neuron editing extracts differences in activation distributions to generate post-treatment data synthetically, encoding complex edits in a lower-dimensional manifold. This technique can be applied to any neural network's latent space but is focused on autoencoders for modeling distribution-to-distribution transformations efficiently. The work leverages the advantages of modeling complex distribution-to-distribution transformations in a lower-dimensional manifold using autoencoders. Editing neurons in the neural network's internal layer allows for context dependence modeling, with some neurons showing drastic changes post-treatment while others encoding background context information remain less edited but still influence the output. Neurons in the internal layer of the neural network show varying levels of editing post-treatment, with some undergoing drastic changes while others encoding background context information remain less edited but still influence the output. Editing in a low-dimensional internal layer allows for editing on a denoised version of the data, avoiding editing noise and focusing on significant dimensions. The assumption is made that internal neurons have semantic consistency across the data. Neuron editing in the hidden layer of an autoencoder retains key dimensions while discarding noise dimensions. This editing process assumes semantic consistency across data manifolds. The autoencoder learns a joint manifold of all given data, demonstrating that neural networks prefer learning patterns over memorizing inputs. Neuron editing extrapolates better than generative models, closely resembling predicted changes on both extrapolated and interpolated data. Neuron editing outperforms generative models by closely resembling predicted changes on both extrapolated and interpolated data. Comparisons with traditional GANs and CycleGANs show the limitations of generative approaches in producing complex variations. Neuron editing is motivated for inference tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in preserving existing data variations. Neuron editing is performed on inference by comparing against a regularized autoencoder that performs internal layer transformations during training. The method is motivated for natural image domain transfer and biological applications like correcting batch effects and predicting combinatorial drug effects. GANs learn a transformation that is piecewise linear with ReLU or leaky ReLU activations. Neuron editing involves applying a piecewise linear transformation to distributions of activations from a learned space, achieved through an encoder/decoder pair trained to map data into high-level features. This method is distinct from GANs, which learn transformations that do not behave comparably on different datasets. Neuron editing involves applying a piecewise linear transformation to distributions of activations from a learned space. The transformation, called NeuronEdit, operates on distributions of activations from different inputs and transforms them based on the difference between the source and target distributions. This function shares similarities with a GAN generator in terms of its properties. The NeuronEdit function operates on distributions of activations from network inputs, transforming them based on the difference between source and target distributions. It shares similarities with a GAN generator but guarantees the same editing results for source and extrapolation distributions. The transformed output is obtained by cascading transformations through the decoder without further training. The NeuronEdit function transforms neuron activations through the decoder without additional training, turning an autoencoder into a generative model. This approach allows for unsupervised modeling of variations in data, providing more information compared to GANs. The NeuronEdit function transforms neuron activations through the decoder without additional training, turning an autoencoder into a generative model. Despite not having real posttransformation data for X, it can model the variation intrinsic to X in an unsupervised manner. GANs are notoriously tricky to train due to issues like oscillating optimization dynamics, uninterpretable losses, and mode collapse where the discriminator struggles to detect differences in variability between real and fake examples. This leads to the generator favoring ellipsoid output instead of the more complex and natural variability of the real data. Neuron editing, similar to word2vec embeddings in natural language processing, learns an unsupervised model of data space using an autoencoder. It isolates the variation in neuron activations between source and target distributions, allowing for generation without the issues faced by GANs. Neuron editing, akin to word2vec embeddings, transforms distributions in a latent space. It compares neuron interference with generating methods like autoencoders, GANs, ResnetGAN, and CycleGAN. The image experiment used convolutional layers with specific filters, while other models used fully connected layers. Training was conducted with minibatches and the adam optimizer. The experiment involved using convolutional layers with specific filters and fully connected layers in different models. Training was done with minibatches and the adam optimizer. A motivational experiment on the CelebA dataset illustrated the limitations of training a generative model to map between images with different attributes like hair color. The experiment illustrated the limitations of training a generative model to change hair color in images. GAN models struggle to successfully model this transformation on out-of-sample data, often generating artifacts. Neuron editing in an autoencoder is suggested as a more stable alternative. Neuron editing in an autoencoder is proposed as a stable alternative to training generative models due to difficulties in training. The complex transformation of changing hair color is decomposed into a simple linear shift in the neuron space. Neuron editing can also be used for batch correction to address differences in observed data caused by technical artifacts. Batch effects in biological experimental data are caused by technical artifacts in the measurement process, leading to different datasets when measuring the same sample multiple times. Addressing batch effects is crucial to prevent wrong conclusions. One method to tackle this issue is by repeatedly measuring a control set of cells with each sample and correcting based on the variation in the control. Neuron editing can be applied to transform samples and compare them without the influence of measurement variations. The dataset investigated in this section comes from a mass cytometry experiment measuring proteins in cells from individuals infected with dengue virus. Control1, Control2, Sample1, and Sample2 have different numbers of observations. Technical artifacts and biological differences create variation between the samples. A batch effect is observed in Control1 with artificially low readings of the protein InfG. The model aims to identify and compensate for this variation without losing other true data. The dataset from a mass cytometry experiment shows variation between samples due to technical artifacts and biological differences. A batch effect is seen in Control1 with low readings of protein InfG. The model aims to compensate for this variation without losing other true biological differences, such as higher values of protein CCR6 in Sample1. GANs fail to capture this biological variation, mapping cells to similar values and potentially distorting comparisons. ResnetGAN also does not address this issue. The ResnetGAN and CycleGAN fail to preserve biological variation in protein levels, leading to distorted comparisons. Neuron editing successfully removes batch effects while maintaining true biological differences. Neuron editing successfully removes batch effects while preserving true biological differences, as shown by accurate global assessments across all dimensions. The transformation from Control1 to Control2 mirrors the transformation applied to Sample1, with intra-sample variation preserved. Neuron editing corrects batch effects in biological data from a combinatorial drug experiment on cells from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The dataset analyzed shows the results of learning to batch correct a sample while preserving true variation. GANs attempt to eliminate all sources of variation partially, while the autoencoder does not move the data at all. Neuron editing corrects batch effects in biological data from a combinatorial drug experiment on cells from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The dataset analyzed involves four treatments on cells, with measurements from mass cytometry on 41 dimensions. Neuron editing accurately models the effects of applying Dasatinib to cells treated with Bez+Das, showing a decrease in p4EBP1 without changes in pSTATS. The effects of applying Dasatinib to cells treated with Bez are accurately modeled by neuron editing, showing a decrease in p4EBP1 without changes in pSTATS. However, the regularized autoencoder and three GAN models do not accurately predict the real combination, introducing vertical shifts and losing original variability within the dataset. Despite residual connections, the ResnetGAN still faces the same issues as other models in mimicking the target distribution. Neuron editing accurately predicts transformation across all dimensions, preserving variation better than GAN models. GANs struggle to replicate target data, generating less variance than real data in almost all dimensions. Neuron editing is a novel approach for generating transformed versions of data based on observed pre-and post-transformation data. It utilizes the encoding learned by the latent layers of an autoencoder to mimic the transformation effects. Neuron editing utilizes the encoding learned by the latent layers of an autoencoder to mimic transformation effects on data. Editing neurons in an internal layer results in realistic transformations of image data and predicts synergistic effects of drug treatments in biological data. Learning edits in a hidden layer allows for interactions with context information during decoding. Future work could involve training parallel encoders with the same decoder or training to generate conditionally."
