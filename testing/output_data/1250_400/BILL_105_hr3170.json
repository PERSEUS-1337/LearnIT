    "content": "Section 1 introduces a new section 1260 in the Internal Revenue Code, which deals with gains from constructive ownership transactions. The new section 1260 in the Internal Revenue Code addresses gains from constructive ownership transactions. It specifies that if a taxpayer has gain from such a transaction that would be long-term capital gain, it will be treated as short-term capital gain if it exceeds the net underlying long-term capital gain. Additionally, there will be an interest charge on deferral of gain recognition if gain is treated as short-term capital gain. If gain is treated as short-term capital gain under section 1260, the taxpayer's tax for the year will increase by interest on underpayments for prior years. This interest is not creditable against the tax increase. The taxpayer's tax increase due to short-term capital gain under section 1260 will not be credited against any increase in tax under a specific paragraph. Financial position refers to any position related to stock, debt instrument, partnership interest, or investment trust interest. Constructive ownership transactions are treated as entered into by the taxpayer. The term 'position' includes interests like futures contracts, short sales, or options. Taxpayers are considered to have entered into constructive ownership transactions if they hold long positions, enter into futures contracts, or engage in other transactions related to the same property.
