    "content": "Most of the funding for HUD comes from annual appropriations by Congress to address housing problems for low-income households. Rental assistance programs like Public Housing, Section 8 Vouchers, and project-based assistance make up a majority of the funding. Block grant programs like HOME and CDBG help finance housing and community development activities for low-income families. FHA insures mortgages for lower-income home buyers and developers of affordable rental buildings. HUD's funding primarily comes from Congress through annual appropriations to address housing issues for low-income households. Rental assistance programs, block grant programs, and specialized grant programs help meet the needs of low-income families and homeless individuals, including those with AIDS. The Federal Housing Administration insures mortgages for lower-income home buyers and developers of affordable rental buildings. Surplus FHA funds have been used to offset HUD's budget costs, with recent emergency supplemental funding providing significant assistance to communities affected by natural disasters. Total enacted appropriations for HUD have increased by 57% in the past nine years, with over $13 billion provided through economic stimulus legislation. Total enacted appropriations for HUD have increased by 57% in the past nine years, with over $13 billion provided through economic stimulus legislation (P.L. 111-5). HUD's budget has seen year-over-year increases of 5% or more each year, with growth of nearly 10% in FY2009 and nearly 12% in FY2010. Adjusting for inflation, the growth in \"real\" funding has been less robust, growing by about 17% over the nine-year period. Most of the growth over the previous nine years has come in the last two years. HUD's budget grew by about 17% in the last two years, with most of the growth coming in the last two years. The components of HUD's annual funding include regular annual appropriations, emergency appropriations, rescissions, and offsets. Congressional appropriators are generally subject to limits on the amount of new non-emergency discretionary funding they can provide. In response to disasters, HUD's funds are provided through emergency supplemental spending bills in addition to regular annual appropriations. Congressional appropriators face limits on new non-emergency discretionary funding, which can be managed through offsets like rescissions and offsetting receipts. Net budget authority for HUD is determined by the interaction between new appropriations and offsets, impacting the total budget each year. The total net budget authority for HUD is determined by the interaction between new appropriations and offsets like rescissions and receipts. This net budget authority is not necessarily the best measure of funding for HUD's programs and activities, as shown by the 57% increase in net non-emergency budget authority from FY2002 to FY2010. This increase is not solely due to increased appropriations for HUD programs. The net non-emergency budget authority for HUD increased by 57% from FY2002 to FY2010, reaching over $46 billion. This growth was not solely due to increased appropriations for HUD programs, as regular annual appropriations only grew by 37% during this period. Decreases in offsetting receipts and collections, as well as rescissions, also contributed to the overall increase in budget authority. The 37% growth in regular appropriations for HUD from FY2002 to FY2010 is mainly due to increases in Section 8 voucher and project-based rental assistance programs. These programs accounted for about 57% of HUD's regular appropriations in FY2010. Funding for other HUD programs also began to grow in FY2009 and FY2010. The decline in offsetting receipts is largely due to decreases in receipts from FHA mortgage insurance programs. In FY2009 and FY2010, funding for other HUD programs began to grow as well, while Section 8 funding increased. The decline in offsetting receipts, mainly from FHA mortgage insurance programs, decreased from over $3 billion in FY2004 to under $0.5 billion in FY2010. The annual appropriations process starts with the President's budget request, followed by hearings and crafting of appropriations legislation by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. Continuing resolutions are enacted if appropriations action is not completed before the fiscal year ends on September 30. The appropriations process for FY2011 began with the President's budget release on February 1, 2010, and ended with the signing of P.L. 112-10 on April 15, 2011. Congress often enacts short-term continuing resolutions to avoid a government funding lapse when appropriations are not completed by September 30. The President's FY2011 budget requested about $45.6 billion in net new budget authority for HUD, a decrease of about 1% from FY2010. The President's FY2011 budget requested $45.6 billion in net new budget authority for HUD, a 1% decrease from FY2010. Despite the decrease, there was a 3% increase in appropriations for HUD programs. Funding increases were proposed for Section 8 programs, homeless programs, and HUD's research needs, while funding decreased for programs for the elderly, disabled, and public housing repairs. The President's budget for FY2011 requested funding increases for Section 8 programs, homeless programs, and HUD's research needs, while proposing decreased funding for programs for the elderly, disabled, and public housing repairs. The House-approved HUD funding bill for FY2011 rejected the President's proposed cuts and included a 1% increase in net new budget authority over FY2010. The Senate bill for FY2011 HUD funding rejected proposed cuts to housing programs for the elderly and disabled, public housing capital funding, and the brownfields program. It also included funding for the President's Transforming Rental Assistance initiative and Choice Neighborhoods. The Senate bill for FY2011 HUD funding rejected cuts to housing programs for the elderly and disabled, public housing capital funding, and the brownfields program. It included funding for the President's Transforming Rental Assistance initiative and Choice Neighborhoods. The 111th Congress enacted a series of continuing resolutions to fund at FY2010 levels due to the lack of appropriations legislation before the fiscal year began. The 111th Congress enacted a series of continuing resolutions to fund at FY2010 levels due to the lack of appropriations legislation before the fiscal year began. The latest CR extended funding through December 18, 2010, and December 21, 2010, with the final CR expiring on March 4, 2011. The House approved a year-long continuing resolution (H.R. 1) to fund the federal government through FY2011, which would have provided about $5 billion less in aggregate appropriations (11%) for HUD programs compared to FY2010. H.R. 1 proposed $5 billion less in appropriations for HUD programs compared to FY2010. The Senate Amendment to H.R. 1 would have increased funding for HUD by nearly $6 billion without rescinding any FY2010 funding. The 112th Congress approved a short-term CR to fund the government through March 18, 2011, with funding reductions for some accounts, including HUD's Community Development Fund (CDF) account. The CDF was funded at a level $195 million lower than FY2010, equivalent to the amount provided for congressional earmarks in FY2010. The CDF was funded at a reduced level under H.J.Res. 44, with further funding cuts in subsequent short-term CRs. The final FY2011 funding bill, P.L. 112-10, specified no CDF funds for earmarks and reduced funding for public housing. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act of 2011 (P.L. 112-10) provided year-long FY2011 appropriations for HUD and other government agencies. It funded some HUD programs at FY2010 levels, reduced funding for some programs, and increased funding for Section 8 programs. The law included an across-the-board 0.2% rescission from non-defense discretionary accounts, resulting in a decrease of about 11% in net new budget authority for HUD. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act of 2011 (P.L. 112-10) provided year-long FY2011 appropriations for HUD and other government agencies. It funded some HUD programs at FY2010 levels, reduced funding for some programs, and increased funding for Section 8 programs. The law included an across-the-board 0.2% rescission from non-defense discretionary accounts, resulting in a decrease of about 11% in net new budget authority for HUD. The law provided an estimated $41.1 billion in net new budget authority for HUD, a decrease of about 11% from the FY2010 enacted level. The requested decrease in net new budget authority would only represent a 4% decrease in appropriations for HUD programs in aggregate, due to a substantial increase in offsetting collections and receipts from the FHA mortgage insurance programs. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insures mortgage loans made by private lenders to eligible borrowers, making mortgage credit more widely available and at a lower cost. The FHA home loan insurance programs are primarily administered through two accounts in the HUD budget: the Mutual Mortgage Insurance/Cooperative Management Housing Insurance Fund account (MMI/CMHI) and the General Insurance/Special Risk Insurance Fund account (GI/SRI). The MMI Fund is the largest and covers single-family home loans, including the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) program. The GI/SRI Fund provides insurance for riskier mortgages, multifamily rental housing, and special-purpose loans. The issues discussed apply to single-family loans insured under the MMI Fund. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA) determines the cost of federal loan insurance based on the net present value of expected cash flows. For the MMI Fund, cash inflows come from insurance premiums, while outflows are payments for loan defaults. The subsidy rate, expressed as a percentage of insured loans, reflects the net value of these cash flows. If inflows exceed outflows, the subsidy rate is negative. The subsidy rate is determined by the net value of cash flows from insurance premiums and payments for loan defaults. It is expressed as a percentage of insured loans. A negative subsidy rate indicates that cash inflows exceed outflows, while a positive rate indicates the opposite. Agencies must appropriate the credit subsidy in the budget year loans are originated, but actual cash flows may differ over time. The MMI Fund historically has had a negative subsidy rate, generating negative credit subsidy to offset costs. The MMI Fund historically has a negative subsidy rate, generating negative credit subsidy to offset costs. Agencies periodically revise initial subsidy estimates based on actual loan experience. The Fund is divided into Purchase and Refinance risk category and HECM risk category. The Purchase and Refinance category had a negative subsidy rate of -2.59% for FY2011, higher than the -0.62% estimated for FY2010. The MMI Fund is divided into Purchase and Refinance risk category and HECM risk category. The Purchase and Refinance category had a negative subsidy rate of -2.59% for FY2011, generating about $5.8 billion in negative credit subsidy. Proposed FHA reforms may contribute to the increase in negative credit subsidy. The Congressional Budget Office projected a smaller negative credit subsidy of around $1.9 billion for the Purchase and Refinance category. The Congressional Budget Office projected that the MMI Purchase and Refinance risk category would generate a smaller negative credit subsidy of around $1.9 billion, including $960 million without proposed changes and an additional $902 million with HUD-proposed reforms. Despite lower projections than the Administration's, CBO still anticipated this category to be profitable in FY2011, not requiring a positive credit subsidy. FHA's estimates were revised upward due to increased annual premiums in April 2011. FHA's estimates of FY2011 negative credit subsidy were revised upward due to increased annual premiums in April 2011. The President's FY2012 budget request indicated a -3.92% subsidy rate for the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund's Purchase and Refinance risk category for FY2011. Estimates of offsetting receipts for this category increased to nearly $10 billion by the time the FY2012 budget was released. CBO also increased its estimate of FHA receipts for FY2011 by over $1 billion. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 moved the HECM program into the MMI fund, with a positive credit subsidy of 0.83%. HUD proposed changes to the HECM program in FY2011 to reduce the need for positive credit subsidies, including increasing annual insurance premiums and adjusting the loan size formula. HUD proposed changes to the HECM program in FY2011, including increasing annual insurance premiums to 1.25% of the loan balance and adjusting the loan size formula to result in smaller loans for borrowers. Legislation aimed to reduce credit subsidies for HECMs, with H.R. 5850 providing $140 million and S. 3644 providing $150 million, less than the Administration's estimates. The FY2012 appropriations law directed HUD to make adjustments to the program to achieve a zero credit subsidy. The demand for FHA-insured mortgages has been increasing, with FHA insuring 18.7% of new single-family mortgages in FY2009, up from about 2% in FY2006, leading to higher mortgage insurance premiums paid into the MMI Fund. The demand for FHA-insured mortgages has been increasing in recent years, with FHA insuring 18.7% of new single-family mortgages in FY2009, up from about 2% in FY2006. The growing volume of new mortgages insured by FHA means higher mortgage insurance premiums paid into the MMI Fund. Despite newer mortgages having better credit quality, the default rate on past FHA-insured loans is still rising, putting strain on the MMI Fund. Congress mandated that the MMI Fund must have a capital reserve ratio of at least 2%, but during FY2009, the ratio was only 0.53%. The MMI Fund must maintain a capital reserve ratio of at least 2% to cover unexpected losses. In FY2009, the ratio fell to 0.53%, prompting proposed changes to FHA's mortgage insurance programs, including increasing annual premiums. Congressional action is required for some changes. The FHA increased annual mortgage insurance premiums after the enactment of P.L. 111-229 in 2010. The maximum annual insurance premium amounts were set at 1.5% for borrowers with downpayments greater than 5% and 1.55% for borrowers with downpayments of 5% or less. Additionally, the upfront premium charged by FHA was raised to 2.25% for loans endorsed on or after April 5, 2010. FHA raised the upfront mortgage insurance premium to 2.25% for loans endorsed on or after April 5, 2010, and later lowered it to 1% for loans endorsed on or after October 1, 2010. Borrowers with credit scores between 500 and 579 were required to provide a downpayment of at least 10%, while those with credit scores of 580 or above had a minimum downpayment requirement of 3.5%. FHA proposes changes to downpayment and credit score requirements, including a 10% downpayment for credit scores between 500-579 and 3.5% for scores of 580 and above. Seller concessions may be reduced from 6% to 3%. Increased oversight of FHA-approved lenders is also planned. FHA plans to increase oversight of FHA-approved lenders and enforce requirements. They may make administrative changes and seek additional authority from Congress. The FHA Reform Act of 2010 (H.R. 5072) aimed to grant FHA more enforcement powers, including requiring lenders to indemnify FHA for non-compliant mortgages and fraud cases. The bill also proposed establishing a Deputy Assistant Secretary for Risk Management and Regulatory Affairs within FHA. The FHA Reform Act of 2010 aimed to grant FHA more enforcement powers, including establishing a Deputy Assistant Secretary for Risk Management and Regulatory Affairs. This would abolish the current position of FHA chief risk officer and allow FHA to contract with outside credit risk analysis sources. HUD provides capital grants and rental assistance through the Section 202 and Section 811 programs for elderly and disabled residents. Supportive services are optional for Section 202 housing but mandatory for Section 811 housing. HUD has funded over 106,000 units of Section 202 housing and over 30,000 units of Section 811 housing. HUD provides capital grants and rental assistance through the Section 202 and Section 811 programs for elderly and disabled residents. While supportive services are optional for Section 202 housing, they are mandatory for Section 811 housing. The President's proposal for FY2011 suggested reducing funding for both programs, with Section 202 and related programs funded at $274 million and Section 811 program funded at $90 million. This would have resulted in a significant decrease compared to previous years. The House-passed appropriations bill (H.R. 5850) and the Senate committee-passed bill (S. 3644) did not follow the President's recommendations to redesign the programs or stop producing new units. Both bills maintained the same funding level for Section 202 at $825 million, while the Section 811 program received $300 million in H.R. 5850 and $200 million in S. 3644. The difference in funding levels was due to the treatment of Section 811 vouchers, with both bills moving funding for voucher renewals to the Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance account. In FY2011, funding for Section 811 vouchers was split between the Section 811 and Section 8 tenant-based accounts. $67 million was allocated for Section 811 voucher renewals, $20 million less than in FY2010. Congress appropriated $150 million for the Section 811 program. In FY2011, $67 million was allocated for Section 811 voucher renewals, $20 million less than in FY2010. Additionally, approximately $89 million was provided for Service Coordinators and $39 million for the Assisted Living Conversion program within the funds appropriated for Section 202. The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program, the largest assistance program administered by HUD, is funded through the tenant-based rental assistance account, supporting almost 2.3 million vouchers used by families for housing subsidies. The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program is funded through the tenant-based rental assistance account, supporting almost 2.3 million vouchers used by families for housing subsidies. The account also covers administrative costs for Public Housing Authorities. Funding debates focus on whether allocated funds are sufficient for all vouchers in use and if they will be allocated efficiently. In FY2010, Congress provided over $16 billion for voucher renewals. In FY2010, Congress provided over $16 billion for voucher renewals, with debates focusing on funding efficiency and allocation for PHAs to serve families while containing costs. PHAs were not provided enough funding to cover all vouchers in use, only those being utilized in FY2009. In FY2010, PHAs had about 94% of their vouchers under lease, leading to insufficient funding in FY2010 to cover all vouchers. The President's FY2011 budget requested $17 billion for voucher renewals, aiming to fund 95% of all vouchers and allocate funding based on prior costs and utilization, with the authority to reallocate funds to PHAs with lower reserves to increase utilization and serve more families. The President's FY2011 budget requested the Secretary be given authority to reallocate funding to PHAs with lower reserves to increase utilization and serve more families. The budget also requested Congress to lift the ban on \"over-leasing\" to facilitate additional increases in leasing. The House bill included $150 million less for renewals than the amount requested in the President's budget. The House bill included $150 million less for renewals than the amount requested in the President's budget. The committee report indicated that the funding in H.R. 5850 would be sufficient to meet the renewal needs of the program and reiterated support for funding all vouchers in use. The bill did not include the reallocation authority requested by the President, as the committee believes the program is due for major authorization changes outside of the Appropriations Committee's jurisdiction. The committee report states that the bill would change the funding formula for PHA funding to reflect the program's needs. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 would fund renewals at less than the President's request, citing revised estimates of need. The Senate bill did not include the reallocation authority requested by the President, citing concerns about potential cost increases. The Senate bill, like the House bill, did not include the reallocation authority requested by the President. Concerns were raised about potential cost increases and the management of costs in the program. Both bills included less funding for renewals than requested by the President but more than in FY2010. The President's budget requested funding renewal of mainstream vouchers for persons with disabilities in the Section 8 account. Both House and Senate bills proposed adopting this request, with H.R. 1 not explicitly including funding in the tenant-based rental. HUD requested Congress to fund the renewal of mainstream vouchers for persons with disabilities in the Section 8 account with $114 million in FY2011. The final FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) allocated less than requested for Section 811 renewals, directing funds to renew vouchers issued since 2007. Each Public Housing Authority (PHA) has a contract with HUD for authorized vouchers, totaling around 2.3 million. Congress can create additional vouchers, including replacement and new vouchers. In recent years, Congress has allocated around 2.3 million authorized vouchers to Public Housing Authorities (PHAs). Additional vouchers, including replacement and new vouchers, are sometimes created by Congress. These new vouchers have been designated for specific special populations or purposes, such as families in the child welfare system and homeless veterans. Funding has been allocated for various voucher programs, including supportive housing for at-risk families and individuals, homeless veterans through the VASH program, and families displaced by hurricanes. The 111th Congress allocated funding for homelessness demonstration, $75 million for VASH vouchers for homeless veterans, and $66 million for families displaced by hurricanes. The Senate bill also included $16 million for the Family Unification Program. H.R. 1 did not provide funding for new incremental vouchers, but the final FY2011 appropriations law allocated about $50 million for VASH vouchers. The project-based rental assistance account funds existing project-based Section 8 rental assistance contracts between HUD and private property owners. The project-based rental assistance account provides funding to administer and renew existing project-based Section 8 rental assistance contracts between HUD and private multifamily property owners. Congress funded the contracts for 20- to 40-year periods, but new annual appropriations are needed once contracts expire. In FY2011, the President requested over $9 billion for the project-based rental assistance account. In FY2011, the President requested over $9 billion for the project-based rental assistance account to maintain subsidies and provide funding for existing contracts. HUD indicated that an estimated $662 million would be needed for amendment funding. Both the House and Senate bills proposed to adopt the President's funding level. In FY2011, the President requested funding for a new \"Transforming Rental Assistance\" initiative to streamline HUD's rental assistance programs and increase residential mobility options for tenants. The proposed budget included $350 million for this initiative, aimed at transferring HUD-assisted housing units to a new form of project-based rental assistance with tenant mobility features. The final FY2011 appropriations law provided less funding than the President's request for this initiative. The President's budget proposes funding to transfer HUD-assisted housing units to a new form of project-based rental assistance with tenant mobility. This new assistance will allow families to take their subsidies with them if they move to private market housing. The goal is to transfer 300,000 units, targeting public housing properties owned by local PHAs, public and multifamily housing properties owned by PHAs willing to combine administrative activities, and multifamily properties with old forms of rental assistance. The President's budget proposes funding to transfer HUD-assisted housing units to a new form of project-based rental assistance with tenant mobility. This new assistance aims to transfer 300,000 units, targeting public housing properties owned by local PHAs, public and multifamily housing properties owned by PHAs willing to combine administrative activities, and multifamily properties with old forms of rental assistance. Most of the funding requested would be used to cover the difference in subsidy costs for each unit under the new program, with additional funds allocated for combining PHA activities, landlord outreach, tenant mobility promotion, technical assistance, and program evaluation. The President's budget proposes funding for a new project-based rental assistance program to transfer 300,000 housing units. The funding includes subsidies, landlord outreach, tenant mobility promotion, technical assistance, and program evaluation. However, the proposed legislation did not receive funding approval due to concerns about unknown future costs. The Transforming Rental Assistance initiative lacks funding in H.R. 1 or the final FY2011 appropriations law. The public housing program, established in 1937, offers rental units for low-income families. Congress supports over 3,100 PHAs with funds for maintenance and modernization. HOPE VI aids in redeveloping distressed public housing. The President's FY2011 budget sought increased funding for public housing operations. HUD provides funding through the capital fund to PHAs for large projects and modernization. HOPE VI is a grant program for demolishing and redeveloping distressed public housing. The President's FY2011 budget requested increased funding for the Public Housing operating fund and decreased funding for the capital fund. The decrease in the capital fund considers the previous capital funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Fully funding the operating fund would allow more capital funds to be used for capital needs. The FY2011 funding law (P.L. 112-10) funded the capital fund higher than H.R. 1 but less than FY2010, and funded the operating fund at about $10 million less than H.R. 1. The reduced appropriations for the operating fund may be due to the transfer of up to 20% of capital funding to cover operating expenses. The final FY2011 funding law (P.L. 112-10) funded the public housing capital fund higher than H.R. 1 but lower than FY2010, and the operating fund slightly less than H.R. 1. The President's FY2012 budget proposed a mandatory offset of PHA reserves to cover reduced appropriations for the operating fund. Additionally, the budget requested $250 million for the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative, a new proposal to revitalize distressed neighborhoods beyond public housing. The Choice Neighborhood Initiative, modeled after the HOPE VI program, offers competitive grants to revitalize distressed neighborhoods, not limited to public housing. Eligible entities include PHAs, local governments, nonprofits, and for-profit developers. The funding aims at transforming, rehabilitating, and replacing HUD public and assisted housing. In FY2010, Congress allocated $200 million to HOPE VI, with $65 million set aside for Choice Neighborhoods. In FY2011, the House proposed $200 million for HOPE VI, while the Senate proposed $250 million for Choice Neighborhoods. HUD also circulated draft legislation for the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative. In FY2011, Congress had differing funding positions for HOPE VI and Choice Neighborhoods. H.R. 5850 proposed $200 million for HOPE VI, while S. 3644 suggested $250 million for Choice Neighborhoods. The House Financial Services Committee discussed the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative, and H.R. 5814 included authorization for it. The final FY2011 funding law allocated nearly $100 million for HOPE VI, with a $65 million set-aside from FY2010. This may result in most HOPE VI funding being used for Choice Neighborhoods. The Housing Trust Fund was established in 2008 to provide housing assistance. The Housing Trust Fund, established in 2008, aims to provide a dedicated source of funding for affordable housing. However, contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were suspended in 2008, leaving the fund without a source of funding. The Housing Trust Fund's funding from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was suspended in 2008, leaving the fund without a source of funding. Despite requests for funding in the FY2010 and FY2011 budgets, Congress did not provide any funding for the Housing Trust Fund. The Housing Trust Fund did not receive funding from Congress in FY2010 and FY2011. The Transformation Initiative, proposed in President Obama's FY2010 budget, aims to strengthen HUD's research and technological capacities. Funding for the initiative includes appropriations for reducing mortgage fraud and the Secretary's authority to transfer funds from HUD's budget. The funding request for the initiative involves appropriations for reducing mortgage fraud and the Secretary's authority to transfer funds from HUD's budget. In FY2010, Congress provided $20 million for addressing mortgage fraud and authorized a 1% transfer authority, resulting in a fund of $239 million. In FY2011, the President requested $20 million for combating mortgage fraud and a 1% transfer authority, which could have resulted in a fund of almost $470 million. The House and Senate bills proposed limits on the department's discretion regarding fund allocation for combating mortgage fraud and transfer authority. The Transformation Initiative funds were restricted to core Department needs, with emphasis on oversight of funding. The Committee limited the use of Transformation Initiative funds to core Department needs, emphasizing oversight. The final FY2011 appropriations law included $71 million for new FHA and Section 8 voucher computer systems, with transfer authority granted to HUD. The final FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) allocated $71 million for updating FHA and Section 8 voucher computer systems, with transfer authority granted to HUD. The Administration's budget for FY2011 included community development initiatives to transform CDBG and related programs, maintaining funding for CDBG at FY2010 levels while eliminating funding for certain programs and earmarks. Additionally, new initiatives such as Catalytic Competition Grants and the Capacity Building Clearinghouse were requested. The Administration's FY2011 budget proposed changes to community development funding, including defunding earmarks like the Neighborhood Initiative and Economic Development Initiative to allocate funds to new initiatives like Catalytic Competition Grants and the Sustainable Communities Initiative. Overall, there was a reduction in funding for Community Development Fund activities from $4.450 billion to $4.380 billion. The Administration's FY2011 budget proposed defunding earmarks like the Neighborhood Initiative and Economic Development Initiative to allocate funds to new initiatives like Catalytic Competition Grants and the Sustainable Communities Initiative. The House bill recommended a $4.382 billion appropriation for Community Development Fund activities, including $89.3 million for congressional earmarked funds for EDI and NI projects. The Senate Appropriations Committee bill recommended a $4.450 billion appropriation for CDF activities. The final FY2011 appropriations law, P.L. 112-10, appropriated $3.501 billion for the CDF account, which is 21.2% less than the previous year's funding and 20.1% less than requested by the Administration for FY2011. The final FY2011 appropriations law, P.L. 112-10, allocated $3.501 billion for the CDF account, a 21.2% decrease from the previous year and 20.1% less than the Administration's FY2011 request. Funding for CDBG formula grants was reduced by 16.4%, and the SCI program saw a 33% cut. The act did not fund the BEDI program, and the CDF supports various community development programs, including CDBG, EDI, and NI. The CDF has funded community development programs like EDI and NI in the past. The CDBG program, authorized under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, is a major federal source for neighborhood revitalization and economic development. In 2010, CDBG funds were awarded to various communities and states. The program can be used for activities benefiting low- and moderate-income individuals, addressing slums or blight, or public health and safety threats. The Administration proposed freezing CDBG funding at over $3.9 billion for FY2011. The CDBG program, authorized in 1974, provides funding for community development to assist low- and moderate-income individuals, address slums or blight, and public health threats. The Administration proposed freezing funding at over $3.9 billion for FY2011. H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 proposed modestly higher funding levels. The House passed H.R. 1, reducing CDF funding by 66.3% below FY2010 levels. The House passed H.R. 1, which would have significantly reduced funding for the CDF account below the FY2010 levels. It did not provide clear instructions on fund allocation among the components of the CDBG program. The final FY2011 appropriations law allocated $3.508 billion for activities in the CDF account, with $3.343 billion for CDBG formula funds. A 0.2% mandatory cut reduced the CDF account by $7 million, and a 1% discretionary transfer moved $35 million to HUD's Transformation Initiative. The Administration requested $148.5 million for a new economic development initiative in distressed areas. The Administration requested $148.5 million for a new initiative supporting economic development projects in distressed areas through the proposed Catalytic Competition Grants Program (CCGs). Unlike CDBG funds, CCG program funds would be awarded competitively to various entities for green infrastructure projects, economic recovery, transit-oriented development, small business support, and administrative costs. The Administration requested $148.5 million for the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) to fund various projects such as green infrastructure, economic recovery, transit-oriented development, small business support, and administrative costs.
