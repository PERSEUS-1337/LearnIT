There are three formal methods Congress can use to combat noncompliance: inherent contempt power, criminal contempt statute, and civil enforcement. The three formal methods Congress can use to combat noncompliance with a congressional subpoena are inherent contempt power, criminal contempt statute, and civil enforcement through the judicial branch. Inherent contempt allows Congress to detain a contemnor until compliance is met, criminal contempt permits certification for prosecution, and civil enforcement seeks a court judgment for compliance. Congress may seek a civil judgment from a federal court to enforce compliance with a congressional subpoena, especially for executive branch officials. This report explores Congress's contempt power, including inherent contempt, criminal contempt, and civil enforcement procedures. It also discusses the challenges Congress faces in enforcing contempt actions against executive branch officials. The power of Congress to punish for contempt is closely tied to its investigative authority, which is broad and essential to its legislative function. The Supreme Court has affirmed Congress's authority to seek and enforce information, as seen in rulings like McGrain v. Daugherty arising from the Teapot Dome scandal in the 1920s. This power includes the ability to conduct oversight and investigations, even without specific constitutional or statutory provisions. The Supreme Court established broad legislative authority to seek and enforce informational demands in rulings related to the Teapot Dome scandal. In McGrain v. Daugherty, the Court described the power of inquiry as essential for effective legislation, emphasizing the need for compulsion to obtain accurate information. The power of inquiry with enforcing process is essential for effective legislation, as seen in the McGrain v. Daugherty case. The Constitution allows for compulsion to obtain accurate information, as demonstrated in the Sinclair v. United States case where a witness was convicted for contempt of Congress for refusing to answer questions. The Supreme Court upheld a witness's conviction for contempt of Congress in a lawsuit between the government and Mammoth Oil Company. The Court rejected the witness's argument that pending lawsuits justified withholding information, affirming Congress's authority to require disclosures for its own investigations. Subsequent rulings have consistently upheld Congress's broad investigative powers. The Supreme Court has consistently upheld Congress's broad investigative powers, stating that its authority to require disclosures for its own investigations is not limited by pending lawsuits. Congress's power of inquiry is described as broad and inherent in the legislative process, encompassing inquiries into existing laws and potential statutes, with a peak focus on waste, fraud, abuse, or maladministration. The Supreme Court has affirmed Congress's broad investigative powers, emphasizing its authority to inquire into existing laws and potential statutes, particularly focusing on waste, fraud, abuse, or maladministration within government departments. Congress's inherent contempt power, necessary for effective investigation and legislation, allows for probing corruption, inefficiency, or waste in the Executive Branch. The Supreme Court recognizes Congress's power to investigate corruption in the Executive Branch. Congress's inherent contempt power allows for individuals to be tried and imprisoned if they fail to comply with inquiries. The House has the power to imprison witnesses for contempt until they comply with inquiries, as seen in the case of Anderson v. Dunn in 1818. The Speaker ordered the arrest of Anderson for attempting to bribe a Member of the House, provided him with counsel and defense witnesses, and found him guilty of contempt. The House has the power to imprison witnesses for contempt until they comply with inquiries, as seen in the case of Anderson v. Dunn in 1818. Anderson was granted counsel, defense witnesses, and a copy of the accusatory letter before being found guilty of contempt and reprimanded by the Speaker. The process included attachment by the Sergeant-at-Arms, a hearing with provision for charges, identification of the accuser, compulsory process, counsel, and determination of guilt. Judicial review through a writ of habeas corpus could be sought to ensure compliance with due process standards. In a habeas corpus proceeding, the court decides if the House or Senate acted within its jurisdiction and if contempt proceedings followed due process standards. While not all procedural rights are required, notice and an opportunity to be heard must be given. The court may impose fines instead of incarceration to avoid habeas corpus challenges. Congress can argue for fines based on its authority to punish contemptuous behavior. The imposition of monetary fines as an alternative to incarceration for contemptuous behavior could be argued based on Congress's authority. This approach may avoid habeas corpus challenges, as fines could be seen as a less restrictive punishment. The 1821 Supreme Court decision in Anderson suggests that imprisonment is the least possible power adequate for the end proposed, with other penalties being mere alternatives to confinement. The power of imprisonment is the least possible power adequate for the end proposed, with other penalties being mere alternatives to confinement. While Congress may have the authority to impose fines as punishment for contempt, there is no precedent for this action. The House or Senate can conduct inherent contempt proceedings independently, without needing help from other branches. While fines for contempt of Congress have no precedent, imprisonment is a possible outcome, but it cannot extend beyond the current session of Congress. The inherent contempt process allows Congress to conduct proceedings independently, with the possibility of fines or imprisonment. However, imprisonment cannot extend beyond the current session of Congress. The process has been criticized as outdated and ineffective, leading to its disuse since 1935. One suggestion to streamline the process is to have initial fact-finding done by a special committee before a final decision is made by the full House or Senate. In the past, inherent contempt actions were conducted by the House and Senate, resulting in punishment or compliance. However, the process was seen as time-consuming and limited in effectiveness. In 1857, a statutory criminal contempt procedure was established, allowing for judicial trial by a United States Attorney. In 1857, a statutory criminal contempt procedure was enacted as an alternative to the inherent contempt procedure conducted by the House and Senate. This allowed for judicial trial by a United States Attorney, with most contempt proceedings still being handled at the bar of the house rather than through criminal contempt methods. The criminal contempt method allows for prosecution of witnesses who fail to testify or produce documents, with penalties including a fine of up to $100,000 and imprisonment for up to one year. The procedure outlined in 2 U.S.C. Section 194 involves committee approval, reading the report on the floor, and House approval of a resolution authorizing prosecution by the U.S. Attorney. The criminal contempt procedure outlined in Section 194 involves committee approval, reading the report on the floor, and House approval for prosecution by the U.S. Attorney. It is punitive in nature, used to punish uncooperative witnesses and deter others from similar conduct. Once a witness is voted in contempt, they lack an incentive to cooperate with the committee. Once a witness has been voted in contempt by the committee and the House or Senate, they will not be able to purge themselves by testifying or supplying subpoenaed documents. The U.S. Attorney is duty-bound to bring the contempt matter before the grand jury for its action, but it is unclear whether this duty is mandatory or discretionary. In some cases, compliance with subpoenas after contempt citations have been voted may result in the House not pursuing further proceedings. In Ex parte Frankfeld, the District Court for the District of Columbia granted petitions for writs of habeas corpus sought by two witnesses before the House Committee on Un-American Activities. The court ordered the witnesses released since the mandatory procedure had not been followed. Congress intended to leave no measure of discretion to either the Speaker of the House or the President of the Senate in such cases. The committee must report facts to the House or Senate, and the Speaker or President must certify the facts to the district attorney. Congress intended for this process to be mandatory, with no discretion for the Speaker, President, or district attorney. The district attorney is required to submit the facts to the grand jury. In previous cases, it was observed that the U.S. Attorney must bring the contempt citation before the grand jury. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit concluded that the duty of the Speaker to certify contempt citations to the U.S. Attorney is discretionary, not mandatory, based on legislative history and congressional practice. When Congress is not in session, the Speaker or President of the Senate reviews contempt citations, which may be inherently discretionary. In Wilson v. United States, defendants' convictions were reversed due to the Speaker certifying contempt citations without approval. In cases where Congress is not in session, the review of a committee's contempt citation is done by the Speaker or President of the Senate, which may involve discretionary decisions. The U.S. Court of Appeals has ruled that the duty of the Speaker to certify contempt citations is discretionary, not mandatory. This discretion extends to the U.S. Attorney's function as well, despite the use of mandatory language in the statute. If inherent or criminal contempt is not an option, Congress can seek enforcement of a subpoena through the judicial branch. This involves filing a civil suit in federal district court to compel compliance with congressional subpoenas. Congress may appeal to the judicial branch to enforce a congressional subpoena through civil enforcement, involving filing a suit in federal court. The Senate has statutory authority for civil enforcement, while the House has pursued it through an authorizing resolution. In 1978, Congress enacted a civil enforcement procedure applicable only to the Senate, giving the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia jurisdiction over such actions. In 1978, Congress enacted a civil enforcement procedure applicable only to the Senate, allowing the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia jurisdiction over actions to enforce, secure a declaratory judgment, or prevent non-compliance with Senate subpoenas. The Senate may choose to seek compliance directly or first seek a declaratory judgment before court enforcement. The Senate has the option to seek compliance with a subpoena or obtain a declaratory judgment before court enforcement. The court's jurisdiction is limited to reviewing the validity of the subpoena, and it cannot enjoin the congressional proceeding. If the court orders compliance and the individual refuses, they may face contempt of court proceedings. The court's jurisdiction is limited to reviewing the validity of the subpoena and cannot enjoin the congressional proceeding. If the court orders compliance and the individual refuses, they may face contempt of court proceedings. Civil enforcement has limitations, especially when dealing with federal government officers or employees. The House of Representatives may authorize a committee to seek civil enforcement to force compliance with a subpoena, as seen in the 2008 case involving former White House Counsel Harriet Miers. The House may authorize a committee to seek civil enforcement action to force compliance with a subpoena. In 2008, a dispute arose over former White House Counsel Harriet Miers' refusal to testify in a House Judiciary Committee investigation. This marked the first attempt by Congress to seek civil enforcement of a subpoena in federal court solely through a resolution of a single house. The federal courts' jurisdiction over such claims was previously unresolved, but a court decision in Committee on the Judiciary v. Miers established that the statutory basis is sufficient for jurisdiction if authorized by a house of Congress. In 2012, the House again authorized a committee to pursue civil action in federal court to enforce a subpoena against an executive branch official. In 2012, the House authorized a congressional committee to pursue civil action in federal court to enforce a subpoena issued to an executive branch official. The committee filed a lawsuit seeking compliance with subpoenas, which was rejected by the court in 2013. The court's decision addressed federal court jurisdiction, standing, causes of action, and separation-of-powers concerns. The court rejected the DOJ's motion to dismiss based on jurisdictional and justiciability arguments, following the reasoning in Miers. It denied motions for summary judgment from both parties and ordered the DOJ to provide a list of withheld documents. Authorization from the full House is required for civil enforcement of subpoenas, as courts will not entertain civil motions without it. Authorization from the full House is necessary for civil enforcement of subpoenas, as courts will not entertain civil motions without it. If an authorizing resolution by the House can be obtained, there is a likelihood that the court will find no legal impediment to seeking civil enforcement of subpoenas or other committee orders. The executive branch has consistently argued that Congress cannot invoke its contempt authority against an executive branch official asserting executive privilege in response to a congressional subpoena. The executive branch has consistently argued that Congress cannot use contempt authority against an executive branch official invoking executive privilege in response to a congressional subpoena. The Attorney General has directed U.S. Attorneys not to pursue criminal contempt prosecutions in such cases, as supported by DOJ opinions from the 1980s and past actions in contempt proceedings. The House has faced challenges in enforcing contempt citations against executive branch officials who invoke executive privilege. The DOJ has declined to prosecute for criminal contempt in such cases, leading Congress to seek other avenues like civil enforcement through federal courts. The 2014 case involving IRS official Lois Lerner highlighted the broadening stance of the executive branch on criminal contempt. Lerner was held in contempt for refusing to testify about allegations of IRS targeting conservative groups. The House approved a contempt citation against IRS official Lois Lerner for refusing to testify about allegations of IRS targeting conservative groups. Despite invoking the Fifth Amendment, the DOJ has not pursued a criminal case against Lerner, unlike past cases involving executive privilege. The dispute with Lois Lerner did not involve executive privilege but her personal Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The DOJ did not pursue a criminal case against Lerner for refusing to testify, highlighting the challenges Congress faces in enforcing subpoenas against executive branch officials. The challenges in enforcing subpoenas against executive branch officials, like Lois Lerner, involve obstacles in using criminal contempt statutes. If the President endorses noncompliance, the DOJ may not prosecute. However, in cases where the official's actions are not endorsed by the President, prosecution may be pursued. The executive branch may choose not to prosecute an official for contempt if the conduct was not endorsed by the President. Congress can enforce subpoenas through civil action, but this may not be effective due to lengthy legal processes. Enforcing subpoenas through civil action may not effectively protect congressional prerogatives due to lengthy legal processes, as seen in the Miers case. Litigation can be prolonged with appeals, leading to delays in obtaining information for oversight. The committee's ability to utilize information for oversight may have been diminished by the change in administrations and the passage of time. Congress may not always rely on the executive branch or civil enforcement to enforce subpoenas, but it retains the authority to enforce subpoenas through inherent contempt."
