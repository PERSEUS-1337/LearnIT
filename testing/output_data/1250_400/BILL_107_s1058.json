    "content": "The \"Biodiesel Renewable Fuels Act\" is cited as the short title. An amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is made regarding a credit for biodiesel used as fuel. The biodiesel fuels credit under section 38 is determined as the biodiesel mixture credit, which is calculated based on the biodiesel mixture rate for different blends of qualified biodiesel mixture. The rates vary for B-1, B-2, and B-20 blends. The biodiesel fuels credit rates vary for B-1, B-2, and B-20 blends, with specific amounts allocated for each blend. The applicable amount for a B-1 blend is 1.5 cents, for a B-2 blend it is 3.0 cents, and for a B-20 blend it is 20.0 cents. The term 'qualified biodiesel mixture' refers to a blend of diesel and biodiesel that is sold or used by the taxpayer producing the mixture. The applicable amount for a B-1 blend is calculated as 1.5 cents multiplied by the percentage of biodiesel in the blend. The credit for biodiesel used in the production of a qualified biodiesel mixture is only allowed if the sale or use is in the taxpayer's trade or business. Casual off-farm production is not eligible for the credit. The credit amount may be reduced to account for any benefit from the exemption of excise tax. The credit for biodiesel used in qualified mixtures is subject to reduction based on benefits from excise tax exemptions. Biodiesel is defined as monoalkyl esters of long chain fatty acids from vegetable oils for diesel engines, including oils from various sources. Registration requirements must be met for inclusion as biodiesel. The biodiesel must meet registration requirements set by the EPA under the Clean Air Act. If biodiesel is separated from a qualified mixture or used for purposes other than fuel, a tax is imposed on the person responsible. A tax is imposed on any person who separates biodiesel from a mixture or uses the mixture for non-fuel purposes. The tax is calculated based on the biodiesel mixture rate and the number of gallons in the mixture. Applicable laws and penalties apply to this tax as if imposed under a different section. Rules similar to those for estates and trusts apply, and there is an option to elect not to apply the biodiesel fuels credit. The tax on biodiesel fuels is imposed based on the mixture rate and gallons used. Rules similar to those for estates and trusts apply, and taxpayers have the option to elect not to apply the biodiesel fuels credit. The biodiesel fuels credit is part of the general business credit, with restrictions on carrybacks before January 1, 2003. Amendments include adding the biodiesel fuels credit to Section 38(b) and Section 196(c). The biodiesel fuels credit is added to Section 196(c) and Section 40A, with restrictions on carrybacks before January 1, 2003. The amendments made by Section 40A apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2001. The reduction of motor fuel excise taxes on biodiesel mixtures is addressed in Section 3. The amendment to Section 4081 introduces a new subsection (f) regarding the taxation of biodiesel mixtures. It outlines the reduced tax rate for qualified biodiesel mixtures and diesel fuel used in producing such mixtures. This amendment applies to taxable years starting after December 31, 2001. The amendment introduces a reduced tax rate for qualified biodiesel mixtures produced from diesel fuel. Definitions from section 40A apply, and certain rules from subsection (c) also apply. Conforming amendments in Section 4041 address the sale or use of qualified biodiesel mixtures. The amendment introduces a reduced tax rate for qualified biodiesel mixtures produced from diesel fuel. Definitions from section 40A apply, and certain rules from subsection (c) also apply. Conforming amendments in Section 4041 address the sale or use of qualified biodiesel mixtures. The rates under subsection (a) are adjusted for biodiesel mixtures as defined in section 40A. The amendment introduces a reduced tax rate for qualified biodiesel mixtures produced from diesel fuel, effective January 1, 2002. If diesel fuel taxed under section 4081 is used to produce a qualified biodiesel mixture sold or used in a trade or business, the Secretary will pay an amount equal to the applicable biodiesel mixture rate per gallon. The amendment introduces a reduced tax rate for qualified biodiesel mixtures produced from diesel fuel, effective January 1, 2002. To offset reductions in Highway Trust Fund receipts due to the amendment, amounts equivalent to the reductions will be transferred from the funds of the Commodity Credit Corporation based on estimates by the Secretary of the Treasury. Adjustments will be made to subsequent transfers to correct any errors in the estimates."
