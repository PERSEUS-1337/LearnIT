Presumption of service connection for diseases associated with Project 112: Diseases diagnosed as a result of increased exposure to toxic agents during military service will be presumed to have been incurred or aggravated by that service, even without evidence during the service period. Veterans who served in the Armed Forces and were exposed to chemical or biological warfare tests under Project 112 may be presumed to have been exposed to toxic agents associated with certain diseases. This presumption allows for service connection for diseases without the need for conclusive evidence. Veterans exposed to chemical or biological warfare tests under Project 112 may be presumed to have been exposed to toxic agents linked to specific diseases. This presumption allows for service connection without the need for conclusive evidence, based on sound medical and scientific evidence of exposure. The Secretary will determine a positive association between exposure to toxic agents during Project 112 and diagnosed diseases in humans or animals based on sound medical and scientific evidence. This includes considering statistical significance, replicability, and peer review of information. The positive association between exposure to toxic agents and diseases in humans or animals is determined based on credible evidence outweighing any against it. If the presumption of service connection for a disease is removed, veterans and survivors will still be entitled to compensation. The text chunk discusses the entitlement of compensation for veterans and survivors of veterans who were awarded dependency and indemnity compensation for diseases related to Project 112.
