    "content": "Federal job training and employment programs aim to connect vulnerable youth to work and school. These young people are typically low-income with barriers to employment. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 provides job training and related services for unemployed and underemployed individuals, including youth. Programs under WIA, such as Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild, are carried out by the Department of Labor. The Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program is also implemented under WIA. These programs collectively form the federal job training system for youth. Title I of WIA includes programs like Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild, aimed at connecting youth to education, employment, leadership, and community service. WIA programs were authorized until September 30, 2003, but continue to be funded annually. Policy makers in the 112th Congress hinted at reauthorizing the law. This report discusses issues related to WIA youth programs, focusing on Youth Activities and Job Corps, as well as provisions in bills like H.R. 803 and S. 1356. The curr_chunk discusses provisions of bills related to WIA youth programs, including Youth Activities, Job Corps, and other job training and employment services for youth. It mentions programs like YouthBuild, Reintegration of Ex-Offenders, and Youth Opportunity Grants. The curr_chunk discusses various youth programs authorized under WIA, including Youth Activities, Job Corps, YouthBuild, Reintegration of Ex-Offenders, and Youth Opportunity Grants. These programs aim to provide job training and other services to low-income youth, with funding continuing for most programs except for Youth Opportunity Grants since FY2003. The Youth Activities, Job Corps, YouthBuild, Reintegration of Ex-Offenders, and Youth Opportunity Grants programs aim to connect low-income youth to educational and employment opportunities. Each program serves youth with specific employment barriers, but they differ in their focus and services provided. YouthBuild requires participants to be high school dropouts and focuses on construction work, while the Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program targets youth offenders and those at risk of dropping out. Job Corps is the only program offering residential services for youth. Workforce investment boards must provide 10 specific elements to youth in the program, including mentoring and follow-up. YouthBuild participants engage in construction work activities. Job Corps provides residential services for youth. The Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program offers various activities for youth returning from secure facilities. Funding for these programs is allocated differently, with DOL distributing funds to local WIBs for Youth Activities and entering agreements with organizations to operate Job Corps centers. YouthBuild and the Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program award grants to organizations. The Department of Labor (DOL) distributes funds to local Workforce Investment Boards (WIBs) for Youth Activities and enters agreements with organizations to operate Job Corps centers. Additionally, DOL partners with nonprofit and for-profit organizations for Job Corps programs and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service for Job Corps programs on USDA lands. YouthBuild and the Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program competitively award grants to organizations and local communities. Congress has been working on reauthorizing the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) and has held hearings and listening sessions to address issues related to WIA youth programs. During the 112th Congress, hearings and listening sessions were held to address issues related to the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) and its youth programs. The House Education and Workforce Committee discussed declining youth employment and held hearings on job training program inefficiencies and modernizing WIA. The committee also reviewed a bill to reauthorize WIA, the Workforce Investment Improvement Act of 2012 (H.R. 4297), which was favorably reported in June 2012. The House Committee on Education and the Workforce discussed job training program inefficiencies and modernizing the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) during the 112th Congress. They reviewed and favorably reported a bill to reauthorize WIA in June 2012. In the 113th Congress, the House passed the Supporting Knowledge and Investing in Lifelong Skills Act (SKILLS Act) introduced by Representative Virginia Foxx. The House Committee on Education and the Workforce discussed job training program inefficiencies and modernizing the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) during the 112th Congress. They reviewed and favorably reported a bill to reauthorize WIA in June 2012. In the 113th Congress, the House passed the Supporting Knowledge and Investing in Lifelong Skills Act (SKILLS Act) introduced by Representative Virginia Foxx. A legislative hearing on H.R. 803 was held before the full Committee on Education and the Workforce on February 26, 2013. The committee ordered the bill reported by a vote of 23 to 0 on March 6, 2013. The House passed the bill on March 15, 2013, by a vote of 215 to 202. In the Senate, Senators Patty Murray, Lamar Alexander, Tom Harkin, and Johnny Isakson introduced the Workforce Investment Act of 2013 (S. 1356) on July 24, 2013. Issues raised during the WIA reauthorization process include proposals to consolidate workforce programs for adults, dislocated workers, and youth, with advocates citing increased efficiency and cost savings, while others express concerns about potential oversight of at-risk youth and marginalized groups. Under a proposal to consolidate workforce programs, states could have more flexibility in targeting funds. Advocates believe consolidation could improve efficiency and reduce costs, but some worry about overlooking at-risk youth. Coordination between the workforce system and other systems serving youth, like education, is also a concern. Congress is interested in evaluating the effectiveness of youth workforce programs, with impact evaluations underway for Job Corps and YouthBuild. Congress is interested in evaluating the effectiveness of youth workforce programs, with impact evaluations underway for Job Corps and YouthBuild. Concerns include eligibility requirements for youth programs and the emphasis on serving older youth. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 temporarily allowed youth ages 22 through 24 to access services under the Youth Activities program. Stakeholders have raised concerns about the program's focus on older youth, school status of participants, and eligibility criteria. Congress is considering proposals to improve the performance of Job Corps centers. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommended consolidating administration of selected workforce programs to address overlap and improve efficiency. Past legislation has aimed to consolidate certain programs, such as the Employment Service (ES) with other services. The Government Accountability Office recommended consolidating selected workforce programs to improve efficiency, including the Employment Service and training services under TANF. Legislation in the 113th Congress proposed consolidating various workforce programs, such as Youth Activities and Reintegration of Ex-Offenders, into a single Workforce Investment Fund allocated to states for employment and training activities. The bill proposes consolidating workforce programs into a Workforce Investment Fund (WIF) allocated to states for employment and training activities. Required activities include providing \"work ready services\" in the one-stop delivery system, with funding distributed based on factors like the number of disadvantaged youth. States must set aside funding for a competitive grant program for individuals with barriers to employment, including youth aged 16 and older. The bill proposes consolidating workforce programs into a Workforce Investment Fund (WIF) allocated to states for employment and training activities. States must set aside funding for a competitive grant program for individuals with barriers to employment, including youth aged 16 and older, who are low-income or from low-income families. States could award grants to local boards or nonprofits to provide employment and training services to these individuals. Additionally, state and local workforce investment boards would be required to describe strategies and services to assist at-risk and out-of-school youth in acquiring education, skills, credentials, and employment experience for success in the labor market. The bill proposes consolidating workforce programs into a Workforce Investment Fund (WIF) allocated to states for employment and training activities. It includes provisions for at-risk youth aged 16 through 24, defining them as low-income and high school dropouts, youth in foster care, youth offenders, youth with disabilities, children of incarcerated parents, or migrant youth. Concerns have been raised about potential reductions in youth services under the proposed WIF. Chairman Kline supports consolidating workforce programs to eliminate duplicative programs and ensure accountability. Some policymakers are concerned that fewer youth may be served under the proposed WIF without a set-aside funding for youth programs. S. 1356 would maintain youth programs and establish Youth Innovation and Replication Grants for states and localities to improve education and employment outcomes for youth. Congress may need to consider the role of one-stop centers in serving youth. One-stop centers facilitate connections to job training, employment, and services for youth, even those ineligible for WIA Youth program. Various methods are used to attract youth to these centers, but some areas face challenges in attracting them without referrals. Some local areas struggle to attract youth to one-stop centers without referrals. Recommendations include catering more to youth, training staff on youth matters, and enhancing youth connections through funding and guidance from DOL. Local areas can improve access for youth by co-locating youth program staff at one-stop centers, customizing facilities to be more \"youth-friendly,\" and establishing separate satellite centers for youth. H.R. 803 and S. 1356 require states to continue funding one-stop centers, but do not specify youth services. Youth councils play a role in developing workforce plans and coordinating services for eligible youth. Members include local board representatives, youth service providers, juvenile justice agencies, law enforcement, public housing authorities, and parents. The National Youth Employment Coalition (NYEC) has documented challenges faced by youth councils in developing beyond advisory roles to Workforce Investment Boards (WIBs). Some councils struggle to engage youth and parents due to transportation issues and conflicting schedules. A 2002 report identified enabling conditions that have helped innovative youth councils to enhance youth activities under the Youth program. The report highlighted challenges faced by youth councils in engaging participants due to transportation and scheduling issues. Enabling conditions identified in a 2002 report have helped innovative youth councils develop comprehensive systems for youth activities. Key conditions include the presence of an established intermediary organization, strong school-to-career partnerships, and a community-wide planning process. Stakeholders recommend giving youth councils more flexibility in partnerships and priorities. Stakeholders recommend a stronger role for youth councils, suggesting they develop a comprehensive youth plan to coordinate activities and consolidate funding streams. Reauthorization legislation may make youth councils optional, with H.R. 803 in the 113th Congress proposing this change. S. 1356 would require local workforce investment boards to become local workforce development boards and address the needs of vulnerable youth in their plans. H.R. 803 and S. 1356 propose changes to state and local workforce boards to address youth interests and needs. S. 1356 would require local workforce investment boards to become local workforce development boards and establish standing committees for youth services. Best practices from existing youth councils could inform Congress on facilitating youth workforce activities. The proposed changes in H.R. 803 and S. 1356 aim to address youth interests and needs by requiring local workforce investment boards to establish standing committees for youth services. Coordination between the workforce and education system is crucial, with existing provisions in WIA intended to facilitate this coordination. Stakeholders suggest that greater coordination can help meet the multiple needs of youth as outlined in WIA. Some stakeholders suggest that greater coordination between youth programs and educational agencies is needed to meet the multiple needs of youth as outlined in WIA. A 2004 report by the Government Accountability Office highlighted the collaboration between workforce and education systems, noting that about half of all youth received services through community-based organizations, secondary schools, and colleges. However, some education entities were hesitant to partner, hindering the vision of providing comprehensive youth development services. The Government Accountability Office found that about half of all youth received services under the Youth Activities program through various organizations, schools, and universities. Some educators were cautious about partnering due to perceived conflicts with schools' academic mission. Collaboration between the Department of Labor and Department of Education is aimed at ensuring all youth, whether in-school or out-of-school, receive necessary services and support. Secretary of Education Martha Kanter and Assistant Secretary of Labor Jane Oates testified about the collaboration between the Department of Labor and Department of Education to provide services and support for youth. They mentioned the successful School-to-Work program as an example of past collaboration. H.R. 803, a reauthorization bill, includes provisions for coordination between workforce and education systems, but it is not explicit. The reauthorization bill H.R. 803 includes provisions for coordination between workforce and education systems, allowing local areas to include education officials on the local workforce investment board. The Senate bill S. 1356 also addresses coordination with the education system, requiring states to submit a Unified State Plan every four years covering various programs under WIA. The reauthorization bill H.R. 803 includes provisions for coordination between workforce and education systems at the local level. Senate bill S. 1356 requires states to submit a Unified State Plan every four years covering programs under WIA, including Youth Activities, Adult Activities, Dislocated Workers, adult education, Employment Service, and vocational rehabilitation. Congress and stakeholders are concerned about the effectiveness of youth programs under WIA. The evaluation of youth programs authorized under WIA, including Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild, has been a concern for Congress and stakeholders. While few evaluations have been conducted, the programs have generally met or exceeded their goals under the common performance measures. Section 172 of WIA mandates continuous evaluation of programs and activities, focusing on effectiveness relative to cost. Reauthorization legislation would require independent evaluations to be conducted by the Department of Labor. The evaluations of programs and activities funded under WIA are required to assess effectiveness relative to cost. Limited information exists on the effectiveness of these programs, with only 5 out of 47 programs having undergone impact studies since 2004. Rigorous impact studies involve randomly assigning individuals to treatment and control groups to determine program effectiveness. None of the programs evaluated were youth programs authorized under WIA. The Department of Labor (DOL) has contracted a social science research organization to conduct an impact evaluation of the YouthBuild program, which will randomly assign youth to the program or a control group. Initial results on the program's impact on youth employment are expected in 2015. DOL also completed a process evaluation of the Job Corps program to examine center practices associated with performance. The Department of Labor (DOL) is conducting an impact evaluation of the YouthBuild program, with results expected in 2015. A recent process evaluation of the Job Corps program identified factors such as robust student support and strong partner relationships that are associated with strong performance. The Job Corps program was rigorously evaluated in the late 1990s to early 2000s, showing positive outcomes in education and employment for youth ages 16 to 24. A follow-up report found that while positive employment effects diminished over time, there were increased earnings for youth between ages 26 to 34. The research focused on employment outcomes 5 to 10 years after random assignment for youth aged 26 to 34. Positive effects diminished over time, with similar employment rates and earnings between program and control groups. However, older youth aged 20 to 24 at the time of program application saw increased earnings. Performance measures for Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild were discussed, with concerns raised about potential disincentives for serving youth with greater barriers to employment. The WIA reauthorization bill proposed changes to youth core performance measures. The WIA reauthorization bill, H.R. 803, aims to address concerns about performance measures for Youth Activities and Job Corps by introducing new indicators for measuring outcomes such as entry into unsubsidized employment, retention in employment, earnings growth, and attainment of credentials. The WIA reauthorization bill, H.R. 803, introduces new indicators for measuring outcomes for eligible youth in activities funded by the WIA Youth Activities program, including entry into education, training, or employment, retention in education or employment, earnings for employed youth, attainment of postsecondary credentials or diplomas, participation in training programs leading to credentials or employment, and program effectiveness in serving employers. States may also require additional performance indicators. The WIA reauthorization bill, H.R. 803, introduces new indicators for measuring outcomes for eligible youth in activities funded by the WIA Youth Activities program, including entry into education, training, or employment, retention in education or employment, earnings for employed youth, attainment of postsecondary credentials or diplomas, participation in training programs leading to credentials or employment, and program effectiveness in serving employers. States may also require additional performance indicators. Additionally, S. 1356 requires the DOL Secretary to establish performance measures for Job Corps center operators based on indicators for youth eligible under Youth Activities. Section 136 of WIA sets forth state and local performance measures for the accountability system of the Youth Activities program. These measures assess the effectiveness of States and local areas in achieving continuous improvement of workforce investment activities funded under this subtitle to optimize the return on investment of Federal funds. Under WIA, state performance measures for youth ages 14-18 include basic skills attainment, secondary school diplomas, and postsecondary education or employment placement. For youth ages 19-21, the core indicators are employment entry, retention, earnings, and credential attainment. States negotiate performance levels with DOL. Stakeholders argue that current measures may incentivize programs to focus on high-functioning youth to meet targets. Performance measures in WIA Section 136 are determined through negotiation between states and DOL. Stakeholders argue that these measures may lead programs to only serve high-functioning youth to meet targets. Some programs funded with Youth Activities dollars only accept youth at specific grade levels to ensure goal achievement. DOL issued guidance in 2010 to help service providers assist youth most in need while still meeting performance goals. In response to the report, DOL issued guidance in 2010 to state workforce agencies on strategies to facilitate service providers to serve youth most in need, while still achieving performance goals. This guidance focused on six strategies: multiyear contracting, basing enrollment goals on total participant count, using real-time indicators for provider performance assessment, factoring participant characteristics into goal negotiations, creating positive incentives for enrolling at-risk youth, and encouraging interagency collaboration for youth needs. The 2010 DOL guidance encourages local WIBs to adopt \"real-time\" indicators like changes in attitudes, behaviors, knowledge, and skills for youth programs. Some suggest that common measures may not prioritize higher-risk groups. The 2010 DOL guidance recommends using \"real-time\" indicators for youth programs, such as learning gains and grade level improvements. Suggestions have been made to adjust performance levels for serving higher-risk youth populations, similar to adjustments made under the Job Training Partnership Act. Governors could adjust national performance standards for local areas based on economic and demographic factors. Governors adjusted service delivery areas (SDAs) standards based on economic and demographic factors under JTPA. The process aimed to level the playing field across different areas. Job Corps established over 20 core performance metrics, including entered employment and retention in postsecondary education. DOL implemented 33 additional performance metrics based on GPRA requirements. The Department of Labor (DOL) has implemented 33 performance metrics to assess the Job Corps program's performance, developed from DOL policy and the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA). A 2011 report by the DOL Office of the Inspector General raised concerns about inaccurate reporting of results, lack of established targets for some metrics, and miscalculations in program participant costs. YouthBuild program applicants are required to include a description of results to be achieved with common indicators of performance for youth and lifelong learning. The YouthBuild program applicants must include a description of results to be achieved with common indicators of performance for youth and lifelong learning, as required by Section 173A(c)(3)(B)(xii) of WIA. The final regulation for YouthBuild, issued in February 2012, outlines performance indicators for grantees, including placement in employment or education, attainment of a degree or education, and literacy and numeracy gains. DOL has also set goals for the program, such as retention rates for individuals exiting the program and entering employment, post-secondary education, or training. The Department of Labor (DOL) has issued guidance to YouthBuild program grantees on performance indicators, including retention rates and recidivism rates. Stakeholders have discussed eligibility requirements and serving out-of-school and older youth. Under H.R. 803, states and local areas would be impacted by reauthorization legislation. Stakeholders are discussing eligibility requirements for the Youth Activities program, including the emphasis on serving out-of-school and older youth. Under H.R. 803, states and local areas would need strategies to assist at-risk youth, but not required to serve a certain percentage or allocate a minimum funding. Youth aged 14-21 with barriers like basic literacy skills deficiency or homelessness are eligible for the program. Ongoing discussions include the extent of the WIA Youth program. The Government Accountability Office's (GAO's) 2002 research on the implementation of the WIA Youth program found challenges in documenting youth's income eligibility. State and local officials reported difficulties in obtaining necessary documentation, diverting resources from service delivery. The GAO examined how states and localities implement the WIA Youth program and other federal programs funded by the Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Officials noted challenges in youth providing required documentation for program eligibility, including income requirements that may exclude needy youth. Additionally, youth face difficulties in proving eligibility under other criteria such as involvement in foster care or the justice system, or being homeless. Some states have requested waivers for certain eligibility criteria from the Department of Labor. Some states have requested waivers for certain eligibility criteria from the Department of Labor under the WIA Youth program. However, DOL cannot waive participant eligibility requirements, but states and local governments can establish their own policies for verifying eligibility. Stakeholders have raised concerns about the lack of flexibility in documenting income and other eligibility factors under WIA regulations. Stakeholders have raised concerns about the lack of flexibility in documenting income and other eligibility factors under WIA regulations. Some states and localities prefer using eligibility criteria from WIA's predecessor, the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), such as eligibility based on participation in the federal free lunch program or residency in high-poverty census tracts. Youth living in Youth Opportunity grant program sites are automatically eligible based on their residency in low-income communities. Some stakeholders suggest expanding eligibility for out-of-school youth in the Youth Activities program based on residency in high-poverty areas or certain risk factors, regardless of income. It is uncertain how changing eligibility requirements would impact the number of eligible youth or if those with more opportunities would still receive services. Stakeholders also question if the program should focus more on out-of-school youth, including those not working. Stakeholders have raised concerns about the focus of the Youth Activities program on out-of-school youth, including dropouts and those who are unemployed or underemployed. Despite the requirement for 30% of funds to be used for out-of-school youth, challenges remain in recruiting and retaining these individuals. Serving out-of-school youth is more costly and maintaining contact with them is difficult, especially due to transportation issues. Some suggest allocating more WIA Youth funding to dropouts and other out-of-school youth. Serving out-of-school youth is more costly and maintaining contact with them is difficult, especially due to transportation issues. Some stakeholders suggest allocating more WIA Youth funding to dropouts and other high-risk youth, even those who are in school but struggling academically. There are debates on whether to prioritize out-of-school youth or maintain the current funding share while increasing technical assistance to meet their needs. The committee reports on bills addressing federal programs for in-school and out-of-school youth, with debates on funding allocation and technical assistance. DOL has issued guidance on serving out-of-school youth, including alternative education programs and funding for education pathways. Additionally, DOL funded grants for reconnecting youth who have dropped out to multiple education pathways. In FY2007, DOL provided $3.4 million to seven midsize cities to implement a system reconnecting youth who have dropped out to multiple education pathways. Some states provided technical assistance through a training network, while local areas contracted with service providers for GED programs and vocational training. Youth aged 14-21 are eligible for WIA, with the ARRA of 2009 temporarily extending services to age 24. The WIA Youth program focuses on providing services for youth aged 14-21, including GED programs and vocational training. The ARRA of 2009 extended services to youth up to age 24 to address the growing number of unemployed young adults. Research suggests that factors like delayed marriage and high living costs are prolonging the transition to adulthood for many young people. Older youth are more likely to be disconnected from work or school, facing challenges like family conflict and difficulty finding stable employment with adequate wages and health insurance. The transition to adulthood for vulnerable youth is complicated by challenges like family conflict and obstacles to employment. Older youth are more likely to be disconnected from work or school. There is a debate on whether the WIA should target older, disconnected youth in reauthorization legislation. Expanding the age range of the Youth program could strain resources. DOL has advised co-enrolling older youth in both the Youth and Adult Activities programs. A report by GAO found that 7% of youth in the Youth program funded by ARRA were ages 22-24, indicating a potential increase in youth seeking services if the age range is expanded. The Youth program funded by ARRA included ages 22-24, totaling about 21,000 youth. DOL allows co-enrollment of older youth in both Youth and Adult Activities programs. Exiters ages 19-21 in the Youth program increased from 28.1% in 2008 to 34.8% in 2012-2013. Older youth can receive mentoring under the Youth program and ITA under the Adult program. Exiters ages 19 to 21 in the Youth program increased from 28.1% in 2008 to 34.8% in 2012-2013. The Youth program offers academic services like tutoring, while the Adult program focuses on job search assistance and workplace training. The Youth program emphasizes leadership skills and community service, which the Adult program does not. The Adult program provides job search assistance and workplace training, while the Youth program focuses on leadership skills, community service, and supportive services like child care and transportation. The Youth program also offers adult mentoring and counseling, including drug and alcohol abuse counseling, compared to the Adult program's primary focus on job counseling. The Adult program provides job search assistance and workplace training, while the Youth program focuses on leadership skills, community service, and supportive services like child care and transportation. The Youth program also offers adult mentoring and counseling, including drug and alcohol abuse counseling. The Department of Labor (DOL) published a request for comment on its methodology for selecting low-performing centers for closure, based on performance rating, on-board strength, and facility condition criteria. The Department of Labor (DOL) is considering closing low-performing centers as part of its reform agenda to improve performance. Factors such as efficiency rating, facility condition, and federal oversight are being considered. The closures aim to maximize results for students and taxpayers, with budget constraints playing a role. The comment period ended in February 2013, with no further information provided as of February 2014. The Department of Labor is considering closing low-performing centers to improve efficiency and maximize results for students and taxpayers due to budget constraints. H.R. 803 includes provisions to improve and close underperforming centers, with new performance measures and a program improvement plan for those reporting less than 50% on certain indicators. The bill also mandates an audit of center performance over the past 10 years and ranking based on performance and incidents of violence. The bill H.R. 803 aims to close low-performing Job Corps centers based on past performance and incidents of violence. The Department of Labor Secretary is required to conduct an audit and rank centers, with a mandate to close the bottom quintile within 12 months of enactment. Similar proposals have been suggested in previous Congresses, but centers were not ultimately closed. The Department of Labor considered closing Job Corps centers to improve efficiency, but ultimately did not. Legislation in the 104th Congress proposed closing 25 underperforming centers based on various criteria. There was also a proposal to transfer Job Corps operations from the federal government to states, but some objected due to concerns about decreased student attendance and funding shifts. The Workforce Investment Act of 2013 proposed transferring Job Corps operations to states, allowing them to manage centers integrated with workforce development systems. Some concerns were raised about potential decreases in student attendance and funding shifts. The bill also aimed to establish expected performance levels for the Youth Activities program. The Workforce Investment Act of 2013 proposed changes in Job Corps operations, including transferring management to states. It aimed to establish expected performance levels for the Youth Activities program, eliminating existing indicators and implementing common performance metrics. The ETA implemented common measures for workforce programs in 2003 to collect program performance data. These measures include placement in employment or education, degree attainment, and literacy gains. The common measures are used to assess program performance under the Government Performance and Results Act. The common measures for the Youth Activities program are used to assess program performance under the Government Performance and Results Act. Goals for the common measures are set ambitiously and adjusted for individual grantees as needed. Performance targets are developed using regression analysis. DOL sets program goals for Youth Activities using regression analysis to account for different economic circumstances. Performance targets for YouthBuild and Job Corps are also based on regression analysis, incorporating factors like program results and labor market conditions. Each program has met or exceeded its goals. The DOL sets performance targets for Youth Activities and Job Corps based on economic assumptions and program results. Each program has met or exceeded its goals in PY2011 and PY2012. Placement in employment or education and attainment of a degree or certificate are key measures used to evaluate program success. The program evaluates success based on key measures such as attainment of a degree or certificate, literacy or numeracy gains for youth participants. Diploma, GED, or certificate attainment is measured for those enrolled in an educational program, excluding postsecondary students. Literacy or numeracy gains are measured for youth not in school with basic skills deficiencies. The readiness certificate does not count as a diploma and excludes postsecondary students. Literacy or numeracy gains measure the increase in educational functional levels for out-of-school youth with basic skills deficiencies. Youth are assessed in reading, writing, and math before entering the program and are tested regularly within one year of program entry. Individuals not deficient in basic skills are excluded from this measure to focus on those needing remediation. Youth are tested regularly within one year of program entry to measure literacy and numeracy gains for those with basic skills deficiencies. Individuals not deficient in basic skills are excluded from testing to focus on those needing remediation. DOL provides guidance on types of tests and accommodations for students with disabilities."
