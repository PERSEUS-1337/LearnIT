    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Americans with Disabilities Act Restoration Act of 2007\". Congress finds that the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 intended to establish a clear prohibition of discrimination based on disability, but Supreme Court decisions have narrowed its protection. Congress recognized that individuals with disabilities have the right to participate fully in society, but prejudice often prevents them from doing so. Congress recognized the barriers that prevent individuals with disabilities from fully participating in society, leading to the broad definition of disability in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, influenced by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 expanded the definition of disability to include societal limitations and myths about disability, as highlighted by the Supreme Court. Despite Congress's intention for a broad interpretation of disability, the Supreme Court's ruling in Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams narrowed the scope of the term. The Supreme Court has interpreted the term \"disability\" strictly, creating a demanding standard for qualification under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. This has led to limitations in the Act's coverage for individuals who have mitigated their impairments through measures like medication and assistive devices, contrary to congressional intent. The Act aims to restore the broad protection available under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, in response to Supreme Court decisions that have narrowed the scope of discrimination protection for individuals who have mitigated their impairments. The Act aims to reinstate the original congressional intent of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 by clarifying that protection is available for individuals facing adverse treatment based on impairment, prejudiced attitudes, or societal barriers. The Americans with Disabilities Act aims to protect individuals from adverse treatment based on disability-related fears, ignorance, stereotypes, societal barriers, and the failure to provide reasonable accommodations and services.
