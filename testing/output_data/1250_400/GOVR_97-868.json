    "content": "The Internet is a \"network of networks\" connecting millions of computers worldwide through unique IP numbers. Domain names simplify access, with TLDs like .com or .org. The DNS maps addresses to names, maintained by root servers for global connectivity. DARPA funded the Internet's origins for military use. The Internet originated from DARPA funding for military use and evolved into a civilian network with support from NSF. The DNS is a set of databases managed by entities like IANA, coordinating root servers and IP address space allocation. The NSF made technical decisions regarding root servers, managed IP address space, and signed an agreement with InterNic to handle domain name registration for .com, .net, and .org gTLDs. Criticism grew over NSI's sole control, leading to trademark disputes and concerns about IANA's legal foundation. After the imposition of registration fees in 1995, criticism of NSI's control over gTLDs grew, leading to trademark disputes in the .com domain. Concerns about IANA's legal foundation prompted international actions, including the IAHC proposal for new gTLD management. The U.S. government created an interagency group led by NTIA to address the domain name issue. On June 5, 1998, DOC took steps in response. The U.S. government created an interagency group led by NTIA to address the domain name issue. On June 5, 1998, DOC issued a final statement endorsing a new not-for-profit corporation to manage Internet names and addresses, ensuring stability, competition, and fair representation of the Internet community. The White Paper endorsed a process for Internet names and addresses management, leading to the creation of ICANN. The final version of ICANN's bylaws and articles of incorporation were submitted to the Department of Commerce on October 2, 1998. On November 25, 1998, DOC and ICANN signed an official Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to transition management responsibility for DNS functions to a private-sector not-for-profit entity. On September 17, 2003, ICANN and the Department of Commerce agreed to extend their Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) until September 30, 2006. The MOU specified transition tasks for ICANN to address. On June 30, 2005, the U.S. government outlined principles for the Internet's domain name system, emphasizing the importance of security and stability. On September 29, 2006, the Department of Commerce (DOC) announced a new Joint Project Agreement (JPA) with ICANN to transition the coordination of technical functions related to the DNS to the private sector. The JPA focused on transparency and accountability mechanisms within ICANN. On September 30, 2009, DOC and ICANN agreed on an Affirmation of Commitments (AoC) to institutionalize the global technical coordination of the DNS by a private-sector-led organization, ensuring accountability, transparency, security, stability, and promoting competition and international participation. The AoC affirms commitments made by DOC and ICANN to ensure accountability, transparency, security, stability, and promote competition and international participation. ICANN is a not-for-profit corporation headquartered in Los Angeles, CA, organized under California law and overseen by the California attorney general. It consists of a Board of Directors advised by supporting organizations and advisory committees representing various Internet interests. ICANN, a not-for-profit corporation headquartered in Los Angeles, is overseen by a Board of Directors advised by supporting organizations and advisory committees representing various Internet interests. The Board consists of 16 international members and is responsible for making final policy and operational decisions. The organization's budget has significantly increased over the years due to the growth of the Internet and domain name registration, reaching $159 million in revenue and 373 staff members in 2015. The growth of the Internet and domain name registration has led to a significant increase in the ICANN budget, reaching $159 million in revenue and 373 staff members in 2015. ICANN is primarily funded through fees paid by registrars and registry operators. Congressional committees oversee the Department of Commerce's management of ICANN's activities. The Department of Commerce is overseen by congressional committees regarding ICANN's activities and policies. The U.S. government originally owned and operated key components of the network architecture enabling the domain name system. The 1998 Memorandum of Understanding initiated a transition of DNS coordination to a private-sector entity. The 1998 Memorandum of Understanding between ICANN and the Department of Commerce initiated the transition of DNS coordination to a private-sector entity. The U.S. government retains a role in DNS management through contractual agreements with ICANN, IANA/ICANN, and VeriSign. On September 30, 2009, an Affirmation of Commitments was agreed upon to institutionalize global DNS coordination by a private-sector-led organization. The Department of Commerce and VeriSign manage the official DNS root zone file. An Affirmation of Commitments was agreed upon between DOC and ICANN to institutionalize global DNS coordination. There were disagreements on whether DOC should maintain control over ICANN after the JPA expiration. U.S. industry groups argued for continued DOC oversight to prevent undue control by foreign entities, while international entities supported full privatization. Many argued for continued U.S. government oversight of ICANN to prevent foreign control, while others believed ICANN had met conditions for privatization. Senator Snowe introduced S.Res. 564 in the 110th Congress, stating more progress was needed in accountability and transparency. NTIA issued a Notice of Inquiry in 2009, citing areas where further work was required to increase confidence in ICANN. On April 24, 2009, NTIA issued a Notice of Inquiry seeking public comment on the upcoming expiration of the JPA between DOC and ICANN. The review highlighted areas where further work was needed to increase confidence in ICANN, including stability, accountability, and competition. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce held a hearing on the JPA expiration and transition progress. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce discussed the expiration of the JPA between DOC and ICANN. Members expressed the need for a permanent instrument to ensure ICANN's accountability to the public and global stakeholders. This instrument should maintain the DOC-ICANN relationship, include periodic reviews of ICANN performance, and outline steps for accountability and domain name management. The instrument should ensure the permanent continuance of the present DOC-ICANN relationship, provide for periodic reviews of ICANN performance, outline steps for accountability, create a mechanism for adding new gTLDs and internationalized domain names, ensure timely access to WHOIS information, and include commitments for ICANN to remain a not-for-profit corporation headquartered in the United States. Under the AoC, ICANN commits to remaining a not-for-profit corporation headquartered in the United States with global offices. Review panels will evaluate ICANN governance, transparency, accountability, and responsiveness to global Internet users. The AoC calls for the establishment of review panels to evaluate ICANN governance in four areas: Ensuring accountability, transparency, and the interests of global Internet users, and preserving security, stability, and resiliency of the DNS. The panels will consist of various stakeholders and independent experts. The panel will review ICANN's plan to enhance the operational stability, reliability, resiliency, security, and global interoperability of the DNS. It will also examine the impact of new gTLDs on competition, consumer trust, and consumer choice. Additionally, the panel will assess the effectiveness of existing WHOIS policy in meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement and promoting consumer trust. The panel will review existing WHOIS policy to assess its effectiveness in meeting the needs of law enforcement and promoting consumer trust. It will be composed of various stakeholders including the chair of the GAC, the CEO of ICANN, representatives of Advisory Committees, Supporting Organizations, independent experts, global law enforcement community, and privacy experts. The Accountability and Transparency Review Team (ATRT) released recommendations to improve ICANN's transparency and accountability, which were adopted by the Board in June 2011. The Board adopted all 27 ATRT recommendations in June 2011, focusing on transparency and accountability in Board governance, GAC effectiveness, public input, and policy development. ATRT2 presented 12 new recommendations in December 2013. The IANA functions contract authorizes ICANN to manage DNS technical aspects, including IP address allocation and root zone file editing. Additionally, a cooperative agreement with VeriSign is intertwined with IANA functions. The DOC has authority over the root zone file, allowing the U.S. government to approve or deny changes to the DNS. The June 30, 2005, U.S. government principles aim to preserve the security and stability of the DNS. The U.S. government aims to maintain security and stability of the DNS, asserting its authority over the root zone file. The JPA and AoC did not directly impact this authority. NTIA awarded the IANA functions contract to ICANN until 2015, with a potential extension to 2019, featuring a separation of policy development and implementation. The most recent IANA functions contract was awarded to ICANN until September 30, 2015, with a possible extension to 2019. The contract includes a separation between policy development and implementation, along with a conflict of interest policy and transparency requirements. The contractor must be U.S. owned and operated, with operations and systems based in the United States. NTIA retains oversight authority over ICANN and the domain name system. NTIA has the authority to oversee ICANN and the domain name system through the IANA functions contract and cooperative agreement with Verisign. They announced plans to transition stewardship to the global Internet community by September 30, 2015, and are working with ICANN and other stakeholders to develop a proposal for the transition. The Internet technical organizations, including IETF, IAB, ISOC, RIRs, and top-level domain operators, called for accelerating the globalization of ICANN and IANA functions. NTIA requires a transition proposal with broad community support and adherence to four principles to maintain the multistakeholder model and security of the Internet DNS. Supporters of the transition argue that transferring authority over ICANN and the DNS to the global Internet community will strengthen the multistakeholder model of Internet governance. They believe this will help prevent proposals for intergovernmental control over the Internet. Opponents of the transition are skeptical and cautious about the process. Critics of the transition express concerns about the potential risks of foreign governments gaining more control over the Internet and the DNS, especially in the absence of NTIA's oversight. They also worry about the development of a new international multistakeholder entity to oversee the domain name system. Critics are concerned about the risks of foreign governments gaining influence over the DNS through a new Internet governance mechanism that lacks U.S. oversight. H.R. 4342, the DOTCOM Act, aims to prevent NTIA from relinquishing control until a report on the advantages and disadvantages of the transition is submitted to Congress, addressing national security concerns. The DOTCOM Act, H.R. 4342, requires a report on the advantages and disadvantages of transitioning NTIA's authority over IANA to the multistakeholder Internet community. The House Energy and Commerce Committee approved the bill, and it was later included as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2015, passing the House on May 22, 2014. The DOTCOM Act, included as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2015, passed the House on May 22, 2014. The House supported protections for the .mil domain and advocated for the separation of policymaking and root-zone management functions. The Senate also addressed the future of Internet governance in its version of the FY2015 National Defense Authorization Act. Section 1646 of S. 2410 in the FY2015 National Defense Authorization Act advises transferring the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority functions to a global multi-stakeholder community only if the '.MIL' domain and Internet Protocol addresses used by the Department of Defense remain exclusive. The Department of Defense is directed to sustain stewardship of Internet root zone servers and seek an agreement for the .mil domain during the IANA transition process. The committee urged the Department of Defense to ensure that the .mil domain retains its current status as a generic top-level domain after the IANA transition. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 does not include the DOTCOM Act provision. Congress stated that the Secretary of Defense should only support the IANA transfer if assurances are provided to protect legacy top-level domain names and Internet Protocol addresses used by the Department of Defense. The House Appropriations Committee approved H.R. 4660, the FY2015 Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations Bill, which emphasizes the need for assurances to protect legacy top-level domain names and Internet Protocol addresses used by the Department of Defense during the IANA transfer. Congress also highlights the importance of maintaining consensus-based decision making in the multi-stakeholder approach and ensuring the accountability process works transparently, securely, and efficiently to uphold a free, open, and resilient Internet. The House Appropriations Committee approved H.R. 4660, the FY2015 Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations Act, emphasizing the need to protect legacy top-level domain names and IP addresses used by the Department of Defense during the IANA transfer. The bill report does not include funds for NTIA to carry out the transition, expecting the maintenance of the existing contract with ICANN throughout FY2015. An amendment prohibits the use of funds to relinquish NTIA's responsibility for Internet domain name system functions. The House Appropriations Committee approved H.R. 4660, the FY2015 Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations Act, emphasizing the need to protect legacy top-level domain names and IP addresses used by the Department of Defense during the IANA transfer. An amendment offered by Representative Duffy was adopted on May 30, 2014, prohibiting the use of funds to relinquish NTIA's responsibility for Internet domain name system functions. The Senate Appropriations Committee directed NTIA to conduct a thorough review and analysis of any proposed transition of the IANA contract to ensure ICANN has an approved oversight plan insulated from foreign government control. The House Appropriations Committee approved H.R. 4660, emphasizing the need to protect legacy top-level domain names and IP addresses used by the Department of Defense during the IANA transfer. An amendment prohibited the use of funds to relinquish NTIA's responsibility for Internet domain name system functions. The Senate Appropriations Committee directed NTIA to ensure ICANN has an approved oversight plan insulated from foreign government control. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-235) prohibits NTIA from relinquishing its responsibility for Internet domain name system functions during FY2015. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-235) prohibits NTIA from using funds to relinquish its responsibility for Internet domain name system functions during FY2015. The prohibition on funding for NTIA's IANA transition activities expires on September 30, 2015. Additionally, NTIA is directed to inform Congressional committees 45 days in advance of any proposed successor contract or decision related to changing its role with ICANN or IANA activities. The Explanatory Statement in the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-235) directs NTIA to report to Congress within 45 days on any potential consequences if a decision is made to transition Internet governance responsibilities. Other legislation, such as H.R. 4367, H.R. 4398, and H.R. 5737, also address the proposed transition and aim to restrict NTIA from relinquishing its DNS and IANA responsibilities without proper authorization. Several bills, including H.R. 4367, H.R. 4398, and H.R. 5737, aim to prevent NTIA from giving up its authority over Internet functions. The DOTCOM Act of 2015, reintroduced as H.R. 805, requires a GAO report on the implications of the proposed transition before any responsibility is relinquished. H.R. 805 requires a GAO report on the implications of the proposed transition of NTIA's authority over the Internet domain name system before any responsibility is relinquished. The report will analyze advantages, disadvantages, principles, criteria, transfer proposals, evaluation processes, national security concerns, and security implications. It also includes defining the \"multistakeholder model\" and other relevant terms. The Senate introduced S.Res. 71 to raise awareness about NTIA's proposed transition of Internet governance. The resolution emphasizes the importance of accountability and governance reforms for ICANN. Additionally, a Senate hearing was held on preserving the multistakeholder model of Internet governance, with testimony from NTIA and ICANN. The Senate passed S.Res. 71 on February 5, 2015, to address the transition of the stewardship of the IANA functions. A hearing was held by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation on February 25, 2015, to discuss the preservation of the multistakeholder model of Internet governance. ICANN has initiated a process for the multistakeholder community to reach a consensus on a transition proposal, divided into two tracks: IANA Stewardship Transition and Enhancing ICANN Accountability. A draft proposal for the transition of NTIA's stewardship of the IANA functions was put out for public input, with a steering group proposed to oversee the process. The draft proposal for transitioning NTIA's stewardship of the IANA functions involves forming a steering group composed of representatives from various ICANN constituencies and affected parties. The Coordination Group, comprised of 30 individuals representing 13 communities, is responsible for preparing a transition proposal. The ICG's mission is to coordinate the development of proposals for the three primary IANA functions. The ICG released its charter on August 27, 2014, stating its mission to coordinate proposals for the three primary IANA functions. The proposals for Domain Names, Number Resources, and Protocol Parameters are being developed by different operational communities. The Domain Names proposal is still in progress with a target submission date of June 2015. The Number Resources proposal was submitted to the ICG on January 15, 2015, by the Consolidated RIR IANA Stewardship Proposal Team. The Protocol Parameters proposal is being developed by the IANAPLAN Working Group. The final proposal to the ICG is due in June 2015. The five RIRs submitted the Number Resources proposal on January 15, 2015, while the IETF submitted the Protocol Parameters proposal on January 6, 2015. Consensus on the domain name function proposal has been challenging, with a deadline extended to June 2015. The complexity arises from transitioning the domain name IANA function currently performed by ICANN under contract with NTIA. The debate within the multistakeholder community is whether a new organization should oversee the IANA function contract or if ICANN should be given authority with enhanced accountability measures. ICANN has also started a process to enhance its accountability in case it is no longer under contract with the U.S. government. This process aims to strengthen ICANN's broader accountability mechanisms. ICANN has initiated a process to enhance its accountability in case it is no longer under contract with the U.S. government. A Cross Community Working Group (CCWG) has been formed to develop proposals to strengthen ICANN's accountability mechanisms. The group consists of 25 members appointed by chartering organizations and 141 participants contributing to discussions. Decisions will be made by consensus, and the group will be open to interested individuals as participants. The Cross Community Working Group (CCWG) on enhancing ICANN's accountability consists of 25 members appointed by chartering organizations and 141 participants. Decisions are made by consensus, and the group is open to interested individuals as participants. Additionally, up to seven advisors selected by a Public Experts Group will provide independent advice and research. The CCWG is pursuing two interrelated Work Streams focusing on mechanisms enhancing ICANN accountability within the IANA Stewardship Transition timeline. The Cross Community Working Group (CCWG) on enhancing ICANN's accountability consists of 25 members appointed by chartering organizations and 141 participants. The group is pursuing two interrelated Work Streams. Work Stream 1 focuses on mechanisms enhancing ICANN accountability within the IANA Stewardship Transition timeline, while Work Stream 2 addresses accountability topics extending beyond the transition. A proposal will be submitted to the ICANN Board for approval, with NTIA needing to approve the multistakeholder community proposal for the transition to occur. The NTIA will have to approve the multistakeholder community proposal for the transition to take place. Congress has prohibited NTIA from spending FY2015 funds on relinquishing its responsibility for Internet domain name system functions. NTIA Administrator Lawrence Strickling stated that appropriated funds will not be used to terminate the IANA functions contract with ICANN before September 30, 2015. Congress expects NTIA to provide regular reports on the transition process. Verisign will work with NTIA to remove NTIA's approval role for changes to the root zone file before September 30. Congress requires NTIA to report regularly on the transition process, actively monitoring discussions within the multistakeholder community. NTIA will engage with ICANN, Verisign, governments, and stakeholders, providing feedback as needed. The focus is on an open and inclusive process, but the community must proceed carefully as there is only one chance to get it right. Everyone has a responsibility to participate. The community should proceed carefully as there is only one chance to get it right. Everyone has a responsibility to participate in the multistakeholder process. Administrator Strickling called for equal consideration of all transition proposal models and accountability in new organizational structures. NTIA emphasized the need for stress testing solutions to safeguard against future contingencies. NTIA emphasized the need for stress testing solutions to safeguard against future contingencies such as attempts to influence or take over ICANN. They encourage addressing questions on how to remove or replace board members and improve current accountability tools. NTIA stated that both transition processes should remain in sync, with a target date of delivering a transition plan in the summer, but with flexibility to extend the contract if needed. NTIA emphasized stress testing solutions to safeguard against future contingencies for ICANN. The timing for delivering a transition plan is targeted for the summer, with flexibility to extend the contract if necessary. ICANN is an international organization with a diverse Board of Directors and constituency groups worldwide. The Governmental Advisory Committee provides advice to the ICANN Board on public policy matters, but the Board is not obligated to follow the recommendations. Many in the international community argue against the U.S. government's continued involvement in ICANN. The Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC) advises the ICANN Board on public policy matters and government concerns. While the ICANN Board must consider GAC advice, it is not required to follow it. There are calls for greater international involvement in Internet governance, with the United Nations discussing the issue at the 2003 World Summit on the Information Society. The UN's Working Group on Internet Governance (WGIG) recommended further internationalization of Internet governance and the creation of a new global forum for Internet stakeholders. The WGIG released a report in 2005 advocating for further internationalization of Internet governance and the creation of a new global forum for stakeholders. The report proposed four models, including ones where ICANN would be replaced or made accountable to a higher body. The U.S. opposed transferring control of the domain name system from ICANN to an international body, while the EU initially supported the U.S. position but later shifted towards favoring enhanced international governance of the Internet. The 109th Congress and the European Union initially supported U.S. control over ICANN. However, the EU later shifted towards favoring enhanced international governance of the Internet. Conflict at the WSIS Tunis Summit was averted by an Internet governance agreement in 2005. ICANN and the U.S. maintained their roles in the domain name system. The Internet Governance Forum (IGF) was formed under the U.N. to discuss Internet policy issues, with no binding authority. The Internet Governance Forum (IGF) was established as a platform for stakeholders to discuss Internet policy issues without binding authority. In 2010, the U.N. General Assembly renewed the IGF for another five years and tasked the U.N.'s Commission on Science and Technology for Development (CSTD) to develop recommendations for its improvement. Controversies arose in 2010 and 2011 regarding new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) and the addition of the .xxx TLD, leading to debates on increased government influence on ICANN policy decisions. Governments like the US, Canada, and the EU support the current ICANN multistakeholder model but want a stronger role for the Governmental Advisory Committee. Brazil, South Africa, and India prefer a UN Internet policy entity to oversee bodies like ICANN. Russia and China propose an International Code of Conduct for Information Security for discussion at the UN General Assembly, promoting a democratic international Internet management. The World Conference on International Telecommunications (WCIT) was held in Dubai on December 3-14, 2012, convened by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) to revise the International Telecommunications Regulations (ITRs), a global treaty governing international telecommunications traffic. The revised International Code of Conduct for Information Security emphasizes the need for multilateral, transparent, and democratic international Internet governance mechanisms to ensure equitable resource distribution and secure Internet functioning. The WCIT, convened by the ITU, aimed to revise the ITRs, a global treaty governing international telecommunications traffic. Key policy questions included how to address Internet traffic and governance. Concerns arose in Congress about potential intergovernmental control over the Internet. The 112th Congress expressed concerns about potential intergovernmental control over the Internet as the WCIT approached. A hearing was held to discuss international proposals to regulate the Internet, leading to the passing of H.Con.Res. 127 in the House to preserve the multistakeholder governance model. The United States has a consistent policy to promote a global Internet free from government control. H.Con.Res. 127 and S.Con.Res. 50 were passed unanimously by the House and Senate, respectively, to preserve the multistakeholder model of Internet governance. S.Con.Res. 50 was passed by the Senate and House unanimously to preserve the multistakeholder model of Internet governance. During the WCIT, a proposal to extend ITR jurisdiction over Internet governance was supported by some countries but later withdrawn. ITU adopted a nonbinding resolution promoting an enabling environment for Internet growth. The ITU adopted a nonbinding resolution titled \"To Foster an enabling environment for the greater growth of the Internet\" as a compromise after a proposal was withdrawn at the WCIT in Dubai. The resolution emphasizes equal government roles in international Internet governance and invites Member States to share their positions on Internet-related issues within the ITU's mandate. The United States declined to sign the treaty due to Resolution 3 and new ITR articles on spam and cybersecurity. The debate over Internet governance is expected to continue in future telecommunications meetings, with the 113th Congress likely monitoring and opposing any proposals for intergovernmental control over the Internet. The 113th Congress is expected to monitor the ongoing debate over Internet governance and oppose any proposals for intergovernmental control. H.R. 1580, introduced by Representative Walden, affirms the U.S. policy to preserve the multistakeholder model governing the Internet. The bill was passed unanimously by the House of Representatives. In October 2013, ICANN and other organizations called for strengthening global multistakeholder Internet cooperation. In October 2013, ICANN and other major organizations released a statement in Montevideo, Uruguay, calling for strengthening global multistakeholder Internet cooperation. They emphasized the importance of globally coherent Internet operations, expressed concern over surveillance undermining trust, and agreed to accelerate the globalization of ICANN and IANA functions. The President of ICANN also met with the President of Brazil to discuss plans for an international Internet governance summit in April. The Montevideo Statement in October 2013 called for accelerating the globalization of ICANN and IANA functions for equal stakeholder participation. A global multistakeholder meeting, NETmundial, was held in April 2014 in Brazil to discuss Internet governance principles and future evolution. The outcome was a nonbinding \"NETmundial Multistakeholder Statement\" reaffirming the multistakeholder model of Internet governance. The outcome of NETmundial in April 2014 produced a nonbinding \"NETmundial Multistakeholder Statement\" that reaffirmed the multistakeholder model of Internet governance. It endorsed the transition of the U.S. government's stewardship role of IANA functions to the global multistakeholder community and emphasized the importance of human rights in implementing a free and open Internet. ICANN announced the formation of a Panel on the Future of Global Internet Cooperation, composed of stakeholders from various sectors, to prepare a report on principles, frameworks, and a roadmap for future Internet governance. The Panel on the Future of Global Internet Cooperation, composed of stakeholders from various sectors, prepared a report on principles, frameworks, and a roadmap for future Internet governance. The report, Towards a Collaborative, Decentralized Internet Governance Ecosystem, was released in May 2014. The creation of a NETmundial Initiative for Internet Governance Cooperation and Development was announced in August 2014. The ITU's Plenipotentiary Conference in Busan, Republic of Korea, concluded in November 2014. The NETmundial Initiative in Brazil aims to apply principles for effective Internet cooperation and governance. The ITU's Plenipotentiary Conference in Busan concluded successfully without expanding its role in Internet governance. Top Level Domains (TLDs) are suffixes at the end of web addresses. Prior to ICANN's establishment, there were eight gTLDs (.com, .org, .net, .gov, .mil, .edu, .int, and .arpa). In 2000 and 2004, ICANN held application rounds for a limited number of new gTLDs; there are currently 22 gTLDs in operation. Some are reserved or restricted to particular types of organizations (e.g., .museum, .gov, .travel) and others are open for registration by anyone (.com, .org, .info). Applicants for new gTLDs are typically commercial and non-profit organizations who seek to become ICANN-recognized registries that will establish and operate name servers for their TLD registry, as well as implement a domain name registration process for that particular TLD. With the growth of the Internet and the accompanying growth in demand for domain names, debate focused on whether and how to further expand the number of gTLDs. Beginning in 2005, ICANN embarked on a long consultative process to develop rules and procedures for introducing and adopting new gTLDs. ICANN embarked on a consultative process to introduce new gTLDs, allowing for an indefinite number of new gTLDs to be approved and added to the domain name system. The new gTLD program, approved in 2011, allowed for potentially hundreds of new gTLDs to be introduced, with applications accepted from January to April 2012 for a fee of $185,000. This program has been controversial, with concerns raised by trademark holders about higher costs and difficulties in protecting their rights. ICANN approved the new gTLD program in 2011, allowing for the introduction of potentially hundreds of new gTLDs. Applications were accepted from January to April 2012 with a fee of $185,000. The program faced controversy due to concerns from trademark holders about higher costs and challenges in protecting their rights. Governments and law enforcement also expressed worries about intellectual property protections and combating cybercrimes across the new gTLDs. The GAC advocated for stricter rules to enhance law enforcement and consumer protection in the new gTLD process. Despite opposition from trademark holders and some parts of the U.S. government, ICANN proceeded with the gTLD expansion in December 2011. ICANN defended the program, stating that new gTLDs would offer more protections and promote competition and innovation in the domain name system. The application window for new gTLDs opened on January 12, 2012, with 1,930 applications received by June 13, 2012. ICANN opened the application window for new gTLDs on January 12, 2012, receiving 1,930 applications by June 13, 2012. The evaluation process for the new gTLDs is complex and could take 9 to 20 months for approval and delegation into the DNS. The approval and delegation of new gTLDs can take 9 to 20 months after the application window closes. ICANN's gTLD Applicant Guidebook outlines the rules and procedures for evaluation. Currently, 521 gTLDs are added to the Internet, with 894 in the process. Concerns exist about domain name abuse as new gTLDs go live. ICANN plans for future rounds with changes to the application process to address issues effectively. In the long term, a systemized approach for applying for gTLDs is being developed. Concerns about domain name abuse, such as trademark infringement and consumer fraud, arise as new gTLDs go live. Legislation has been enacted to create a \"kids-friendly\" top-level domain name for age-appropriate content. The Dot Kids Implementation and Efficiency Act of 2002 authorized the creation of a kids.us domain for age-appropriate content. Legislation for an adult content top-level domain has also been considered in the past. ICANN has explored the possibility of a gTLD for adult content since 2000. ICANN considered creating a \".xxx\" domain for adult websites, sparking controversy. The Department of Commerce and ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee requested more time to address concerns before final approval in 2005. ICANN requested additional time to address objections regarding the creation of a .xxx domain for adult content. The Board initially rejected the proposed agreement but left room for a revised one. A revised agreement was published for public comment in 2007, but the Board ultimately denied the .xxx domain, citing reluctance to manage Internet content. On March 30, 2007, the ICANN Board voted 9-5 to deny the .xxx domain, citing reluctance to manage Internet content. ICM Registry challenged ICANN's decision before an Independent Review Panel, which ruled in favor of ICM Registry on February 19, 2010. The ICANN Board postponed a decision on the .xxx TLD in March 2010. The ICANN Board of Directors voted to allow ICM's .xxx TLD application to move forward after a series of meetings and consultations with the Governmental Advisory Committee. The Board intends to enter into a registry agreement with ICM for the .xxx TLD, despite some conflicts with GAC advice. The ICANN Board approved a resolution to establish the .xxx TLD with ICM Registry, despite conflicts with GAC advice. The .xxx domain became available in December 2011, aiming to enhance Internet security by addressing vulnerabilities in the DNS system. The ICANN Board approved the .xxx top-level domain, with nine in favor, three opposed, and four abstentions. The domain became available in December 2011 to enhance Internet security by addressing vulnerabilities in the DNS system. DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) were developed to mitigate DNS vulnerabilities, ensuring the validity of transmitted DNS addresses through electronic signatures. NTIA issued a Notice of Inquiry seeking public comment on deploying DNSSEC into the Internet's DNS infrastructure. The NTIA issued a Notice of Inquiry seeking public comment on deploying DNSSEC into the Internet's DNS infrastructure, including the authoritative root zone. DNSSEC must be voluntarily adopted by registries, registrars, and DNS server operators worldwide to maximize protection against fraudulent DNS redirection. DNSSEC must be voluntarily adopted by registries, registrars, and DNS server operators worldwide to maximize protection against fraudulent DNS redirection. The WHOIS database's scope and accessibility of information has been a contentious issue, with debates on what data should be publicly available. The WHOIS database's accessibility and scope have been debated by ICANN's GNSO, with a focus on public access to accurate information. Privacy advocates, registries, and registrars support a narrow technical definition, while others prefer a more expansive approach. Discussions have led to the approval of a working definition for WHOIS data display, with ongoing debates on privacy and the option of listing third-party contact information. The GNSO deferred a decision on WHOIS database privacy and recommended more studies, rejecting a proposal for third-party contact information. ICANN initiated four studies of WHOIS in 2011, examining misuse, registrant identification, proxy abuse, and privacy reveal. A WHOIS policy review team issued 16 recommendations for strengthening WHOIS in 2012. The WHOIS policy underwent a review in 2010 and a final report was issued in 2012 with 16 recommendations for improvement. ICANN approved a resolution in 2012 to redefine the purpose of collecting gTLD registration data. An Expert Working Group released recommendations in 2014 for a next-generation Registration Directory Service to replace WHOIS. Intellectual property concerns regarding domain name ownership led to the development of recommendations for trademark/domain name dispute resolutions by WIPO. The ownership and registration of domain names have raised intellectual property concerns. WIPO developed recommendations for trademark/domain name dispute resolutions, which were adopted by ICANN. A dispute resolution policy was implemented in December 1999, with a special procedure for abusive registrations. The Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act was passed by the 106th Congress, giving courts authority to address cybersquatting and cyberpiracy. The Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, passed by the 106th Congress, allows courts to order forfeiture, cancellation, or transfer of domain names registered in \"bad faith\" similar to trademarks. It also provides for civil damages of $1,000 to $100,000 per domain name. The debate over ICANN's addition of new generic top-level domain names is driven by intellectual property concerns, with fears that it could compromise trademark protection. Domain names are also seen as a potential tool to combat online piracy. In the 112th Congress, bills were introduced to address online piracy by prohibiting Internet service providers from directing traffic to domain names with infringing content. ICANN's decisions regarding the DNS can impact policy issues like intellectual property, privacy, e-commerce, and cybersecurity. The key policy question is how to ensure Internet stability, security, competition, and fair representation of the global Internet community. The key policy question surrounding the management of the DNS is how to ensure Internet stability, security, competition, and fair representation of the global Internet community. Controversies like new gTLDs and .xxx have raised concerns about governmental influence over the ICANN policymaking process. Some argue for increased government involvement in developing Internet policies, while others defend the multistakeholder model for its bottom-up, consensus approach. Governments argue for an enhanced role in Internet policy development, while defenders of the multistakeholder model advocate for a bottom-up approach to protect decisions from government control. The 114th Congress will closely examine the proposed transition of ICANN's authority to a multistakeholder-driven entity, ensuring stability, security, and openness of the DNS without U.S. government stewardship. Congress will monitor the transition plan and assess the impact of intergovernmental telecommunications conferences on Internet governance. Congress will monitor the transition of ICANN's authority to a multistakeholder-driven entity to ensure stability, security, and openness of the DNS without U.S. government stewardship. They will also assess the impact of intergovernmental telecommunications conferences on Internet governance, with potential implications for ICANN, the DNS, and the Internet."
