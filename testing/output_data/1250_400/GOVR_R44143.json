    "content": "Under the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, both state and federal governments are prohibited from denying equal protection of the laws. Courts apply different levels of scrutiny based on the classification involved, with strict scrutiny being the most demanding form of review. This higher level of scrutiny increases the likelihood of a court finding the government's action unconstitutional. Increased scrutiny, such as strict scrutiny, raises the likelihood of a court finding governmental action unconstitutional. Strict scrutiny applies to classifications based on race, national origin, and alienage, requiring the government to prove its action is narrowly tailored to a compelling interest. When applying strict scrutiny, reviewing courts consider if governmental action is narrowly tailored to a compelling government interest. The government must prove the constitutional validity of its action under strict scrutiny, showing it cannot achieve its goals through less discriminatory means. Intermediate scrutiny is less strict than strict scrutiny but more stringent than rational basis review, applying to classifications like gender or illegitimacy. Courts determine if governmental action is substantially related to an important government interest under intermediate scrutiny, with the government bearing the burden of proof. Rational basis review is the least strict form of scrutiny, applying to classifications not subject to heightened levels of scrutiny. Rational basis review is the least searching form of judicial scrutiny, applying to classifications not subject to heightened levels of scrutiny. Governmental action must be rationally related to a legitimate government interest to survive this review. Courts consider the legitimacy of any possible governmental purpose behind the action, and the action only needs to be a reasonable way of achieving a legitimate government purpose. Rational basis review is deferential to the government, with courts generally presuming the constitutionality of actions subject to this review. The U.S. Constitution's due process guarantees, found in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, prevent the government from depriving individuals of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. The Supreme Court has interpreted this to include substantive guarantees that protect certain liberty interests. The Constitution's due process language prohibits the government from depriving individuals of life, liberty, or property without following specific procedures. Substantive due process also protects against undue government interference with fundamental rights, subjecting such actions to strict scrutiny. Governmental actions must be narrowly tailored to a compelling interest and cannot encroach on fundamental rights more than necessary. Under strict scrutiny, the government must show a substantial need for its action to further a compelling interest without encumbering fundamental rights more than necessary. The Supreme Court has recognized rights like the right to have children, use contraception, and marry as fundamental. In Obergefell v. Hodges, the Court ruled state same-sex marriage bans unconstitutional, requiring states to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples and recognize same-sex marriages legally formed in other states. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell v. Hodges resolved a circuit split on state same-sex marriage bans, finding them unconstitutional. The Court held that states must issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples and recognize same-sex marriages legally formed in other states, based on the Constitution's due process and equal protection principles. The majority rested its decision on the fundamental right to marry, stating that this right is constitutionally protected for all individuals, including same-sex couples. The Supreme Court extended the fundamental right to marry to same-sex couples, citing reasons such as individual autonomy, support for committed unions, safeguarding children, and marriage's role in the nation's social order. The Court acknowledged a departure from precedent in determining fundamental rights, emphasizing that historical use should not define rights. The Court acknowledged a departure from precedent in determining fundamental rights, emphasizing that historical use should not define rights. The fundamental right to marry was extended to same-sex couples, with the Court recognizing that rights evolve with a better understanding of constitutional imperatives. The Court did not apply strict scrutiny to state same-sex marriage bans, deviating from previous approaches. The Court extended the fundamental right to marry to same-sex couples, invalidating state same-sex marriage bans without applying strict scrutiny. The Court emphasized that equal protection and due process guarantees protect this right. The Court extended the fundamental right to marry to same-sex couples, invalidating state same-sex marriage bans without applying strict scrutiny. The Court emphasized that equal protection and due process guarantees protect this right, without specifying the level of scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation. Some dissenting Justices believed the Court overstepped its role by deciding the issue of same-sex marriage instead of leaving it to the democratic process. The dissenting Justices disagreed with the Supreme Court's decision on same-sex marriage, believing it should have been left to the people to decide. They also expressed concern about the Court establishing a fundamental right based on history and tradition. The decision in Obergefell raised questions about its impact on gay individuals' rights, judicial scrutiny for sexual orientation classifications, plural marriages, and the Court's approach to recognizing fundamental rights. The Obergefell decision raised questions about its impact on the rights of gay individuals, the level of judicial scrutiny for sexual orientation classifications, and the Court's approach to recognizing fundamental rights. The decision was limited to the marriage context and did not address whether classifications based on sexual orientation warrant heightened scrutiny. The Obergefell decision did not address whether classifications based on sexual orientation warrant heightened scrutiny, potentially impacting the rights of gay individuals. Prior to Obergefell, federal appeals courts were divided on the level of scrutiny for such classifications. The Ninth Circuit held that sexual orientation classifications warrant heightened scrutiny, while the Second Circuit found them to be quasi-suspect. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has determined that classifications based on sexual orientation are quasi-suspect, subject to intermediate scrutiny. In contrast, the Sixth Circuit has ruled that such classifications are not suspect or quasi-suspect, only subject to rational basis review. The Obergefell decision focused on the right to marry, leaving unresolved the circuit split on the level of scrutiny for sexual orientation classifications. This ambiguity may lead to future court battles on this issue. The circuit split between the Second, Sixth, and Ninth Circuits on the level of scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation could lead to differing outcomes for laws facing constitutional challenges. This ambiguity may result in some courts applying heightened scrutiny while others apply rational basis review, potentially creating inconsistencies in legal outcomes. The Supreme Court's Obergefell decision also raised questions about this issue. The Supreme Court's Obergefell decision raised questions about whether laws classifying based on sexual orientation could receive different outcomes depending on the evaluating court. Chief Justice John Roberts suggested that the decision could potentially extend the right to marry to polygamy, but the majority opinion seemed crafted to limit its reach to same-sex marriage. The majority found that the fundamental right to marry applies equally to same-sex couples, distinguishing it from plural marriages. The Obergefell decision extended the right to marry to same-sex couples based on fundamental reasons like individual autonomy and family. While some argue that this rationale may not apply to plural marriages, others suggest that it could potentially provide a basis for legalizing plural marriages. The Court's departure from precedent in determining fundamental rights raises the possibility of considering current views in addition to historical recognition. This could lead to an expansion of constitutional protections for various types of marriages. The Court's departure from precedent in determining fundamental rights raises the possibility of considering current views in addition to historical recognition. This could expand the number of rights deemed fundamental, leading to questions about the proper level of judicial scrutiny for governmental actions that interfere with fundamental rights."
