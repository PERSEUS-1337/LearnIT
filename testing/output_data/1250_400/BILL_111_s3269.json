    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Safe Teen and Novice Driver Uniform Protection Act of 2010\" or the \"STANDUP Act.\" Congress finds that motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for Americans aged 15-20, with teenage drivers having significantly higher fatality rates compared to older drivers. Teenage drivers also account for over a third of all fatalities in crashes they are involved in. According to research organizations, teenage drivers have higher crash rates compared to older drivers, with a significant portion of fatalities involving other individuals. The presence of peers in the vehicle increases the risk of a crash for 16-, 17-year-old drivers. Cognitive distraction from cell phones affects teenage drivers' performance, especially those between 15 and 20 years old. Night driving by teenagers poses a higher risk despite occurring less frequently. According to studies, cognitive distraction from cell phones significantly impairs teenage drivers' performance, especially those aged 15 to 20. Despite only 20% of teenage driving occurring at night, over 50% of crash fatalities involving teenage drivers happen during nighttime. Graduated driver licensing systems implemented in certain states have shown a decrease in fatal and injurious crashes among teenage drivers. Between 1995 and 1999, crashes involving 16-year-old drivers decreased by 25% in Michigan and 27% in North Carolina due to the implementation of comprehensive graduated driver licensing systems. In California, teenage passenger deaths and injuries from crashes involving 16-year-old drivers declined by 40% between 1998 and 2000. The National Transportation Safety Board reports that over 40 states have implemented 3-stage graduated driver licensing systems to improve teenage driver safety. Many states have implemented 3-stage graduated driver licensing systems to improve teenage driver safety. A 2001 Harris Poll shows strong support for requirements such as practice driving hours, learner's permit periods, and limits on teenage passengers in cars with teenage drivers. State graduated driver licensing laws are implemented to improve teenage driver safety. State graduated driver licensing laws aim to enhance teenage driver safety by requiring novice drivers under 21 to complete a 2-stage licensing process, including a learner's permit stage with specific restrictions. State graduated driver licensing laws include a learner's permit stage with restrictions on cell phone use and night driving, followed by an intermediate stage with additional restrictions on passengers. State graduated driver licensing laws include restrictions on cell phone use, night driving, and passengers under 21 years old. Additional requirements may include 40 hours of behind-the-wheel training, a driver training course, and other regulations set by the Secretary of Transportation. State graduated driver licensing laws may require at least 40 hours of behind-the-wheel training with a licensed driver over 21 years old, completion of a driver training course, and supervision by a licensed driver over 21 while operating a vehicle. Additionally, individuals convicted of driving-related offenses during the learner's permit or intermediate stage may face automatic delays in obtaining an unrestricted driver's license. State law mandates that individuals convicted of driving-related offenses during the learner's permit or intermediate stage will have their unrestricted driver's license automatically delayed. Offenses include driving while intoxicated, misrepresentation of age, reckless driving, driving without a seat belt, speeding, or any other driving-related offense as determined by the Secretary of Transportation. The Secretary will establish regulations to implement this law. SEC. 4. INCENTIVE GRANTS. For the first 3 fiscal years post-enactment, the Secretary of Transportation will grant funds to compliant States. States must apply with the required information and Governor certification of compliance. Grant amounts are determined based on appropriations and compliance with section 3(a). For the first 3 fiscal years post-enactment, compliant States will receive grants based on appropriations and compliance with section 3(a). Grant funds can be used for enforcing licensing processes, training law enforcement personnel, publishing educational materials, and carrying out administrative activities. The State agency personnel enforce the licensing law, publish educational materials, and carry out administrative activities. $25,000,000 is authorized annually for this purpose from the Highway Trust Fund. SEC. 5. WITHHOLDING OF FUNDS FOR NONCOMPLIANCE. During the fourth fiscal year after enactment, the Secretary will withhold 3% of funds from non-compliant states, increasing to 5% in the fifth year and 10% in subsequent years. During the sixth and subsequent fiscal years, the Secretary will withhold 10% of funds from states not in compliance with section 3(a) of title 23, United States Code. Any funds withheld before the sixth fiscal year will remain available for distribution to the state until the end of the third fiscal year following the appropriation year. Any funds withheld from a State under subsection (a) before the sixth fiscal year will be available for distribution until the end of the third fiscal year following the appropriation year. Funds withheld after the sixth fiscal year may not be distributed to the State. If a State comes into compliance with section 3(a) before the funds are no longer available, the Secretary of Transportation will distribute the withheld amounts to the State. When a State complies with section 3(a), the Secretary of Transportation will distribute any withheld funds to the State. The distributed funds must be spent by the State within three fiscal years, or they will revert back to the Treasury. If a State is not in compliance by the end of the distribution period, the funds will also revert back to the Treasury."
