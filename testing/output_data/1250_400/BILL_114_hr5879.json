The term 'eligible project partner' includes individuals involved in designing, constructing, providing nuclear steam supply systems, supplying nuclear fuel, or having ownership interest in an advanced nuclear power facility eligible for the credit under subsection (a). Special rules apply to partnerships for determining the credit, where a qualified public entity is treated as the taxpayer with respect to their distributive share of the credit, and any partner of the partnership is considered an eligible project partner. The credit must be taken into account in the first taxable year of the eligible project partner ending with, or after, the qualified year.

Effective dates are specified for the amendments."
