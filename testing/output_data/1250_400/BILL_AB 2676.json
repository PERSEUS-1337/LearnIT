    "content": "Section 17052.6 of the Revenue and Taxation Code in California is amended to allow a credit against the \"net tax\" for expenses related to household and dependent care services necessary for gainful employment. The percentage of the allowable federal credit varies based on adjusted gross income, with different percentages for different income brackets. The adjusted gross income determines the percentage of credit for household and dependent care services necessary for gainful employment in California. Different income brackets have varying percentages, with the credit ranging from 0% to 200% based on income levels. Adjusted gross income determines the percentage of credit for household and dependent care services in California. The credit ranges from 0% to 200% based on income levels. For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2019, income brackets have varying percentages, with credits ranging from 65% to 0%. Adjusted gross income determines the percentage of credit for household and dependent care services in California, ranging from 50% for $40,000 or less to 0% for over $100,000. The credit is limited to expenses for household services and care provided in the state, and earned income subject to tax under this part. Compensation for active services in the Armed Forces is also considered. (2) Earned income, as defined in Section 21(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, is limited to income subject to tax under this part. Compensation for active services in the Armed Forces is considered earned income subject to tax, regardless of domicile. Additionally, Section 21(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code is modified to include children as qualifying individuals. For Section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code, a child shall be considered a qualifying individual if they receive over half of their support from the parent with custody for a greater portion of the year. This applies to children whose parents never married and lived apart for the last six months of the year. The child must receive over half of their support from parents who never married and lived apart for the last six months of the year. The child must also be in the custody of one or both parents for more than half of the year. The amendments to this section apply to taxable years starting in 2002 and 2011. This act provides for a tax levy and takes immediate effect."
