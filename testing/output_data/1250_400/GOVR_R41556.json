Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons capability is a major concern, potentially leading to a wider conflict if Israel were to preemptively strike. Iran's strong ties to Syria complicate U.S. efforts in the region. The Middle East presents challenges to U.S. foreign policy with Iran's nuclear ambitions and strong ties to Syria. Despite some improvement in the U.S. image under the Obama Administration, dissatisfaction with U.S. policy in the region persists. Regional actors like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Turkey are taking more responsibility in resolving disputes, reducing U.S. influence. The ongoing war in Afghanistan and failures in the Israeli-Arab peace process also hinder U.S. influence in the broader Middle East.

The region struggles with the global financial crisis, domestic challenges, and human rights issues. The United States advocates for economic and political reform to address these challenges. Congressional considerations include responses to Palestinian divisions, Hamas' control of Gaza, Israeli settlements, and obstacles to the peace process amidst budget constraints. General questions for congressional consideration include how the 112th Congress will respond to Palestinian divisions, Hamas' control of Gaza, Israeli settlements, and obstacles to the peace process in the Middle East. Additionally, how the United States will continue to support regional initiatives amidst budget constraints, address radical regimes like Iran and Syria, and balance counterterrorism strategies with diplomatic efforts in Arab regimes. Members of Congress may also face issues related to the war in Afghanistan, terrorism, and foreign assistance. Members of the 112th Congress may face various issues in the Middle East, including terrorism, foreign assistance, and the global financial crisis. There is a growing international consensus to impose stricter economic sanctions on Iran to halt its nuclear development. The United States and its allies have imposed sanctions on Iran to hinder its nuclear development, focusing on targeting Iran's energy sector and isolating it from the international financial system. Efforts to restrict international investment in Iran's energy sector began in 1996 with the Iran Sanctions Act, which has since been expanded with the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010. These measures aim to persuade foreign companies to choose between the Iranian market and the much larger U.S. market. The U.S. has broadened efforts to persuade foreign firms to choose between the Iranian market and the larger U.S. market. The Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 expanded measures to restrict Iran's gasoline imports and access to the U.S. market. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1929 imposed a ban on heavy weapons sales to Iran, while EU sanctions prohibit involvement in Iran's energy sector. The U.N. Security Council Resolution 1929 imposes a ban on heavy weapons sales to Iran and sanctions Iranian entities linked to the Revolutionary Guard. EU sanctions also restrict involvement in Iran's energy sector. Major economic powers like Japan and South Korea have imposed similar restrictions on Iran. The sanctions are impacting Iran's economy, with many international firms exiting the Iranian market. However, there is no consensus on whether the sanctions are affecting Iran's nuclear program. The 112th Congress may consider additional measures against Iran. Many international firms are exiting the Iranian market due to sanctions, but it is unclear if these sanctions are affecting Iran's nuclear program. The 112th Congress may consider additional measures against Iran. The United States and Israel have strong bilateral relations based on shared strategic goals and democratic values, with U.S. foreign aid playing a significant role in reinforcing these ties. U.S. foreign aid has been crucial in strengthening the bilateral relations between the United States and Israel since the creation of Israel in 1948. Despite some disagreements over certain issues, such as Israeli settlements and arms sales, successive Administrations and lawmakers have viewed Israel as a reliable partner in the region. Critics argue that U.S. aid exacerbates tensions in the Middle East, with some claiming it indirectly causes suffering to Palestinians. However, Congress has consistently taken measures to enhance Israel's security and maintain its military edge over neighboring countries, with the Obama Administration reaffirming its commitment to this in 2010. The U.S. has consistently supported Israel's Qualitative Military Edge (QME) since 1948. The Obama Administration reaffirmed this commitment in 2010, emphasizing the importance of Israel's security for national security. The 112th Congress may focus on U.S. aid to Israel, including $3 billion in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) for FY2011. Additionally, defense appropriations for co-research and development of missile defense systems, such as the Iron Dome, have been authorized and appropriated by Congress.

President Obama emphasized the importance of Israeli-Palestinian peace for U.S. national security interests. President Obama declared Israeli-Palestinian peace a U.S. national security interest due to its impact on relations in the Middle East. His call for a settlement freeze in the West Bank led to brief proximity talks, but settlements remained a barrier. Despite efforts to secure a freeze, Israel continued settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, hindering progress in peace talks. The US Administration offered incentives to Israel for a settlement freeze in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, but abandoned the effort in December. Final status issues in negotiations include borders, security, Jerusalem, refugees, and water. Congress remains interested in the Arab-Israeli peace process and has introduced resolutions regarding Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Foreign operations appropriations legislation restricts US official conduct with the Palestinian Authority in Jerusalem. In the 111th Congress, resolutions were introduced to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and relocate the U.S. embassy there. Congress emphasized an undivided Jerusalem as Israel's capital. The Obama Administration views Jerusalem as a final status issue for negotiation. Legislation also required a new Palestinian state to act peacefully and counter terrorism. Congress supported Israel's right to self-defense against rocket attacks and a flotilla attempting to break Israel's blockade of Gaza. In the 112th Congress, legislation may revisit moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem and conditions for a new Palestinian state.

Enhanced oversight of U.S. security assistance to Saudi Arabia may be considered by Congress. The 112th Congress may focus on U.S. counterterrorism policy in Yemen due to the threat of Yemen-based terrorists targeting the U.S. homeland. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) has attempted attacks, and American citizen Anwar al Awlaki has been linked to radicalizing individuals for terrorist activities. Congress may seek to alter U.S. security assistance to Saudi Arabia and may not enjoy expedited procedural privileges for new legislation under the Arms Export Control Act. Anwar al Awlaki, a radical ideologue of AQAP, has been linked to radicalizing individuals for terrorist activities, including Major Nidal M. Hasan, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, and Faisal Shahzad. The Obama Administration is considering increasing assistance and intelligence cooperation with Yemen without militarizing the U.S. presence there. Reports suggest the CIA may use drones in Yemen or place U.S. military units under JSOC control. U.S. intelligence agencies may have limited knowledge of the local terrain in Yemen. The U.S. military may have limited presence in Yemen, leading to potential challenges in utilizing all assets effectively. Congress may debate the balance between counterterrorism efforts and stabilizing Yemen, with some lawmakers advocating for increased U.S. military involvement. There could be calls for Yemen to cooperate in apprehending wanted AQAP operatives like Awlaki.

Disagreements over Yemen's policy of releasing alleged terrorists to appease tribal leaders and domestic politicians have caused tensions with U.S. lawmakers. In Iraq, despite peaceful elections, ethnic and factional infighting has delayed the formation of a new government. U.S. intervention helped break the deadlock, leading to the agreement on key leadership positions. Since the 2010 national elections in Iraq, major factions reached an agreement with U.S. intervention to form a new government, but concerns remain about Iranian influence and potential conflicts between Kurdish and Arab groups. Despite a reduction in U.S. forces, ongoing violence and political uncertainty persist, raising doubts about long-term stability after the U.S. withdrawal in 2011. The violence in Iraq has led to uncertainty and concerns about stability after the U.S. withdrawal in 2011. Some experts fear Iraq could become a \"failed state\" without continued U.S. presence.

Challenges include sectarian tension due to pending STL indictments and Hezbollah's rejection of potential charges. Observers question U.S. support for Hariri amid escalating rhetoric and conflicting statements. Sayyid Hassan Nasrallah rejects potential indictment as a U.S. and Israeli attack on the \"resistance.\" Hezbollah's opposition to STL indictments could impact Hariri's government legitimacy and U.S. support. U.S. assistance to Lebanon may be affected by changes in government, especially if Hezbollah gains more power. The LAF's clash with IDF along the Blue Line adds to tensions.

The U.S. is concerned about election irregularities in Egypt, including disruption of opposition campaigns, arrests of supporters, and media access denial. Congress has provided $1.5 billion in aid annually, with funding for democracy promotion being controversial. The Egyptian government opposes foreign support for NGOs working on political reform. During the Bush Administration, Economic Support Funds were directed towards USAID programming in democracy and governance in Egypt. Congress allocated $25 million for democracy promotion in FY2010, but U.S. democracy assistance has decreased as overall economic aid to Egypt has decreased. Some analysts suggest the Obama Administration may de-emphasize democracy assistance to ease tensions with the Egyptian government, while others argue for more effective aid allocation. The Obama Administration may reduce democracy assistance to Egypt to improve relations, while some argue for more effective aid allocation. Despite efforts to weaken Al Qaeda, the organization remains a threat with regional affiliates and appeal to some Muslims. Al Qaeda operatives are determined to attack the U.S. and exploit vulnerabilities. Al Qaeda operatives remain determined to attack the United States and exploit vulnerabilities.
