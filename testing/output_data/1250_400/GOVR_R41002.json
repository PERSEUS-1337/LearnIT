    "content": "Increasing pressures on water supplies are leading to changes in operations at Corps facilities to meet municipal and industrial demands. Corps reallocations at Lake Lanier are causing conflict between Alabama, Florida, and Georgia. The agency is considering reallocating storage for M&I use at dams in various states, with more requests expected. Reallocation involves tradeoffs, affecting benefits and stakeholders. The federal role in M&I water supply development is limited, with states and local entities playing a key role as recognized in the 1958 Water Supply Act. The federal government recognizes state primacy in developing water supplies for domestic, municipal, industrial, and other purposes. Federal investments in water resources infrastructure primarily support flood control, navigation, irrigation, multipurpose dams, and diversion facilities. The largest federal projects are constructed by the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers. Since the 1960s, construction of large federal dams has slowed due to high costs, ecological and social impacts, and site availability. Reservoir planning now focuses on balancing objectives for existing reservoirs and managing for new goals. Congress authorizes the Corps to build dams and water infrastructure, operated to meet authorized purposes and comply with federal laws. The Corps is authorized by Congress to construct dams and water infrastructure for specific purposes, including M&I storage. Additional requirements such as fish and wildlife protection and recreation benefits are also included for all Corps facilities. The Corps has limited authority to provide M&I water supply under the 1958 WSA and the Flood Control Act of 1944. The Corps has authority to provide benefits like recreation from its projects. The 1958 WSA and Flood Control Act of 1944 give limited authority for M&I water supply. The report focuses on the implementation of the 1958 WSA by the Corps and data on reservoir storage reallocation. The 1944 authority is not likely to play a significant role in future water reallocation. For legal issues related to the 1958 WSA, refer to CRS Report R40714 by Cynthia Brougher. Congress provided the Corps with general M&I water supply authority in the 1958 WSA. In the 1958 Water Supply Act (WSA), Congress granted the Corps authority for municipal and industrial (M&I) water supply, but limited decision-making without congressional approval. Modifications to reservoir projects for water supply must not seriously affect the project's original purposes without Congress approval. The reallocation of water supply needs congressional authorization if it significantly impacts the facility's original purposes or operations. The criteria for determining the seriousness of the impact or the magnitude of the change were not defined by Congress. The 1958 Water Supply Act granted the Corps authority for municipal and industrial water supply, with limitations on decision-making without congressional approval. Modifications to reservoir projects for water supply must not significantly affect the original purposes without Congress approval. The Corps developed guidance for determining when reallocation does not require congressional approval, setting criteria based on storage capacity and reallocation limits. The 1958 Water Supply Act granted the Corps authority for municipal and industrial water supply, with limitations on decision-making without congressional approval. Modifications to reservoir projects for water supply must not significantly affect the original purposes without Congress approval. Earlier guidance did not include numeric criteria, but now water supply purposes are considered insignificant if the total reallocation of storage is not greater than 15% of total capacity or 50,000 acre feet, whichever is less. Recent court decisions have raised questions about the Corps' discretionary authority and reallocations at Lake Lanier, leading to lawsuits consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida in 2007. A 2009 court order addressed whether the Corps violated the 1958 WSA by not seeking congressional approval for changes made in Lake Lanier operations for municipal and industrial water supply. The court largely agreed with litigants who argued that congressional approval was necessary. The court order largely agreed with Florida, Alabama, the Alabama Power Company, and the Southeastern Federal Power Customers, finding that the Corps violated the 1958 WSA by reallocating storage in Lake Lanier for M&I water supply without seeking congressional approval. The court estimated that over 21% of Lake Lanier's storage had been reallocated since the mid-1970s, exceeding the Corps' discretionary authority. This has raised questions about the impact on M&I water supply for communities in northern Georgia. The court found that the Corps exceeded its discretionary authority by reallocating storage space in Lake Lanier for M&I water supply without congressional approval. This has raised concerns about the reallocation of water at other Corps facilities, including 135 reservoirs with 11 million acre-feet of storage for M&I water. The 1958 WSA is the basis for a small portion of the Corps' M&I storage, with Lake Texoma being reallocated over 50,000 AF for M&I use. The Corps has reallocated over 50,000 AF of storage space for M&I use at Lake Texoma, with four reallocations approved, including one for 84,099 AF. The reallocation was made in 1985 with compensation for lost hydropower, and the Corps found it would not significantly harm the lake's authorized purposes. The reallocation at Cowanesque Lake in PA exceeds the 15% usable storage criterion, representing almost 30% of storage. The Corps reallocated water supply at Cowanesque Lake under the 1958 WSA without congressional approval, exceeding the agency's policy limit. The reallocation was mentioned in P.L. 99-88 and evaluated for potential effects on authorized purposes. The Corps evaluates potential effects of reallocations on authorized purposes and operational changes. Concerns raised by a 2009 court order question the sufficiency of Corps analyses related to Lake Lanier operations. Unauthorized withdrawals for M&I uses at Lake Cumberland have not been authorized or stopped. Many Corps facilities have unknown unauthorized withdrawals and operational actions supporting M&I uses. Unauthorized M&I withdrawals at Lake Cumberland have not been authorized or stopped. The extent of unauthorized withdrawals and operational actions supporting M&I uses at other Corps facilities is largely unknown. The Corps' operation of Lake Lanier for M&I water supply has been controversial, with concerns raised about reallocations at other facilities and uncertainty about future reallocation processes. Most reallocations have occurred without national attention or litigation, either through the Corps' authority or congressional direction. Existing reallocations under the 1958 WSA have generally met the Corps' criteria, but questions arise regarding the agency's discretionary authority in M&I reallocation at federal facilities. Issues include how to handle multiple reallocations in a basin, the agency's discretion in agreements with stakeholders, and unauthorized withdrawals. As interest in reallocations grows, policies may need reevaluation, especially regarding the transition process if M&I reallocations are approved. The current policies on M&I reallocations at Corps facilities involve decisions on financial arrangements and handling unauthorized withdrawals. Questions arise about how to transition reallocations, charge for storage space, and credit return flows. These issues are part of broader water policy questions for Congress, including the federal role in municipal water supply and adapting to climate change effects. The complexity of addressing these questions is compounded by existing water infrastructure operations and institutions. The federal role in municipal water supply and potential changes due to climate change effects are complex issues with varying opinions on the proper response. Enacting any changes to federal facilities is challenging due to the numerous affected constituencies."
