    "content": "The people of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges the disproportionate impact of drought on areas heavily reliant on groundwater. While state programs assist communities with water needs, there is no similar assistance for individual homeowners with groundwater wells. The program created by this act aims to provide low-interest loans and grants to individual homeowners for improving drinking water and wastewater treatment. This includes actions like digging deeper wells, addressing water contaminants, and connecting to local water systems. The board will establish a program to offer loans and grants to local agencies and eligible applicants for purposes such as extending service lines, connecting to water systems, and closing abandoned septic tanks and wells for health and safety reasons. The Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund is established in the State Treasury to provide financial assistance for various water-related projects, such as connecting service lines, improving wells, and installing water treatment systems. The board has the authority to adopt regulations to support the program's objectives without following the usual rulemaking process. The Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund is created in the State Treasury for water-related projects. Moneys in the fund can be used by the board upon legislative appropriation. Eligible loan applicants must have a household income below the statewide median, own the residence, lack financial assistance from private lenders, and demonstrate ability to repay the loan. An eligible applicant for a grant from the Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund must have ownership of the residence, be unable to obtain financial assistance from private lenders, demonstrate ability to repay the loan, and meet specific criteria. The loan granted will be secured by a mortgage on the residence, repaid within 20 years with a 1 percent interest rate, and require homeowner's insurance. The board may partner with a private financial institution to provide loans and utilize funds for loan guarantees. An eligible applicant for a grant must have a household income below 60% of the statewide median, own the residence, and be unable to secure financial assistance from private lenders. Recipients must repay the grant if they sell the residence within five years or return any unused funds. $10 million is transferred to the Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund. This act is deemed urgent for public peace, health, or safety. Ten million dollars is transferred from the General Fund to the Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund for providing eligible households with access to safer drinking water and wastewater treatment during California's drought. This act is deemed urgent for public peace, health, or safety.
