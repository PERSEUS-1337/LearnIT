    "content": "Federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs have been in existence since the National Defense Education Act of 1958. These programs offer borrowers the opportunity to have their student loan debt forgiven or repaid in exchange for work in specific fields or professions. Over 50 such programs are authorized, with around 30 operational as of October 1, 2017. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs are created by the federal government to forgive or repay a portion of an individual's student loan debt in exchange for meeting certain requirements, such as working in public service or specific occupations. These programs aim to provide financial incentives for individuals to enter or remain in these fields. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs are designed to support individuals in public service or specific occupations by providing financial incentives. These programs offer debt relief to borrowers of federal student loans who choose to enter public service or follow an income-driven repayment plan. Other forms of debt relief may also be available for borrowers facing certain unfortunate circumstances. One of the earliest federal student loan forgiveness programs was the NDSL program, established in response to the Soviet Union's launch of the Sputnik satellite in 1957. Various forms of debt relief are available to borrowers facing specific circumstances, such as total disability, death, school closure, false certification, unauthorized loans, unpaid refunds, successful defense to repayment, and bankruptcy discharge. The NDSL program, established in response to the Soviet Union's launch of the Sputnik satellite in 1957, provided low-interest loans to college students. It also included a student loan forgiveness component for those who taught full-time in public schools, with up to half of their loans cancelled. The NDSL program, established in response to the Soviet Union's launch of the Sputnik satellite in 1957, provided low-interest loans to college students. Congress authorized a student loan forgiveness component for those who taught full-time in public schools, with benefits expanded over the years to include teachers in schools with low-income students or disabilities, Head Start program participants, and those in the Armed Forces. Qualified borrowers could have a portion of their loans canceled based on years of public service. The NDSL program, established in response to the Soviet Union's launch of the Sputnik satellite in 1957, provided low-interest loans to college students. Qualified borrowers became eligible to have a portion of their loans canceled based on the number of years of public service completed. The program was later renamed the Federal Perkins Loan Program and additional federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs were established for other professions and high-need areas. Over 50 such programs currently exist. Currently, there are over 50 federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs authorized by federal law. These programs aim to provide student loan debt relief to borrowers in various professions and high-need areas. The report identifies and describes these programs, offering brief summaries of their purpose and operation. Readers seeking comprehensive details are encouraged to refer to additional resources such as federal statutes, regulations, and agency guidance. Over 50 federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs are authorized under federal law, each designed to provide debt relief to borrowers through specified service, professions, locations, or income-driven repayment plans. These programs vary in eligibility criteria, benefit amounts, funding, and means of providing benefits. This overview identifies parameters to characterize the programs and ensures consistency in terminology used for benefits. Several parameters are used to broadly characterize authorized federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs. Borrowers must meet specific criteria such as working in certain professions or locations, or adhering to income-driven repayment plans to qualify for benefits. At the end of a specified period, a portion of the individual's student loan debt is forgiven or repaid. This relieves the individual of responsibility for repaying that portion of their debt. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs require borrowers to meet specific criteria, such as working in certain professions or adhering to income-driven repayment plans. At the end of a specified period, a portion of the individual's student loan debt is forgiven or repaid, relieving them of that responsibility. Loan forgiveness benefits are broadly available to qualified borrowers, while loan repayment benefits are subject to availability and discretion. Loan forgiveness benefits are available to borrowers of qualified loans, outlined in loan documents. Eligible borrowers are entitled to benefits funded through mandatory appropriations. There are two categories: public service employment forgiveness and income-driven repayment forgiveness. Loan repayment programs offer debt relief for specific service, profession, or location. Loan repayment programs provide debt relief for borrowers through either direct repayment or funding to a separate entity. These programs are separate from federal student loan programs and aim to address employment needs or shortages, as well as help federal agencies recruit and retain qualified employees. Loan repayment benefits are limited and serve as additional compensation for targeted employees. Loan repayment benefits are available to help federal agencies recruit and retain qualified employees. These benefits are discretionary and subject to fund availability. The tax liability on forgiven debt varies depending on the type of loan forgiveness program. Employment-focused loan forgiveness programs exclude forgiven debt from gross income for federal tax purposes, while income-driven repayment or public service employment forgiveness may result in a tax liability for the borrower. The borrower may not be responsible for paying federal income tax on forgiven debt from employment-focused loan forgiveness programs. However, debt forgiven through income-driven repayment or public service employment may result in a tax liability for the borrower. Loan forgiveness programs can include federal student loans under Title IV of the Higher Education Act. Federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs cover three categories of loans: federal student loans under Title IV of the Higher Education Act, student loans under Title VII and Title VIII of the Public Health Service Act, and private education loans. Eligible loans for forgiveness and repayment typically include federal student loans, with some programs also including private education loans. Federal student loans are currently only made through the Direct Loan program authorized under Part D of Title IV. Loans eligible for forgiveness or repayment include federal student loans made through the Direct Loan program under Part D of Title IV. Previously, federal student loans were also made through the FFEL program until June 30, 2010, and the Federal Perkins Loan program until September 30, 2017. In the Direct Loan program, loans are government-funded and administered by ED, while in the FFEL program, loans were made by nonfederal lenders. In the Direct Loan program, loans are made by the government with federal capital, while in the FFEL program, loans were made by nonfederal lenders. Nonprofit guaranty agencies administer federal loan insurance and process loan forgiveness benefits. Loan types in both programs had similar borrower terms and conditions, with differences in availability of loan forgiveness benefits noted. Perkins Loans were made by institutions of higher education with a combination of federal and institutional capital. The Perkins Loan program involves loans made by institutions of higher education with federal and institutional capital. Direct Subsidized Loans in the Direct Loan program are available to undergraduate students with financial need, with interest charges subsidized by the government during specific periods. Direct Subsidized Loans are available to undergraduate students with financial need, with interest charges subsidized by the government during specific periods. Borrowing limits restrict the amounts that students may borrow, and in FY2017, 6.2 million Direct Subsidized Loans were made. Direct Unsubsidized Loans are available to undergraduate, graduate, and professional students without the need to demonstrate financial need. Loan proceeds can be used to finance portions of a student's cost of attendance, with the borrower responsible for paying all accrued interest. In FY2017, 8.1 million Direct Unsubsidized Loans totaling $49.8 billion were made. Direct PLUS Loans are available to parents of undergraduate students and graduate/professional students. Borrowers are responsible for paying all accrued interest on the loan. There are no explicit limits on the amount that can be borrowed in PLUS Loans. In FY2017, Direct PLUS Loans totaling $22.4 billion were made to parents of undergraduate students and graduate/professional students. Direct Consolidation Loans allow borrowers to combine federal student loans into a single loan and extend their repayment period. Consolidation Loans allow borrowers to combine federal student loans from various programs, including Direct Loan and FFEL programs, as well as other authorized programs. This flexibility enables borrowers to access loan forgiveness and repayment benefits. Direct Consolidation Loans have a fixed interest rate based on the weighted average of consolidated loans. In FY2017, Direct Consolidation Loans totaling $48.8 billion were made, with interest rates based on the weighted average of consolidated loans. Perkins Loans, available to undergraduate and graduate students, have a fixed interest rate of 5% and offer loan cancellation for public service. Additionally, HRSA offers student loans to health professions students through various programs authorized under the PHSA. In FY2017, HRSA made approximately 253,000 Perkins Loans totaling $782.23 million, with loan cancellation for public service. HRSA also offers student loans to health professions students through five programs, including loans for dentistry, optometry, pharmacy, podiatric medicine, veterinary medicine, allopathic, and osteopathic medicine. In academic year 2016-2017, HRSA estimated making 20,849 loans totaling $162.8 million. The HRSA offers student loans for health professions students, including those pursuing degrees in allopathic or osteopathic medicine. The program provides fixed interest rate loans to financially needy students who must complete a residency in a primary care field and practice in that field for 10 years. Failure to meet service requirements results in higher interest rates for loan repayment. Additionally, the program offers need-based, low interest rate loans to students from disadvantaged backgrounds. The HRSA offers student loans for health professions students, including those pursuing degrees in allopathic or osteopathic medicine, with fixed interest rates for financially needy students. Loans are provided for primary care fields with a requirement to practice for 10 years. Loans are also available for students from disadvantaged backgrounds pursuing degrees in nursing. The Nursing Faculty Loan Program provides loans to nursing students pursuing diploma, associate, baccalaureate, or graduate degrees. Administered by nursing schools, it targets financially needy U.S. citizens, nationals, or lawful permanent residents. In 2016-2017, HRSA issued 10,138 loans totaling $31.8 million. Additionally, the program supports registered nurses completing graduate studies to become qualified nursing school faculty. Nursing schools offer loans for eligible advanced masters or doctoral degree programs, with loan forgiveness options available. In the same academic year, 1,998 loans totaling $27.3 million were provided. The Health Education Assistance Loans (HEAL) program, authorized in Title VII, Part A-I of the PHSA, no longer makes new loans but continues to administer outstanding loans. HEAL program loans supported students pursuing degrees in various healthcare fields and were phased out between 1995 and 1999. Borrowers of HEAL loans are still responsible for repayment. In addition to federal student loan programs, private financial institutions, state-supported programs, and IHEs also offer student loans known as private or alternative loans. Private student loans are offered by nonfederal entities like banks, credit unions, state-supported programs, and IHEs. These loans have specific terms set by the lender. While not part of federal programs, some federal loan repayment programs offer benefits to borrowers. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs aim to provide debt relief to eligible borrowers, each with unique features. The report outlines different categories of debt relief programs, including loan forgiveness entitlement programs, with specific qualifying criteria and program components such as types of qualifying service, economic circumstances, debt relief amounts, and exclusions. For more program-specific details, refer to Appendix A. The report categorizes debt relief programs based on their availability to borrowers, starting with loan forgiveness entitlement programs. These programs include loan forgiveness for public service and income-driven repayment plans. Next are programs for loan repayment in broad public service or employment, followed by programs for public service in government employment. Loan forgiveness for public service employment offers debt relief to qualified borrowers in specific occupations. Loan forgiveness for public service employment provides debt relief to qualified borrowers in certain occupations or in public service. These benefits are entitlements for federal student loans and are available to an open-ended number of qualified borrowers. Table 1 summarizes the various programs offered, highlighting eligibility criteria based on employer and occupation requirements. Table 1 summarizes loan forgiveness benefits available to borrowers based on employer and occupation requirements. Eligibility criteria include specific types of service or occupation. Programs are ranked by the scale of benefits offered. Loan forgiveness is accessible to a wide range of borrowers, but specific criteria must be met, such as serving as a teacher. Loan forgiveness benefits are available to a wide range of borrowers based on specific eligibility criteria, including completing a certain type of service or entering a particular occupation. Programs like Federal Perkins Loan Cancellation and Direct Loan Public Service Loan Forgiveness are accessible to teachers and individuals in public service occupations. Borrowers must serve for a minimum period of time, ranging from 1 year to 10 years. Loan forgiveness following income-driven repayment provides debt relief based on income proportion repayment over an extended period. Loans under forgiveness programs require a minimum service commitment of 1 to 10 years. Debt relief is provided through income-driven repayment plans for borrowers who repay based on their income but have not fully repaid their student loans. These benefits are entitlements written into federal student loan terms. The programs are available to a large number of qualified borrowers and are separate from public service employment programs. Table 2 summarizes the various loan forgiveness programs following income-driven repayment. Table 2 summarizes various loan forgiveness programs available to borrowers who meet income-driven qualifications. These programs do not have specific employer or occupational requirements, but borrowers must make monthly payments towards their federal student loans for a specified period. Loan forgiveness or repayment programs do not have specific employer or occupational requirements. Borrowers must make monthly payments towards their federal student loans for a specified period (between 20 and 25 years) based on factors like debt amount, family size, and income. Monthly payments are capped at a percentage of discretionary income (between 10% and 20%). At the end of the repayment period, the remaining loan balance is forgiven. Public service employment loan repayment benefits specific occupations or employers, providing debt relief to borrowers in public service. Loan repayment for public service employment offers debt relief benefits to borrowers in specific occupations or employers. These programs are not entitlements and are subject to limited availability and program funds. Loan forgiveness programs do not have specific employer or occupational requirements and involve making monthly payments towards federal student loans for a specified period. Loan repayment programs for public service employment are available to qualified borrowers and subject to program funds. These programs are smaller in scale compared to loan forgiveness programs. Table 3 summarizes various loan repayment programs based on employment needs and eligibility criteria, including employer and occupational requirements, as well as economic circumstances. Programs are organized by operational status and administering department or agency. Unlike loan forgiveness programs, these programs have specific eligibility components. Table 3 displays 19 loan repayment programs for public service employment, categorized by operational status and administering department. These programs target various occupations, with a focus on health-related professions, legal occupations, and large animal veterinarians providing emergency services. Borrowers must meet specific eligibility criteria, including economic circumstances. Loan repayment programs target various occupations, including health care providers and faculty, legal professions, and large animal veterinarians. Borrowers may work for multiple employers but may be required to serve in specific geographic areas. Service commitments typically last between one and five years. Loan repayment programs for federal government employees are narrowly targeted to meet agency-specific needs. Loan repayment programs for federal government employees have service commitments lasting between one and five years. These programs are narrowly targeted to meet agency-specific recruitment and retention needs and are potentially the smallest in scale. Information on the programs' scale is not readily available, but the Office of Personnel Management reports annually on the number of agencies participating and the amount of benefits received. Table 4 summarizes the various loan repayment programs offered by federal agencies for recruiting and retaining qualified employees. Table 4 summarizes federal agencies' loan repayment programs for recruiting and retaining qualified employees, organized by operational status and administering department or agency. Unlike loan forgiveness programs, these programs are not grouped by availability or financial resources. Table 4 summarizes federal agencies' loan repayment programs for recruiting and retaining qualified employees. These programs vary in availability to employees and are designed to recruit and retain members of the Armed Forces. Some programs are open to any agency employee, while others target specific fields or occupations designated as hard-to-fill. Borrowers participating in these programs must serve for a minimum period of time. Loan repayment programs are available to employees in designated fields or occupations, with service commitments typically between one and five years. Eligibility may be based on economic circumstances, with some programs considering borrower's situation at the time of borrowing and others during the repayment period. Economic circumstances are one factor alongside qualifying service types for debt relief programs. Loan repayment programs can be based on economic circumstances at the time of borrowing or during the repayment period. Eligibility may consider factors such as disadvantaged backgrounds or high monthly loan payments. Programs offer forgiveness or repayment benefits based on the borrower's outstanding balance, a flat dollar amount, or a percentage of the loan. Several programs offer to forgive the entire amount of an individual's outstanding student loans by requiring a certain number of payments towards the balance. Benefits may also be awarded by employers in the form of a flat dollar amount or a percentage of outstanding loans. Some programs offer varying flat rates based on the type of service performed, while others pay a percentage of the borrower's outstanding loans. Some loan forgiveness and repayment programs offer regular payments or varying flat rates based on service type. Restrictions may apply, such as ineligibility for defaulted loans or receiving benefits from multiple programs. U.S. citizenship may be required, and penalties may apply for not completing service terms. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs have eligibility requirements, including U.S. citizenship, and penalties for not completing service terms. Some programs do not allow individuals to benefit from multiple programs for the same service. Participants may become eligible for benefits once their obligation under one program is completed. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs have eligibility requirements, including U.S. citizenship. Some programs restrict benefits if individuals are already receiving benefits from another program, but they may become eligible once their obligation under the first program is completed. Certain programs specifically require participants to be U.S. citizens, nationals, or legal permanent residents, while others may only be available to these groups based on the type of loan eligible for forgiveness or repayment. For example, federal student loans under the Higher Education Act are only available to specified eligible noncitizens. The availability of programs like the PSLF program, which is only for Direct Loan program loans, is restricted based on a borrower's citizenship and immigration status at the time the loans were obtained. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs have eligibility requirements based on U.S. citizenship and immigration status. Availability of benefits may be restricted for defaulted loans, depending on the program. For example, in the Direct Loan Stafford Loan Forgiveness for Teachers program, borrowers may be ineligible for forgiveness on defaulted loans unless satisfactory repayment arrangements are made. In the Perkins Loan Cancellation program, borrowers with defaulted loans that have not been accelerated may still qualify for forgiveness. In federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs, borrowers who have defaulted loans may still qualify for forgiveness if they have made satisfactory repayment arrangements. Clawback provisions may require participants to repay the unearned portion of benefits or the full amount received, plus interest and punitive fees in some cases. Borrowers may be exempt from liability in certain programs. Some federal loan forgiveness programs may require participants to repay the unearned portion of benefits or the full amount received, plus interest and punitive fees. Student loan debt forgiveness or repayment may be included in gross income for taxation, but certain programs exempt borrowers from this liability. Some federal loan forgiveness programs may require repayment of benefits. Loan forgiveness or repayment may be excluded from gross income for taxation under certain conditions, such as specified in IRC Section 108(f). Loans must have been borrowed for education, with terms for cancellation based on work in specific professions or for certain employers. Exclusions are also provided for programs like the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment program and state programs under the Public Health Service Act. The IRC Section 108(f)(4) provides exclusions for certain loan forgiveness programs, including the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment program and state programs under the Public Health Service Act. Individuals may be responsible for paying income tax on forgiven loans if not excluded by statute. Some loan forgiveness programs offer supplemental funds to offset tax liability. Approximately $200 million in revenue was lost in FY2017 due to the exclusion of forgiven loan income from taxation. The exclusion of forgiven loan income from taxation can lead to tax savings for recipients of loan forgiveness and repayment benefits. However, this exclusion resulted in a loss of approximately $200 million in revenue in FY2017. Researchers debate the effectiveness of loan forgiveness programs in incentivizing borrowers to enter specific fields or government service. Key issues include whether individuals would enter these fields without debt relief, if student loan debt is the main barrier, and if debt relief encourages students to rely more on loans for education expenses. The analysis discusses the effectiveness of loan forgiveness and repayment programs in incentivizing individuals to enter specific fields or government service. It considers whether student loan debt is the main barrier and if debt relief encourages students to rely more on loans for education expenses. The cost of these programs to the federal government relative to the benefits received is also examined. The influence of loan forgiveness and repayment programs on employment choices is assessed by comparing career paths of recipients with those without access to such benefits. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) studied loan repayment recipients in its Intramural Research Program (IRP) to encourage medical research careers. The NIH studied loan repayment recipients in its Intramural Research Program (IRP) to encourage medical research careers. Individuals who received loan repayment benefits were more likely to continue conducting medical research at the NIH and pursue a career as a medical researcher even if they left the NIH. This suggests that the program may be meeting its goals, although other factors may also influence individuals' career choices. The loan repayment program at NIH may not be the sole reason for individuals to stay in targeted positions. Other research suggests that some individuals would have entered certain fields or taken specific jobs even without loan repayments. Factors like job availability and personal career interests also play a role in career decisions. Loan forgiveness programs may not always be necessary if individuals would have chosen the same path regardless. Loan repayment programs may not always be necessary as some individuals would have taken certain jobs even without the benefits. However, evidence shows that in some cases, participants would not have accepted a position without loan repayment. For example, the NIH found that loan repayment was a key factor in attracting physicians to stay in research positions. Loan repayment programs can be effective in recruiting and retaining staff in federal agencies. Loan repayment benefits are effective in retaining staff in federal agencies, including physicians in research positions at the NIH. However, the uncertainty of funding for discretionary programs and the insufficient incentive of award amounts may hinder the effectiveness of loan repayment programs in recruiting and retaining individuals in certain professions. Loan repayment programs may not provide sufficient financial incentives for individuals to enter and stay in certain professions. Some programs, like the Government Employee Student Loan Repayment Program, require participants to pay federal income taxes on the benefits received, making the program less attractive. Additionally, the short-term nature of many programs may also impact their effectiveness in recruitment and retention. Some agencies estimate that tax liability can account for 39% of loan repayment amounts, making programs less attractive. Short-term nature of programs may lead to turnover and less stable workforce. Loan forgiveness programs assume student debt influences career choices, but research shows decisions are more complex. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs are based on the assumption that student loan debt impacts career decisions, but research shows decisions are more complex. Factors like lower compensation, preference for specialty, and administrative duties also influence choices. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs aim to address the impact of student loan debt on career decisions. However, factors such as lower compensation, preference for specialty fields, and administrative duties also play a role in physicians' career choices. Debt levels may affect certain racial and ethnic groups differently, leading to the availability of loan forgiveness and repayment programs. Despite financial incentives, the lifetime earnings gap between primary care and specialty physicians remains significant. One study estimated that over a lifetime, the average primary care physician earns $3.5 million less than a specialty physician, impacting job choices. High levels of debt influence career decisions, leading graduates to choose higher paying jobs over lower paying fields like education or non-profit work. Researchers have found that undergraduates with higher debt levels tend to choose higher salary jobs over education-related, government, or nonprofit positions. Law school debt may play a secondary role in career choices, with demographic factors being more influential. Loan repayment programs may not significantly impact the career decisions of law school graduates. Additionally, the prospect of debt relief through loan forgiveness programs could lead students to finance more of their education with loans. The effects of student loan forgiveness and repayment programs on career choices of law school graduates are debated. Some argue that these programs may encourage students to take on more student loan debt by offering debt relief after a certain period of payments tied to income. Monthly payments are limited to a portion of discretionary income, and some believe this may impact the size of debt. Some argue that tying monthly payments to income and not debt may make the size of the debt irrelevant to borrowers and encourage over-borrowing. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs incur costs to the federal government, depending on the program structure. The costs incurred by the federal government for loan forgiveness and repayment programs depend on the program structure. There are three categories of costs associated with these programs: loan subsidy costs, appropriated program costs, and administrative costs. Loan forgiveness programs are part of federal credit programs, such as the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan program and the Federal Family Education Loan program. Loan subsidy costs are funded through mandatory indefinite appropriations as per the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990. The Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program is a guaranteed loan program funded through mandatory indefinite appropriations. The budgetary costs of direct loans and loan guarantees are measured based on their estimated long-term costs to the government. Loan subsidy costs reflect the present value of cash flows from the government, excluding administrative expenses, discounted to the time of loan disbursement. The loan subsidy cost is the estimated present value of cash flows from the government, less the cash flows to the government, resulting from a direct loan or loan guarantee. A positive cost means a cost to the government, while a negative cost means the government earns a return. Loan forgiveness benefits increase subsidy costs by altering cash flows. For example, Stafford Loan Forgiveness to Teachers discharges a portion of borrowers' loan balance. Loan forgiveness benefits, such as Stafford Loan Forgiveness to Teachers, result in an increase in loan subsidy costs by reducing cash flows to the government. Other programs like Public Service Loan Forgiveness and income-based repayment plans also contribute to higher subsidy costs. These costs are accounted for in the fiscal year when the loan was originally made. Loan forgiveness programs, such as Public Service Loan Forgiveness and income-based repayment plans, increase subsidy costs by reducing government cash flows. Funding for these programs comes from discretionary or mandatory appropriations, with benefits available only when funds are allocated. This may limit the availability of benefits to all eligible borrowers. Funding for loan forgiveness programs like Public Service Loan Forgiveness and income-based repayment plans comes from discretionary or mandatory appropriations. Availability of benefits is limited by fund allocation. Examples of programs funded through discretionary appropriations include GESLR and JRJ Loan Repayment. NHSCLRP is funded through mandatory appropriations. Perkins Loan Cancellation benefits are unique, specified in loan terms, and granted by the institution. Perkins Loan program is not a federal credit program. The Perkins Loan program offers loan forgiveness to eligible borrowers, but it is not a federal credit program like other forgiveness programs. Institutions absorb the costs of loan cancellation without reimbursement from the government, despite funding not being appropriated since FY2009. The program is a revolving fund, and the Education Department keeps track of eligible reimbursement amounts. The Education Department tracks reimbursement amounts for loan forgiveness programs, with costs funded separately through discretionary or mandatory appropriations. Administrative costs for federal credit programs are accounted for separately and funded annually. Limited information is available on the actual costs to the government for these programs. The Education Department tracks reimbursement amounts for loan forgiveness programs, with costs funded separately through discretionary or mandatory appropriations. Limited information is available on the actual costs to the government for these programs, with variation in how administrative costs are funded across different agencies. Cost estimates for loan forgiveness programs are often based on projected future benefits, with data on debt relief provided and recipients available for some programs. In a 2008 notice of proposed rulemaking, the Education Department estimated a cost of $1.5 billion over five years for the Direct Loan Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. The Revised Pay-As-You-Earn repayment plan is expected to make approximately 6 million borrowers eligible for forgiveness. The Education Department estimated costs for various repayment plans, including $15.4 billion for the REPAYE plan and $2.1 billion for the PAYE plan over specific time periods. They projected that millions of borrowers would be eligible for forgiveness under these plans, with average loan balances of $39,500 for those receiving forgiveness. The Education Department estimated that approximately 400,000 borrowers would receive loan forgiveness through public service loan forgiveness or after 20 years of repayment under the PAYE plan. The average original loan balance for these borrowers would be $39,500, with an average of $41,000 in loans forgiven. Additionally, they projected that 126,000 borrowers from the FY2009 loan cohort would repay their loans according to IBR, with 44,000 of them having some portion of their student loan debt forgiven after 25 years. The Education Department estimated that many borrowers would receive loan forgiveness through various repayment plans. Congress may need to review the current policy on federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs to determine if changes are necessary. The Education Department estimated that many borrowers would receive loan forgiveness through various repayment plans. Congress may need to review the current policy on federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs to determine if changes are necessary. The policy may explore whether existing programs are effectively achieving their intended purposes and if changes should be made to optimize loan forgiveness and repayment benefits. Considerations include examining if multiple programs offer similar benefits for borrowers, assessing if programs lead to financial windfalls, and determining if there is sufficient information available to evaluate program effectiveness. Overlapping programs may occur when multiple programs have the same goals and serve the same group of individuals. The Education Department estimated that many borrowers would receive loan forgiveness through various repayment plans. Congress may need to review the current policy on federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs to determine if changes are necessary. Overlapping programs may occur when multiple programs have the same goals and serve the same group of individuals. Individuals potentially may be able to qualify for benefits under multiple programs, leading to potential financial windfalls. Recipients may receive benefits from multiple sources for the same service performed, leading to potential financial windfalls. Overlapping programs can occur when multiple programs serve the same group of individuals, allowing individuals to qualify for benefits under multiple programs. Multiple programs may overlap when they serve the same group of individuals, leading to potential administrative burdens. For example, the Nursing Education Loan Repayment Program (NELRP) and Nursing Faculty Loan Repayment Program (NFLRP) both aim to increase qualified nursing faculty and are administered by the Department of Health and Human Services. However, the NFLRP grants money to nursing schools to establish their own loan repayment programs, creating duplication in benefits and administrative responsibilities for the HRSA. The Nursing Faculty Loan Repayment Program (NFLRP) grants money to nursing schools for loan repayment programs, potentially creating administrative burdens for the HRSA. Congress may need to consider combining or altering programs to avoid double benefits for the same group of individuals. Loan forgiveness programs aim to incentivize individuals to enter specific fields, but may also provide windfalls for those who would have entered regardless. Loan forgiveness programs in certain fields may attract individuals who would not have considered entering those fields otherwise. However, concerns have been raised about the potential for individuals to borrow larger amounts under these programs, knowing that loan forgiveness is a possibility. Congress may need to consider setting limits on the amounts that can be forgiven under certain loan forgiveness programs. Some individuals may borrow larger amounts under loan forgiveness programs, raising concerns about the need for limits on forgiveness amounts. Congress should consider tailoring programs to specific needs by implementing more sensitive funding controls. Loan repayment programs may influence individuals to stay in specific jobs or careers, indicating some effectiveness in retaining highly skilled employees. Loan repayment programs may be somewhat effective in retaining highly skilled employees by influencing their choice to stay in specific jobs or careers. Congress could consider implementing more sensitive funding controls to tailor programs to specific needs. Insufficient data are available to assess the effectiveness of federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs in achieving their objectives. Limited programmatic data is available for many programs, and for some, data will only be available once borrowers apply for benefits. Loan repayment programs, such as the PSLF program, have limited data available to assess their effectiveness in achieving program objectives. Borrowers must remain employed in public service jobs for 10 years to qualify for forgiveness benefits, but little is known about the benefits received so far. Future participation is difficult to project as borrowers are not required to document their employment. Loan forgiveness is available for borrowers who repay according to the program's requirements. Future participation in loan repayment programs like PSLF is challenging to predict as borrowers are not obligated to document their employment. Loan forgiveness is possible for those who adhere to income-driven repayment plans for extended periods, but data collection on participants is limited, making it difficult to assess program effects. The availability of data on program outcomes may be limited, making it challenging to assess the effects of loan repayment programs. There is variation in the types and amounts of student loan debt that qualify for debt relief, with some programs having specific limitations while others have fewer restrictions. Consideration should be given to imposing additional limitations on the types and amounts of student loan debt eligible for relief. Consideration should be given to imposing additional limitations on the types and amounts of student loan debt eligible for relief, especially with concerns about over-borrowing and incentives from loan forgiveness programs. Plus Loans for graduate and professional students have increased borrowing amounts, raising questions about borrowing for expenses covered by expected family contributions and then having a significant portion forgiven through federal programs. The federal government is considering limits on non-need-based federal student loans and loan repayment programs. Selection criteria for loan repayment programs vary among federal agencies, with 34 agencies providing benefits in 2016. Participants must serve for at least three years and reimburse the agency if they leave early. In 2016, 34 federal agencies provided loan repayment benefits under the GESLRP. Participants must sign a service agreement to serve for at least three years and reimburse the agency if they do not complete their service. Agencies have flexibility in determining eligibility criteria, leading to variations in program requirements that can be challenging for participants to understand. The U.S. Department of State provides benefits to individuals with a loan balance of at least $5,000. Variations in eligibility requirements across agencies can make it difficult for participants to discern. The GESLRP may only attract individuals to work in a limited number of agencies. Program-specific details are provided in an appendix, with information varying in scope and level of detail for each program. The provided information includes details on various federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs, such as statutory citations, program purposes, eligible loans, service requirements, benefit amounts, eligibility restrictions, tax treatment, budget classification, funding amounts, loan discharges, program beneficiaries, and additional resources.
