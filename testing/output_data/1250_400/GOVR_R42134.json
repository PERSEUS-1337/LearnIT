    "content": "Risk adjustment is the process of adjusting payments to health insurance plans based on differences in the risk characteristics of enrollees. This helps level the playing field by ensuring fair payments based on factors like gender, age, geography, and health status. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) pays private health plans under Medicare Advantage (MA or Medicare Part C) and how these payments are risk adjusted. Risk adjustment models consider factors like age, geography, health status, and family size to account for differences in expected health care spending. Medicare Advantage offers private plan options for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Parts A and B. Medicare Advantage provides private plan options for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Parts A and B. Health plans receive capitated monthly payments adjusted for demographics and health status. Plans are at-risk if costs exceed payments, but can retain savings if costs are less. Payments are based on bids compared to a benchmark set by the federal government. The Medicare Advantage payment system is based on bids compared to a benchmark set by the federal government. Plans can retain savings if costs are less than payments, which are adjusted for demographics and health status. The Medicare Advantage payment system adjusts payments to plans based on demographic and health factors of enrollees, such as age, gender, Medicaid eligibility, and disability. CMS uses a risk adjustment methodology to estimate next year's healthcare expenditures, incorporating variables like age and disability status. The Medicare Advantage payment system adjusts payments based on demographic and health factors like age, gender, Medicaid eligibility, and disability. Health status is determined by ICD-9-CM codes, which are mapped into diagnostic groups and condition categories. The codes have a hierarchy imposed on them for payment adjustments. The Medicare Advantage payment system adjusts payments based on demographic and health factors using ICD-9-CM codes mapped into diagnostic groups and condition categories. The codes are hierarchically organized for payment adjustments, with only the most significant manifestation of a disease being coded for reimbursement purposes. The Medicare Advantage payment system adjusts payments based on demographic and health factors using ICD-9-CM codes mapped into diagnostic groups and condition categories. Codes are hierarchically organized for payment adjustments, with only the most costly form of the disease dictating reimbursement. 70 HCC codes are currently used to predict Medicare expenditures, with 87 codes to be incorporated in 2012. Figure 2 illustrates the conversion of ICD-9-CM codes into HCC codes for a hypothetical patient with various diagnosed conditions. Figure 2 shows the conversion of ICD-9-CM codes into HCC codes for a 76-year-old female with multiple diagnosed conditions. Not all diagnoses result in an HCC, as some conditions are excluded from the CMS model due to not being chronic or short-term illnesses. The models aim to predict future expenditures, so conditions that are fleeting or not good predictors are not captured. The conditions of chest pain and ankle sprain are excluded from the CMS model as they are not chronic. Short-term illnesses are also not captured in the model. The risk factors for each condition are estimated, and the total risk score is calculated based on the disease hierarchy. This score is then multiplied by the MA plan's base rate to determine the risk-adjusted base payment. Multiple conditions can increase the risk score, leading to higher estimated annual payments. The presence of interaction effects between certain diseases and disability can result in higher healthcare costs for individuals in Medicare Advantage plans. CMS has incorporated these interactions into the payment model to adjust for the increased costs. The CMS-HCC model adjusts payments to MA plans based on interactions between diseases and disability, leading to higher healthcare costs for individuals. This model uses a linear regression approach with expenditures predicted by diagnoses and demographic variables, including interactions between certain diseases and permanent disability. The relative risk factors for each variable are periodically recalculated using current claims data. The CMS-HCC model adjusts payments to MA plans based on interactions between diseases and disability, using risk scores to individualize payments reflecting health status and demographics. The CMS-HCC model adjusts payments to Medicare Advantage plans based on risk scores that reflect health status and demographics. New enrollees in Medicare Advantage are assessed based on age, sex, Medicaid status, and original reason for Medicare entitlement, rather than diagnoses. CMS adjusts payments to Medicare Advantage plans based on risk scores that consider age, sex, Medicaid status, and original reason for Medicare entitlement, rather than diagnoses. New enrollees without 12 months of Part B eligibility have rates determined by these factors, while non-new enrollees have their risk scores updated periodically using encounter data. This shift allows CMS to retain diagnostic information for payment updates directly from plan data. The risk score of each beneficiary enrolled in MA is determined by encounter level data, including dates of service and ICD-9-CM codes. Risk scores can be adjusted twice a year on January 1 and July 1 based on data from the prior 12-month period. Sources of error in risk-adjusted payments include age, gender, disability status, Medicaid eligibility, and disease. Demographic data and Medicaid eligibility come from administrative files, while health status information is submitted by plans to CMS. The risk-adjusted Medicare Advantage payments are calculated based on encounter data, including ICD-9-CM codes, and can be adjusted twice a year. Sources of error in payments include age, gender, disability status, Medicaid eligibility, and disease. Plans are responsible for providing accurate health status information to CMS for risk-adjusted payments, which are audited through RADV audits to ensure accuracy. In 2011, CMS proposed extrapolating RADV error rates to entire plan contracts, resulting in estimated savings of $2.27 billion. In 2011, CMS proposed extrapolating RADV error rates to entire plan contracts, aiming for estimated savings of $2.27 billion. CMS released a final notice in 2012 stating that audits will be conducted at the contract level, with potential recoveries likely to be problematic for some Part C plans. Plans may push back more aggressively as CMS seeks to recover larger dollar amounts. CMS conducts audits at the contract level, using a three-step process: sampling, medical record review, and error rate calculation/payment adjustment. They sample 201 enrollees from eligible Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in an MA contract, meeting specific criteria. This process may lead to potential recoveries that could be challenging for some Part C plans. Enrollees in MA contracts must meet specific criteria to be eligible for sampling in audits conducted by CMS. These criteria include being enrolled in an MA contract in January of the payment year, continuous enrollment for 12 months, non-ESRD status, non-hospice status, full Medicare Part B coverage, and having at least one risk adjustment diagnosis. Eligible enrollees are divided into three groups for sampling, with 67 randomly selected from the highest risk score group. The eligible enrollees for sampling in audits conducted by CMS are divided into three equal groups based on risk scores. Each group consists of 67 enrollees randomly selected. Sampling weights are assigned to ensure representation of each group in the sample. The weights will be used to extrapolate sample payment error findings to the entire population. The CMS conducts audits by dividing eligible enrollees into three equal risk-based groups of 1,000 each. Enrollees are randomly selected with a weight of 14.925. The sampled enrollees' medical records are reviewed to validate HCC codes and payment justifications. If discrepancies are found, the plan has 12 weeks to provide evidence. The CMS conducts audits to validate HCC codes and payment justifications. If discrepancies are found, the plan can appeal the findings. The final decision is binding unless a review by the CMS Administrator is requested. Payment errors are categorized as positive (overpayment) or negative (underpayment). Risk scores are corrected based on supported HCCs, and payments are calculated for each sampled enrollee. The audit corrects risk scores based on supported HCCs and calculates payments for each sampled enrollee. Payment errors are categorized as positive (overpayment) or negative (underpayment), and are calculated based on the difference between original and corrected payments. The estimated payment error for each MA contract is derived by multiplying the total payment error for each sampled enrollee by their sampling weight. The estimated payment error for each MA contract is determined by multiplying the total payment error for each sampled enrollee by their sampling weight. The payment recovery amount for audited MA contracts is based on the lower bound of the 99% confidence interval around the payment error estimate, adjusted by a fee-for-service (FFS) adjuster to account for different documentation standards used in RADV audits compared to the risk adjustment model. The American Academy of Actuaries raised concerns about the CMS audit process. Payment errors are calculated for each enrollee in an MA contract, with a total error established based on audit findings. Errors are then extrapolated to the contract level, with a 99% confidence interval calculated. In a hypothetical example, the estimated plan error is $1,187.50 with a confidence interval of $1,037.50 to $1,337.50. Recent academic studies and preliminary research by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission have raised concerns about risk adjustment under Medicare Advantage. The results of the RADV audit will not lead to additional payments to MA plans. The distribution of actual costs for beneficiaries with the same plan error is a key issue highlighted in the analysis. The RADV audit results will not lead to extra payments for MA plans. Concerns have been raised about risk adjustment in Medicare Advantage, with studies showing a distribution of actual costs for beneficiaries with the same HCC code. Plans may manipulate enrollment to benefit from reimbursement rates, leading to disproportionate enrollment of low-cost beneficiaries. MedPAC is worried about certain MA plans enrolling high-cost individuals. MedPAC and stakeholders are concerned about Medicare Advantage plans potentially enrolling high-cost individuals but being reimbursed for average cost enrollees. The American Academy of Actuaries expressed concerns about the audit process and the accuracy of risk adjustment models in estimating payment errors and adjusting premiums. The AAA's position is that the Medicare fee-for-service data used for risk adjustments may contain errors and the methodology was not designed to adjust premiums accurately. They are concerned about the inconsistency in applying risk adjustment factors developed with unvalidated data to MA data that is validated. This could result in premiums not reflecting the actual risk profiles of enrollees. The proposed audit process aims to apply risk adjustment factors only to validated MA data, which differs from the data used to develop the risk adjustment model. This inconsistency could lead to inadequate payments for certain conditions, creating uncertainty and potential systematic underpayment. The Health Practice Council is concerned about data inconsistency in risk adjustment for MA plans, which could lead to underpayment and payment inequities. The proposed audit process aims to address this by applying risk adjustment factors only to validated data, but uncertainty remains in estimating risk scores and plan bids. The addition of a fee-for-service adjuster to the final recovery amount may help mitigate these concerns. The Council is concerned about the modified payment methodology for MA plans not reflecting enrollees' risk profiles accurately. A fee-for-service adjuster has been added to address this issue. There are concerns about using Medicare fee-for-service data for risk adjustment coefficients and potential financial risks from RADV audits. The Secretary's approach to methodological concerns in risk adjustment implementation remains to be seen. The history of Part C risk adjustment payments for Medicare private plans involves various models to adjust for the cost of healthcare among beneficiaries. Different models have been used over the years, each increasing in complexity and explanatory power. The R2 measure is used to assess how well a model predicts individual beneficiary expenditures. The R2 measure is used to assess how well different models predict individual Medicare beneficiary expenditures. The models attempt to predict spending based on beneficiary characteristics, with the most recent model able to explain approximately 12.5% of the variation in expenditures. The Average Adjusted Per Capita Cost (AAPCC) model has an R2 of 0.0077, explaining 0.77% of variation in beneficiary expenditures. Prior models increased the explained variation, with the most recent proposed model able to explain approximately 12.5% of the variation. The demographic variables in the AAPCC model include age, sex, Medicaid enrollment, institutionalized status, and working aged status. These variables explain less than 1% of expenditure variation. The model does not account for health costs or adjust payments for enrolling. The Principal In-Patient Diagnostic Cost Group (PIP-DCG) model, implemented by CMS from 2000 to 2003, considered beneficiary health status and the worst principal inpatient diagnosis. This model explained more of the variation in Medicare expenditures compared to the AAPCC model. Starting in 2004, Medicare plan payments were adjusted by the CMS-HCC model, which incorporates information from various healthcare settings to determine payments. Starting in 2004, Medicare plan payments were adjusted by the CMS-HCC model, which considers severity of illness, accumulated effects of multiple diseases, and interactive effects. The model explains nearly 10% of expenditure variation and is updated annually to reflect changes in diagnosis codes. The CMS-HCC model, updated annually, explains nearly 10% of expenditure variation. Version 12 and Version 21 include updates to diagnosis codes and recalibration with recent data, increasing predictive power to around 12.5%. Version 21 will be implemented in 2012 for PACE plans."
