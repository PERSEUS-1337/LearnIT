    "content": "The Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides legal protection to species and their habitats, administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). Species can be listed as \"endangered\" or \"threatened\" based on extinction risk assessments. Legal tools under the ESA include prohibiting unpermitted \"take\" of endangered species and ensuring actions do not harm listed species or critical habitat. As of August 24, 2016, 2,266 species were listed as endangered or threatened. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) aims to protect species and their habitats, with FWS or NMFS ensuring actions do not harm listed species or critical habitat. As of August 24, 2016, 2,266 species were listed as endangered or threatened. The ESA was passed in 1973 and has been amended multiple times since then. Funding authorization expired in 1992, but Congress has continued to appropriate funds. The ESA's purpose is to conserve ecosystems for endangered and threatened species. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) aims to protect species and their habitats, with strict substantive provisions to conserve ecosystems for endangered and threatened species. The ESA can become a battleground in debates over scarce resources, with economic interests on multiple sides of vanishing species issues. Examples include conflicts over hydropower development, farmland protection, tribal graves, and timber harvest. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) is a battleground for debates over resource scarcities and altered ecosystems, with examples including conflicts over hydropower development, farmland protection, tribal graves, timber harvest, and global climate change. Tensions have increased as species are added to the protected list, with efforts to tailor the ESA for specific circumstances. Critics argue that the ESA does not do enough to accommodate needs other than species conservation, while defenders believe it balances development biases. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) has sparked debates over resource scarcities and altered ecosystems, with tensions rising as more species are added to the protected list. Critics argue that the ESA does not adequately address needs beyond species conservation, while defenders believe it balances development biases. The debate on the ESA largely divides along demographic lines, with urban and suburban populations showing stronger support for species conservation compared to rural areas. Native Americans, often reliant on natural resources, frequently support the survival of listed species. Groups opposing strong protections for listed species claim job losses, while those seeking strong protections argue the opposite. The debate often revolves around the impact on jobs. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) sparks debates over resource scarcities and altered ecosystems as more species are added to the protected list. Critics argue it does not address needs beyond species conservation, while defenders believe it balances development biases. The debate divides along demographic lines, with urban and suburban populations supporting conservation. Native Americans often support listed species survival. Groups opposing strong protections claim job losses, while those seeking strong protections argue the opposite. Some industries see the ESA as a problem, while others view it as supporting their interests. The ESA contains statutory authority for activities and a provision authorizing appropriations. Congress has continued to appropriate funding for the ESA, raising questions about the act's prohibitions and appropriations. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) contains statutory authority for activities and a provision authorizing appropriations. The authorization for appropriations expired in FY1992, but the act's prohibitions and authorities remain in effect. The agencies still have the authority to conduct actions and enforce prohibitions, even without appropriated funds. The ESA is not authorized, but agencies still have authority to enforce prohibitions and conduct actions. Statutory provisions remain in effect, and citizen suits can still be initiated regardless of agency funding. Citizen suits can still be initiated under the ESA regardless of agency funding, potentially dissuading parties from prohibited acts. Congressional rules distinguish between authorizations and appropriations but do not affect a measure's legal force. House rules prohibit unauthorized appropriations in legislation. House rules prohibit unauthorized appropriations in legislation, amendments, and conference reports. The House Rules Committee can waive these rules through special rules, allowing for consideration of appropriations measures with unauthorized appropriations. Senate rules also distinguish between authorizations and appropriations, similarly prohibiting unauthorized appropriations. House rules prohibit unauthorized appropriations in legislation, amendments, and conference reports, which can be waived through special rules. Senate rules also distinguish between authorizations and appropriations, prohibiting unauthorized appropriations except in specified circumstances. The practical effects of a funding lapse include no interagency consultations for agency actions and no issuance of incidental take statements. During the funding lapse, there were no interagency consultations for agency actions, no issuance of incidental take statements, no species listed or delisted, no critical habitat designated, no issuance of incidental take permits for nonfederal actions, reduced inspections of incoming cargo for violations of species listed under CITES, no monitoring of candidate species, and no federal enforcement of prohibitions on taking listed species or adverse modification of critical habitat. No fulfillment of obligations under CITES, no monitoring of candidate species, no federal enforcement of prohibitions on taking listed species or adverse modification of critical habitat, no acquisition of habitat for listed species, no state grants for conservation, and no ability to exempt agency actions from jeopardy opinions. Previous efforts to end funding for the ESA were abandoned due to the listed effects. The answer to this question depends on the choice of measurement. The 104th Congress considered eliminating conflicts in projects but abandoned the effort. The ESA aims for species recovery, with only 34 delisted due to recovery. Some species listed as extinct were difficult to prove. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) aims for species recovery, with only 34 delisted due to recovery. Rare species can be difficult to prove as extinct, like the ivory-billed woodpecker and Eskimo curlew. Some studies show that a significant number of listed species have improved or stabilized their populations. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) has shown success in stabilizing or increasing populations of listed species, with 41% showing improvement. Some species, like red wolves and California condors, may not exist without ESA protection. Scientific information is crucial for ESA actions, focusing on causes of extinction, normal extinction rates, and comparing current rates. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) has been successful in stabilizing or increasing populations of listed species, with 41% showing improvement. Species like red wolves and California condors may have faced extinction without ESA protection. Scientific information is essential for ESA actions, focusing on causes of extinction, normal extinction rates, and comparing current rates to background levels. Global climate change also contributes to habitat loss, further endangering species. Habitat loss, driven by factors like global climate change and invasive species, is a major threat to many species. The homogenization of flora and fauna, along with multiple threats, contributes to species decline. Some argue that extinction is a natural process, questioning the need for government intervention. The gradual homogenization of the world's flora and fauna has led to a demise of many species. Many species are threatened by multiple factors, and some decline for no obvious reason. Geological evidence shows that most species that have ever lived on Earth are now extinct. Scientists are concerned that the current rate of extinction exceeds background rates, but estimating current rates is challenging due to uncertainty in total species numbers. Extinction rates are calculated using conservative assumptions. Scientists struggle to estimate the current rate of species extinction, with conservative assumptions leading to estimates of 17,000 species per year. This rate is believed to far exceed background extinction rates, which are typically 1 to 10 species per 10 million per year. Critics question these estimates, but diverse methods all suggest that current rates are significantly higher than normal. Current estimates suggest that current extinction rates are significantly higher than normal background rates, which are typically 1 to 10 species per 10 million per year. Critics often question these estimates due to uncertainties in calculations, but similar numbers are generated across different studies and methods. Once a species goes extinct, it cannot be revived, but evolution continues, leading to the possibility of new species evolving to adapt to changing conditions. Some scientists estimate that recovery from severe extinction events could take up to 25 million years, suggesting that returning to pre-historic species numbers would take several million years. The Endangered Species Act defines endangered species as those facing extinction and threatened species as likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) defines endangered species as those in danger of extinction and threatened species as likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future. The ESA provides protection for all species and subspecies of animals, with further protection for distinct population segments within a species. Limited protection is available for plant species, and no protection is given to organisms not classified as animals or plants. The term \"take\" under the ESA includes actions like harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, or trap. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides protection for all species and subspecies of animals, with additional safeguards for distinct population segments. Limited protection is available for plant species, and no protection is given to organisms not classified as animals or plants. The term \"take\" under the ESA includes actions like harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, or trap. The law assigns the major role to the Secretary of the Interior for managing listed species through FWS, while marine species and anadromous fish fall under the responsibility of the Secretary of Commerce through NMFS. The Endangered Species Act assigns the major role to the Secretary of the Interior for managing listed species through FWS, while marine species and anadromous fish fall under the responsibility of the Secretary of Commerce through NMFS. Species may be listed based on scientific and commercial information, with economic considerations excluded from the decision-making process. The Endangered Species Act prohibits economic considerations in listing decisions, focusing on the scientific question of whether a species is threatened or endangered. Endangered species face extinction throughout their range, while threatened species are likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future. The Act allows for different levels of protection for species, including subspecies and distinct population segments. The Endangered Species Act defines species as a species, subspecies, or distinct population segment, allowing for varying levels of protection. The interpretation of \"endangered\" has evolved, with courts rejecting the Department of the Interior's narrow view. In 2014, the Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service defined a significant portion of a species' range as crucial for its viability. In 2014, FWS and NMFS defined a significant portion of a species' range as crucial for its viability, based on scientific factors and threats to its continuance. The determination of endangered or threatened status must be made solely on the best scientific and commercial data available, without consideration of potential economic impacts. The 1982 amendments to the ESA clarified that listing determinations must be based solely on the best scientific and commercial data available, without considering economic impacts. This ensures that decisions regarding the listing or delisting of species are made strictly on biological criteria. The 1982 amendments to the ESA require the Secretary to base listing decisions solely on scientific and commercial data, excluding non-biological factors. Economic considerations are deemed irrelevant in determining the status of species as endangered or threatened. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) prohibits the consideration of economic factors in determining if a species is endangered or threatened. Conservation methods can be chosen to lower costs as long as conservation goals are still met. Species listings can be initiated by petition, with a 90-day determination period for substantial scientific or commercial information. If warranted, a status review must be conducted within 12 months. FWS and NMFS must make an initial determination within 90 days of receiving a petition from any interested person. The 90-day determination assesses if there is substantial scientific or commercial information indicating the petitioned action may be warranted. If so, the agency has 12 months to conduct a status review of the candidate species and decide if the action is warranted, not warranted, or warranted but precluded by higher priority species. Lawsuits have been filed for failure to meet deadlines, with settlements in 2011 setting deadlines for listing determinations on hundreds of species. As of August 2016, FWS had received over 160 ESA petitions, with more than 100 for listing. The federal government's responsibilities towards proposed species for listing under the Endangered Species Act involve conferring with the appropriate Secretary to avoid jeopardizing their existence or habitat. This process aims to resolve conflicts early in the planning stages to assist federal agencies and applicants. The conference process under the Endangered Species Act aims to identify and resolve conflicts early in the planning stages to assist federal agencies and applicants in avoiding harm to species or their habitats. The process is less formal and allows for advice on minimizing adverse effects, with the option for a more complete and formal consultation process to prevent duplication of effort later on. Once a species is listed, agencies have specific responsibilities to avoid harm and potential liability for compensation. The Endangered Species Act aims to identify conflicts early to avoid harm to species. Agencies have responsibilities to prevent harm and liability. Candidate species are monitored to prevent risks. Federal agencies may develop conservation agreements to improve species status. Federal agencies and landowners can enter into conservation agreements to improve the status of candidate species and prevent their listing as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act. If a species is proposed for listing, the Secretary must follow specific procedures including publishing the proposal in the Federal Register and notifying relevant stakeholders. The Secretary must follow specific procedures when proposing a species for listing under the Endangered Species Act, including publishing in the Federal Register, notifying stakeholders, and holding a public hearing. As of August 24, 2016, 73 species were proposed for listing, and federal agencies must confer with the Secretary on actions that may jeopardize candidate species. Emergency listings may skip some normal steps in the process, and special regulations can be promulgated for threatened species. Recovery measures for threatened species can be tailored accordingly. The Secretary may promptly list a species in emergency situations that pose significant risks to its well-being, skipping some normal listing process steps. Special regulations can be issued for conserving threatened species, with protections and recovery measures tailored to specific situations. A distinct population segment (DPS) under the ESA refers to a genetically distinct and geographically separated portion of a listed species, with criteria for designation outlined in a 1996 policy. Only vertebrates can be designated as a DPS, with the segment's demise needing to represent an important loss of genetic diversity. The 1996 policy outlines criteria for designating a Distinct Population Segment (DPS) under the ESA, where only vertebrates can be designated. Discreteness is based on separation from other groups, and significance is determined by the loss of genetic diversity. If a DPS is found to be threatened, special rules may be written. The concept of evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) was developed by NMFS to interpret the \"distinct population segment\" language in the ESA, particularly for salmon populations. The concept of evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) was developed by NMFS to interpret the \"distinct population segment\" language in the ESA for salmon populations. As of July 25, 2016, 28 ESUs of salmon and steelhead trout along the Pacific coast were listed as either endangered or threatened under the ESA. The ESU concept has been controversial due to its lack of scientific basis and the question of whether hatchery fish can be included in ESUs. The concept of evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) was developed by NMFS to interpret the \"distinct population segment\" language in the ESA for salmon populations. Congress added experimental populations to the ESA in 1982 to reintroduce species without severe land use restrictions. Two criteria must be met for reintroduction as an experimental population: authorized release by the service and geographic separation from other animals of the same species. An experimental population's protected status is determined differently from that of a DPS or other species, with special regulations under Section 4 of the ESA. Experimental populations under the ESA are designated as essential if in imminent danger of extinction, otherwise treated as nonessential and considered threatened. Special regulations apply, including rules for taking the species. No Section 7 consultation is required for agency actions unless in a national wildlife refuge or park. Critical habitat is not designated for nonessential populations. Delisting, uplisting, and downlisting processes are the same as listing. The Secretary of the Interior can initiate status changes, or review petitions for changes in listing status. Delisting, uplisting, and downlisting processes are similar to listing under the ESA. The Secretary of the Interior can initiate status changes or review petitions for changes in listing status. Changes in status must be based solely on scientific and commercial data, without considering economic impacts. Critical habitat is designated for listed species, including areas beyond their current geographic range if essential for conservation. Species are reviewed every five years for potential status changes. Critical habitat designation under the Endangered Species Act includes areas essential for species conservation, even beyond their current range. The Secretary may delay or choose not to designate critical habitat if it could harm the species. As of July 25, 2016, critical habitat had been designated for 758 listed species, affecting private land only if federal actions are involved. Federal agencies must avoid adverse impacts on critical habitat. Critical habitat designation under the Endangered Species Act includes areas essential for species conservation, even beyond their current range. Designated for 758 listed species, critical habitat covers 47.5% of domestic animal and plant species. Private land is affected by critical habitat only if federal actions are involved. Federal agencies must avoid adverse impacts on critical habitat, based on the best scientific data available and considering economic and other relevant impacts. The Secretary may exclude areas from critical habitat if benefits outweigh the designation, but extinction risks must be considered. Economic factors are not considered in listing species as endangered. The exclusion of habitat areas from critical habitat designation under the Endangered Species Act may be considered if the benefits outweigh the designation, but extinction risks must be taken into account. Economic factors are not considered in listing species as endangered, but must be considered in the designation of critical habitat. Adverse modification of critical habitat is primarily an obligation for federal agencies, not private landowners. The ESA imposes restrictions on private land use mainly through prohibitions on taking listed species, with designated critical habitat adding additional restrictions only in cases involving federal actions. The Endangered Species Act imposes restrictions on private land use mainly through prohibitions on taking listed species, with designated critical habitat adding additional restrictions only in cases involving federal actions. P.L. 108-136 amended the ESA to exclude Defense Department lands with Integrated Natural Resource Management Plans from critical habitat designation, considering national security and military training concerns. The Endangered Species Act restricts private land use by prohibiting taking listed species, with critical habitat adding more restrictions for federal actions. Amendments exclude Defense Department lands with Integrated Natural Resource Management Plans from critical habitat designation, considering national security and military training concerns. Administrations and Congress have limited FWS's ability to designate critical habitat through appropriations. FWS prioritized critical habitat designation for unoccupied areas important for conservation, but budget constraints hinder compliance with ESA demands. In October 1999, FWS announced that critical habitat designation was a low priority due to budget constraints. Conservation groups criticized FWS for not seeking increased funds for critical habitat designation. FWS believes critical habitat offers minimal additional protection for species and is not worth the expense. The agency has been sued for failing to designate critical habitat, but views it as a poor use of resources compared to the ESA's listing process. The designation of critical habitat is seen as a poor use of budgetary resources by FWS due to the perception of minimal additional conservation benefit. While critical habitat may offer extra protection for listed species in federal actions, FWS argues that the jeopardy consideration already provides necessary protection, making designated critical habitat unnecessary. According to FWS, designated critical habitat does not provide additional protection from federal actions as the jeopardy consideration already offers necessary protection. The definition of \"destroy or adversely modify\" was changed in February 2016 to focus on the recovery goal of the law. The Federal Register notice stated that after the Ninth Circuit's decision, the Services issued guidance to discontinue the use of the 1986 definition of \"conservation.\" The new definition in 50 C.F.R. 402.02 emphasizes the act's focus on recovery, stating that destruction or adverse modification means an alteration that diminishes the value of critical habitat for the conservation of a listed species. Recovery plans are required for listed species, but the ESA and its regulations provide little detail on these plans. The Secretary must develop recovery plans for the conservation and survival of listed species, covering a wide range of species. The plans are not binding on federal agencies or others, leading to criticism for their hortatory nature. As of August 24, 2016, there were recovery plans for 1,156 U.S. species. Land acquisition for conservation purposes can be funded through the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), which is primarily derived from offshore oil and gas leases. The appropriate Secretary must cooperate with states in conserving protected species and may enter into cooperative agreements to assist states in their endangered species programs. Under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the Secretary must cooperate with states to conserve protected species and may enter into cooperative agreements for funding. The 1988 ESA amendments established a fund for state grants, with Congress appropriating $53.5 million for cooperative activities in FY2016. Federal action agencies must complete a biological assessment if their actions may harm a listed species, to determine the need for formal consultation based on scientific data. Federal action agencies must complete a biological assessment to determine if their actions may harm a listed species, leading to a Section 7 consultation with FWS or NMFS to ensure actions do not jeopardize species or critical habitat. If no harm is found, a biological opinion is issued by the Secretary. The Endangered Species Act requires federal action agencies to conduct a biological assessment to assess potential harm to listed species. If no harm is found, a biological opinion is issued by the Secretary, outlining terms for the action to proceed without jeopardizing species or critical habitat. If harm is likely, the Secretary must suggest alternative actions to avoid harm. The BiOp is based on the best available scientific and commercial data. The Endangered Species Act requires federal agencies to base their Biological Opinions on the best scientific and commercial data available. Consultations typically result in \"no jeopardy\" opinions or suggest reasonable alternatives for projects to proceed. The consultation process should be completed within 90 days for federal actions, but may take longer with mutual agreement. If no alternatives are feasible, the proposing agency must consider the impact on listed species. The consultation process under the Endangered Species Act may be extended up to 150 days with mutual agreement. If no alternatives are feasible, the proposing agency must either forego the action, risk penalties under the ESA, or apply for an exemption from the penalties. The \"God Squad\" committee decides on exemptions for specific actions that may harm a species, requiring at least five votes to pass. Exemptions under the Endangered Species Act are decided by a high-level committee known as the \"God Squad,\" consisting of specified federal officials and state representatives. The committee must have at least five votes to pass an exemption for actions that may harm a species. The process includes strict rules and deadlines, with the Secretary of Defense able to grant exemptions for national security reasons. Additionally, the President may exempt projects in disaster areas under certain circumstances. The Endangered Species Act allows for exemptions to be granted by the \"God Squad\" committee for actions that may harm a species. The Secretary of Defense can grant exemptions for national security reasons, and the President may exempt projects in disaster areas under specific circumstances. To be eligible for an exemption, federal agencies must have carried out consultation processes in good faith, considered alternatives, and conducted required biological assessments. The Endangered Species Act allows exemptions for actions that may harm a species, granted by the \"God Squad\" committee. Federal agencies must meet specific requirements, including conducting biological assessments and refraining from irreversible commitments of resources. The exemption process aims to ensure meaningful consideration of issues and prevent preemptive actions. Additional requirements are outlined in relevant regulations. The ESC grants exemptions if no reasonable alternatives exist, the benefits outweigh the risks, and the action is in the public interest. The Endangered Species Act allows exemptions for actions that may harm a species, granted by the \"God Squad\" committee. The ESC grants exemptions if no reasonable alternatives exist, the benefits outweigh the risks, and the action is in the public interest. Special provisions apply in certain instances, such as international treaty obligations, national security, and presidentially declared disasters. The exemption process is complex and can take up to 280 days. The Endangered Species Act allows exemptions for actions that may harm a species, granted by the \"God Squad\" committee. The exemption process is complex and can take up to 280 days, with special provisions for international treaty obligations, national security, and presidentially declared disasters. The applicant must fund any required mitigation measures, and the burden of conservation and recovery may fall heavily elsewhere. The burden of conservation and recovery may fall heavily elsewhere, making it difficult for a governor to balance the interests of an entire state. Exemption from the ESA for an action may not be sufficient if other statutory obligations still apply. Parties may be reluctant to support the extinction of a species publicly. The consultation process allows agencies to modify actions to avoid harming species or critical habitats. Agencies consider ESA consequences early to avoid conflicts and the need for exemptions. The ESA offers opportunities for federal agencies to modify actions to avoid harming species or critical habitats while still proceeding with their activities. Private parties can obtain permits for incidental take of listed species through habitat conservation plans. The use of these permits was expanded in the 1990s, with streamlined procedures for activities with minimal impacts. Other provisions include exemptions for raptors, regulations for subsistence activities by Alaskan Natives, and prohibitions on interstate transport and sale. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) includes provisions for streamlined procedures for activities with minimal impacts, exemptions for raptors, regulations for subsistence activities by Alaskan Natives, and prohibitions on interstate transport and sale of listed species and parts. It also specifies rules for establishing experimental populations and enumerates prohibited acts such as taking endangered species and violating regulations. Threatened species are subject to similar protections as endangered species. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) prohibits taking endangered species and violating regulations. Threatened species receive similar protections. Violating ESA regulations may result in civil penalties. Exceptions include incidental take permits and self-defense against bodily harm from endangered species. Civil penalties apply to violators, especially importers/exporters of wildlife. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) allows for civil penalties for violations, with higher fines for knowing violators and business entities. The ESA also allows for citizen suits in federal court to enforce compliance with its provisions, with the possibility of awarding litigation costs and attorneys' fees to the prevailing party. The ESA's citizen suit provisions allow for litigation costs and attorneys' fees to be awarded to any party, driving efforts to conserve species. Citizen suits often challenge delays in listing decisions and account for a significant number of lawsuits against FWS and NMFS. The ESA also implements CITES and the Convention on Nature Protection and Wildlife Preservation. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) allows for citizen suits to challenge delays in listing decisions, leading to numerous lawsuits against FWS and NMFS. The ESA also implements CITES and the Western Hemisphere Convention for the United States, focusing on protecting species and controlling international wildlife trade. The United States is committed to establishing nature reserves, controlling international wildlife trade, and protecting wildlife through the Western Hemisphere Convention. The ESA designates the Secretary of the Interior as the Endangered Species Scientific Authority under CITES, responsible for ensuring that international trade does not harm species. The Secretary also serves as the Management Authority for the United States under CITES. The Secretary of the Interior, as the Management Authority for the United States under CITES, is responsible for ensuring legal export and import of specimens, as well as proper conditions for live specimens. The ESA prohibits importing or exporting listed species, with exceptions for scientific purposes or species survival enhancement. Importers and exporters of fish or wildlife must obtain permission from the Secretary for trade-related provisions enforcement. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) allows for exemptions for scientific purposes or species survival enhancement. Importers and exporters of fish or wildlife must obtain permission from the Secretary for trade-related provisions enforcement. An exemption was granted for the Grayrocks Dam and Reservoir to protect the habitat of endangered whooping cranes. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) allows exemptions for scientific purposes or species survival enhancement. An exemption was granted for the Grayrocks Dam and Reservoir in Wyoming to protect the habitat of endangered whooping cranes. The Tellico Dam on the Little Tennessee River faced opposition and litigation after the snail darter was listed as endangered, leading to the landmark Supreme Court case TVA v. Hill clarifying the ESA's reach. The Supreme Court case TVA v. Hill clarified the broad reach of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and its relationship to public works projects. Congress passed P.L. 95-632, which established an ESC process and provided an exemption for the Tellico Dam if a decision was not reached within a specified time. Despite the ESC denying an exemption for the dam, Congress directed its completion in P.L. 96-69. Additionally, the Bureau of Land Management sought exemptions for timber sales in the habitat of the threatened northern spotted owl, with controversy surrounding the process and decisions made by the ESC. The Bureau of Land Management sought exemptions for timber sales in the habitat of the threatened northern spotted owl. In 1992, the ESC granted an exemption for 13 of the sales, which were later withdrawn in the Clinton Administration. Other instances included applications for exemptions for a refinery in Eastport, ME, and a docking area for barges in Mound City, IL, both facing challenges due to endangered species concerns. The Consolidated Grain and Barge Company sought to build a docking area for barges at Mound City, IL, on the Ohio River, which was habitat for an endangered mussel. After facing challenges and denial of permits, the company applied for an exemption but withdrew the application in 1986. The Suwanee River Authority's consulting engineer applied for an exemption to dredge Alligator Pass in Suwanee Sound, Florida, a habitat for the endangered manatee. The project was denied a permit by the Army Corps of Engineers, and the Authority later refused to ratify the engineer's actions, leading to the withdrawal of the application."
