Parameter noise combined with traditional RL methods benefits both off- and on-policy methods. Exploration is a key challenge in deep RL to prevent premature convergence to local optima. Many methods have been proposed to address this challenge in high-dimensional and continuous-action environments. Exploration in deep reinforcement learning is a key challenge to prevent premature convergence to local optima. Various methods have been proposed to address this challenge, such as noise injection, parameter noise, and temporally-correlated noise. These methods aim to enable efficient and effective exploration in high-dimensional and continuous-action environments. This paper explores combining parameter space noise with deep RL algorithms like DQN, DDPG, and TRPO to enhance exploratory behavior. Results show that parameter noise outperforms traditional action space noise in sparse reward tasks. The study assumes a standard RL framework with an agent interacting in a fully observable environment modeled as a Markov decision process. Results show that parameter noise is more effective than traditional action space noise in tasks with sparse rewards. The study focuses on the standard RL framework with an agent in a fully observable environment modeled as a Markov decision process. The environment is defined by states, actions, initial state distribution, reward function, transition probabilities, time horizon, and discount factor. The goal is to maximize expected discounted return, and off-policy RL methods are considered with two popular algorithms, Deep Q-Networks (DQN) being one of them. The paper discusses off-policy reinforcement learning methods, focusing on Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG). DQN uses a deep neural network to estimate the optimal Q-value function, while DDPG is an actor-critic algorithm for continuous action spaces. Both algorithms utilize off-policy data to update their Q-value functions. Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) is an extension of traditional policy gradient methods that improves upon REINFORCE by computing Q-values for each action using off-policy data and updating function approximators according to the currently followed policy. The actor is trained to maximize the critic's estimated Q-values by back-propagating through both networks, using a stochastic policy for exploration through action space noise. Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) is an extension of traditional policy gradient methods that improves upon REINFORCE by updating function approximators according to the currently followed policy. TRPO computes an ascent direction that ensures a small change in the policy distribution by solving a constrained optimization problem. Policies are represented as parameterized functions, such as neural networks, with structured exploration achieved by sampling from a set of policies with additive Gaussian noise applied to the parameter vector. Policies are represented as parameterized functions, such as neural networks, with structured exploration achieved by sampling from a set of policies with additive Gaussian noise applied to the parameter vector. State-dependent exploration involves perturbing the policy at the beginning of each episode and keeping it fixed for the entire rollout. This approach distinguishes between action space noise and parameter space noise, highlighting the impact on action selection in continuous action spaces. In contrast to state-dependent exploration, perturbing deep neural networks with spherical Gaussian noise can introduce consistency in actions and dependencies between states and actions. This reparameterization technique, as demonstrated by Salimans et al. (2017), involves using layer normalization between perturbed layers to achieve meaningful perturbations in deep neural networks. The reparameterization technique by Salimans et al. (2017) involves using layer normalization between perturbed layers to achieve consistent perturbations in deep neural networks. Adaptive noise scaling in parameter space noise is proposed to address the challenges of selecting a suitable scale \u03c3, which can vary over time as parameters become more sensitive to noise. This approach adapts the scale of parameter space noise over time based on the variance in action space it induces. The proposed solution involves adapting the scale of parameter space noise over time based on the variance in action space it induces. This is achieved by defining a distance measure between perturbed and non-perturbed policies in action space and adjusting the parameter space noise accordingly. Parameter space noise can be applied in both off-policy and on-policy methods for exploration and training purposes. Parameter space noise can be applied in off-policy and on-policy methods for exploration and training. In off-policy cases, data collected off-policy can be used for perturbing the policy and training the non-perturbed network. On-policy methods can incorporate parameter noise using an adapted policy gradient. The expected return can be expanded using likelihood ratios and the re-parametrization trick for N samples. The section addresses the benefits of incorporating parameter space noise in state-of-the-art RL algorithms, its effectiveness in exploring sparse reward environments, and how it compares to evolution strategies. Incorporating parameter space noise in RL algorithms is explored in this section. It investigates the benefits for state-of-the-art algorithms, effectiveness in sparse reward environments, and comparison to evolution strategies. Reference implementations of DQN and DDPG with adaptive parameter space noise are available online for evaluation. The study includes comparisons on discrete-action environments using DQN and continuous control tasks with DDPG and TRPO. In discrete-action environments, a comparison is made between a baseline DQN agent with -greedy action noise and a version with parameter noise. The noise scale is adjusted based on KL divergence between perturbed and non-perturbed policy. Reparameterizing the network to represent the greedy policy \u03c0 is found to be useful for parameter perturbation. For parameter perturbation, reparametrizing the network to represent the greedy policy \u03c0 is found to be useful. A single fully connected layer is added to predict a discrete probability distribution over actions. Perturbing the policy \u03c0 instead of Q results in more meaningful changes, with the Q-network trained according to standard DQN practices. The policy is trained to exhibit the same behavior as running greedy DQN, and comparisons are made against regular DQN and two-headed DQN with -greedy exploration. Random actions are sampled for the first 50 thousand timesteps to fill the replay buffer before training starts. Parameter space noise approach is compared against regular DQN and two-headed DQN with -greedy exploration. Actions are randomly sampled for the first 50 thousand timesteps before training. Results show that parameter space noise often outperforms action. The study compares parameter space noise against regular DQN and two-headed DQN with -greedy exploration. Results indicate that parameter space noise generally outperforms action space noise, especially in games requiring consistency. However, in extremely challenging games like Montezuma's Revenge, parameter space noise struggles to explore effectively, suggesting the need for more sophisticated exploration methods like BID4. Parameter space noise is ineffective in exploring extremely challenging games like Montezuma's Revenge, indicating the necessity of more advanced exploration methods such as BID4. Proposed enhancements to DQN, such as double DQN, prioritized experience replay, and dueling networks, are separate from our improvements and could further enhance results. Experimental validation of this theory is left for future research. Comparing parameter noise with action noise on continuous control environments in OpenAI Gym BID6 using DDPG as the RL algorithm shows promising results. In comparing different noise configurations on continuous control environments in OpenAI Gym using DDPG as the RL algorithm, the study evaluates the performance of no noise, uncorrelated additive Gaussian action space noise, correlated additive Gaussian action space noise, and adaptive parameter space noise. The results are depicted for three exemplary environments after training each agent for 1 million timesteps. The study found that layer normalization applied after each layer before the nonlinearity was useful, especially for parameter space noise. The study evaluates different noise configurations on continuous control environments using DDPG as the RL algorithm. Results show that parameter space noise outperforms other exploration strategies in HalfCheetah environment, breaking out of sub-optimal behavior. Parameter space noise also performs well in other environments compared to correlated action space noise. Parameter space noise outperforms correlated action space noise in the HalfCheetah environment, indicating a significant difference between the two. DDPG can learn good policies even without noise, suggesting well-shaped reward functions in environments that require little exploration. Parameter noise helps escape local optima and enables existing RL algorithms to learn in environments with sparse rewards. Parameter noise aids in escaping local optima and enables existing RL algorithms to learn in environments with sparse rewards. A toy example with a chain of states is used to evaluate the effectiveness of parameter noise compared to other DQN methods. The environment consists of states with varying rewards, and the performance of the policies is evaluated after each episode. In a toy example with a chain of states, parameter space noise is compared to other DQN methods. The environment is evaluated with varying rewards, and the performance of policies is assessed after each episode. The optimal return is achieved if one hundred subsequent rollouts are successful. Parameter space noise outperforms action space noise and even the more computationally expensive bootstrapped DQN in this simple environment. Parameter space noise outperforms action space noise and bootstrapped DQN in a simple environment where the optimal strategy is always to go right. However, in more complex environments where the optimal action depends on the state, parameter space noise may not work as well. The results highlight the exploration behavior difference compared to action space noise in this specific case. Continuous control environments are made more challenging for exploration by using sparse rewards, where rewards are only given after significant progress towards a goal. Various environments like SparseCartpoleSwingup, SparseDoublePendulum, SparseHalfCheetah, SparseMountainCar, and SwimmerGather are considered. DDPG and TRPO are used to solve these environments, with performance shown in FIG6 for DDPG. The overall performance is evaluated by running each configuration with five random seeds and plotting the median return. The performance of DDPG in solving challenging environments with sparse rewards is shown in FIG6. SparseDoublePendulum is relatively easy to solve, while SparseCartpoleSwingup and SparseMountainCar require parameter space noise for successful policies. SparseHalfCheetah shows some success but fails to learn a successful policy. DDPG fails in the SwimmerGather task. Parameter space noise can improve exploration behavior, but it is noted that exploration improvements are limited. Parameter space noise can enhance exploration behavior in off-the-shelf algorithms like DDPG, but its effectiveness varies depending on the task. Combining parameter space noise with traditional RL algorithms allows for improved exploration while still utilizing temporal information and back-propagation for optimization. Comparing this approach with Evolution Strategies (ES), which also introduce noise in parameter space for exploration, shows potential benefits in performance on various games. By combining parameter space noise with traditional RL algorithms, temporal information can be included while relying on back-propagation for optimization. Comparing ES and traditional RL with parameter space noise directly on 21 ALE games shows that DQN with parameter space noise outperforms ES on 15 out of 21 Atari games, demonstrating the combination of exploration properties of ES with the sample efficiency of traditional RL. The study demonstrates that parameter space noise improves exploration in reinforcement learning, outperforming ES on 15 out of 21 Atari games. Various algorithms have been proposed for exploration in RL, but in real-world problems with continuous and high-dimensional spaces, these algorithms become impractical. Deep reinforcement learning techniques for exploration are complex and computationally expensive, with perturbing policy parameters showing promise in improving exploration efficiency. The authors propose perturbing policy parameters to improve exploration in reinforcement learning, outperforming random exploration. Their method is evaluated for both on and off-policy settings, using high-dimensional policies and environments with large state spaces. This approach is related to evolution strategies and has shown promise in high-dimensional environments like Atari games. The authors propose parameter space noise as a simple yet effective method for exploration in reinforcement learning, outperforming traditional exploration techniques. Their approach perturbs network parameters directly, showing superior exploration behavior compared to other methods. In this work, parameter space noise is proposed as a more effective method for exploration in reinforcement learning compared to traditional action space noise. It shows improved performance with deep RL algorithms like DQN, DDPG, and TRPO, especially in environments with sparse rewards. Parameter space noise is suggested as a viable alternative to action space noise in reinforcement learning applications. The network architecture for ALE BID3 includes 3 convolutional layers followed by a hidden layer with 512 units and a linear output layer. ReLUs are used in each layer, with layer normalization in the fully connected part. A policy network with a softmax output layer is included for parameter space noise. The Q-value network is trained using the Adam optimizer with specific parameters, and the replay buffer can hold 1 million state transitions. Exploration is done using -greedy baseline and adaptive scaling of noise in action space. Target networks are updated every 10,000 timesteps. The policy is perturbed at the beginning of each episode with adaptively scaled noise. The standard deviation is adjusted every 50 timesteps. To prevent getting stuck, -greedy action selection is used with = 0.01. Initial data is collected with 50 K random actions before training. Parameters include \u03b3 = 0.99, reward clipping to [-1, 1], and gradient clipping for Q output layer to [-1, 1]. Observations are down-sampled to 84 \u00d7 84 pixels. In training the DDPG algorithm, the policy is perturbed at the start of each episode with adaptively scaled noise. -greedy action selection is used with = 0.01 to prevent getting stuck. Initial data collection involves 50 K random actions. Parameters such as \u03b3 = 0.99, reward clipping to [-1, 1], and gradient clipping for Q output layer to [-1, 1] are set. Observations are down-sampled to 84 \u00d7 84 pixels and converted to grayscale. The network input consists of a concatenation of 4 subsequent frames. Additionally, up to 30 noop actions are used at the beginning of each episode. The network architecture for both actor and critic includes 2 hidden layers with 64 ReLU units each. Layer normalization is applied to all layers. Target networks are soft-updated with \u03c4 = 0.001. The critic is trained with a learning rate of 10 \u22123 and the actor with a learning rate of 10 \u22124. Adam optimizer with batch sizes of 128 is used for updating both actor and critic. The critic is regularized with an L2 penalty of 10 \u22122. The replay buffer holds 100 K state. The actor and critic in the DDPG algorithm are updated using the Adam optimizer with batch sizes of 128. The critic is regularized with an L2 penalty of 10 \u22122. Action space noise is adjusted for dense and sparse environments. TRPO uses a step size of \u03b4 KL = 0.01 and a policy network with specific hidden layers for different tasks. The baseline is a learned linear transformation of observations. TRPO uses a step size of \u03b4 KL = 0.01, with specific hidden layers for different tasks. The Hessian calculation is subsampled with a factor of 0.1, \u03b3 = 0.99, and batch size per epoch is set to 5 K timesteps. Various environments from OpenAI Gym and rllab are utilized for tasks with specific reward conditions. State encoding follows a proposed method using \u03c6(s t ) = (1{x \u2264 s t }). The curr_chunk discusses the use of DQN with a simple network to approximate the Q-value function in various environments. Each agent is trained for up to 2K episodes with different chain lengths and seeds. The performance of the policy is evaluated after each episode, and the problem is considered solved if one hundred subsequent trajectories achieve the optimal return. The environment is depicted in Figure 6. The curr_chunk discusses the comparison of adaptive parameter space noise DQN, bootstrapped DQN, and \u03b5-greedy DQN in a simple and scalable environment. Different strategies are evaluated with specific parameters and settings for training the network. The curr_chunk discusses training a network with a stochastic policy using parameter space noise and adapting the scale over time to improve learning. This method addresses limitations in selecting a suitable scale for the noise and aims to enhance performance in a straightforward manner. The proposed solution involves adapting the scale of parameter space noise over time to improve learning performance. This method aims to address limitations in selecting the appropriate scale for the noise, using a time-varying scale \u03c3 k updated every K timesteps based on a distance measure between non-perturbed and perturbed policies. In the following sections, the choice of distance measure for policy representation is outlined. For DQN, a probabilistic formulation is used to measure the distance in action space between non-perturbed and perturbed policies. The text discusses the use of a probabilistic formulation to measure the distance in action space between non-perturbed and perturbed policies in DQN. It introduces the softmax function applied to predicted Q values to define policies, and relates this to -greedy action space noise. The KL divergence is used as a distance measure to compare different policy approaches. The text discusses using the KL divergence as a distance measure to relate action space noise and parameter space noise in reinforcement learning algorithms like DDPG and TRPO. By adaptively scaling noise, the goal is to match the distance between greedy and -greedy policies, resulting in effective action space noise with the same standard deviation as regular Gaussian noise. The text discusses adapting noise in reinforcement learning algorithms like TRPO to match the distance between policies. This is done by setting an adaptive parameter space threshold, scaling noise vectors, and ensuring constraint conformation through the conjugate gradient algorithm. Learning curves for Atari games and performance comparisons between ES and DQN are provided. The final performance of ES after 1,000 M frames is compared to DQN with -greedy exploration and parameter space noise exploration after 40 M frames. Performance is estimated by running 10 episodes with exploration disabled. Adaptive parameter space noise achieves stable performance on InvertedDoublePendulum. TRPO with noise scaled according to parameter curvature is also discussed. Adding parameter space noise improves the performance of TRPO on challenging sparse environments, as shown in FIG10. The TRPO baseline uses action noise, while the variance is learned. Parameter space noise aids in more consistent learning."
