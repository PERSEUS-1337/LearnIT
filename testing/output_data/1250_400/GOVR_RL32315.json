The conflict between environmental concerns and the need for increased domestic energy production from public lands is a major policy issue. The Bush Administration has its own initiative to expedite the oil and gas permitting process on federal lands. Oil and gas development practices have generated considerable debate in Congress. The Bush Administration has its own initiative to expedite the oil and gas permitting process on federal lands. Oil and gas development practices have been debated in Congress since the early years of the industry. Originally, oil and gas resources on public lands could be transferred to private ownership under the Mining Law of 1872. President Taft withdrew lands prospective for oil in Wyoming and California from availability under the Mining Law of 1872, leading to the Pickett Act of 1910. Congress eventually decided that defense-related minerals, including oil and gas, should remain under federal ownership, resulting in the Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920. The Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920 removed oil and gas from the patenting process, placing it under a leasing system that has generated billions in revenues for the federal government. Split-estate situations arise when minerals are owned by the federal government under privately held lands, leading to specific policies and procedures for mineral development. Federal statutes allow the federal government to issue patents for land while reserving the right to minerals, making the mineral estate dominant over the surface use. Specific policies and procedures must be followed by mineral estate holders for mineral development, such as obtaining surface agreements, consent from private surface owners, payment for damages, or posting a bond. Approximately 11% of public lands are split-estate, with higher percentages in Wyoming and Montana. Environmentalists advocate for public land withdrawals and restrictions due to concerns about inadequate environmental protection under mining laws. Ranchers and other groups also express concerns about the impact of development on water and land, while development supporters argue that existing environmental laws regulate oil and gas development on public lands. The Mining Law of 1872 and the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 are criticized for inadequate environmental protection. Ranchers and groups are concerned about the impact of development on water and land. Development supporters argue that existing environmental laws regulate oil and gas development on public lands. The industry faces delays in drilling due to environmental reviews. Proposed energy bills aim to address concerns over domestic oil and gas supplies. The proposed conference report on a comprehensive energy bill (H.R. 6) and S. 2095 addresses industry and Bush Administration concerns over increasing domestic oil and natural gas supplies. Title III of H.R. 6 and S. 2095 would establish a White House Office of Federal Project Coordination to expedite permitting on public lands. Environmentalists argue that these provisions could harm the environment. The Senate's substitute bill, S. 2095, is awaiting action. This report provides an overview of the oil and gas leasing system on U.S. public lands, including permitting, production, and reserves. The report provides an overview of the oil and gas leasing system on U.S. public lands, including information on permitting, production, and reserves. It discusses the contribution of onshore oil and gas towards meeting U.S. energy demand and current estimates of reserves in restricted areas. Leasing of onshore federal public lands for oil and gas development is based on Resource Management Plans developed by the Bureau of Land Management. The leasing of federal public lands for oil and gas development is based on Resource Management Plans developed by the Bureau of Land Management. Tracts with oil and gas potential are offered for competitive leasing each quarter, with drilling permits required for each well. In FY2002, 1,765 new oil and gas leases were issued on public lands totaling 1.4 million acres. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act requires environmental considerations in land-use planning, covering diverse uses like timber, grazing, wildlife conservation, and recreation. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) develops Resource Management Plans (RMPs) for public lands, covering diverse uses like timber, grazing, wildlife conservation, recreation, and energy. RMPs must consider environmental impacts and be consistent with regulations, allowing public participation. The BLM determines which lands with oil and gas potential will be available for leasing through competitive bidding auctions held quarterly. The objective is to provide a \"fair market value\" return to the highest responsible qualified bidder. The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 requires public lands with oil and gas potential to be leased through competitive bidding auctions held quarterly by the BLM. If no bids meet the $2/acre minimum, leases are offered noncompetitively. Noncompetitive leasing is available for two years with a $75 application fee. Geophysical exploration permits can be issued by BLM for unleased public lands. Simultaneous noncompetitive lease applications filed after a competitive lease sale are prioritized through a lottery system. Geophysical exploration permits on unleased public lands may be issued by BLM, excluding drilling for core samples or oil and gas. Once a lease is obtained, the lessee has exclusive rights for further exploration, development, and production. An Application for a Permit to Drill (APD) must be approved for each oil and gas well, following the Mineral Leasing Act guidelines. The Application for a Permit to Drill (APD) must be approved for each oil and gas well, following specific guidelines outlined in the Mineral Leasing Act. The APD form must include a drilling plan, surface use plan, and evidence of bond/surety coverage. The process involves a 30-day review period, consultation with the surface managing agency, and a 35-day processing requirement by the BLM. The application may be approved, approved with stipulations, rejected, or delayed for additional analysis or information. The BLM is required to process the APD application within a 35-day period, which may result in approval, approval with stipulations, rejection, or delay. A study by IPAMS found delays in APD approvals due to the need to update outdated RMPs to accommodate increased natural gas leasing. This process involves public involvement and revision of old plans under FLPMA section 1712. The BLM is revising old RMPs to accommodate increased natural gas leasing, which may cause delays in APD approvals. The process involves public involvement and revision of plans under FLPMA section 1712. IPAMS testified that rewriting RMPs can take up to three years, compared to less than one year a decade ago. The usefulness of an RMP is now seven years, down from possibly 20 years in the past. The EPA testified that rewriting RMPs now takes up to three years, compared to less than one year a decade ago. The usefulness of an RMP is now seven years, down from possibly 20 years in the past. The rapid pace of CBM development has raised new land use concerns not previously addressed in RMPs. Environmentalists argue that 20-year-old plans are not suitable for current land management decisions, causing delays in site-specific analysis for drilling permits by the BLM. In April 2003, BLM announced strategies to expedite the APD process. In April 2003, BLM announced strategies to expedite the APD process, including processing multiple permit applications together, implementing geographic area development planning, and establishing standard operating agreements with oil and gas operators. Public lands for oil and gas leasing are categorized as open under standard terms, open with restrictions, or closed. Closed areas consist of wilderness areas, national parks, and environmentally sensitive areas unlikely to be reopened for leasing. Some lands are closed pending land use planning or NEPA compliance. Areas closed to leasing include wilderness areas, national parks, monuments, and environmentally sensitive areas. Some lands are closed pending land use planning or NEPA compliance, while others are closed due to federal land management decisions on endangered species habitat or historical sites. Approximately 165 million acres have been withdrawn from mineral entry, leasing, and sale, with another 182 million acres subject to surface management agency approval for mineral development. Mineral rights on public lands are subject to various restrictions imposed by the Department of the Interior, including no surface occupancy, timing limitations to protect wildlife, and controlled surface use with mitigation plans. Industry sources argue that these restrictions effectively hinder oil and gas development. Industry sources argue that stringent lease stipulations on public lands, such as directional drilling and controlled surface use, hinder oil and gas development. They claim that federal withdrawals limit exploration and reserve base, while environmental groups support these withdrawals for protecting non-mineral values of public lands. The Rocky Mountain region holds a significant portion of the natural gas and crude oil resource base on public lands. The Rocky Mountain region holds a significant portion of the natural gas and crude oil resource base on public lands, with 60% of the undiscovered resource base in the region on public lands. The region has become a focal point for U.S. oil and gas policy due to increased interest in access to natural gas. Studies have been conducted on restrictions on natural gas in the Rocky Mountain region by various organizations. The National Petroleum Council (NPC) and Energy Information Administration (EIA) conducted studies on natural gas supplies in the Rocky Mountain region. The NPC study found a resource base of 335 trillion cubic feet (tcf), while the EIA estimated 293.6 tcf of technically recoverable natural gas resources. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act Amendments (EPCA) study focused on five major geologic basins in the region and found 138.5 tcf. Despite differences in resource base, the amount of natural gas on federal lands available for development was similar across the studies. The EPCA study found 138.5 tcf of natural gas in the Rocky Mountain region, with 63% of proven reserves on federal lands available for leasing. The NPC and EIA studies show differences in the percentage of natural gas open for leasing, with the EIA report excluding proven reserves. The EPCA study found that 26 tcf of proven natural gas reserves are on federal lands out of 43 tcf total in five major geologic basins, with 63% open under standard lease terms. Oil resources in the Rocky Mountains examined in the study have less significance relative to U.S. oil supply, with 600 million barrels falling under \"no access\" category and 3.2 billion barrels available for leasing, one-third with restrictions. About 2.5 billion barrels of oil are estimated on non-federal lands in the studied basins, representing 7% of all technically recoverable oil in the United States. The EPCA study found that about 2.5 billion barrels of oil are estimated to be available on non-federal lands in the studied basins, representing 7% of all technically recoverable oil in the United States. The study also concluded that development of natural gas in restricted land use areas would likely face costly delays, but with greater flexibility in federal regulations, about 29 tcf of natural gas could become immediately available. Additionally, removing certain lease stipulations could make 51 tcf of natural gas less costly to develop, freeing up a total of 80 tcf. The EIA report suggests that with greater flexibility in federal regulations, 29 tcf of natural gas could be immediately available, and removing certain lease stipulations could make 51 tcf less costly to develop, freeing up a total of 80 tcf. Environmental groups argue that relaxing these restrictions would pose risks to the environment. The NPC study estimates that 41% of the total gas resources in the Rocky Mountain region are either closed or restricted, with an estimated total of 335 tcf of natural gas resources in the region as of 1999. Major policy disagreements exist regarding the importance of oil and gas reserves on public lands in meeting U.S. energy needs. The Rocky Mountain region holds substantial oil and gas reserves, with disagreements over their importance in meeting U.S. energy needs. It represents 37% of the unproved natural gas resource base in the U.S. If the estimated 108 tcf of natural gas in the region were produced, it could last 20-30 years, meeting 15% of projected U.S. demand. The Wilderness Society stated that the U.S. has enough natural gas supply for the next 40 years, based on annual demand growth projections. The Wilderness Society testified that the United States has sufficient natural gas supply to meet domestic needs for the next 40 years, with 1,351 tcf of natural gas potentially available for development. The NPC report estimated that 16% of this supply is subject to restrictions, including 70 tcf of Rocky Mountain natural gas that could be brought into production in the near term. The NPC argues that 70 tcf of Rocky Mountain natural gas is under restriction or lease stipulations, hindering production. They propose relaxing land-use constraints to allow for more drilling on federal lands in the intermountain west. The RAND Corporation suggests focusing on access restrictions for the most viable resource categories to maximize production. The RAND Corporation's 2002 Issue Paper suggests focusing on access restrictions for the most viable resource categories to maximize production. Total U.S. oil production is forecasted to decline annually, with oil imports expected to make up 65% of total supply by 2025. Federal onshore oil production is concentrated in Wyoming, New Mexico, and California. Total U.S. natural gas production was 19.4 tcf in 2002, with federal onshore oil production accounting for 5.4% of total U.S. oil production. Wyoming, New Mexico, and California are the top three states for federal onshore oil production. U.S. natural gas production varied between 18-20 tcf annually from 1993-2002, with projections showing an increase to 20-24.3 tcf by 2025. Imports from Canada are expected to rise to 3.7 tcf in 2010 before falling to 2.6 tcf in 2025 due to declining Canadian gas production and increased domestic use in oil sands production. Imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) are projected to increase from 170,000 bcf in 2002 to 4.8 tcf in 2025, as per EIA forecasts. Gas production on public lands has risen to 2.2 tcf in 2002, with New Mexico and Wyoming being the top two states contributing 85% of the total production. Proved U.S. oil reserves were reported at 22.7 billion barrels. The federal onshore share of total U.S. domestic oil and gas production is expected to remain stable, with Texas leading in reserves. U.S. oil reserves were 22.7 billion barrels as of December 31, 2002, with natural gas reserves at 187 tcf. Despite a decline in oil reserves over the past decade, significant amounts of oil are still available for production. The United States has substantial oil reserves, with technically recoverable resources estimated at 92 billion barrels. However, the rate of production is expected to decline over the long term. In contrast, natural gas reserves have increased by 16.5 tcf since 1991, with production also rising. Gas imports have also increased to 17% from about 9% in 1991. Annual gas discoveries were 70% above the average since 1976. The United States has seen an increase in natural gas reserves by 16.5 tcf since 1991, with production also rising. Gas imports have increased to 17% from about 9% in 1991. Annual gas discoveries were 70% above the average since 1976. The 2002 oil and gas resource assessment estimates 1.9 billion barrels of oil, 183 tcf of natural gas, and 3.1 billion barrels of natural gas liquids as undiscovered resources in the Rocky Mountain West. Over 90% of the undiscovered gas is classified as unconventional, with coalbed methane accounting for 25%. Recent estimates by the EIA indicate that federal onshore oil is 12.5% of all technically recoverable oil, while natural gas on public lands is estimated to account for 22.3% of all technically recoverable gas. Undiscovered conventional oil is estimated at 30.1 billion barrels, conventional natural gas at 319.7 trillion cubic feet, and unconventional natural gas at 358.7 tcf. Coalbed methane gas, trapped in coalbeds, is an important resource with several variables affecting its quantity. The estimate for undiscovered unconventional natural gas is 358.7 tcf. Coalbed methane gas is trapped in coalbeds and extraction involves removing water to release the gas. Concerns about groundwater contamination have arisen due to water quality and disposal issues in coalbed methane production. Coalbed methane (CBM) production involves extracting gas trapped in coalbeds by removing water. Water can be reused if fresh or disposed of through injection or discharge. CBM development was incentivized by a 1980 tax credit, leading to significant production growth since 1987. In 2002, CBM accounted for 8% of US natural gas production, with 10,000 wells producing 1.65 million barrels of water daily. Production rates vary due to geology, with reserves largely undeveloped. Out of 700 tcf of CBM in the US, only 100 tcf are economically recoverable. The United States has significant coalbed methane (CBM) reserves, with only about 100 tcf out of 700 tcf classified as economically recoverable. CBM proved reserves were 18.5 tcf in 2001, accounting for 10% of U.S. dry gas reserves. Colorado and New Mexico hold more than half of U.S. CBM reserves, while the San Juan Basin is the most productive region. Wyoming, Utah, and Alabama also have significant CBM reserves. The federal government owns over half of the mineral rights in the Powder River Basin, estimated to have 39 tcf of CBM resources. The San Juan Basin is the most productive region for coalbed methane (CBM), containing 65% of known reserves and 80% of production. The Warrior Basin in Alabama is the second most productive, with 9% of U.S. production and 8% of reserves. The Powder River Basin (PRB) in Wyoming has estimated CBM resources of 39 tcf, with split-estates where the federal government owns mineral rights and private entities own surface rights. Concerns have arisen regarding surface use agreements between surface owners and mineral lessees, leading to the establishment of the Wyoming Split-Estate Initiative in 2002 to address conflicts. The Wyoming Split-Estate Initiative was established in 2002 to address conflicts between surface owners and mineral owners or lessees in Wyoming. Environmental concerns about CBM production include land disturbance, water issues, and the process of hydraulic fracturing. Major issues involve surface infrastructure, water removal, effects on the water table, and disposal of water that may affect wildlife and surface water resources. A draft EPA report concluded that there is no evidence of contamination of drinking water wells from CBM production. The process of hydraulic fracturing for CBM production has raised concerns over the impact of injected fluids on underground drinking water. A draft EPA report found no evidence of contamination, but expressed concern over the use of diesel fuel. An agreement was made to end the use of diesel fuel as an injection fluid. Proposed energy legislation may prohibit EPA regulation of fluid injection for hydraulic fracturing. Dennis Hemmer stated that water from CBM production mostly seeps into underground aquifers. CBM production for hydraulic fracturing raises concerns about water pollution and depletion of underground aquifers. Discharges of 602 million barrels annually in 2002 flow into surface waters or holding ponds, with environmentalists warning of groundwater contamination. Wildlife habitats and water sources are at risk, with potential impacts on natural vegetation and aquatic life. The infrastructure needed for CBM production may exacerbate these environmental concerns. The Wildlife Management Institute of Washington D.C. warns about the negative effects of CBM production on wells, water sources, and wildlife habitats. BLM requires monitoring wells for CBM producers to assess groundwater quality and quantity, with costs involved. IBLA invalidated leases in 2002 due to insufficient evaluation of environmental issues related to CBM production. The Interior Board of Land Appeals (IBLA) invalidated leases in 2002 due to environmental issues related to CBM production not being evaluated sufficiently. Supplemental environmental assessments were prepared for the Powder River Basin to determine CBM development in approved leasing areas. The Wyoming Outdoor Council (WOC) sued BLM to withdraw leases in Wyoming, leading to a pause in lease sales on public lands with high CBM content. The IBLA ruling was eventually dismissed in December 2003. The BLM was directed to update a 1985 resource management plan before offering CBM leases in the Powder River Basin. After a lawsuit, lease sales on public lands with high CBM content were paused. The IBLA ruling was dismissed in December 2003. The Wyoming BLM office finalized a new EA and RMP, anticipating approving 39,000 permits for new wells over a 10-year period. Demand for oil and natural gas is forecasted to rise, with uncertainty on how much domestic supply will come from public lands. The outlook for increased oil and natural gas production from U.S. public lands is uncertain, with challenges in accessing restricted areas. The Bush Administration is working to ease restrictions, but opposition and legal challenges remain. Conventional natural gas production is expected to remain steady, while unconventional gas production in the Rocky Mountain region is forecasted to increase. Industry's main concern is gaining greater access to federal lands with oil and gas potential and expediting the permitting process. The forecast for increased natural gas production in the Rocky Mountain region by 2025 is expected to rise to 43% of production in the lower 48. Industry's main concern is gaining access to federal lands for drilling, while environmental groups worry about potential damage to sensitive lands and wildlife habitats. The United States may rely more on natural gas imports, including LNG from stable countries, and increased production from the deepwater OCS. Oil and gas firms are exploring worldwide for the best return on investment. The United States may rely more on natural gas imports, primarily LNG from stable countries, and increased production from the deepwater OCS. A proposed Alaskan natural gas pipeline could provide 2.71 tcf by 2025. Oil and gas firms worldwide continue exploration and development for the best return on investment, considering factors like political stability, resource base, and financing. Public land use decisions must weigh concerns about the environment, residents, and society. Terms for competitive and noncompetitive leases include acreage limits, bonus bids, bond requirements, rental rates, and royalties. The onshore leasing program for oil and natural gas production on federal lands in the U.S. brings in significant annual revenues to the U.S. Treasury. Revenues include bonus bids, rents, and royalties collected by the Minerals Management Service (MMS) and distributed to states, the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury, and other designated programs. All states except Alaska receive 50% of the revenues collected from public land oil and gas leases within their boundaries, while Alaska receives 90% of all revenues collected. Revenues from federal leases vary widely over the years due to price fluctuations. The National Park System (NPS) was created in 1916 to conserve scenery, natural and historic objects, and wildlife in national parks for future generations. Yellowstone National Park was established in 1872, and Congress has since created other national parks at regular intervals. The NPS philosophy initially differed from the Forest Service's focus on resource use. The National Park System (NPS) was established in 1916 to conserve scenery, natural and historic objects, and wildlife in national parks for future generations. Early tension arose between conservationists promoting National Parks and utilitarians promoting National Forests. The focus of the public lands withdrawal debate in the early 1900s was on the President's authority to make withdrawal orders based on national security. The President has the authority to change the designation of public lands, making them unavailable for certain activities. This power has been used to establish military reservations and create national monuments through statutory delegation. The President can reserve the smallest area necessary to protect historic landmarks and other objects on federal lands. National monuments can be created by the executive branch through statutory delegation under the Antiquities Act, reserving the smallest area necessary to protect historic landmarks and other objects on federal lands. The Taylor Grazing Act withdrew 140 million acres from homesteading laws, while the Organic Act regulated and designated recreation and primitive areas. FLPMA allows withdrawals by the executive branch or Congress, with wilderness designations considered essential to prevent administrative revocation. The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act withdrew large areas from resource use pending congressional disposition. The Wilderness Act required the Forest Service to study designated primitive areas for wilderness suitability, defining wilderness as off-limits to development to prevent destruction. The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act and the Wilderness Act withdrew large areas of Alaska from resource use or development pending congressional disposition. Wilderness is defined as off-limits to development to preserve nature's pristine characteristics. There are four types of withdrawal: congressional authority, executive branch power delegated by Congress, specific resource withdrawals by Congress, and general withdrawals. Withdrawals of national wildlife refuges require an act of Congress or can be done by the executive branch under the Antiquities Act of 1906 and the Pickett Act of 1910. Congress can also withdraw specific resources like oil, gas, coal, and minerals. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) governs modern executive withdrawals, establishing procedures for land use planning, sales, acquisitions, and withdrawals. FLPMA replaced the executive branch's implied authority with defined procedures, requiring congressional approval for withdrawals exceeding 5,000 acres. Under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA), withdrawals of public lands can be temporary or permanent and require congressional approval for parcels exceeding 5,000 acres. The Secretary of the Interior can make emergency withdrawals for up to three years. FLPMA mandated a review of existing withdrawals in 11 Western states to determine their continuation. Millions of acres were withdrawn prior to FLPMA, and the Secretary of the Interior has the authority to determine the continuation of existing withdrawals. BLM continues to review approximately 70 million withdrawn acres, prioritizing 26 million acres for potential return or alternative uses. As of November 2000, BLM had reviewed 7 million acres, revoking withdrawals on over 6 million acres. Retention of a withdrawal requires a compelling show of need, particularly for lands not opened to multiple use like mining and mineral leasing. The BLM is reviewing approximately 70 million withdrawn acres, prioritizing 26 million for potential return or alternative uses. Over 6 million acres have had withdrawals revoked, with a stringent process in place to justify retention of withdrawals. Lands not suitable for mineral development may remain closed or restricted."
