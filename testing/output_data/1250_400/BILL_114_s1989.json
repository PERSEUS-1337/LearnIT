    "content": "The \"Primary Care Enhancement Act of 2015\" allows for direct primary care service arrangements where individuals pay a fixed fee for ongoing primary care services. This arrangement is not considered a health plan or insurance. The amendment applies to taxable years after the enactment of the Act. The Primary Care Enhancement Act of 2015 allows for periodic provider fees paid to primary care physicians for defined medical services to be treated as medical care. This amendment applies to taxable years after the enactment of the Act. Additionally, there is a Medicare Primary Care Medical Home Demonstration Program. Section 1115A of the Social Security Act is amended to include a Primary Care Medical Home Model where qualified practices are reimbursed a periodic fee for services provided to individuals enrolled under part B of Medicare. The Primary Care Medical Home Model under Section 1115A of the Social Security Act reimburses qualified practices with a periodic fee for services provided to individuals enrolled in Medicare Part B. The fee paid to these practices is capped at twenty percent of the estimated monthly amount payable from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Supplementary. The Secretary shall establish a performance benchmark using ACO quality measures in the Medicare shared savings program for qualified direct primary care medical home practices participating in the model under this subsection. Beginning in the second year of the model, qualified direct primary care medical home practices will have their periodic fees adjusted based on performance. If a practice meets or exceeds the performance benchmark, the fee will increase by 5 percent for each enrolled individual. If the practice does not meet the benchmark, the fee will be reduced by 5 percent. Each qualified direct primary care medical home practice must provide preventive care, wellness counseling, primary care, and coordinate with specialty and hospital care. Failure to meet performance benchmarks for two consecutive years will result in termination from the model. The direct primary care medical home practice must offer preventive care, wellness counseling, primary care, coordination with specialty and hospital care, availability of ongoing care appointments 7 days a week, secure e-mail and telephone consultation, and a primary care provider panel size that supports the scope of services. The Secretary will prioritize selecting qualified practices for participation. The Secretary will prioritize selecting qualified direct primary care medical home practices that seek to enroll dual eligible individuals. Care provided in these practices is not considered insurance. The qualified direct primary care medical home practices participating in the model under section 1935(c)(6) of the Social Security Act shall not be considered insurance products and are not subject to regulation as insurance products by State insurance commissioners. These practices must submit an annual report to the Secretary on the progress of individuals enrolled with chronic conditions, including emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and surgeries. The Secretary shall provide qualified direct primary care medical home practices with necessary patient data for evaluation of the model. Providers enrolled in the model must report on the progress of individuals with chronic conditions, including ER visits, hospitalizations, surgeries, specialist visits, and radiology use. Providers currently opted out of Medicare can participate in a qualified direct primary care medical home practice under the model, but those excluded from federal health care programs due to fraud are not permitted to participate. The Secretary will conduct the model for at least 3 years, and after the third year, a qualified direct primary care medical home practice meeting requirements can continue permanently. The model under this subsection will continue permanently if it meets the requirements, and if a majority of qualified practices meet the criteria, the Secretary will expand the model nationwide. SEC. 5 allows Medicare Advantage organizations to contract with qualified direct primary care medical home practices to offer primary care services under their plans, including provisions for shared savings. A qualified direct primary care medical home practice is defined as one described in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act."
