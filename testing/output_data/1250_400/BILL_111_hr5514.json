States receive funds through different means and spend money on common activities. It is important for taxpayers, legislators, and agencies to have access to objective data for comparing government performance and costs effectively. The purpose of this Act is to enhance government accountability at the State level by requiring annual accountings using total accountability measures, including unit-cost data. This will help identify which States are most effective with taxpayer dollars and promote competition among States to be more efficient in spending. States with lower activity costs will serve as models for others, ensuring more accountability and value for taxpayers. The Act requires State governments receiving Federal financial assistance to submit a State fiscal accounting report before the end of the fiscal year. The report must include a summary of total funding and expenditures for each budget entity, along with unit-cost summaries. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will publish these reports on their website within 30 days of receiving them. Additionally, the Act aims to standardize State fiscal accounting reports to enhance government accountability and promote efficiency in spending. The Director will standardize State fiscal accounting reports for comparison purposes. State governments must submit program descriptions to the Director within 180 days. A classification system for agency activities will be established based on relevant data. The Director will establish a uniform system for classifying agency activities, identify conduct for each activity unit, and define performance measures for each agency activity. The Director will establish a uniform system for classifying agency activities and defining performance measures. The unit-cost summary for a State government budget entity must be one page long and include funds available, agency activities, and a reconciliation of funds with expenditures. SEC. 6. STATEMENT OF FUNDS AVAILABLE. This section requires a statement to identify all sources of funds available for expenditure by the budget entity, including State appropriations, Federal financial assistance, and other sources determined appropriate. SEC. 7. AGENCY ACTIVITY LINE ITEM LISTINGS. The agency activity line item listing must identify the activity, total funds expended, activity units, and unit cost. It should also describe conduct, purposes, and beneficiaries of the activity. Special rules apply for determining expenditures for certain activities. The Director determines allocation of expenditures for agency activities without measurable accomplishments. Total funds expended must include payments to contractors or subordinate entities. Unit-cost of agency activities is determined by a specific formula. The formula in SEC. 8 defines UC as the unit-cost of agency activity, m as the amount, and q as the number. It outlines the reconciliation of funds available with adjusted expenditures, identifying and explaining any differences. Adjusted expenditures are determined by a specific formula. The formula in SEC. 8 defines adjusted expenditures (AE) as the sum of all expenditures (EXP) for agency activities, pass-throughs (PT), and reversions (REV). A budget entity can identify pass-throughs and reversions based on criteria set by the Director. Noncompliance with filing State fiscal accounting reports will result in a 10% withholding of Federal financial assistance. Rules are outlined in SEC. 10. The Director is authorized to make rules necessary for this Act. Definitions include State government, budget entity, agency activity, and Federal financial assistance."
