    "content": "The Forest Landscape Restoration Act aims to promote collaborative ecosystem restoration of priority forest landscapes to achieve ecological, economic, and social sustainability. It leverages local, national, and private resources to reduce wildfire management costs and demonstrate the effectiveness of ecological restoration techniques. The Act also highlights the use of forest restoration byproducts to offset treatment costs and benefit rural economies. The Forest Landscape Restoration Act defines key terms such as \"covered Federal lands,\" \"Fund,\" \"program,\" and \"Secretaries.\" It establishes the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program under section 4. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program is established by the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture to fund ecological restoration treatments for priority forest landscapes. Activities must comply with the Endangered Species Act and National Environmental Policy Act. Eligible proposals must have a complete landscape restoration strategy for a 10-year period on at least 50,000 acres of primarily forested Federal lands. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program prioritizes ecological restoration treatments for a 10-year period on landscapes of at least 50,000 acres, primarily forested Federal lands. It includes the best available science in ecological restoration strategies and requirements for old-growth maintenance. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program incorporates the best available science in ecological restoration strategies, requirements for old-growth maintenance, and large-tree retention. It does not include the establishment of permanent roads and must be developed through a collaborative process involving diverse interests. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program involves diverse interests and focuses on ecological restoration projects on Federal lands. Plans include using fire for restoration, improving habitat for wildlife, maintaining water quality, controlling invasive species, managing roads, utilizing woody biomass, and reporting on performance annually. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program aims to prevent invasions of exotic species, maintain roads, utilize woody biomass, and provide employment opportunities in rural communities through various entities and partnerships. Annual performance reporting is also required. The proposal aims to utilize local entities, Youth Conservation Corps crews, small businesses, and other entities to hire and train local people for completing contracts. It also includes analyzing cost savings from reduced wildfire management costs and estimating annual Federal funding needed for implementation. The collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal includes analyzing cost savings from reduced wildfire management costs, estimating annual Federal funding needed for implementation, and meeting additional requirements determined by the Secretaries for efficient administration. The nomination process for collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals involves submission to the Bureau of Land Management Director and Regional Forester, nomination by State Directors or Regional Foresters, and documentation of proposals for funding allocation. The State Director of the Bureau of Land Management or Regional Forester making the nomination must include a proposal to use Federal funds for ecological restoration treatments on covered Federal lands and provide evidence of how funds transferred to the Secretaries would be used for restoration treatments. The State Director or Regional Forester making the nomination must provide evidence of how funds transferred to the Secretaries would be used for restoration treatments on covered Federal lands. If the proposal includes activities on non-covered Federal land, evidence of the owner's intent to participate and provide funding is required. The nomination for collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals must include evidence of the owner's intent to participate and provide funding for activities on non-covered Federal land. The Secretaries will select proposals based on ecological restoration strength, collaborative process, and proposed strategies. The Secretaries will give special consideration to various factors when selecting collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals, including ecological case strength, collaborative process, cost reduction potential, wildfire management cost reductions, proposal strength, and non-Federal investment leverage. They may fund up to 10 proposals per fiscal year. The Secretaries may select up to 10 collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals per fiscal year, with a limit of 2 proposals in any 1 region of the National Forest System. They will establish a scientific advisory panel of experts to evaluate nominated proposals based on ecological restoration strategies and likelihood of success. The Secretaries may establish a technical advisory panel of experts to evaluate proposals for landscape restoration based on ecological case strength and wildfire management cost reductions. The panel will focus on the use of woody biomass and small-diameter trees to provide local economic benefits. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Fund is established to pay for ecological restoration treatments on Federal lands, with up to 50% of the cost covered. The fund receives appropriations and interest earnings, and the Secretaries can request transfers from the Treasury for approved proposals. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Fund allows for ecological restoration treatments on Federal lands, with funding from appropriations and interest earnings. The Secretaries can request transfers from the Treasury for approved proposals and establish an accounting system. Authorization of $40,000,000 for each fiscal year 2008 through 2018 is provided, with a work plan and budget created within 180 days of selecting a proposal. Program Implementation and Monitoring: Within 180 days of selecting a collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal, the Secretaries will develop an implementation work plan and budget in collaboration with stakeholders. This plan will outline how the proposal will achieve ecological and economic benefits, including capacity building for restoration efforts. It will also include a business plan addressing cost reductions, infrastructure needs, and the sustainability of woody biomass supply for ecological restoration. The Secretaries will use funds from the Fund for ecological restoration treatments that align with the landscape restoration proposal and are identified through a collaborative process. They will also provide an annual report in collaboration with stakeholders. The Secretaries will use funds for restoration treatments consistent with the landscape restoration proposal and identified through a collaborative process. An annual report will be prepared on the accomplishments of each selected collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal, including treated acres, progress evaluation, community benefits, and results of monitoring and evaluation. The Secretaries will use a multiparty monitoring process to assess the effects of collaborative forest landscape restoration projects for at least 15 years. A report on project performance, community benefits, and costs will be provided every 5 years. The Secretaries will assess the effects of collaborative forest landscape restoration projects for at least 15 years through a multiparty monitoring process. A report on project performance, community benefits, and costs will be submitted every 5 years to specific committees."
