    "content": "The 9/11 Commission found that al Qaeda terrorists exploited weaknesses in aviation security, including a focus on potential bombers rather than hijackers, lax checkpoint screening, lack of in-flight security measures, industry compliance with hijackers, and a failure of imagination among policymakers. The 9/11 Commission identified a failure of imagination among senior policymakers and agencies responsible for intelligence, national defense, and aviation security. Before September 11, 2001, there were no specific actions taken to defend against the possibility of suicide hijackings, which were greatly underestimated. Congressional oversight of aviation security was lacking, with a focus on airport congestion and passenger service rather than potential threats. After the 9/11 attacks, Congress quickly passed the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) to address weaknesses in aviation security. ATSA established the Transportation Security Administration, mandated federal security screeners at airports, required explosive detection screening for checked bags, deployed air marshals on high-risk flights, and reinforced cockpit doors. Congressional oversight had previously focused on airport congestion and passenger service rather than terrorism threats. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) established the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) under the Department of Transportation to address security in all modes of transportation. ATSA mandated federal security screeners at airports, required explosive detection screening for checked bags, deployed air marshals on high-risk flights, and reinforced cockpit doors. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 placed TSA within the Department of Homeland Security and authorized arming airline pilots for additional security measures. Additional aviation security measures were included in the Vision 100 - Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act. The Vision 100 - Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act established an aviation security capital fund to improve baggage screening efficiency and arm pilots of all-cargo aircraft. Despite these measures, vulnerabilities in air cargo operations, general aviation, airport employee access controls, screener performance, and potential terrorist attacks using shoulder-fired missiles persist. The 9/11 Commission also identified these security weaknesses. The 9/11 Commission identified vulnerabilities in air cargo operations, general aviation, airport employee access controls, screener performance, and potential terrorist attacks using shoulder-fired missiles. The Commission made specific recommendations for improvements in airport passenger and baggage screening, and air cargo security. However, it did not address risks related to inadequate access controls in secured areas of airports and general aviation operations, or specific recommendations for shoulder-fired missile threats against commercial airliners. The 9/11 Commission acknowledged concerns about shoulder-fired missile attacks on commercial airliners but did not make specific recommendations. It emphasized the need for a multi-layered security system in aviation, with effective coordination and redundancies. The focus was on persisting vulnerabilities in commercial aviation, with recommendations tailored to address these issues. The 9/11 Commission's aviation security recommendations focused on persisting vulnerabilities in commercial aviation. Six aviation-specific recommendations were identified, including enhancing passenger pre-screening, improving explosives detection, addressing human factors at screening checkpoints, deploying baggage screening systems, intensifying cargo screening efforts, and using hardened cargo containers on passenger aircraft. Additionally, an overarching recommendation was made to prioritize transportation security based on risk and implement cost-effective deterrents. The 9/11 Commission issued an overarching recommendation for transportation security policy to prioritize based on risk and implement cost-effective deterrents. Passenger pre-screening on September 11, 2001 consisted of CAPPS, security questions, and photo ID checks. Over half of the hijackers were identified through these measures, but with little consequence. CAPPS now screens for possible hijackers and is maintained by airlines. The CAPPS system, initially used for screening individuals who might bomb a passenger jet, has evolved to screen for possible hijackers as well. CAPPS II, its successor, has faced controversy over privacy concerns. It aims to authenticate passengers' identities and check them against terrorist watch lists. The 9/11 Commission recommended improving passenger pre-screening capabilities without delay. The 9/11 Commission recommended improving passenger pre-screening capabilities without delay, utilizing federal government watchlists. Implementation of CAPPS II was limited to system testing until concerns were addressed, with airlines reluctant to provide data for testing due to liability concerns. The GAO found that TSA addressed only one of eight concerns regarding CAPPS II implementation. Airlines' reluctance to provide data for testing due to liability concerns has hindered progress. CAPPS II program has been scrapped over privacy concerns, but a new program may replace it. Congress may increase oversight of Secure Flight program and debate on the best way to proceed. H.R. 10 requires TSA to take over prescreening from airlines within 180 days and begin testing by November 1, 2004. The Secure Flight program, successor to CAPPS, may face increased oversight from Congress. H.R. 10 mandates TSA to take over prescreening from airlines within 180 days and start testing by November 1, 2004. Concerns over IEDs, highlighted by the 9/11 Commission, stem from past incidents like the Philippines Airlines bombing and Richard Reid's attempted attack. Yousef assembled an IED on an airplane, hiding it under a seat with a digital watch timer. Concerns over IEDs were raised after incidents like Richard Reid's shoe bomb attempt. The 9/11 Commission recommended improving explosives detection on passengers, as current screening technologies have limited capabilities. The 9/11 Commission recommended enhancing explosives detection on passengers by implementing new technologies such as trace detection methods and body scan imaging. These technologies are currently being tested at various airport sites to improve security measures. The 9/11 Commission recommended implementing new technologies for detecting explosives on passengers, including body scan imaging and trace detection methods. Congress may debate funding for passenger screening initiatives, while the TSA is urged to improve screener performance through human factors studies. The TSA conducted a human factors study to address screener performance issues highlighted by a recent audit. Initiatives such as threat image projection (TIP) and improved recurrent training are being implemented to enhance aviation security. Key human factors issues include screener selection, training, fitness for duty, and interaction with screening technologies. Despite some ongoing research, funding for aviation security human factors research remains limited. The TSA is conducting human factors research to address screener performance issues, including selection, training, and interaction with screening technologies. However, funding for this research is limited compared to other agencies. Congress may consider oversight to ensure concerns over passenger and baggage screening performance are adequately addressed. There is a lack of a comprehensive strategic plan for human factors in aviation security, and the National Academy of Sciences may be tasked with examining these needs. H.R. 10 includes a provision for the TSA to conduct human factors studies to improve screener performance and pilot next-generation screening technologies. Congress may debate the adequacy of funding for installing baggage screening systems, as only $250 million was appropriated in FY2004 and requested in FY2005, while Vision 100 authorizes up to $500 million annually. Integration of EDS equipment at all passenger airports is estimated to cost over $4 billion and may take several years to complete. The TSA's funding for integrating EDS equipment at airports is limited, with only $250 million appropriated in FY2004 and requested in FY2005 out of the authorized $500 million annually. The total cost of integrating EDS equipment is estimated to exceed $4 billion, leading to a slow progress in completing the integration. The TSA's approach of reimbursing airports for expenses as they are incurred could further delay the process. The 9/11 Commission recommended that the aviation industry should contribute to the costs of deploying EDS systems, but defining a fair share has been a point of contention. The 9/11 Commission recommended that the aviation industry should contribute to the costs of deploying EDS systems at airports. Airlines and airports currently share the financial burden, with airlines paying the first $250 million annually through security fees. The TSA has proposed increasing the local share of costs, which airports oppose. The Commission did not specify what they consider a fair industry contribution. The 9/11 Commission recommended that the aviation industry should contribute more to the costs of deploying EDS systems at airports. Congress is debating the equity of cost-sharing for airport security projects, with proposals to increase the local share of costs. Legislation introduced in the House seeks to double the amount collected in aviation security fees for aviation security capital fund. The House bill (H.R. 5121) aims to increase aviation security fees for the aviation security capital fund and enhance TSA's flexibility in baggage screening. The bill also addresses cargo security recommendations from the 9/11 Commission and the TSA's strategic plan for cargo security. The TSA unveiled a strategic plan for cargo security in November 2003 based on recommendations from the Aviation Security Advisory Committee. The plan includes a multi-layered risk-based approach with four key strategic objectives: enhancing shipper and supply chain security, pre-screening elevated risk cargo, using technology for targeted air cargo inspections, and securing all-cargo aircraft through facility security measures. Goals of the plan include pre-screening all cargo shipments, inspecting items considered high risk, deploying new technology solutions, and implementing operational and regulatory programs to enhance security measures. The 9/11 Commission supports the TSA's approach but suggests accelerating progress towards achieving these objectives. The 9/11 Commission supports TSA's strategic plan for cargo security but recommends accelerating progress. Congress debates the level of physical screening needed for cargo on passenger aircraft. Proposals include 100% screening, but TSA's risk-based approach is favored. Both H.R. 10 and S. 2845 aim to improve cargo screening and tracking. The 9/11 Commission recommends deploying hardened cargo containers on passenger aircraft to carry suspicious cargo, but the cost and opposition from passenger airlines may hinder this initiative. The 9/11 Commission recommends deploying hardened cargo containers on passenger aircraft to enhance security, despite potential opposition from airlines due to increased costs. Proponents argue that it adds an extra layer of defense, similar to hardened cockpit doors, while opponents suggest other security measures may suffice. However, relying on just one hardened container per aircraft may still leave vulnerabilities in cargo screening processes. The TSA requires all cargo from unvetted shippers to be carried on all-cargo planes, not passenger planes. There are concerns about detecting high-risk cargo and allowing suspect cargo in hardened containers on passenger planes. Congress may debate if hardened cargo containers can effectively protect against cargo bombings. The debate in Congress revolves around the use of hardened cargo containers on passenger aircraft to protect against potential cargo bombings. H.R. 10 proposes a pilot program to evaluate blast-resistant containers, while S. 2845 focuses on evaluating blast-resistant cargo container technology. The 9/11 Commission recommends establishing risk-based priorities for protecting transportation assets. The 9/11 Commission recommended that TSA establish risk-based priorities for protecting transportation assets, including blast-resistant cargo container technology. A unified strategic plan for aviation security is needed to allocate limited resources effectively. A unified strategic plan for aviation security is essential for effectively allocating limited resources. The TSA should focus on developing a formal strategy that addresses funding needs, budget implications, and the roles of federal, local, state authorities, and industry stakeholders. This strategy is likely to be risk-based and multi-layered, in line with recommendations from the 9/11 Commission. Congress may consider formally tasking the TSA with this responsibility. Congress may consider formally tasking the TSA with developing a national strategy for aviation security that addresses funding needs, budget implications, and the roles of federal, local, state authorities, and industry stakeholders. Challenges persist in defining roles and allocating resources for state and local participation and industry involvement in aviation security. Local jurisdictions are responsible for the physical security of airport sites, while TSA maintains security oversight and enforcement, including passenger screening. The physical security of airport sites is the responsibility of local jurisdictions and airport operators, while the TSA oversees security and passenger screening. Local governments and state authorities support aviation security through law enforcement presence. Air carriers, aircraft owners, and operators also play a role in security measures. However, there is a lack of a unified plan for assigning roles and missions to stakeholders and adopting a systems approach for aviation security. The oversight and enforcement of aviation security requirements lack a unified plan for assigning roles and missions to stakeholders. Congress and the TSA may consider improving strategic planning, resource allocation, and integration of resources for aviation security. H.R. 10 requires the Department of Homeland Security to prepare transportation security plans, including aviation security, to set risk-based priorities. H.R. 10 mandates the Department of Homeland Security to develop a comprehensive transportation security plan, including aviation security, to prioritize risks and allocate resources effectively. Congress has focused on implementing recommendations from the 9/11 Commission report, leading to the passage of legislation like Vision 100 -- Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act. The House Subcommittee on Aviation reviewed aviation security recommendations from the 9/11 Commission. The 108th Congress passed legislation including Vision 100 and the National Intelligence Reform Act in response to the Commission's recommendations. Vision 100 established a redress process for aviation professionals and required justification for Air Defense Identification Zones. Vision 100 legislation addresses aviation security concerns by establishing a redress process for aviation professionals, requiring justification for Air Defense Identification Zones, and mandating security training for airline crews. It also calls for a study on the effectiveness of aviation security measures and the development of recommendations for improvement. The Vision 100 legislation mandated a study by the Department of Homeland Security on the effectiveness of aviation security measures, including the air marshal program and security screening. It also established the Aviation Security Capital Fund, providing up to $500 million per year for aviation security improvements. Additionally, the legislation authorized grants for airports to enhance baggage explosive detection systems and other security-related projects. Vision 100 legislation mandated the implementation of security programs for air charter operators and required a review of the CAPPS II passenger prescreening system by the Government Accountability Office. The TSA has since abandoned CAPPS II and is working on an alternative prescreening system called \"Secure.\" The Vision 100 legislation required certification of various issues before implementing programs like CAPPS II, which has been replaced by \"Secure Flight.\" It also expanded the Federal Flight Deck Officer Program to include other flight crew members and mandated security regulations for foreign and domestic aircraft repair stations. Additionally, it modified background check requirements for foreign pilots seeking training in the US. The Vision 100 legislation mandated security regulations for foreign and domestic aircraft repair stations, transferred background check duties for foreign pilots to the DHS, and authorized fee collections to offset costs. The National Intelligence Reform Act addressed aviation security concerns post-9/11 and required the Department of Homeland Security to develop security measures. The National Intelligence Reform Act (P.L. 108-458) includes provisions for aviation security, requiring the Department of Homeland Security to develop a National Strategy for Transportation Security and modal-specific security plans. This includes a threat matrix for civil aviation security, guidance on biometrics for airport access control, and funding for research and development. The National Intelligence Reform Act (P.L. 108-458) mandates TSA to implement biometric technologies for airport access control and establish authentication procedures for law enforcement officers carrying firearms on passenger aircraft. It authorizes funding for research and development of biometric technologies and the creation of a center of excellence. TSA is required to test an advanced passenger prescreening system and assume the role of passenger prescreening within 180 days of completing testing. The act also mandates the establishment of redress procedures for passengers falsely identified or targeted by the system. The National Intelligence Reform Act mandates TSA to implement biometric technologies for airport access control and establish authentication procedures for law enforcement officers carrying firearms on passenger aircraft. It also requires the TSA to establish redress and remedy procedures for passengers falsely identified or targeted by the system, minimize false positives, establish oversight boards, implement safeguards for security and privacy concerns, conduct prescreening of international flights, screen individuals against terrorist watch lists, and establish a process for prescreening of air charter and leasing companies. The National Intelligence Reform Act mandates TSA to implement biometric technologies for airport access control and establish authentication procedures for law enforcement officers carrying firearms on passenger aircraft. It also requires the TSA to establish redress and remedy procedures for passengers falsely identified or targeted by the system, minimize false positives, establish oversight boards, implement safeguards for security and privacy concerns, conduct prescreening of international flights, screen individuals against terrorist watch lists, and establish a process for prescreening of air charter and leasing companies. Additionally, the act requires the TSA to prioritize developing and deploying airport checkpoint screening technologies to detect various weapons and explosives, as well as create a strategic plan for the deployment of explosive detection equipment at airport screening checkpoints. The National Intelligence Reform Act mandates TSA to implement biometric technologies for airport access control, establish authentication procedures for law enforcement officers carrying firearms on passenger aircraft, and prioritize developing and deploying airport checkpoint screening technologies to detect weapons and explosives. It also requires the TSA to create a strategic plan for the deployment of explosive detection equipment at airport screening checkpoints, initiate a pilot program to test advanced screening systems, conduct a human factors study to improve screener performance, and provide training for law enforcement officers on inflight counterterrorism procedures and identification of fraudulent documents. The National Intelligence Reform Act mandates TSA to implement biometric technologies for airport access control and prioritize developing airport checkpoint screening technologies. It also requires training for law enforcement officers on inflight counterterrorism procedures and identification of fraudulent documents. Additionally, it encourages international agreements for the deployment of Federal air marshals on international flights and authorizes air marshal training for foreign law enforcement personnel. The act also increases funding for aviation security capital and directs the TSA to expedite the installation of in-line baggage screening equipment at airports. The act increases funding for aviation security capital by authorizing up to $400 million per year through FY2007. It also directs TSA to study wireless communication technologies for cabin crew notifications, issue tamper-resistant pilot licenses, develop screener staffing standards, and study integrating screening workforce operations. The act requires the TSA to develop standards for screener staffing levels at airports, integrate screening workforce operations, fund research for explosive detection systems, prohibit certain carry-on items, pursue international treaties to limit MANPADS proliferation, and destroy excess MANPADS stockpiles worldwide. The act directs the President to pursue international treaties to limit the availability, transfer, and proliferation of MANPADSs worldwide. It also requires reports on diplomatic efforts, annual briefings on MANPADS non-proliferation, expedited certification for missile defense systems on commercial aircraft, assessment of aircraft vulnerability to MANPADS attacks, and a pilot program for blast-resistant cargo containers. Additionally, it authorizes funding for improved air cargo and airport security. The act authorizes funding for improved air cargo and airport security, including a pilot program for blast-resistant cargo containers. It also establishes a grant program for advanced air cargo security technology and requires the TSA to issue final regulations for cargo operations security. Additionally, the act mandates a report on threats from international cargo shipments and the potential for secure facilities along aviation routes. The DHS, in coordination with the Department of Defense and the FAA, is required to report on threats posed by international cargo shipments to the US and analyze the potential for secure facilities along aviation routes. The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2005 directs research, development, and procurement of systems to inspect and screen air cargo on passenger aircraft. The 108th Congress addressed many aviation security concerns, but some policy areas may not have been adequately covered. During the 108th Congress, aviation security concerns were addressed, but some areas like general aviation security and air cargo procedures were not fully covered. The 9/11 Commission briefly mentioned concerns about general aviation security, but no formal recommendations were made. Legislation focused on airport and airspace restrictions, with a provision in Vision 100 requiring the development of a security plan for general aviation flights at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Temporary flight restrictions were also discussed. During the 108th Congress, legislation addressing general aviation security was viewed as lacking cohesion and comprehensiveness. Concerns were raised about the risk posed by corporate jets, private planes, and helicopters, as highlighted in a recent assessment by the FBI and DHS. Comprehensive measures for air cargo security operations and oversight were also deemed inadequate during this time. During the 108th Congress, concerns were raised about the lack of comprehensive legislation for air cargo security operations and oversight. Specific measures proposed in S. 165 were removed from the final National Intelligence Reform Bill of 2004, leading to the TSA being directed to address these issues through proposed rulemaking. The 109th Congress may focus on overseeing the TSA's implementation of air cargo security rules to ensure they meet objectives."
