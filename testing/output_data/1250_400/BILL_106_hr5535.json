    "content": "The \"Coastal Resources Enhancement and Restoration Act of 2000\" establishes National Science Foundation research grants for coastal engineering and shoreline protection. Not less than 10 percent of engineering research grants shall be used for coastal engineering and coastline protection research starting in fiscal year 2001. Additionally, supplemental environmental programs in coastal areas are addressed. SEC. 3 amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to allow federal agencies violating the Act to choose to undertake artificial reef and aquatic habitat restoration projects instead of paying fines. SEC. 4 addresses access to publicly owned shores. The amendment allows publicly owned shores with insufficient public access to be considered privately owned for shoreline protection projects. Cost sharing for such shores is defined, and rules will be issued by the Secretary of the Army to ensure public access. The Secretary of the Army will issue rules to ensure public access to publicly owned shores for shoreline protection projects, with exceptions for environmentally sensitive areas. SEC. 5. BEACH NOURISHMENT ACCOUNT. Establishment of the Beach Nourishment Account in the Treasury with funds from the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. Funds are available for a pilot program and projects for beach nourishment, shore protection, and erosion control without further appropriation. The Beach Nourishment Account in the Treasury, funded by the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, supports a pilot program and projects for beach nourishment, shore protection, and erosion control. The Secretary of the Army is responsible for carrying out these projects, following cost-sharing requirements and reporting transactions to Congress. Remaining funds in the account can be invested by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary of the Treasury can invest funds not needed for current withdrawals from the Beach Nourishment Account in interest-bearing US obligations. The interest and proceeds from these investments will be credited to the account. SEC. 6. COMPREHENSIVE OCEAN OBSERVING SYSTEM PILOT PROGRAM. The Secretary of Commerce and the Administrator of NASA will jointly implement a pilot program to establish a comprehensive ocean monitoring network in the United States. Partnerships will be formed with local interests to collect a wide range of data on coastal oceans and inland waterways. Information collected will include wave heights, coastal currents, mammal movement, sewage outfall, and water quality. The pilot program for the ocean monitoring network will include data on wave heights, coastal currents, mammal movement, sewage outfall, water quality, fishing boat tracking, oil spill tracking, beach erosion, weather, river mouth sediment observation, and coastal mapping. Federal cooperation will involve the Geological Survey, Navy, and Environmental Protection Agency. Regional test projects will be established in Southern California and another location. The pilot program for the ocean monitoring network will establish two regional test projects in Southern California and another location. The Secretary and the Administrator will coordinate existing efforts and seek to obtain additional information. $4,000,000 will be available annually from the Beach Nourishment Account for this program. The Beach Nourishment Account will provide $4,000,000 annually from 2001 to 2006 for two regional test projects under the ocean monitoring network pilot program."
