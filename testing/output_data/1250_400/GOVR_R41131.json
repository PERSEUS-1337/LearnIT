    "content": "The alternate engine program for the F-35 Lightning II fighter was a significant issue for Congress in FY2012, with implications for the defense budget and military capability. The program developed the General Electric/Rolls-Royce F136 engine as an alternative to the Pratt & Whitney F135 engine. Despite successive Administration proposals to terminate the program, Congress continued to fund it until the announcement of its termination in December 2011. On December 2, 2011, General Electric and Rolls-Royce ended development of the F136 engine, terminating the F-35 engine competition. The Department of Defense selected the Lockheed Martin F-35 with the Pratt & Whitney F135 engine in 2001. Congress required an alternate engine for the F-35, leading to the development of the F136 engine. Despite Administration proposals to terminate the program, Congress continued to fund it until its termination in December 2011. The alternate engine program for the F-35 was proposed to be terminated due to high costs, but Congress restored funding multiple times. However, in FY2011, funding was deleted, and the program was formally terminated in April 2011. Supporters of the termination argued that developing a second engine would significantly increase costs and reduce the number of F-35s that could be procured. The potential termination of the alternate engine program for the F-35 was due to high costs and concerns about reducing the number of F-35s that could be procured. The reduction in procurement over the next five years could total 50 to 80 aircraft if a second engine is procured, leading to increased life-cycle operation and support costs. Having a second engine is deemed unnecessary to sustain international interest in the F-35, as significant potential foreign buyers are already committed to the program. Congress has accepted the risk of using single designs across fleets for both powerplants and airframes. The F-35 program has significant reasons for interest, including capabilities, procurement cost, and operating costs. Congress accepts the risk of using single designs across fleets. Development of the F135 engine has progressed to the point where an alternate engine program is no longer necessary. Opponents argue that terminating the alternate engine program does not comply with Section 213 of the FY2008 defense. The Administration's proposal to terminate the alternate engine program for the F-35 program is being opposed due to concerns about compliance with Section 213 of the FY2008 defense authorization act. This section mandates the development and procurement of 2 options for the propulsion system to ensure competitive production for the Joint Strike Fighter. The proposal to terminate the alternate engine program for the F-35 program is being opposed to ensure competitive production for the Joint Strike Fighter. Having a second engine in production would allow for competition in procuring and supporting F-35 engines, potentially reducing costs and promoting better engine performance and reliability. Having two F-35 engine production lines would also allow for quicker production surges if needed. The F-35 alternate engine program was terminated by DOD on April 25, 2011, despite the potential benefits of having a second engine in production for competitive procurement, better engine performance, and international interest in the F-35 program. The F-35 alternate engine program was terminated by DOD on April 25, 2011, despite the potential benefits of competition in engine production. General Electric and Rolls-Royce ended their self-funded development of the F136 engine on December 2, 2011. Pratt & Whitney, the incumbent engine maker, received $7.3 billion in funding for work related to the F-35 program. The F-35 program received $7.3 billion in funding during FY1994-FY2009, including $6.1 billion for F135 System Development and Demonstration work. The F136 engine team received $2.4 billion during FY1995-FY2009, with $1.7 billion for SDD work. The F136 SDD contract had fewer test hours and ground test engines compared to the F135 contract. The F136 engine team's effort from FY2005-FY2009 did not include design, development, test, or delivery of STOVL Lift System components and exhaust systems, which were provided under the F135 Pratt & Whitney SDD contract. The F136 SDD contract had fewer test hours and ground test engines. The government operated under a series of continuing resolutions (CRs) between FY2011 and the enactment of the final FY2011 DOD and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act on April 15, 2011. Some members of Congress questioned the status of the program during the CR period due to the Administration's opposition to further funding of the alternate engine program. The CRs set DOD spending at FY2010 levels, including war funding. The Office of Management and Budget Director assured funding on a pro-rata basis. The alternate engine program was funded at FY2010 levels until a stop-work order was issued in March 2011. Secretary of Defense Gates testified about the program's cost. The alternate engine program was funded at the FY2010 level from October 1, 2010, through March 24, 2011, when DOD issued a stop-work order. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates testified that there is little advantage to having a second engine as most customers will only buy one due to limited logistics and space. The F135 engine program is doing well, completing 13,000 hours of testing out of 14,700, while the F136 has only completed 50 hours of testing. The Air Force part of the alternate engine program was deemed unnecessary due to limited logistics and space. The F135 engine program has completed 13,000 hours of testing out of 14,700, while the F136 has only completed 50 hours. Secretary of the Air Force Michael Donley expressed doubts about the benefits of investing in a second engine at a hearing. The Air Force Chief of Staff testified that the F-35 should not have an alternate engine due to advancements in engine technology. General Schwartz also mentioned that having more engines could result in fewer F-35s, which would not be beneficial for the Air Force or the Department of Defense. He questioned the need for an alternate engine funding, suggesting that Rolls and GE should invest more if they believe in the value of their product. General Schwartz and Adm. Roughead questioned the need for funding an alternate engine for the F-35, suggesting that Rolls and GE should invest more if they believe in the value of their product. The idea of having a second engine manufacturer was discussed to allow competition and potentially save costs. The need for an alternate engine for the F-35 was questioned by General Schwartz and Adm. Roughead, who suggested that Rolls and GE should invest more in their product. Developing a second engine would require significant upfront costs for tooling, infrastructure, and sustainment. The Administration believed the alternative engine program was no longer necessary as a hedge against the main engine program's failure, citing small financial benefits from competition due to high development costs. The Administration believed the alternative engine program for the F-35 was no longer needed as a hedge against the main engine program's failure, citing small financial benefits from competition due to high development costs. OMB stated that cancellation would result in estimated near-term savings of over a billion dollars. GAO testified that competitive pressures could yield enough savings to offset the costs of competition over the JSF program's life, with potential savings equal to or exceeding the investment required for the alternate engine program. The GAO stated that an additional investment of $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion may be needed for the alternate engine program for the F-35, with potential savings of 9 to 11 percent. They highlighted the benefits of competition, including cost savings and nonfinancial benefits like better performance and increased reliability. Proponents argue that a competitor is necessary to control costs, while the Administration believes the costs of a second engine outweigh the benefits. Cost has been a significant issue in the alternate engine debate for the F-35. Proponents argue that a competitor is needed to control costs, pointing to cost growth in the F135 engine. In response, Secretary Gates stated that cost growth is expected with developmental aircraft and that the problems with the engine are manageable without the need for a second engine. A Joint Assessment Team was created by DOD to investigate Pratt & Whitney's cost structure and production issues. In July 2009, the Department of Defense created a Joint Assessment Team (JAT) to investigate Pratt & Whitney's cost structure and production issues related to the F135 engine for the F-35 Lightning II program. The JAT's charter included understanding production costs, cost projections, and developing a plan to address cost and affordability. A Pentagon study indicated that adding a second engine would cost the same as sticking to a single-source plan, supporting the decision to reject proposals for a competitive engine acquisition strategy. The Pentagon memo supports the decision to reject proposals for a competitive engine acquisition strategy for the F-35 program. The estimated costs for a second engine are equivalent to a sole-source scenario. Despite reduced development costs for the F136 engine, the potential cost savings from two competing F-35 engine programs are not compelling. Pratt & Whitney received $1 billion for additional F135 engines and production improvements. Pratt & Whitney received $1 billion for additional F135 engines and production improvements, with a focus on engine improvements for the F-35B variant. Section 211 of the 2007 defense authorization act directed three independent cost analyses of the F-35 engine program, which resulted in differing conclusions regarding the financial break-even points for an alternate engine program. The Cost Analysis Improvement Group (CAIG), Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA), and GAO conducted studies in 2007 using data from the JSF program office and contractors. They had differing conclusions on financial break-even points for an alternate engine program, citing non-financial benefits like fleet readiness and international relations. The CAIG study analyzed engine competitions for the F-16, F/A-18, and F-22 programs, favoring a dual-source approach based on past cost performance. The CAIG study analyzed past cost performance in acquisition efforts using competition for the Navy and Marine Corps F/A-18 strike fighter program and the F-22 engine procurement. It assumed a 5% immediate price decrease and a steeper cost reduction for subsequent engines with competition. The study estimated a 21.1% reduction in engine procurement costs over the program's lifetime to break even, with a 25.6% reduction on a net-present-value basis. The CAIG study found that a 21.1% reduction in engine procurement costs was needed to break even, with a 25.6% reduction on a net-present-value basis. It was estimated that DOD would need to compete engine operations and support contracts to achieve these savings by 2040. The study also discussed the growth potential in the F-35 engine, projecting a 7.2% weight growth between Critical Design Review and Initial Operational Capability. The CAIG study discussed the growth potential in the F-35 engine, estimating a 7.2% weight growth between Critical Design Review and Initial Operational Capability. It mentioned that Pratt & Whitney's F135 engine was close to exceeding its designed engine temperature specifications, requiring modifications for thrust growth. The IDA study examined engine competition for the F-16 and F/A-18 programs, estimating a 11% to 18% gross savings with an alternate engine program for the F-35. The IDA study estimated that an F-35 engine competition could result in a gross savings of 11% to 18%. It concluded that investing in an alternate engine program for the F-35 would incur costs of $8.8 billion in constant FY2006 dollars, which would be challenging to recoup through procurement-cost savings alone. The study suggested that a 40% procurement-cost savings would be needed for the program to break even on an NPV basis, but this could decrease to 18% if engine O&S contracts were also competed. The study highlighted the lack of historical data linking procurement and O&S costs in a single competition and emphasized contractor responsiveness as a key factor in the \"Great Engine War.\" The IDA study suggested that an alternate engine for the F-35 could lead to significant savings and enhance industry responsiveness. The GAO study stated that a 10.3% to 12.3% procurement-cost savings would be needed for the program to break even, with potential savings of up to 20% from past engine competitions. Michael Sullivan from GAO believed the alternate engine program would be successful. The study suggested that an alternate engine for the F-35 could lead to significant financial savings of up to 20%. The GAO's director believed the program would reach its break-even point by the late 2020s, despite marginal financial benefits. The size of the F-35 production run will impact the potential for reaching a break-even point for an alternate engine program. The size of the F-35 production run will be influenced by U.S. and foreign governments' decisions on procurement. Engine manufacturers like GE/Rolls-Royce and Pratt & Whitney have made offers for building F136 and F135 engines at fixed prices or with cost-plus contracts. These decisions can change over time due to shifts in international security and defense budgets, making it hard to predict the final size of the production run. Pratt & Whitney and GE/Rolls-Royce made offers for F135 engines at reduced prices. A fixed-price contract for F135s was agreed upon for F-35s in Low Rate Initial Production Lot IV, with costs 16% lower than the previous lot. An MOU signed in 2006 outlined production work for the JSF Air System, including propulsion systems. The 2006 MOU signed by the United States outlines production work for the JSF Air System, including the production of the JSF Air Vehicle with propulsion systems F135 and F136. The scope of work includes development of primary and alternate propulsion systems subject to the availability of funds. The provision for cooperative production and procurement of F135 and F136 remains valid, with ongoing implementation of obligations contingent on U.S. and partner nation funds. Discussions have taken place regarding the exclusion of F136 in RDT&E funding requests, with no plans for amendment. The Department will continue to implement its obligations for the JSF SDD and PSFD MOU, including cooperative production of F135 and F136, based on funding availability. Consultations have been held with partners regarding the exclusion of F136 in funding requests. The UK and other partners support the F136, expressing concerns about long-term costs if the second engine is canceled. British Secretary of State for Defence Liam Fox supports the F136 engine, expressing concerns about long-term costs if it is canceled. Both JSF engines have faced development challenges, including failures during ground testing due to high-cycle fatigue. These engine malfunctions have caused delays in the F-35B aircraft's first flight and contributed to cost overruns in the F135 program. The ongoing testing to determine the causes of engine failures in the F-35B aircraft resulted in delays and cost overruns in the F135 program. Pratt & Whitney identified worn bushings and loose nuts as causes of damage to the engines. The F136 engine also encountered test incidents, including ingestion of a test sensor and impact damage to turbine blades. In 2009, an F136 engine ingested a test sensor and sustained impact damage to turbine blades. A loose nut was found to be the cause, leading to a minor redesign. In 2010, another F136 engine sustained damage, prompting a design change. In 2011, some F135 engines were replaced due to a misassembly issue identified during testing. Pratt & Whitney confirmed the replacements and initiated further checks on other engines. Since March, a number of F135 test and production engines have been replaced with spares due to a mis-assembly issue discovered after an overhaul. Pratt & Whitney responded to criticism about quality control deficiencies, stating that only a few parts had a high scrap rate and overall, they were running at a 97 percent yield rate for the total engine. William Begert, the vice president of business development, stated that only a few parts had a high scrap rate, with an overall yield rate of 97 percent for the total engine. Pratt & Whitney achieved 115% of required thrust with a production-representative General Electric F136. The Administration's FY2012 budget proposes terminating the alternate engine program, raising questions for Congress on whether to continue or terminate the program. Congressional appropriations have supported the program using funds from various sources, including existing F-35 program funds and additional funds from within the DOD topline. If the alternate engine program is continued, questions may arise about funding sources and potential impacts on other DOD programs. Congressional appropriations have supported the program using funds from existing F-35 program funds and additional funds from within the DOD topline. The source of funds could affect other DOD programs, with potential consequences such as curtailed F-35 activities or the need to transfer funds from other defense programs to F-35. Congress may need to address these issues. The program executive officer (PEO), Marine Corps Brig. Gen. David Heinz, plans to phase out 50-80 tails from the program over the next five years. Congress faces a decision on whether to continue the alternate engine program, which could impact the number of F-35s procured, cause delays, or reduce other defense capabilities. Additional funding of $2.9 billion over six years is needed to develop the F136 engine for competition. The need for an additional $2.9 billion over six years to develop the F136 engine for competition has been highlighted. Different cost projections and assumptions regarding the effects of competition on cost are key factors in the decision-making process for Congress. Supporters of the F136 engine argue that the upfront cost of its development can be offset by savings from competition over the program's lifetime. The role of competition in controlling cost growth is emphasized, with advocates suggesting that having a single engine type for the F-35 may pose a fleet-grounding risk. The decision for Congress lies in determining which assumptions to believe regarding the benefits of competition in procurement. Congress may need to consider the fleet-grounding risk of a single engine type for the F-35 compared to other aircraft fleets. Supporters of a second engine argue that relying on one type of engine for the majority of future U.S. fighters could lead to all F-35s being grounded in case of engine issues. Past instances of groundings due to engine problems in the Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force are cited. DOD officials believe that terminating the alternate engine program poses minimal operational risk, as current engine performance is satisfactory. DOD argues that advancements in technology reduce operational risks of relying on a single engine type for aircraft, as engines can now diagnose their own condition and provide advanced warning of impending failures. Despite potential cost savings, logistical issues may complicate the use of multiple engines, especially for the Navy with limited facilities. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Gary Roughead supports the use of a single engine type. The Navy faces logistical challenges in supporting multiple engines due to limited facilities. Admiral Gary Roughead supports using a single engine type, emphasizing space constraints on carriers. Air Force Chief of Staff Norton Schwartz expresses concerns about the practicality of having alternate engines for the Air Force only. Congress may need to decide on using multiple engines for one service or the entire F-35 program. The Air Force has experience supporting multiple engine types for single-airframe fleets with the F-16 and F-15. Congress may need to decide on using multiple engines for the F-35 program. General Electric's ability to compete for future fighter aircraft engines may be affected if the F136 engine is terminated. General Electric has a significant share of the market for commercial aircraft engines and supports various military aircraft engines. General Electric has a significant market share in commercial aircraft engines and supports military aircraft engines like the F400 and F110 series. A 2007 study highlighted GE's strong position in the commercial engine market, producing 1,000 engines compared to Pratt & Whitney's 220. The study also noted that GE derives 15% of its business from military engines, while Pratt & Whitney derives 50%. Concerns arise about GE's ability to design and produce fighter engines if the F136 program is terminated, as about 200 military jet engineers may not be able to transfer their skills to commercial engines. The termination of the F136 program could impact General Electric's ability to design and produce fighter engines, potentially reducing their competitiveness for military engine contracts. It may also lead to a decrease in suppliers for F-35 engine spare parts, increasing vulnerability to disruptions. Maintaining competition between the F135 and F136 engines could create uncertainty for suppliers and reduce workload for individual F135 suppliers. Multiple vendors could potentially create parts for each engine, as suggested by a defense consulting firm in 2006. The uncertainty for F135 and F136 suppliers regarding annual business volumes is highlighted. A defense consulting firm suggested in 2006 that multiple vendors could create parts for each engine. The IDA study of 2007 concluded that it is unlikely for suppliers to exit the domestic industrial base due to F136 termination. The study expressed concerns about DOD placing all fighter engine production with a firm weak in the commercial marketplace. Overall, the U.S. industrial base would be stronger with an active F136 program. The IDA study of 2007 concluded that it is unlikely for suppliers to exit the domestic industrial base due to F136 termination. The U.S. industrial base would be stronger with an active F136 program, as competition between General Electric and Pratt & Whitney improved engine development. Congress may consider the non-monetary value of competition in engine choice. The House passed H.R. 1540, including language requiring competitive development and procurement of the F-35's engine. The House passed H.R. 1540, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, which includes language barring funds for performance improvements to the F-35's engine unless developed and procured competitively. The Act also requires DOD to preserve existing F136 engines and tooling and allows the contractor to conduct research and development on the engine at their expense. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 prohibits funds for performance improvements to the F-35's engine unless developed and procured competitively. The Act also mandates the preservation and storage of property related to the F136 propulsion system. The Secretary of Defense is required to develop a plan for preserving and storing property related to the F136 propulsion system. The plan must ensure that the property can be used to restart development, sustain and repair the system, and be stored at government or contractor facilities. Additionally, the plan must identify costs for restarting development, allow for contractor use of the property for research and testing, and determine any necessary contract modifications or funding. The Secretary of Defense is required to develop a plan for preserving and storing property related to the F136 propulsion system, allowing for contractor use for research and testing. The plan must identify costs for restarting development and determine any necessary contract modifications or funding. Additionally, the plan prohibits the disposal of the property and requires a report to be submitted to the congressional defense committees. The Secretary of Defense is mandated to submit a report to Congress on the plan for the F136 propulsion system. The committee supports the contractor's efforts to continue development despite program cancellation, emphasizing the importance of competition for the success of the Joint Strike Fighter program. The Administration's statement on H.R. 1540 highlights the significance of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Propulsion System. The Administration strongly objects to limiting funds for F-35 engine improvements without competitive development, citing potential delays and cost increases. This could destabilize the program and impact the viability of certain variants. The Administration opposes funding for the F136 engine program, citing potential destabilization of the F-35 program and delays in engine development. They also object to the requirement to store and preserve property from the terminated program, citing unnecessary costs during a period of fiscal restraint. The Senate passed S. 1867, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, which includes language prohibiting funds for the F136 engine. The conference report on H.R. 1540 addresses the preservation and storage of F136 assets. The conference report on H.R. 1540 includes language on the preservation and storage of F136 assets, requiring the Secretary of Defense to develop a plan for the disposition of property acquired under the F136 propulsion system development contract. The plan must ensure long-term sustainment and repair of the property and allow for preservation and storage at government facilities or contractor locations. The Secretary of Defense must develop a plan for the disposition of property acquired under the F136 propulsion system development contract, allowing for preservation and storage at government facilities or contractor locations. No funds can be used for destroying or disposing of the property until a report is submitted to the congressional defense committees. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report to the congressional defense committees within 120 days of the enactment of the Act, detailing the plan for the F136 propulsion system. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees did not include funding for the F-35 alternate engine in the 2012 Department of Defense Appropriations Act. The 2012 Department of Defense Appropriations Act, passed as part of H.R. 2055, did not include funding or language for the F-35 alternate engine program. The legislative history appendix covers details from FY1996-FY2010, focusing on final bill and report language related to the program. The FY1996 Defense Authorization Act authorized funding for the F-35 program, previously known as the Joint Advanced Strike Technology (JAST) program. The act required a report on the program, allocated $7 million for competitive engine concepts, and directed the Department to include two separate approaches to reduce program risk. The Senate report questioned the program's ability to meet the needs of the three services. The conference report on S. 1124 discussed the need for engine competition in the JAST program and directed the Department to include two separate approaches to reduce program risk. The conferees emphasized the importance of adequate engine competition and the scale of flying prototypes in the program. The Under Secretary of Defense was directed to ensure engine competition and appropriate demonstrator aircraft size in the JAST program plan. The Department's JAST program plan includes engine competition and appropriate demonstrator aircraft size to reduce program risk. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommends funding for competitive engine concepts to lower life cycle costs and increase confidence in achieving affordability. The committee supports competitive propulsion programs to reduce risk and achieve more affordable life cycle costs. They direct the evaluation of at least two propulsion concepts from competing engine companies for full scale aircraft demonstrators. The history of fighter engine propulsion plants shows challenges in developing new engines, with dissatisfaction leading to upgrades and additional manufacturers being brought in. The committee supports competitive propulsion programs to reduce risk and achieve more affordable life cycle costs by evaluating at least two propulsion concepts from competing engine companies for full scale aircraft demonstrators. The history of fighter engine propulsion plants shows challenges in developing new engines, with dissatisfaction leading to upgrades and additional manufacturers being brought in. The JAST program's decision to select a single power plant design, a derivative of the F-22 engine, without proven reliability is deemed unwise by the Committee, urging the program to actively pursue an engine design with competition. The Committee supports competitive propulsion programs to reduce risk and achieve more affordable life cycle costs by evaluating at least two propulsion concepts from competing engine companies for full scale aircraft demonstrators. They believe it is imperative for the JAST program to actively pursue an engine design from a second manufacturer to avoid potential engine performance difficulties. Additional funds have been provided for this purpose in the FY1997 Defense Authorization Act. The committee directs that remaining competition funds be rebaselined to ensure integration into the preferred weapons system concept. The FY1998 Defense Authorization Act discusses accelerating development of an alternate engine for the Joint Strike Fighter program. The FY1998 Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 1119 / P.L. 105-85) requires a report on the Joint Strike Fighter program's funding for an alternate engine development program.

The program's funding levels need to be maintained for risk mitigation projects. The House Armed Services Committee supports the JSF alternate engine program to maintain the fighter aircraft engine industrial base. The committee recommends increased funding to accelerate the JSF AEP development for configuration compatibility with the JSF airframe. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends $144.5 million in funding for the JSF AEP, with no impact on the AEP schedule or funding diversion. The FY2002 Defense Authorization Act emphasizes integrating the alternate engine into the JSF program before full rate production. The Department is urged to develop and integrate the JSF alternate engine within the EMD program to mitigate technical risks. The House Armed Services Committee report highlighted the need for funding to reduce development schedule risk for common hardware components. The JSF program aims to field aircraft with commonality among variants to minimize costs. The JSF joint program office has encouraged collaboration between engine manufacturers for co-development of propulsion components. The committee recommends increased funding of $779.5 million in PE 64800F to reduce development schedule risk of the JSF alternate engine common hardware components. The conference report on H.R. 5010 includes an additional $29,750,000 for the project.

Actions following critical cost growth may lead to restructuring of the F-35 Lightning II aircraft major defense acquisition program. The F136 engine development and procurement program is designated as a major subprogram with stricter oversight and reporting requirements. Actions taken in accordance with these requirements must meet the criteria set forth in section 2433a of title 10, United States Code. If programmatic changes cause the acquisition or procurement unit cost to increase by a certain threshold, additional reassessment and actions may be necessary. The report on H.R. 5136 includes details on the F-35 alternate engine program, with funding allocated for the development and procurement of the F-35 aircraft and a competitive F-35 propulsion system. The F136 engine is being developed as an alternative to the F135 engine, with consistent recommendations for increased funding by the committee over the past four years. The committee recommended funding for the F-35 competitive propulsion system, specifically the F136 engine as an alternative to the F135 engine. Despite Congress appropriating funds for this purpose, the Department of Defense has not included funds for the competitive propulsion system in the budget request for the fifth consecutive year. The committee expressed disappointment in the DOD's lack of compliance with the law requiring the development and procurement of a competitive propulsion system for the F-35. The committee expressed disappointment in the Department of Defense for not including funds for the competitive propulsion system in the budget request for the F-35, despite Congress appropriating funds for it. Cost increases in the F135 engine development program and procurement were noted, with the GAO reporting a 50% increase in development costs. The Under Secretary of Defense directed a review of the F135 cost structure due to significant cost increases in fiscal year 2009. The Under Secretary of Defense directed a review of the F135 cost structure due to significant cost increases in fiscal year 2009. A Joint Assessment Team (JAT) concluded that engine contractor improvement plans were credible but challenging, requiring additional investment for cost reduction initiatives. An investment of $2.9 billion over six years would be needed to finish F136 engine development for competitive procurement of F-35 engines in 2017. The committee is puzzled by the long-term costs being the same for a competitive F-35 engine acquisition strategy. The committee recommends a $485.0 million increase for the competitive engine program in PEs 64800F, 64800N, and 64800M. The F-35 Joint Program Office and contractor failed to meet cost and schedule expectations. The committee recommends a $485.0 million increase for the competitive engine program in PEs 64800F, 64800N, and 64800M due to the F-35 Joint Program Office and contractor failing to meet cost and schedule expectations. Additionally, reviews conducted by the Department of Defense highlighted increased development time and costs, as well as high production risk. The F-35 development program faces delays and increased costs, with the Department of Defense proposing measures to mitigate risks. These include procuring an additional test aircraft, adjusting production rates, and increasing budget allocations. The program is projected to be delayed by 13 months and cost $2.8 billion more. The Secretary of the Air Force has informed the committee that unit costs will exceed thresholds by over 50 percent. The F-35 program is facing delays and increased costs, exceeding unit cost thresholds by more than 50 percent. Testimonies have highlighted issues with late delivery of test aircraft and unrealistic development and test plans. The F-35 program has faced delays due to late delivery of test aircraft and unrealistic development and test plans. The Department of Defense plans to procure 307 aircraft at a cost of $58.2 billion before completing developmental flight testing by mid-fiscal year 2015. Despite findings and continued research and development, the request for 43 F-35 aircraft for fiscal year 2011 remains unchanged from projections in fiscal year 2009. The F-35 program has faced delays due to late delivery of test aircraft and unrealistic development and test plans. Despite findings and continued research and development, the request for 43 F-35 aircraft for fiscal year 2011 remains unchanged from projections in fiscal year 2009. The committee recommends authorization of the budget request for 42 aircraft for fiscal year 2011, subject to completion of certain milestones planned by the Department for calendar year 2010. The committee recommends authorization of the budget request for 42 aircraft for fiscal year 2011, subject to completion of certain milestones planned by the Department for calendar year 2010. Certification is required before procurement of more than 30 F-35 aircraft can proceed. The Administration objects to the additional funding for the extra engine program and associated provisions. The legislative provisions limit JSF development funding to 75 percent until FY 2011 funds are obligated for the extra engine program. The Secretary must ensure future budgets include enough funding for the program. The F135 and F136 engine programs are designated as major subprograms. The extra engine would still need $2.4 billion investment to be viable. The Department does not believe the cost will be recovered or funds should be diverted from defense needs. The current engine has performed well with over 13,000 ground test and 200 flight test hours. If the final bill includes funding for the extra engine program, a veto would be recommended. The current engine has performed well with over 13,000 ground test and 200 flight test hours. If the final bill includes funding for the extra engine program, a veto would be recommended. The report accompanying S. 3454 included a certification requirement for further funding for the alternate engine. The Secretary of Defense would need to certify that the alternate propulsion system will reduce costs and improve operational readiness without disrupting the F-35 program. The development of the alternate propulsion system for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program aims to reduce costs and improve operational readiness without disrupting the program. H.R. 6523 did not specify funding for the F-35 alternate engine. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees issued a joint explanatory statement designating an F-35 engine development and production subprogram. H.R. 6523 included an amended version designating an F-35 engine development and production subprogram as a major subprogram of the F-35 Lightning II aircraft major defense acquisition program. The Secretary of Defense must designate the engine program within 30 days of the enactment of the Act and use the Milestone B decision as the original baseline for reporting requirements. The amended version designates an F-35 engine development and production subprogram as a major subprogram of the F-35 Lightning II aircraft acquisition program. The Secretary of Defense must designate the engine program within 30 days of enactment and use the Milestone B decision as the original baseline for reporting requirements. Actions taken following cost growth will meet the requirements for designated major subprograms. The FY2011 Defense Appropriations Act designated the F-35 engine program as a major subprogram, requiring reassessment and actions by the Secretary of Defense. Additional programmatic changes causing cost growth above a threshold would not meet the requirements. The House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee reported $450 million for the F-35 alternate engine in the FY2011 Defense Appropriations Act. The Senate version did not include funds for the program, but had positive comments. A continuing resolution maintained FY2010 spending levels until March 24, 2011, when a stop-work order was issued. The House later voted to eliminate $450 million for the alternate engine program in a proposed continuing resolution for FY2011. On February 16, 2011, the House approved an amendment to eliminate $450 million for the F-35 alternate engine program. The FY2011 DOD and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, signed into law on April 15, 2011, provided no funds for the program. Congress's interest in the alternate engine program may have been influenced by the \"Great Engine War\" competition between Pratt & Whitney and General Electric from 1984 to 1994. Historians trace the Air Force's interest in an alternate engine for the F-16 to frustrations with Pratt & Whitney's F100 engine. Congress funded General Electric's F110 engine as competition. Annual engine competitions for aircraft procurement were controversial but believed to produce better engines. The Department of Defense spent over $376 million to develop the F110 engine as an alternate option for the F-16, competing with Pratt & Whitney's F100 engine. Annual engine competitions for aircraft procurement were controversial but believed to result in better engines with improved terms and conditions. The competition led to benefits such as better warranties, contract terms, and earlier engine improvements offered by the incumbent, Pratt & Whitney. The Great Engine War resulted in benefits for the Department of Defense, including better contract terms, warranties, and engine quality. The competition led to earlier engine improvements offered by Pratt & Whitney. The management of the engine competition required contractors to provide six years of cost projections, leading to firm-fixed price contracts for six years. This was a significant change from previous negotiations with contractors. The contractors agreed to firm-fixed price contracts for six years, providing cost projections into the future, a significant change from previous negotiations. The GE Rolls-Royce Fighter Engine Team decided to discontinue self-funded development of the F136 engine for the Joint Strike Fighter beyond 2011. The GE Rolls-Royce Fighter Engine Team has decided to discontinue self-funded development of the F136 engine for the Joint Strike Fighter due to uncertainty in the program's schedules. Despite being almost 80 percent complete, the U.S. Department of Defense terminated the program in April. The team had offered to self-fund development through fiscal year 2012 but will now end its work, fulfilling termination responsibilities with the government. Rolls-Royce FET will no longer self-fund F136 development for the Joint Strike Fighter. The program, which had advanced propulsion technologies and received high marks from the DoD, has been terminated. GE and Rolls-Royce advocated for defense acquisition reform through competitive engine proposals for the JSF program."
