    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature aims to support foster care agencies by providing information on admissions requirements and financial aid to California's higher education institutions. Additionally, they urge the University of California and California State University to consider using admissions-by-exemption to help homeless and foster youth transition into four-year public colleges. Section 76010 of the Education Code is amended to prioritize housing for current and former homeless youth and foster youth at California Community Colleges. This includes giving first priority for year-round housing at no extra cost during breaks, and next priority for housing open for the most days in the year. Each campus of the California Community Colleges is required to develop a plan to ensure housing resources for current and former homeless youth and foster youth, regardless of student housing facilities. A \"homeless youth\" is defined as a student under 25 years old verified as homeless within the past 24 months by specific entities. A homeless services provider, director of federal TRIO or Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs program, and a financial aid administrator are recognized under the Education Code. Former homeless youth retain their status for six years from admission. Section 90001.5 of the Education Code is amended to prioritize current and former homeless youth and foster youth for student housing at California State University campuses. Housing facilities open year-round must first accommodate these students at no extra cost during breaks, followed by prioritizing them for housing open for the most days in the year. Each California State University campus must develop a plan to ensure housing resources for current and former homeless youth and foster youth, regardless of student housing availability. Homeless youth are defined as students under 25 who have been verified as homeless within the past 24 months. The curr_chunk discusses the eligibility criteria for students to be considered as former homeless youth for a period of six years. Section 92660 of the Education Code is amended to prioritize current and former homeless youth and foster youth for student housing at University of California campuses, providing them with stable housing at no extra cost during academic breaks. The University of California is required to develop a plan to ensure that current and former homeless youth and foster youth under 25 years of age have access to housing resources during academic breaks, regardless of campus housing availability. Homeless youth are defined as those verified as homeless within the past 24 months by specific entities. The section defines who qualifies as a homeless services provider, director of specific programs, and financial aid administrator. A student verified as a former homeless youth retains that status for six years. The University of California is exempt unless the Regents make it applicable."
