    "content": "The electric power industry historically relied on centralized power plants, but policies promoting distributed generation, like customer-sited generation and net metering, have gained traction since the 1970s energy crisis. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 encouraged states to adopt net metering, which allows consumers to offset energy provided by utilities with on-site generation. State net metering policies are relevant to discussions on renewable energy sources like solar PV in the nation's electricity system. State net metering policies are important for discussions on renewable energy sources like solar PV. Solar PV accounts for 97% of net metering capacity. Federal and state policies, such as tax incentives and renewable portfolio standards, impact the deployment of distributed solar energy sources. Recent state policy changes are expected to either expand or slow down solar energy development. Congress may consider restricting, encouraging, or requiring state policy modifications related to net metering. This report discusses the impact of recent state policy changes on solar energy development and the potential actions Congress could take regarding net metering policies. Net metering determines how customers with distributed generation are compensated for electricity they provide to the grid, typically on a one-to-one basis. Different policy options, such as buy-all, sell-all, are also considered in discussions. Net metering policies allow customers with distributed generation to have their electricity generation subtracted from their consumption for billing purposes. Different policy options, such as buy-all, sell-all, and net billing, provide financial support for distributed generation. As of April 2019, 45 states had net metering policies in place. Net metering policies in 45 states provide financial support for distributed generation. In 2018, almost 2 million customers participated in net metering programs in the United States, representing about 1% of electricity customers. The number of net metering customers increased from 2013 to 2018. Net metering participation has seen growth from 2013 to 2018, with almost 2 million customers participating in the United States. Participation levels vary by state, with Hawaii having the highest rate at over 15%. Factors influencing participation include state policies, electricity prices, and solar resource quality. The differences among states in net metering policies, renewable energy standards, electricity prices, and solar resource quality impact participation rates. Electricity ratemaking allocates costs to customers, with regulators setting rates for utilities to recover their expenses. Vertically-integrated investor-owned utilities in a service territory own and operate all parts of the electricity system. State regulators approve rates for utilities to charge customers, covering costs like power plant operation, grid maintenance, utility operating costs, programmatic costs, and a return on investments. Rates are typically set based on volumetric rates for each customer class. The setting of rates for utilities involves considerations for billing, programmatic costs, and a return on investments. Volumetric rates are commonly used, where customers within the same class pay a fixed rate per kilowatt-hour. This allows for the recovery of total costs based on electricity consumption, with separate customer charges for services like billing. Expenses for customer service are sometimes separated from electricity rates and recovered through a fixed customer charge on the bill. Large industrial customers may have special system modifications with demand charges in addition to volumetric rates. States with net metering have different compensation approaches, impacting distributed generation markets. States with net metering have different compensation approaches for distributed generation (DG) markets. EPACT05 encouraged states to adopt net metering without specifying how customers should be compensated. Many states have revised their compensation approaches in recent years, which may impact DG markets. A common approach is to compensate net metering customers at the utility's approved retail rate of electricity, known as net energy metering (NEM) policy. Initially, NEM was seen as a simple and acceptable approach when markets for solar PV and other DG were uneconomic. Net metering (NEM) policy was initially viewed as a simple and acceptable approach when markets for solar PV and other distributed generation (DG) were uneconomic. State policymakers considered the retail rate as a close proxy for setting rates, with retail rates providing high compensation for net metering generation. Retail rates reflect the total costs incurred by utilities for delivering electricity, including generating electricity and maintaining the grid. The retail rate for net metering generation provides high compensation due to reflecting total utility costs. This may lead to increased costs for non-net metering customers, known as a cost shift or cross-subsidy. Net metering customers generate electricity for their own use, reducing utility costs. However, they still rely on the grid for services, leading to potential cost increases for non-net metering customers. Concerns about equity arise as net metering customers tend to have higher incomes. Studies vary on the extent of cross-subsidies between net metering and non-net metering customers. Studies have shown that net metering customers, who tend to have higher incomes, may be cross-subsidized by non-net metering customers. Methodological differences in estimating cross-subsidies and local factors like DG penetration and electricity demand growth can impact the observed cost shifts. Estimates range from $444 to $1,752 per net metering customer per year. The magnitude of cross-subsidies and the need for policy action are subjects of debate. Net metering is just one factor affecting electricity rates, with potential rate effects being assessed in a 2017 study. A 2015 synthesis of estimates found that net metering cost shifts range from $444 to $1,752 per customer annually. A 2017 study assessed various factors affecting electricity rates, with distributed generation likely causing increases between 0.03 cents/kWh and 0.2 cents/kWh. The presence of cost shifts does not necessarily mean non-net metering customers are subsidizing net metering customers, as it depends on participation rates and regulatory decisions. Addressing cost shifts through ratemaking processes may be delayed due to inherent time lags. Non-net metering customers may be transferring money to net metering customers due to cost shifts, which can be influenced by participation rates and regulatory decisions. Addressing these shifts through ratemaking processes may be delayed, as they have inherent time lags. States are exploring options such as adding fixed charges or changing compensation rates to mitigate concerns about potential cross-subsidies from retail rate compensation. States are considering adding fixed charges or changing compensation rates to address concerns about potential cross-subsidies from retail rate compensation for net metering customers. Utilities and some advocates for low-income customers support adding fixed charges to recover grid maintenance costs, while opponents, such as the solar industry and environmental advocates, argue that net metering promotes competition and societal benefits. Adding fixed charges or alternative compensation rates is believed to reduce cost shifting and increase fairness, with opponents including the solar industry and environmental advocates. They argue that net metering fosters competition and societal benefits, while fixed charges may overlook the benefits of distributed generation, especially solar energy. Determining the value of fixed charges accurately reflecting net metering customers' grid use has been complex and controversial. Some states have adopted an avoided cost rate to represent the energy costs utilities save when customers generate their own energy. An avoided cost rate, also known as an energy rate or wholesale rate, primarily reflects energy production costs and may include network upgrades for distributed generation. It is usually lower than retail rates and can be estimated by regulators or through wholesale electricity markets. Net metering customers with solar PV may be compensated based on a value of solar rate, which considers societal benefits like reduced air emissions. Solar advocates support including societal benefits in compensation methods. Net metering customers are compensated based on a value of solar (VOS) rate, which reflects societal benefits like reduced air emissions. Solar advocates advocate for including societal benefits in net metering policy. The VOS rate can be higher than avoided cost rates but lower than retail rates, with some states considering it greater than retail rates. New York is one state implementing a related compensation rate for distributed energy resources (DERs) to reflect grid and societal benefits. New York is one state implementing a compensation rate for distributed energy resources (DERs) to reflect grid and societal benefits. States vary in their approach to evaluating net metering, with a 2018 analysis noting the significant impact of different assumptions on results. State net metering policies vary in aspects such as compensation rates, program caps, source eligibility, credit retention, and system ownership, which can impact the deployment of distributed generation (DG). Program caps, which limit the number of participants or generation capacity, can be expressed in various ways and influence the promotion of DG. State net metering policies vary in aspects such as compensation rates, program caps, source eligibility, credit retention, and system ownership, which can impact the deployment of distributed generation (DG). Program caps, which limit the number of participants or generation capacity, can affect the promotion of DG by reducing risks to the electricity system and potential financial impacts for utilities, but may also create barriers to achieving renewable energy goals. States specify which generation sources can participate in net metering, often based on capacity limits and technology type, with solar energy being the dominant source but other energy types allowed in some states based on cost factors, customer type, and location. Net metering customers can participate in the program with various energy types based on cost factors, customer type, and location. They can deliver surplus generation to the grid and receive compensation for the total amount of electricity generated, or only for the surplus delivered. Different factors like customer type and location influence the attractiveness of projects like combined heat and power facilities or distributed wind projects. Many states compensate net metering customers for surplus electricity delivered to the grid, with credits carrying over to the next bill. Different provisions exist for credit retention, impacting the potential for customers to reduce their electricity costs to $0. Net metering can apply to single generators like rooftop solar installations or aggregate setups for farms and municipalities. Shared net metering, including virtual net metering, allows multiple customers to benefit from the same generation capacity, such as community solar projects. Shared net metering allows multiple customers to benefit from the same generation capacity, such as community solar projects. Virtual net metering applies when the shared project is located onsite, for example multi-family dwellings. Third party participation, such as solar leasing and power purchase agreements, allows the solar system to be owned by an entity other than the electricity consumer. Some Members of Congress have introduced legislation to address states' net metering policies, with proposals influencing state policies directly. Some legislative proposals in Congress aim to impact state net metering policies directly. For instance, S.Amdt. 3120 in the 114th Congress sought to restrict state regulators from lowering compensation rates for net metering customers. Other bills like S.Amdt. 3053 and H.R. 4175 focus on evaluating the impact of net metering policies on cross-subsidies and promoting net billing policies for community solar. Additionally, there are calls for studies to assess the costs and benefits of net metering, with requests for reports from the Department of Energy and proposals for the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to study various aspects of net metering."
