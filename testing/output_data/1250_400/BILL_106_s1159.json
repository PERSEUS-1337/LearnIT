The findings by Congress highlight the importance of physical education for children's development, health, self-esteem, and overall well-being. It emphasizes the benefits of physical education in improving cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, flexibility, weight regulation, bone development, and more. Additionally, it points out the increasing rates of obesity among young people and the significant economic costs associated with obesity-related diseases in the United States. The percentage of young people overweight has more than doubled in the 30 years preceding 1999. Low activity levels contribute to obesity among children in the US. Obesity-related diseases cost over $100 billion annually. Inactivity and poor diet cause 300,000 deaths yearly. Physically fit adults have reduced risk for heart attacks and stroke. Children are not active enough, with less than 1 in 4 getting vigorous activity daily. Surgeon General's 1996 Report recommends daily physical education for K-12 students. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend daily physical education for all K-12 students to promote health and fitness. Despite a resolution passed in 1987, little progress has been made in providing quality physical education programs. It is essential for all students to have the opportunity to participate in physical education to develop health-related fitness and adopt healthy lifestyles. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to local educational agencies for physical education programs for K-12 students, including equipment, curriculum development, and staff training. Each local educational agency must submit an application to the Secretary outlining a plan to enhance physical education programs in schools to meet specific requirements. These requirements include providing students with a minimum of 150 minutes of instructional physical education per week, fitness education, and instruction in various motor skills to improve overall well-being. Physical education programs in schools must include fitness education, motor skills instruction, cognitive concepts about physical fitness, social and cooperative skill development, appropriate physical activity, and instruction in healthy eating habits. Teachers of physical education must have baccalaureate degrees. Teachers of physical education must have baccalaureate degrees and receive professional development. Extracurricular activities like team sports and ROTC are not part of the physical education curriculum.

Reporting is required for continued funding. \"Annual reports are required for continued funding of grants or contracts under this program.
