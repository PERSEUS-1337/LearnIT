    "content": "The federal government has been involved in collecting educational statistics for over 150 years. The National Institute of Education (NIE) and the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) were established in the 1970s to centralize research efforts. The Institute of Education Sciences (IES) replaced the NIE in 2002, becoming an independent research institute within the Department of Education. The Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA) established the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) as an independent research institute within the Department of Education. ESRA also created the National Board of Educational Sciences (NBES) to advise the Director of IES and established three National Education Centers: the National Center for Education Research (NCER), the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), and the National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance (NCEE). Additionally, P.L. 108-446 added a fourth center to operate within IES. P.L. 108-446 amended ESRA by adding the National Center for Special Education Research (NCSER) to the Institute of Education Sciences (IES). Along with ESRA, P.L. 107-279 enacted the Educational Technical Assistance Act (ETAA) and the National Assessment of Educational Progress Authorization Act (NAEPAA). ETAA provides grants for technical assistance activities, while NAEPAA authorizes national and state assessments in reading and mathematics for grades 4, 8, and 12. These changes have impacted federal educational research and statistics activities. The Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA) led to the creation of an independent research institute, the Institute of Education Sciences (IES), with more freedom from the Department of Education (ED). ESRA also established scientifically-based standards for educational research, providing greater oversight through a technical panel (NBES) compared to previous legislation. ESRA established scientifically-based standards for educational research, requiring methodological rigor for IES-supported research. Funding for ESRA, ETAA, and NAEPAA has continued through annual appropriations legislation. In the 113th and 114th Congress, bills were passed to reauthorize ESRA, ETAA, and NAEPAA with amendments related to IES. The House of Representatives passed H.R. 4366, and the Senate adopted S. 227, both bills aimed at reauthorizing ESRA, ETAA, and NAEPAA with amendments related to IES. The report provides a concise description of programs and authorities established by these acts, organized in alignment with P.L. 107-279. The Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA) under P.L. 107-279 establishes IES as a research institute within the Department of Education. IES aims to provide information on education progress, practices for academic improvement, and program effectiveness through research, statistics, and evaluations.
