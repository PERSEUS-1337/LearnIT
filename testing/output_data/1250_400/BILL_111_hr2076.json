Components of the strategy include a comparative analysis of operational control levels achievable through different security measures like fencing, barriers, and additional Border Patrol agents. The border protection strategy for US international land borders includes assessing infrastructure and security measures such as pedestrian fencing, vehicle barriers, additional Border Patrol agents, natural barriers, and advanced technology like unmanned aerial vehicles for surveillance and response analysis in difficult terrain. The border protection strategy for US international land borders includes advanced technologies and systems for surveillance, information integration, and response analysis in difficult terrain. It also involves regional variations in border security methodologies, cooperation with Mexico and Canada for detecting unauthorized crossings, and removal of obstructive vegetation. A comprehensive cost analysis is also conducted. The comprehensive cost analysis of security measures includes assessing land acquisition, construction, maintenance, contractor, management, and overhead costs, as well as impacts on wildlife, habitat, and hydrology over 25 years. The impacts on wildlife, habitat, natural communities, and hydrology along the border, including costs of mitigating adverse effects and restoring wildlife migration corridors.
