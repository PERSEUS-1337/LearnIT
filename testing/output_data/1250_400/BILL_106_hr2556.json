    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Telecommuting and Air Quality Act\" and includes a grant program for designing a pilot program to improve air quality through telecommuting. The Secretary of Transportation will grant a nonprofit entity to design a pilot program for air quality improvement through telecommuting. The program will be administered in collaboration with the EPA and the Department of Energy. Participating employers are those who voluntarily engage in telecommuting. The proposed Ozone Precursor Credit-Trading Pilot Program involves participating employers who engage in telecommuting to reduce emissions of ozone precursors, which are air pollutants leading to ground-level ozone formation. The program aims to reduce vehicle-miles-traveled and is a collaboration between the Secretary of Transportation, EPA, and Department of Energy. The proposed pilot program aims to evaluate methods for calculating reductions in emissions of ozone precursors through reduced vehicle-miles-traveled by telecommuting employees. Employers can transfer emission credits achieved to other parties through certificates. A commercial trading and exchange forum would be established for this purpose. The pilot program evaluates methods for reducing emissions of ozone precursors through telecommuting. Employers can transfer emission credits to others through certificates and a trading forum. Regulated entities can obtain credits through trades and exchanges, which can assist in achieving compliance with the Clean Air Act. The Federal Government would explore means to facilitate this process. The pilot program aims to reduce emissions of ozone precursors through telecommuting. Employers can transfer emission credits to others through certificates and a trading forum. Regulated entities can obtain credits through trades and exchanges to assist in achieving compliance with the Clean Air Act. The Federal Government would explore means to facilitate the transfer of emission credits between participating employers and regulated entities in specific geographic areas. The Secretary will select geographic areas for a pilot program to promote telecommuting and reduce vehicle miles traveled. Grantees must consult with local governments and business organizations in the selected areas. A study and report on the program's potential impact will be submitted to Congress and the Secretary. The pilot program aims to promote telecommuting and reduce vehicle miles traveled in selected geographic areas. A study will assess the program's impact on transportation policies, energy conservation, air quality, and quality of life. $250,000 is authorized for grants in fiscal year 2000."
