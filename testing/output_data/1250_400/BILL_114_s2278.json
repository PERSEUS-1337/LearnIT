    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Promoting Unlicensed Spectrum Act of 2015\" and includes definitions for key terms. The \"Promoting Unlicensed Spectrum Act of 2015\" defines key terms such as \"appropriate committees of Congress,\" \"Assistant Secretary,\" \"Commission,\" \"Federal entity,\" \"Spectrum Relocation Fund,\" and \"unlicensed operations.\" The term \"unlicensed operations\" refers to spectrum use without exclusive rights or protection from interference under specific regulations. The Federal Communications Commission allocates and allots spectrum. The Commission must balance spectrum allocation for exclusive licensing through auctions and unlicensed operations. Within 18 months of the Act, rules must be established for future allocation, including potential unlicensed operations in auctioned spectrum. These rules must be included in auction service rules and reflected in reports to Congress. SEC. 4. NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR UNLICENSED SPECTRUM. The policy of the United States is to maximize spectrum resources, promote innovation in wireless broadband, and ensure a balanced spectrum policy. The Commission must develop a national strategy within a year to make more radio frequency bands available for unlicensed operations, including clearing bands for such use and ensuring access to low-, mid-, and high-band spectrum for consumers. The Commission is considering rules to allow spectrum sharing for unlicensed operations, including expanding the spectrum sharing model and allowing underlay operations in allocated spectrum without causing interference. This aims to increase opportunities for unlicensed operations and improve spectrum utilization. The Commission is exploring various spectrum sharing approaches to expand opportunities for unlicensed operations and improve spectrum utilization. They are also examining ways to enhance the accuracy of databases and access systems for spectrum sharing and considering harmonizing additional bands for unlicensed operations. A report describing the strategy developed under this initiative, along with any legislative recommendations, is required to be submitted to Congress within a year of the enactment of the Act. The Commission must submit a report to Congress within a year of the Act's enactment, detailing the strategy developed for spectrum sharing and any legislative recommendations. The report will also be made publicly available on the Commission's website. SEC. 5. MAKING FEDERAL SPECTRUM AVAILABLE FOR UNLICENSED OPERATION. The Assistant Secretary, along with the Commission and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, must submit a report to Congress within 270 days outlining steps to designate additional radio frequency bands for unlicensed operations by Federal entities without causing interference. Recommendations include reforming the Spectrum Relocation Fund to address costs and ensuring its solvency if used for sharing radio frequency bands. Consideration is given to permitting unlicensed operations in spectrum bands used by Federal entities without interference. The report to Congress will explore the possibility of allowing unlicensed operations in spectrum bands used by Federal entities without causing harmful interference to Federal Government operations, including homeland security or national security communications needs. Additionally, it will consider alternative spectrum sharing techniques to enable radio technologies conducting unlicensed operations to access Federal spectrum."
