    "content": "The Act titled the \"Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Act of 2007\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 contains findings related to the Act. Congress finds that the possession of weapons of mass destruction by hostile states or terrorist groups poses the greatest threat to national security. It is a top priority to protect the US and its allies from such attacks. The US policy is to ensure compliance with nuclear and chemical weapons treaties. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Chemical Weapons Convention, Biological Weapons Convention, IAEA safeguards system, and various international control regimes aim to prevent the development and use of weapons of mass destruction. The United States' national security interests have been supported by various laws such as the Nunn-Lugar Act and its successors. The Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program has deactivated thousands of nuclear warheads and destroyed intercontinental ballistic missiles. The Nunn-Lugar-Domenici Act, also known as the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program, has achieved significant milestones by deactivating nuclear warheads, destroying missiles, silos, launchers, bombers, air-to-surface missiles, and submarines. President George W. Bush called for the program's expansion in 2004. President George W. Bush called for the expansion of the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program in 2004 to prevent weapons and dangerous materials from falling into the wrong hands. The program helps former Soviet states find employment for weapons scientists, dismantles and destroys weapons, and secures leftover materials from the Soviet WMD arsenal. The Sense of Congress is outlined in Section 3. The Sense of Congress in Section 3 emphasizes the utilization of all US capabilities to prevent catastrophic terrorism using weapons of mass destruction. This includes pursuing a strategy involving multilateral agreements, missile defense, arms control, threat reduction assistance, and holding nations accountable for violations of nonproliferation treaties. The US must also prevent dangerous regimes and terrorist groups from acquiring the world's most dangerous weapons.
