    "content": "The \"Red River Private Property Protection Act\" disclaims any right to land south of the Red River's South Bank boundary line. Previous surveys by the Bureau of Land Management will not determine the current boundary line. The \"Red River Private Property Protection Act\" mandates a new survey to identify the current South Bank boundary line, conducted by Licensed State Land Surveyors within 2 years. The survey must adhere to the gradient boundary survey method and be approved by the Texas General Land Office. Private property owners can appeal public domain claims to an Administrative Law Judge within 1 year of survey approval. SEC. 4. APPEAL.\n\nPrivate property owners can appeal public domain claims to an Administrative Law Judge within 1 year of survey approval.\n\nSEC. 5. RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PLAN.\n\nNo parcels of land in the affected area will be treated as Federal land for resource management plans until the survey is completed, approved, and any appeals are resolved.\n\nSEC. 6. CONSTRUCTION.\n\nThis Act does not affect the interests of States or sovereignty rights of federally recognized Indian tribes north of the Red River's South Bank boundary line.\n\nSEC. 7. SALE OF REMAINING RED RIVER SURFACE RIGHTS. After survey approval and resolution of any appeals, remaining identified Federal lands will be competitively sold at fair market value.

The Act defines key terms such as \"affected area\" as lands along the Red River, \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of the Interior, \"South Bank\" as the elevation along the Red River, and \"South Bank boundary line\" as the boundary between Texas and Oklahoma. The Act defines terms related to the boundary between Texas and Oklahoma along the Red River, including the South Bank boundary line and the gradient boundary survey method established by the United States Supreme Court.
