    "content": "The Act titled \"Made in America Manufacturing Communities Act of 2016\" establishes a program to designate and support manufacturing communities. The Act establishes a program to improve US manufacturing competitiveness by designating and supporting manufacturing communities. The Act establishes a program to improve US manufacturing competitiveness by designating and supporting manufacturing communities. In cases where a member of a designated manufacturing community seeks financial or technical assistance from participating agencies like the Department of Agriculture, Commerce, or Defense, preferential consideration may be given if it aligns with the consortium's economic development strategy and meets all requirements. The program aims to enhance US manufacturing competitiveness by providing financial and technical assistance to designated manufacturing communities through various participating agencies such as the Department of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Housing, Labor, Transportation, Appalachian Regional Commission, Delta Regional Authority, Environmental Protection Agency, National Science Foundation, and Small Business Administration. Each participating agency must identify relevant programs to support this initiative. The participating agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency, National Science Foundation, and Small Business Administration, must identify applicable programs for the manufacturing competitiveness initiative. If multiple members of the same consortium apply for financial or technical assistance, the participating agency will handle the applications. The participating agency may determine preference for financial or technical assistance among members of the same consortium designated as a manufacturing community. Coordination may be required if multiple members are eligible for preference. The agency may require coordination among consortium members eligible for preference in accessing financial or technical assistance. A report on preferential consideration must be submitted within 90 days. Designated manufacturing communities may receive a Federal point of contact for accessing funds and assistance. The program provides financial and technical assistance to manufacturing communities designated under subsection (d) to improve competitiveness in US manufacturing. Recipients can use the assistance for investments in ecosystems. The program offers financial and technical assistance to designated manufacturing communities to enhance US manufacturing competitiveness. Recipients can use the assistance for investments in infrastructure, access to capital, promotion of exports, equipment upgrades, workforce training, energy efficiency, business incubators, site preparation, and advanced research. The Secretary of Commerce coordinates with participating agencies to identify programs for workforce training, energy efficiency, business incubators, site preparation, and advanced research. Participating agencies also coordinate to leverage complementary activities and avoid duplication of efforts. The Secretary designates eligible consortiums as manufacturing communities through a competitive process. An eligible consortium includes institutions of higher education, private sector entities, and government entities representing a defined region. The eligible consortium for manufacturing communities must include institutions of higher education, private sector entities, and government entities, along with potential partners like economic development groups, financial institutions, and utilities. The lead applicant must be a district organization. The lead applicant for the eligible consortium must be a district organization, Indian tribe, State or political subdivision, or institution of higher education. The eligible consortium must be a special purpose unit of a State or local government, an institution of higher education, or a public or private nonprofit organization acting in cooperation with officials of a political subdivision. The consortium can define the region it represents, which should be large enough to contain critical elements of key technologies or supply. The consortium, subject to approval by the Secretary, can define its represented region to contain key technologies, enabling close collaboration. Each designation lasts for 2 years and can be renewed upon application. The Secretary may renew a designation for a consortium for 2 years upon application, allowing for modifications in composition or plan revisions. The Secretary evaluates eligible consortiums for renewal based on performance against previous designations and project-specific metrics proposed in their application. The eligible consortium's application for designation under paragraph (1) must include project-specific metrics, potential changes to consortium composition, plan revisions to improve US manufacturing competitiveness, and any other criteria deemed appropriate by the Secretary. An eligible consortium seeking designation must submit an application to the Secretary with details on regional boundaries, manufacturing concentration, and national competitiveness metrics. The consortium must provide an assessment of its manufacturing concentration and national competitiveness, as well as an integrated assessment of the local industrial ecosystem. Additionally, they need to present an evidence-based plan for developing components of the ecosystem. The consortium must provide an evidence-based plan for developing components of the manufacturing ecosystem, including specific investments to address gaps and make the region uniquely competitive. They should describe the proposed investments, implementation strategy, outcome-based metrics, and evaluation methods. The consortium must outline outcome-based metrics, benchmarks, and milestones to track their strategy for improving manufacturing in the region. The Secretary will evaluate applications based on regional cooperation levels and national manufacturing competitiveness. The Secretary evaluates applications based on regional cooperation and national manufacturing competitiveness. Previously recognized manufacturing communities are deemed designated under this subsection. The Secretary can accept transferred funds from other participating agencies."
