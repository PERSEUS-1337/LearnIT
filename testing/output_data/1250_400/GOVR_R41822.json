    "content": "The 112th Congress is considering legislative proposals to limit the government's risk from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government-sponsored enterprises responsible for nearly half of the nation's residential mortgage debt. In 2008, their capital proved inadequate during the financial crisis, leading to government intervention to support the mortgage markets. The U.S. Department of the Treasury has purchased over $175 billion of special preferred stock to support Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac during the financial crisis of 2008-2009. Treasury and the Federal Reserve have also provided mortgage market support by purchasing nearly $1.4 trillion in MBS. Some proposed legislation may increase the enterprises' cost of doing business, potentially leading to higher interest rates for mortgages. Proposed legislation aims to reduce enterprises' advantages by increasing costs, imposing new limitations on mortgages, enhancing regulatory oversight, and setting new capital requirements. This could lead to higher interest rates for mortgages and increased competition in the market. Increased capital requirements would raise costs but reduce risks. New SEC filing requirements would remove competitive advantage and align rules with competitors. Legislative proposals aim to return enterprises to stockholder control or dissolve them. Other proposals suggest replacing enterprises in secondary mortgage markets. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac entered conservatorship in 2008 due to financial difficulties from mortgage delinquencies and inadequate capital. In 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac entered conservatorship due to financial difficulties from mortgage delinquencies and inadequate capital. They are now under the management of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) and receive financial support from the Treasury. Homeowners indirectly rely on them for mortgage money as they purchase mortgages from lenders and package them into Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS). Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac back almost half of home mortgages. The Obama Administration's report presents three alternatives for the future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac: a privatized system with government mortgage programs targeted based on income or first-time homebuyer status, a privatized system with a government guarantee only during a crisis, and a privatized system with backup government reinsurance of private mortgage insurance. No legislation has been introduced to implement these proposals yet. No legislation has been introduced yet to implement the Obama Administration's proposals for the future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which include a privatized system with backup government reinsurance of private mortgage insurance. Legislation introduced in the 112th Congress addresses various areas of concern, such as executive compensation. H.R. 31, the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Accountability and Transparency for Taxpayers Act of 2011, would require quarterly reports on specific areas related to the enterprises' operations. H.R. 31, the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Accountability and Transparency for Taxpayers Act of 2011, requires the FHFA director to make quarterly reports on 12 specific areas related to the enterprises' operations, including executive compensation, foreclosure mitigation efforts, mortgage fraud prevention, and underwriting standards. Additional information can be included at the director's discretion. The FHFA director is required to make quarterly reports on various aspects of the enterprises' operations, including executive compensation, foreclosure mitigation efforts, mortgage fraud prevention, and underwriting standards. The reports must be reviewed by the FHFA inspector general and posted on the FHFA website. Additionally, the IG will examine FHFA's loss mitigation policies, including the impact of principal reduction on the enterprises' financial condition and nationwide foreclosure rate. There is some overlap with current reporting requirements, such as the FHFA's quarterly Report on the Enterprises' Financial Performance and monthly Foreclosure Prevention and Refinance Report. The FHFA's quarterly Report on the Enterprises' Financial Performance covers capital, investments, and loss mitigation activities. The FHFA's monthly Foreclosure Prevention and Refinance Report also covers loss mitigation efforts. H.R. 463, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Transparency Act of 2011, would make the enterprises subject to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. H.R. 1221, Equity in Government Compensation Act of 2011, would limit the pay of the enterprises' employees. H.R. 1221, Equity in Government Compensation Act of 2011, aims to limit the pay of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac employees. Executive compensation packages would be suspended, and employees would be paid according to the federal government's general schedule. The bill also includes provisions on executive compensation and corporate governance, but states that enterprise employees shall not be considered federal employees. The bill aims to limit the pay of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac employees, suspending executive compensation packages and aligning employee pay with the federal government's general schedule. It includes provisions on executive compensation and corporate governance, stating that enterprise employees shall not be considered federal employees. The bill would remove FHFA's discretion in rejecting enterprise salaries and require the enterprises to charge a guarantee fee reflecting mortgage risk and capital costs. The FHFA would have the option to phase in higher fees over two years or impose them at a higher level two years after enactment. H.R. 1222 was marked up by the House Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government-Sponsored Enterprises and forwarded to the full committee. H.R. 1223, GSE Credit Risk Equitable Treatment Act of 2011, would prohibit treating mortgage-backed securities issued by enterprises differently from similar MBS issued by other companies. Regulatory determinations on \"qualified residential mortgages\" would not be solely based on the enterprises' role. The bill H.R. 1223 aims to prevent regulatory determinations on \"qualified residential mortgages\" from being solely based on the enterprises' role in securitization. Dodd-Frank requires joint regulations to implement risk retention requirements for mortgages in MBS, with QRMs being exempt. Federal Reserve's general counsel testified that enterprises are not exempt from risk retention, as their guarantee is unfunded. Financial Services marked up H.R. 1223 and forwarded it to the full committee. The Federal Reserve's general counsel testified that Dodd-Frank does not exempt the enterprises from the risk retention requirement, and their guarantees may not satisfy the proposed rules. H.R. 1224, GSE Portfolio Risk Reduction Act of 2011, would require the enterprises to reduce their portfolios to $250 billion each over five years. Fannie Mae's portfolio was $789 billion and Freddie Mac's was $697 billion at the end of 2010. Treasury-GSE financial support agreements mandate portfolio reductions to reach $250 billion by 2022. Companion bills H.R. 1182 and S. 693 also aim to reduce the enterprises' portfolios. The financial support agreements between Treasury and the GSEs require the GSEs to reduce their mortgage portfolios to stay within a cap that decreases annually, reaching $250 billion in 2022. Companion bills H.R. 1224, H.R. 1182, S. 693, H.R. 408, and S. 178 propose different schedules for reducing the enterprises' portfolios. H.R. 1224 excludes delinquent mortgages from the portfolio limits. FHFA could order the enterprises to reduce their portfolios more rapidly. H.R. 1225 would require the enterprises to seek permission for debt issuance. The Committee on Financial Services marked up H.R. 1224 and H.R. 1225. H.R. 1224 allows FHFA to order enterprises to reduce risk by reducing portfolios faster. H.R. 1225 requires enterprises to seek permission from the Treasury for debt issuance. Treasury would announce its decision in writing after a seven-day waiting period. Formerly, the Secretary of the Treasury had authority over debt issuance. The Secretary of the Treasury had authority over debt issuance for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the past, but this practice fell into disuse. H.R. 1226 would repeal affordable housing goals and duties to serve underserved markets for the enterprises. FHFA would need to submit a report to Congress within six months. The Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992, amended by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, would repeal the duty to serve underserved markets and funding for housing trust fund and capital magnet fund. FHFA must submit a report to Congress on the bill's impact on multifamily properties, loans to low-income borrowers, and loans to borrowers in rural areas. H.R. 1227, GSE Risk and Activities Limitation Act of 2011, would restrict FHFA from approving new products while an enterprise is in conservatorship or receivership unless necessary to preserve assets or reduce losses. H.R. 1227, GSE Risk and Activities Limitation Act of 2011, would prohibit FHFA from approving new products while an enterprise is in conservatorship or receivership unless necessary to preserve assets or reduce losses. H.R. 2425, Transparency and Security in Mortgage Registration Act of 2011, would prohibit Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae from purchasing or securitizing a mortgage registered with MERS, a system bypassing state laws for mortgage registration. H.R. 2428, GSE Legal Fee Reduction Act of 2011, aims to regulate legal expenses for employees of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae. H.R. 2436, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Taxpayer Payback Act of 2011, prevents a reduction in dividend rates paid to Treasury. H.R. 2439 focuses on removing certain provisions related to the enterprises. Under HERA, FHFA can repudiate contracts, including employment contracts. H.R. 2436 prevents reduction in dividend rates paid to Treasury. H.R. 2439 empowers FHFA to revoke an enterprise's charter. H.R. 2441 terminates the Housing Trust Fund, Capital Magnet Fund, and Hope Reserve Fund. H.R. 2440 directs FHFA to identify non-mission critical assets. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 established the Capital Magnet Fund, funded by enterprises. $80 million was appropriated in FY2010. H.R. 2440 would direct FHFA to identify non-mission critical assets held by enterprises, such as patents and mortgage data. H.R. 2462 would set the maximum amount of support Treasury can provide to each enterprise. Initially, the limit was $100 billion. The Preferred Stock Purchase Agreements (PSPA) provide financial support to enterprises, with the possibility of additional support if needed. Treasury has contracted to purchase preferred stock with limits initially set at $100 billion per GSE, later raised to $200 billion each. Amendments in late 2009 allowed for unlimited support in 2010-2012, reverting to $200 billion limits thereafter. Various companion bills in Congress propose different provisions for the enterprises, with some aiming to replace them. Title VI of H.R. 408 and S. 178, known as the Spending Reduction Act of 2011, aim to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by terminating their conservatorships in 24 months. The enterprises would then either go into receivership or continue under revised charters, with changes including reducing their portfolios to $250 billion each over four years. H.R. 1224 provides for a five-year timeline for these changes. At the end of the conservatorship, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would either go into receivership or continue under revised charters. Changes include reducing portfolios to $250 billion each over four years. Housing goals would no longer apply, and certain provisions from other bills are not included. After leaving conservatorship, there would be a 10-year wind-down period before dissolution, with provisions for financial obligations. After leaving conservatorship, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would face dissolution after a 10-year wind-down period, with provisions for financial obligations such as debts and MBS. FHFA would have strengthened authority to enforce minimum capital levels. The conforming loan limit would be set at $417,000 nationwide with no high-cost exceptions, and the enterprises would be prohibited from purchasing mortgages greater than the area median home price. Minimum downpayment for mortgages purchased by the enterprises would be 5% initially, increasing to 10% afterward. The enterprises, after leaving conservatorship, would have restrictions on purchasing mortgages above the area median home price and would require minimum downpayments of 5% initially, increasing to 10%. They would also need to pay all state and local taxes, register stocks with the SEC, and be charged for government benefits. Companion bills H.R. 1182 and S. 693 include similar provisions with additional guarantee fee increases. The companion bills H.R. 1182 and S. 693 contain provisions to increase guarantee fees, reduce enterprise portfolios, repeal affordable housing goals, end conservatorship in 24 months, phase out charters for new business, repeal SEC registration exemption, and lower conforming limits. The Housing Finance Reform Act of 2011 proposes to end the enterprises' conservatorship in 24 months, phase out their charters for new business, repeal SEC registration exemption, lower conforming loan limits, increase minimum capital requirements, raise borrower downpayment requirements, and require payment of all state and local taxes. Additionally, the bill would authorize the chartering of housing finance guaranty associations to pool and securitize mortgages. The Housing Finance Reform Act of 2011 proposes to authorize FHFA to charter housing finance guaranty associations to pool and securitize mortgages. These associations would guarantee timely payments to investors with a backup guarantee from the federal government. They would be restricted to purchasing and securitizing existing mortgages, specializing in specific markets like community banks and multifamily mortgages. The maximum mortgage size would be based on national and area median prices, with limits ranging from $256,000 to $897,300. Single-family mortgages could only be purchased with a loan-to-value ratio of 80% or less. The Housing Finance Reform Act of 2011 proposes to authorize FHFA to charter housing finance guaranty associations to pool and securitize mortgages. The nationwide mortgage limit would be $256,000, with the highest area limits in Honolulu at $897,300 and San Jose at $886,500. Mortgages on single-family dwelling units could be purchased with a loan-to-value ratio of 80% or less. H.R. 2413 would create a federal corporation to purchase and securitize mortgages meeting certain underwriting standards. H.R. 2413 proposes the creation of a federal corporation to purchase and securitize mortgages meeting specific underwriting standards. The corporation would charge guarantee and reinsurance fees, adjusting them to maintain a market share below 50%. These fees aim to cover mortgage payments during normal times and compensate the Treasury for a federal guarantee. Eligible mortgages would be for 30 years or less, up to 80% of the house's sales price (or 90% with private mortgage insurance), with size limits based on various factors. The proposed federal corporation would oversee the purchase of mortgages meeting specific underwriting standards, with size limits based on factors like the house's sales price. Mortgages eligible for purchase would be for 30 years or less, up to 80% of the sales price (or 90% with private mortgage insurance), with a maximum size based on a formula used in FY2011."
