The highest official in the relevant taxing authority can reverse the injunction only with clear evidence, and officers cannot be penalized unless issuing unreasonable injunctions. This section does not limit legal remedies in court. The revenue from taxes imposed by this subtitle is allocated to states based on the destination of taxable property or services. A Federal Office of Revenue Allocation is established to resolve disputes among states regarding revenue allocation. The destination of tangible personal property is determined by the state where it was first delivered to the purchaser. The destination of taxable property or services for revenue allocation is based on the state or territory where the property was delivered to the purchaser. Tangible personal property, real property, and other property have specific destination rules, while services are allocated based on where they are used, consumed, or enjoyed. Telecommunications services are allocated based on the purchaser's residence. Allocation of service invoices is based on the state or territory where services are used, consumed, or enjoyed. Telecommunications services are allocated based on the purchaser's residence, while transportation services are allocated based on the final destination of the trip. International transportation services are deemed 50 percent attributable to the United States destination or origin. The destination of financial intermediation services is the residence of the purchase. A State Tax Administrator has jurisdiction over gross payments with a destination within their state. Rents and royalties for tangible property are allocated based on where the property is located. Rent and lease payments for vehicles are allocated based on specific criteria. The destination of rents and royalties for the lease of tangible property is determined by the property's location. For vehicles, rent and lease payments are allocated based on where the vehicle was delivered for short-term leases and the lessee's residence for long-term leases. SEC. 54 states that taxes should be stated and charged separately. For each purchase of taxable property or services subject to tax, the vendor must separately charge the sales tax and provide a receipt to the purchaser with specific details. However, sales made through vending machines are exempt from these requirements. The vendor registration number and name are required for each purchase subject to tax. Vending machines are exempt from these requirements if they dispense taxable property for coins or bills up to twenty dollars and sell items under ten dollars each. SEC. 55 allows for installment agreements and compromises for tax liabilities, while SEC. 56 outlines the use of the cash method for tax remittance and reporting, with an option to elect the accrual method for a calendar year. SEC. 57 states that the exemption for taxable property or services used by a trade or business is not available if the business is not operated for profit. If the business has received gross payments exceeding certain expenses in 2 of the last 4 years, it is deemed to be engaged in for profit. The Internal Revenue Service is not authorized to use appropriations for certain expenses, including processing income tax returns for years prior to the repeal of the income tax. New subsections are added to Section 7801 for the Excise Tax Bureau and Sales Tax Bureau within the Department of Treasury. The Sales Tax Bureau administers the national sales tax in required states and other federal duties.

The Secretary of the Treasury can appoint up to 5 Assistant General Counsels without following civil service laws. Modifications to federal income tax for taxable years ending June 30, 1999, include reducing dollar figures for calendar year taxpayers by half and adjusting figures for fiscal year taxpayers based on the number of months in their taxable year. For fiscal year taxpayers, the dollar figures in section 1 and section 11 are adjusted based on the number of months in the taxpayer's taxable year ending June 30, 1999. The Secretary is required to publish tax rate schedules accordingly. Starting January 1, 1999, the Social Security Administration will collect payroll taxes under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Section 7 of the Act addresses self-employment tax rules. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to define 'self-employment income' as gross payments received in a calendar year from the sale of taxable property or services, minus certain deductions. Transition amounts for the years starting in 1999 are calculated based on unrecovered basis amounts related to prior law section 167 property. The unrecovered basis amount for calendar years starting in 1999 is calculated by dividing the basis amount as of December 31, 1998 by ten. This amount pertains to prior law section 167 property and inventory held at the end of 1998. Conforming amendments are made to subsections 1402(b) and 1402(c), with renumbering of subsections 1402(d) et seq. to 1402(b) et seq. Social Security benefits will be indexed on a sales tax inclusive basis. The amendment to the Social Security Act now includes the calculation of the CPI increase percentage for cost-of-living adjustments, taking into account the Consumer Price Index and national sales tax.

An eligible person is someone receiving Social Security benefits and qualified fixed income payments. Qualified fixed income payments include defined benefit plan payments and annuity contract payments. The qualified fixed income payment amount is \\1/12\\ of payments that an eligible person is entitled to receive during the calendar year. Payments must not vary with investment performance, interest rates, or inflation. Defined benefit plan payments and annuity contract payments are included as qualified fixed income payments. The qualified fixed income payment amount is \\1/12\\ of eligible payments, not exceeding $5,000, and must not be affected by investment performance or inflation. To receive compensating payments, eligible individuals must submit an application as prescribed. The Office of Management and Budget baseline for Fiscal Year 1999 will determine compensating payments. Eligible individuals must apply as prescribed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Compensating payments will be received with Social Security benefits and funded from the general fund. Insurers and defined benefit plan sponsors may be required to issue statements for determining qualified fixed income payment amounts. SEC. 10. INTEREST.
