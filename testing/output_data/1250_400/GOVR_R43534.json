    "content": "In 1978, Congress enacted the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to address electronic surveillance abuses. FISA established the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to review government applications for surveillance. Recent revelations have sparked proposals to amend FISA and the practices of the FISC, focusing on the selection process for FISA court judges. Federal judges in Article III courts have life tenure and preside over cases with dispositive judgments. The U.S. Constitution vests judicial power in the Supreme Court and inferior courts established by Congress, ensuring independence from political interference. FISA created the FISC, an Article III court for foreign intelligence investigations, with the power to approve surveillance orders. The FISA Court of Review can review FISC denials. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) allows the FISC to approve electronic surveillance, physical searches, pen register/trap and trace device use, and access to business records. The FISA Court of Review can review FISC denials. The selection of judges for these courts has been criticized for being too partisan and controlled by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Several bills in the 113th Congress aim to change the process of selecting FISA judges, including proposals to transfer selection authority to chief judges of circuit courts or allow the President or congressional leadership to choose FISA judges. The judicial branch has expressed concern with shifting selection away from the Chief Justice. The report discusses proposals in the 113th Congress to change the process of selecting FISA judges, including transferring selection authority to chief judges of circuit courts or allowing the President or congressional leadership to choose FISA judges. The judicial branch has expressed concern with shifting selection away from the Chief Justice, raising questions about the constitutionality of such proposals. The Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution dictates the appointment process for government officials, including Judges of the supreme Court. The Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution dictates the appointment process for government officials, including Judges of the supreme Court. Principal officers, such as judges, must be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. The Supreme Court has indicated that all Article III circuit and district judges are principal officers. If Congress expands the duties of an office, a second appointment may not be necessary if the additional duties are related to the original government post. The Supreme Court has ruled that a second appointment may not be required for an incumbent if the additional duties are related to their original government post. This principle of \"germaneness\" allows for the designation of federal judges to serve in separate positions without violating the Appointments Clause. Congress has long used designations for Article III courts, and the Chief Justice has been given authority in this process. Congress has a history of allowing federal judges to serve in separate positions through designations, including the Chief Justice's authority to assign judges to other federal courts. The Commerce Court, created with Chief Justice-based designations, set a precedent for specialized courts like the FISA courts. Lower federal court judges also have designation authority. The Supreme Court has reviewed and upheld the constitutionality of these designations. The Commerce Court's Chief Justice-based designation process set a model for specialized courts like the FISA courts. Congress has granted lower federal court judges designation authority. The Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of these designations, as seen in cases like McDowell v. United States and Lamar v. United States. The designation process for lower federal court judges, including FISA judges, has been upheld as constitutional by the Supreme Court in cases like McDowell v. United States and Lamar v. United States. The courts have rejected challenges to the Chief Justice's authority to designate judges, citing that it does not violate the Appointments Clause. The Ninth Circuit rejected an argument that the FISC violates the Appointments Clause as judges are designated by the Chief Justice, not appointed by the President with Senate confirmation. The court cited precedent for temporary assignment of judges and noted that FISA judges are not distinguishable from other federal judges. The central issue is whether designation by certain individuals within different branches of government would be constitutionally permissible. The FISA Judge Selection Reform Act would maintain designation authority within the judicial branch but disperse the selection process for the FISC among the 13 chief judges. The FISA Judge Selection Reform Act (S. 1460) proposes increasing the number of FISC judges from 11 to 13, with one designated from each judicial circuit. The Chief Justice would designate the district court judge proposed by the chief judge of the circuit, with involvement from associate justices of the Supreme Court. S. 1460 proposes increasing FISC judges to 13, with one from each circuit. The Chief Justice designates the judge proposed by the circuit's chief judge, with input from Supreme Court justices. The Chief Justice retains final authority in the designation process. Limited judicial precedent suggests Congress can authorize others to designate FISA judges. The McDowell Court declared that Congress has the power to temporarily assign District Judges to serve in other districts. While there is no specific restriction on a District Judge's territorial authority, modern statutes limit a chief judge's designation power. Some proposals suggest giving the President the authority to designate FISA court judges. The McDowell Court affirmed Congress's power to assign District Judges to other districts, but limits exist on chief judges' designation authority. Proposals include granting the President the power to designate FISA court judges, potentially raising concerns about the courts' status as Article III courts due to the appointment terms. The appointment of FISA court judges for fixed terms may not affect their overall Article III status, as seen in precedent regarding judges serving on special panels. However, giving the President sole authority to select FISA court judges could raise separation-of-powers concerns. The proposal to give the President sole authority to select FISA court judges could raise separation-of-powers concerns, as it may encroach upon the judiciary's independence. However, precedent from Mistretta v. United States shows that the President can appoint judges to certain commissions without affecting their judicial duties. If a federal judge is removed from the FISA courts, they would still serve as an Article III judge on their original court. The President's authority to select FISA court judges may raise separation-of-powers concerns, as it could influence judges' impartiality. Proposals suggest giving designation authority to congressional leadership to address these concerns. Proposals to vest designation authority with congressional leadership, such as the FISA Court Accountability Act (H.R. 2586), may raise constitutional concerns under the Appointments Clause and separation-of-powers principles. Congressional designations to the judiciary without bicameralism and presentment requirements could be legally problematic. The legislative acts must meet bicameralism and presentment requirements of the Constitution when altering legal rights. Congressional designations to the judiciary without proper approval may violate constitutional principles."
