The Congress recognizes the risks law enforcement officers face daily, the shift in problems they encounter without increased federal support, their crucial role in combating drugs and crime, the rise in violent crime and drug use, the need for a review of current issues affecting law enforcement, and the importance of studying the role of the Federal Government in supporting law enforcement. A review twenty-five years later would help evaluate current problems affecting law enforcement, including drug-related crime, violence, racial conflict, and decreased funding. Additionally, a comprehensive study of law enforcement issues, such as the role of the Federal Government in supporting officers, working conditions, and responsibility for crime control, would assist in redefining relationships between the Federal Government, the public, and law enforcement officials. A national commission called the \"National Commission to Support Law Enforcement\" is established. The Commission's duties are outlined. The Commission will study and recommend changes regarding law enforcement agencies at all levels, including funding, employment conditions, information-sharing systems, research and training, equipment and resources, cooperation among agencies, government and agency responsibility in solving crime, and the impact of the criminal justice system.
