    "content": "Some Members of Congress have long been interested in the rules governing patentable subject matter. The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act of 2011 placed restrictions on patents involving human organisms and tax avoidance strategies. Courts and the USPTO have historically interpreted Section 101 broadly, but exceptions exist for laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas. In recent years, there has been a shift in how Section 101 is used to invalidate patents or reject applications. The Supreme Court's decisions since 2010 have increased the use of Section 101 to invalidate patents and reject applications at the USPTO. This has led to concerns about the clarity of legal standards in the U.S. patent system. The recent prominence of Section 101 in the U.S. patent system has sparked debate, with some calling it a \"state of crisis\" due to confusing legal standards established by the Supreme Court. The former Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit criticized the Supreme Court decisions for creating chaos and departing from sensible patent policy. However, others believe these decisions may lead to patents of appropriate scope, reduce abusive patent litigation, and encourage higher quality patents. This report reviews current patent law and proposals for reform, including an overview of patentable subject matter and key Supreme Court decisions on Section 101 of the Patent Act. This report examines current patent law and proposals for reform, focusing on patentable subject matter and Supreme Court decisions on Section 101 of the Patent Act. It discusses the patent acquisition process and the role of USPTO examiners in assessing patent applications. The patent acquisition process, known as \"prosecution,\" involves drafting a detailed description of the invention and at least one claim that distinctly points out the subject matter. Examiners assess whether the invention meets patentability criteria such as novelty, nonobviousness, and utility. Novelty requires that the invention is not fully anticipated by prior patents or publications, while nonobviousness mandates that it is not readily achievable by a skilled artisan based on prior knowledge. Additionally, the invention must be useful and provide a tangible benefit to be considered for a patent. An invention must be novel, nonobvious, and useful to be patentable. Section 101 of the Patent Act defines patentable subject matter as any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter. Process patents claim a series of steps to achieve a specific result, often related to methods of manufacture or use. Process patents claim a series of steps to achieve a specific result, often related to methods of manufacture or use. The term \"machine\" includes every mechanical device to perform a function, while \"manufacture\" refers to producing articles from raw materials, and \"composition of matter\" includes all compositions of substances. Courts and the USPTO have set limits on patentable subject matter. The term \"composition of matter\" encompasses all compositions of substances, whether gases, fluids, powders, or solids. Courts and the USPTO have established limits on patentable subject matter, excluding laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas. If a patent application meets the requirements, it will be granted, giving the patent holder the right to exclude others. The USPTO grants patents to inventors who meet the requirements, allowing them exclusivity for twenty years. Patent holders can monitor competitors and enforce their rights through litigation. Patent owners must monitor competitors and may need to litigate in federal courts to enforce their intellectual property rights. The Federal Circuit handles most patent appeals, with the Supreme Court having discretionary review authority. Recent Supreme Court decisions have addressed the law of patentable subject matter, including cases like Diamond v. Chakrabarty and Diamond v. Diehr, which set precedents for patenting genetically engineered microorganisms and processes involving computer algorithms. In Diamond v. Chakrabarty, a genetically engineered microorganism could be patented. Similarly, in Diamond v. Diehr, a process for curing artificial rubber using a computer and a mathematical formula was deemed patentable. These decisions broadened the range of patentable subject matter for information technologies and life sciences. The Supreme Court's series of decisions from 2010 to 2014 narrowed patent eligibility, impacting the patent system significantly. The 2010 decision in Bilski v. Kappos involved the patentability of a method for hedging risk in commodities trading. In its 2010 decision Bilski v. Kappos, the Supreme Court considered the patentability of a method for managing consumption risk costs in commodities trading. The patent application claimed a series of transactions to balance risk positions between consumers and market participants. The USPTO rejected the application as claiming subject matter that... The USPTO rejected Bilski's patent application for a method to manage consumption risk costs in commodities trading, citing it as ineligible for patenting under Section 101. The Federal Circuit determined that the claimed process did not satisfy the requirements for patent eligibility as it was not tied to a specific machine or apparatus. The Federal Circuit concluded that Bilski's patent application did not claim patentable subject matter as it was not tied to a specific machine or apparatus and did not achieve a physical transformation. The USPTO's decision to deny Bilski's application was affirmed by the Federal Circuit. The Supreme Court issued three opinions on the case, with Justice Kennedy's opinion agreeing that Bilski's invention could not be patented. The Supreme Court issued three opinions on the case of Bilski's patent application. Justice Kennedy's opinion, joined by a plurality, rejected the machine or transformation test as the sole standard for patentable processes. Instead, the Court ruled based on the traditional rule that abstract ideas are not patentable. Justice Stevens issued a concurring opinion on his retirement day, agreeing with the decision. Justice Stevens, along with Justices Breyer, Ginsburg, and Sotomayor, concurred that allowing patenting of risk hedging would grant a monopoly over abstract ideas. They agreed that the machine-or-transformation test is reliable but not the exclusive standard. Justice Breyer highlighted four key points of agreement among all nine justices regarding patentable subject matter limitations. The Supreme Court's decision in Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc. shifted focus to the life sciences, specifically regarding patents for methods of determining optimal dosages of thiopurine drugs. The patents claimed methods of administering the drug to a patient, measuring metabolite levels in red blood cells, and adjusting drug levels based on the results to reduce toxicity. The machine-or-transformation test is not the sole standard for assessing patentability of processes. The patents claimed methods of administering a drug providing 6-thioguanine to a patient, measuring metabolite levels in red blood cells, and adjusting drug levels based on the results to optimize therapeutic efficacy for immune-mediated gastrointestinal disorders. If metabolite levels are outside the known range, the physician should adjust the drug dosage accordingly. The Supreme Court concluded that the claims related to adjusting drug levels based on metabolite levels in red blood cells for gastrointestinal disorders were unpatentable as they were directed towards natural laws. The Court emphasized that patenting natural laws could impede innovation and that processes applying natural laws in a useful way could be patented. The Supreme Court found that the claims involving adjusting drug levels based on metabolite levels for gastrointestinal disorders were unpatentable as they were based on natural laws. The Court emphasized that while inventions may embody natural laws, processes must apply them in a useful way to be eligible for patents. The Court determined that the additional steps in the claims did not add enough to qualify as patent-eligible processes. The Supreme Court ruled that the additional steps in the claims did not make the inventions patentable, as they merely applied natural laws in routine ways. Justice Breyer explained that advising physicians to use natural laws did not make the inventions patentable. The Supreme Court in Mayo v. Prometheus ruled that advising physicians to use natural laws did not make the inventions patentable. The Court concluded that the three steps in the claim did not transform unpatentable natural correlations into patentable applications. Justice Breyer argued that the patents did not satisfy the machine-or-transformation test as they only required measuring metabolite levels, not transforming human blood or the body. The Supreme Court in Mayo v. Prometheus ruled that advising physicians to use natural laws did not make the inventions patentable. Justice Breyer argued that the patents did not transform human blood or the body, only required measuring metabolite levels. The Court also addressed concerns that rejecting the patents would discourage diagnostic research. In a June 2013 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that genomic DNA was ineligible for patenting under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7101 due to the \"product of nature\" doctrine. Preexisting substances found in the wild may not be patented, but significant artificial changes can make them patentable. The Supreme Court ruled that genomic DNA was ineligible for patenting under the \"product of nature\" doctrine. While products of nature may not be patented, significant artificial changes can make them patentable. Some experts believed that isolating genes for patents misconstrued this principle. The Supreme Court decision in Myriad reflected that isolating genes for patents was considered a \"technicality\" that did not allow genes to be patented. The litigation began in 2009 when plaintiffs challenged Myriad's patents on the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes associated with breast and ovarian cancers. The U.S. District Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, stating that human genes are naturally occurring and not patentable subject matter. The U.S. District Court ruled that Myriad's gene patent claims on BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were invalid as they were not markedly different from native DNA. The Federal Circuit later reversed this decision, stating that isolated DNA is chemically manipulated and therefore patentable. The Supreme Court vacated the judgment and remanded the case back to the Federal Circuit for reconsideration. The Supreme Court vacated the judgment on Myriad's gene patent claims and remanded the case back to the Federal Circuit for reconsideration. Justice Thomas stated that Myriad did not create anything by isolating the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, and the claims were not expressed in terms of chemical composition. The Supreme Court found that Myriad's claims on isolated DNA were not patentable as they did not involve invention. However, the Court did view claims on complementary DNA (cDNA) more favorably, as cDNA is synthetic and distinct from naturally-occurring DNA. The Court clarified that the case did not involve innovative gene manipulation methods or new gene applications. The Supreme Court ruled that isolated DNA could not be patented as it was not considered an invention, but complementary DNA (cDNA) could be patented as it is synthetic. Justice Thomas emphasized that genes and the information they encode are not patent eligible simply because they have been isolated. Justice Scalia concurred with the judgment but did not agree with the molecular biology details. He noted that isolated genomic DNA is identical to its natural state, while cDNA can be patented. In a recent Section 101 decision, the Supreme Court considered the patentability of a computer-implemented financial exchange system in Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International. The patents in question involved a method for exchanging financial obligations, a computer system to carry out the methods, and a computer-readable medium containing program code. The district court found the inventions unpatentable. The Supreme Court addressed the patentability of a computer-implemented financial exchange system in Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International. The patents involved a method for exchanging financial obligations, a computer system, and a computer-readable medium. The district court deemed the inventions unpatentable as they were considered abstract ideas. The Federal Circuit's ruling was upheld by the Supreme Court, stating that the patents were directed to a patent-ineligible abstract idea. The Supreme Court upheld the Federal Circuit's decision that patents were directed to a patent-ineligible abstract idea. Justice Thomas explained the two-part test for identifying such patents, focusing on whether the claim recites additional elements that transform it into a patent-eligible application. The Court applied this framework to method claims, determining they were drawn to the abstract idea of intermediated settlement. The Supreme Court, following a two-step test, found that the method claims in question were directed towards the abstract idea of intermediated settlement. Justice Thomas emphasized that simply implementing an abstract idea on a computer does not make it patent-eligible, as it would allow any abstract principle to become patentable by incorporating computer hardware. The Court rejected the claims related to computer systems and computer-readable media for the same reason. The Supreme Court rejected patent claims related to computer systems and computer-readable media, as they were deemed to recite only generic computer hardware without meaningful restrictions. The Court emphasized that simply implementing an abstract idea on a computer does not make it patent-eligible, as it would allow any abstract principle to become patentable by incorporating computer hardware. The current law of the land, as established in Supreme Court decisions like Bilski, Mayo v. Prometheus, Myriad, and Alice, requires a two-part test to determine patent eligibility based on whether the claim recites a law of nature, natural phenomenon, or abstract idea, and if so, whether it includes additional inventive elements. The key themes from the opinions include a two-part test for patent eligibility based on whether the claim recites a law of nature, natural phenomenon, or abstract idea, and if it includes additional inventive elements. The courts analyze if a claim preempts a field of activity and do not consider routine hardware to affect eligibility. The machine-or-transformation test is a useful guidepost, and Section 101 determinations can be resolved early in litigation. The machine-or-transformation test is a useful guidepost for patent eligibility, with Section 101 determinations often resolved early in litigation. Statistical analyses show a high probability of invalidating challenged claims, with a 66.5% average invalidation rate. The Federal Circuit upheld 3 patents and invalidated 34 patents, with an average invalidation rate of 91.9%. The USPTO has rejected over 36,000 published patent applications under Alice, leading to approximately two-thirds being invalidated. The Federal Circuit upheld 3 patents and invalidated 34 patents, with an average invalidation rate of 91.9%. Over 36,000 published patent applications have been rejected under Alice, indicating a high success rate for challenging patent claims. Recent Supreme Court interest in patentable subject matter has implications for information technologies and life sciences. Recent Supreme Court interest in patentable subject matter has impacted patent validity in information technologies. The courts have invalidated numerous patents on computer-related inventions that do not describe specific solutions or improvements in technology. Examples include patents for generating menus, analyzing power grid data, and extracting data from hard copy. The invalidated patents include inventions such as generating menus, analyzing power grid data, extracting data from hard copy documents, administering life insurance policies, and processing credit applications over electronic networks. Affinity Labs of Tex. v. DIRECTV, LLC involved a patent claim for a broadcast system allowing out-of-region access to local content via a cellular telephone. The Federal Circuit deemed the concept abstract, as it did not describe how the invention achieved its functions, focusing solely on the idea itself. The Federal Circuit deemed the patent claim for out-of-region broadcasting on a cellular telephone as abstract, as it focused on the idea itself without describing how the invention achieved its functions. The court has upheld patents in other cases that avoided broad functional language and recited specific structures to achieve results. The Supreme Court decisions in Mayo v. Prometheus and Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics have had consequences for the life sciences industry, affecting patentability of diagnostic methods and isolated bodily substances. Fewer judicial opinions have addressed Section 101 in the life sciences compared to information technologies, but the 2015 ruling in Ariosa Diagnostics, Inc. v. Sequenom, Inc. is significant. In the 2015 ruling of Ariosa Diagnostics, Inc. v. Sequenom, Inc., the Federal Circuit addressed the patentability of a non-invasive prenatal diagnostic method involving cell-free fetal DNA in maternal plasma or serum. The method aimed to detect paternally inherited nucleic acid of fetal origin in pregnant females. The Federal Circuit ruled that a method involving detecting cell-free fetal DNA in maternal plasma or serum was not patentable as it was considered a naturally occurring phenomenon. Judge Linn expressed dissatisfaction with the decision, highlighting the importance of the non-invasive technique in prenatal diagnosis. Judge Linn disagreed with the ruling that cffDNA detection was not patentable, emphasizing its significance in non-invasive prenatal diagnosis. He argued that the breakthrough invention should be eligible for patents, suggesting potential legislative changes to patent law. Several industry associations have proposed modifications to Section 101 of the America Invents Act in 2011. The American Intellectual Property Law Association (AIPLA) and the Intellectual Property Owners Association (IPO) have similar proposals to replace the existing language with new criteria for patent eligibility. The American Intellectual Property Law Association (AIPLA) and the Intellectual Property Owners Association (IPO) have proposed modifications to Section 101 of the America Invents Act to establish new criteria for patent eligibility. The proposed changes focus on the eligibility of claimed inventions without considering other patent requirements or conditions. The American Bar Association (ABA) Section of Intellectual Property Law has also offered a related proposal to amend Section 101 for patentability conditions. The proposed modifications to Section 101 of the America Invents Act aim to establish new criteria for patent eligibility, focusing on the eligibility of claimed inventions without considering other patent requirements or conditions. The eligibility of a useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any useful improvement thereof, for a patent is discussed, with exceptions for claims that preempt the use of laws of nature, natural phenomena, or abstract ideas. The AIPLA and ABA Section on Intellectual Property criticize recent Supreme Court decisions for injecting ambiguity into the eligibility determination under Section 101, turning it into a patentability test. The IPO argues that the Court's analysis is contrary to Congressional intent. The IPO and AIPLA criticize recent Supreme Court decisions for injecting ambiguity into the eligibility determination under Section 101, turning it into a patentability test. Some believe legislative reform is necessary to address the restrictive patent eligibility rules, while others argue that it has not affected innovation or investment significantly. Proposed amendments could potentially eliminate constraints on subject matter eligibility and change the current statutory phrase regarding patent entitlement. The AIPLA proposal would eliminate constraints on subject matter eligibility and change the current statutory phrase regarding patent entitlement. This could unintentionally eliminate common law patentability standards. Recent Supreme Court interest in patentable subject matter has sparked debate on the balance between innovation and patent rights. Some experts fear a lack of patent rights may hinder innovation and investment in the US, prompting further inquiry into patentable inventions."
