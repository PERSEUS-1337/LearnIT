The country has a long history of promoting an open and rules-based system that benefits both the U.S. and foreign investors. The Trump Administration has not clearly defined its foreign investment policy, but has expressed openness to foreign investment. In 2016, the U.S. had around $6.4 trillion in inward foreign direct investment, out of a global total of $26.7 trillion. The United States welcomes foreign investment into its economy, with a global inward foreign direct investment position of around $6.4 trillion in 2016. The Commerce Department uses three measures to publish data on U.S. direct investment position: historical cost, current cost, and market value. These measures represent the value of an investment at different points in time. In 2016, foreign direct investment (FDI) in the United States increased by $876 billion at market value and $390 billion at historical cost and current cost. The total cumulative FDI reached $7.4 trillion at market value, $4.0 trillion at current cost, and $3.5 trillion at historical cost. The United Kingdom and Japan are the largest foreign direct investors in the U.S. economy. The drop in FDI in 2014 was due to a $130 billion stock buyback between Verizon and France's Vodafone.

The United States supports and promotes foreign direct investment, but national security concerns have led to new measures restricting foreign investment in various countries. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) reviews foreign investment transactions to determine if they threaten national security or if the foreign investor is controlled by a foreign government. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) reviews foreign investment transactions to assess national security implications, potentially blocking transactions that pose a threat. It is a voluntary process that can lead to future reviews and divestiture if not notified. In a 2016 report to Congress, CFIUS noted that 42% of notified transactions from 2008 to 2014 were in the manufacturing sector, with finance, information, and services sectors accounting for another 31%.

State-owned enterprises' growing international presence raises concerns over economic and security implications. The growing international presence of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) is raising concerns over economic and security implications. An estimated 22% of the world's largest 100 firms are effectively under state control. Policymakers worry that preferential treatment given to SOEs may create anticompetitive effects in the global marketplace, blurring the distinction between firms and governments. State-owned enterprises (SOEs) may have a competitive advantage through government support, raising concerns about their impact on market competition and national security. However, the OECD found little evidence that SOEs' advantages affect their international economic performance.

The performance of foreign-owned establishments compared to U.S.-owned ones shows mixed results. Foreign-owned firms in the U.S. historically had lower rates of return than U.S.-owned firms, but the gap has narrowed over time. This narrowing is related to age effects and startup costs that disappear over time. Foreign-owned manufacturing firms outperform U.S. counterparts with six times more value added and seven times higher value of shipments. Foreign-owned firms have larger plant sizes compared to U.S. firms in similar industries. Foreign-owned firms in the U.S. have significantly higher value added and shipments compared to U.S. firms. They also have larger plant sizes, pay higher wages, and display higher productivity and output per worker. Additionally, foreign-owned firms show higher capital intensity across various industries. These differences should be viewed with caution as the two groups of firms are not strictly comparable. Foreign-owned firms in the U.S. have higher value added, shipments, plant sizes, wages, productivity, and output per worker compared to U.S. firms. Foreign investors tend to opt for larger-scale and higher-capital-intensity plants to offset risks and generate higher profits.

Estimates suggest that foreign direct investment in the U.S. economy may slightly increase in 2016. Concerns over globalization's impact on jobs and potential job losses from mergers and acquisitions exist, but benefits from capital inflow and job creation are also recognized. Foreign direct investment in the U.S. economy may increase in 2016 despite concerns over job losses from mergers and acquisitions. Job security is a public issue, with opposition to foreign investment based on economic and national security interests. Despite national security concerns, the U.S. remains a prime destination for foreign investment, with the potential for new jobs and economic growth."
