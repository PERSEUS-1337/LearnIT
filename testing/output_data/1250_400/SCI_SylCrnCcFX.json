    "content": "Deep networks aim to understand complex mappings through locally linear behavior. The challenge lies in the instability of derivatives, especially in networks with piecewise linear activation functions. A new learning problem is proposed to ensure stable derivatives over larger regions. The algorithm involves identifying stable linear approximation regions and expanding them. This approach is illustrated with residual and recurrent networks on image and sequence datasets. The derivatives of functions parameterized by deep learning models are unstable, especially in over-parametrized models. This instability affects both function values and derivatives, making first-order approximations unreliable. Deep learning models are often unstable due to being over-parametrized, leading to unstable functions and derivatives. This instability affects the reliability of first-order approximations for explanations. Gradient stability is different from adversarial examples, with stable gradients being important for robust estimation techniques against adversarial attacks. In this paper, the focus is on deep networks with piecewise linear activations to ensure gradient stability. The special structure of these networks allows for inferring lower bounds on the maximum radius of p-norm balls around a point where derivatives are stable. The study specifically looks at the case of p = 2, formulating a regularization problem to maximize the lower bound.

Empirical evaluation is done on various network architectures with image and time-series datasets. The study examines inference and learning algorithms with fully-connected, residual, and recurrent networks on image and time-series datasets. It focuses on neural networks with piecewise linear activation functions and proposes novel algorithms for stable derivatives and perturbations. Various network architectures like FC, CNN, RNN, and ResNet are evaluated empirically. The behavior of deep models is mainly influenced by the activation function, with neural networks defined using affine transformations and piecewise linear activation functions being inherently piecewise linear. Various network architectures like FC, CNN, RNN, and ResNet are considered as piecewise linear networks. The proposed approach is based on a mixed integer linear representation of these networks, encoding the active linear piece of the activation function for each neuron. The feasible set corresponding to an activation pattern in the input space is a region where derivatives are stable. The feasible set induced by an activation pattern is called a linear region, where neighboring regions may have the same end-to-end linear coefficients. The input space is a natural region where derivatives are stable. The feasible set induced by an activation pattern is called a linear region. Different contexts of activation patterns include visualizing neurons, reachability of specific output values, and adversarial attacks. The focus is on local linear regions and expanding them through learning. In contrast to previous work focusing on quantifying linear regions, our method expands local linear regions through learning. We certify a 2 margin around a point by forwarding O(D) samples in parallel, providing a computationally efficient solution in high-dimensional settings. The proposed inference algorithm certifies a 2 margin around a point by forwarding O(D) samples in parallel, scaling to ResNet on high-dimensional images. The approach maximizes the 2 margin of linear regions around each data point in an unsupervised manner, akin to transductive SVM.

The curr_chunk discusses the activation pattern in neural networks with ReLU activations and FC architecture. It defines activation indicators and the feasible set of the activation pattern as a convex polyhedron. The linear property of an activation pattern is emphasized, along with the use of a generic loss function for training. The activation pattern in neural networks with ReLU activations and FC architecture is characterized by a set of linear constraints, forming a convex polyhedron. The feasibility of a directional perturbation can be checked using Proposition 4, which verifies if a point lies within the feasible set S(x) based on the activation pattern O. The feasibility of directional perturbations can be checked using Proposition 4, which verifies if a point lies within the feasible set S(x) based on the activation pattern O. Proposition 5 extends this to 1-ball feasibility, but in high dimensions, the exponential number of extreme points in an \u221e-ball makes it intractable. Binary searches can be used to find certificates for directional perturbations and 1-balls, with tractable feasibility on 1-balls due to the convexity of S(x). The feasibility of directional perturbations and 1-balls can be verified using binary searches to find certificates. The tractable feasibility on 1-balls is due to the convexity of S(x). Certificates for 2-ball distances can be computed efficiently using a single forward pass. The number of linear regions in f \u03b8 is intractable to count due to the combinatorial nature of activation patterns. The number of linear regions in f \u03b8 is difficult to count due to the combinatorial nature of activation patterns. To address this, we propose certifying the number of complete linear regions among data points D x, which is efficient to compute under certain conditions. This certification is based on the cardinality of activation patterns and Jacobians of f \u03b8. In this section, we focus on maximizing the 2 margin\u02c6 x,2 through a regularization problem in the objective function. In this section, methods are discussed to maximize the 2 margin\u02c6 x,2 through a regularization problem in the objective function. The objective is rigid due to inner-minimization and the reciprocal of \u2207 x z i j 2, hindering optimization. A hinge-based relaxation similar to SVM is proposed to alleviate the problem. A smoother problem is derived by relaxing the squared root and reciprocal on the 2 norm, along with a hinge loss as a soft regularization problem with a hyper-parameter C. An upper bound of Eq. FORMULA12 is obtained by constraints in the feasible set.

The final objective is learning RObust Local Linearity (ROLL) with a simplified additive structure for stability and parallel computation. Taking \u03b3 = 100 can induce a strong synergy effect, as gradient norms between layers are highly correlated. The ROLL loss demands heavy computation on gradient norms, but a parallel algorithm is developed to avoid back-propagation. By exploiting the functional structure of f \u03b8, a linear network g \u03b8 is constructed to mimic f \u03b8 behavior.

The proposed approach involves efficient computation of gradient norms by decoupling the summation inside the expectation. It can be applied to deep learning models with affine transformations and piecewise linear activation functions. The algorithms do not immediately generalize to maxout/max-pooling nonlinearity but suggest using average-pooling or convolution with large strides instead. In this section, the approach ('ROLL') is compared with a baseline model ('vanilla') in various scenarios using accuracy, number of complete linear regions, and margins of linear regions as evaluation measures on a testing set. Experiments are conducted on a single GPU with 12G memory, and parameter analysis on the MNIST dataset is presented. Parameter analysis was conducted on the MNIST dataset, evaluating margins for testing points at different percentiles. Experiments were done on a 4-layer FC model with ReLU activations. Tuned models with different parameters were compared to a baseline model, showing larger margins with ROLL loss. Spearman's rank correlation between x,1 and x,2 was consistently high. The approach achieved lower #CLR with tight upper and lower bounds. The ROLL loss achieves significantly larger margins compared to the vanilla loss, with a tradeoff of 1% accuracy. Spearman's rank correlation between x,1 and x,2 is consistently high. Parameter analysis shows that increased C and \u03bb result in decreased accuracy but increased margin.

A sample-based approach is used to evaluate gradient stability f \u03b8 (x) y for the ground-truth label in a local region, revealing stability across different linear regions. Evaluation is based on expected distortion and maximum distortion within an intersection. Adversarial gradient is found by maximizing distortion over a ball.

Dynamic programming using the chain-rule of Jacobian is utilized for efficient computation. The dynamic programming approach using the chain-rule of Jacobian is efficient for computing gradients in fully connected networks. However, it is not suitable for convolutional layers due to the expensive nature of representing the convolutional operation. An introductory guide is provided for deriving inference and learning methods for piecewise linear networks with max-pooling nonlinearity. Representing the convolutional operation as a linear transformation is costly. This guide introduces derivations for maxout/max-pooling nonlinearity, emphasizing the feasibility of deriving methods for piecewise linear networks. It is advised against using max-pooling neurons due to new linear constraints they induce. Instead, convolution with large strides or average-pooling is recommended. The activation pattern determines which input is selected, leading to a linear model when fixed. The activation pattern creates a stable derivative feasible set in the input space, but may also result in degenerate cases with similar linear coefficients. The activation pattern in the network leads to a linear model when fixed, causing the nonlinearity in max-pooling to disappear. This results in a feasible set in the input space with stable derivatives. The feasible activation pattern induces linear constraints, forming a convex polyhedron.
