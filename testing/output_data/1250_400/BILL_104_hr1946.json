    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act of 1995\". Congress recognizes the fundamental right of parents to direct the upbringing of their children, as established in Supreme Court cases. The role of parents in raising their children is highly valued and should be protected by all levels of government. Some courts have not treated parental rights as fundamental, leading to improper judicial review of government actions affecting these rights. Parents are facing increasing intrusions into their responsibilities. The right of parents to direct the upbringing of their children is a fundamental right that should be protected. Some courts have not recognized this, leading to improper judicial review of government actions affecting parental rights. Parents are facing increasing intrusions into their responsibilities, and governments should not interfere without compelling justification. The traditional 4-step process used by courts appropriately balances the interests of parents, children, and government. The Act aims to protect parental rights in directing their children's upbringing, safeguard children from abuse, acknowledge parental responsibilities for education, uphold parental choices in healthcare decisions, and establish a standard for judicial review of parental decisions. The Act aims to preserve parental choices in healthcare decisions for children, establish a standard for judicial review of parental rights, and reestablish a 4-step process for evaluating cases involving parental rights. The Act aims to preserve parental rights in child upbringing, shifting the burden to the government to prove interference is necessary for a compelling interest and using the least restrictive means.
