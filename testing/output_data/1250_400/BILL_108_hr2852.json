    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Cord Blood Stem Cell Act of 2003\". The findings of the Act are also outlined. The Congress finds that cord blood, obtained from the placenta and umbilical cord, can be used for clinical applications such as bone marrow reconstitution for various diseases. This cord blood, normally discarded after childbirth, is a valuable source of stem cells that can be collected without risk to the donor and preserved for transplantation or research purposes. Cord blood stem cells can be collected without risk to the donor, preserved for many years, and used for transplantation or research. Advantages over bone marrow transplants include faster availability, lower risks of complications, and the ability to find a fully matched unrelated donor for better transplant success. Finding a fully matched unrelated donor is crucial for successful bone marrow transplantation, especially for patients of ethnic minorities who struggle to find fully matched donors. Cord blood stem cell banks offer increased genetic diversity in donors, providing more opportunities for fully matched or partially matched transplants, reducing complications like graft versus host disease and mortality compared to conventional bone marrow transplantation. Identifying fully matched and partially matched transplant units for qualified candidates is crucial. Cord blood stem cell transplants using partially matched units reduce the risk of graft versus host disease compared to conventional bone marrow transplantation. An inventory of 150,000 cord blood stem cell units, considering ethnic diversity, would provide appropriate matches for at least 90 percent of those seeking transplants within days. Matched donors are more likely within the same ethnic group as the patient, which is important for genetic conditions like Sickle Cell Anemia. Cord blood stem cell transplantation has cured patients with Sickle Cell Anemia, with 80 percent of children transplanted being cured. The earlier the transplant is done in the course of severe disease, the better the outcome. Cord blood stem cell transplantation has been successful in curing patients with Sickle Cell Anemia, especially in children. Unrelated cord blood transplants are beneficial for African American and other ethnic minority patients due to less stringent matching requirements compared to bone marrow. An ethnically balanced national cord blood bank could greatly increase the chances of finding suitable matches for successful treatment. Since its inception in 1987, the National Marrow Donor Program has facilitated 17,000 bone marrow transplants. Cord blood transplantation complements conventional bone marrow transplantation by providing appropriately matched units to patients, especially those of non-caucasoid ethnicity, who have a much lower probability of finding an adequate match through the National Marrow Donor Program. Cord blood is one of the sources of stem cells used in transplantation, however, its collection, preparation, storage, and dissemination require specific systems and expertise. Radiation exposure could cause bone marrow failure, necessitating treatment including bone marrow reconstitution, with cryopreserved cord blood being rapidly available in such cases. Recent scientific developments suggest that further research on cord blood stem cells may lead to a greater understanding of chronic diseases like Parkinson's disease, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer, potentially improving therapies and even offering cures. These diseases contribute significantly to chronic disabilities and healthcare costs in the United States. SEC. 3. NATIONAL CORD BLOOD STEM CELL BANK NETWORK. Part H of title III of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new section, SEC. 376A, establishing the National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network, established under SEC. 376A of the Public Health Service Act, defines key terms such as Administrator, cord blood unit, donor, donor bank, human cord blood stem cells, and National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network consists of qualified cord blood stem cell banks that collect stem cells from neonatal blood immediately after birth. The purpose of the donor banks is to acquire, test, and store donated units of human cord blood in compliance with federal regulations. The donor banks in the National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network acquire, tissue-type, test, cryopreserve, and store donated units of human cord blood with informed consent. They make cord blood units available for stem cell transplantation and allocate 10% of the inventory for research. Eligible banks must have all necessary licenses and authorizations. To be a donor bank in the National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network, a bank must have all required licenses, certifications, registrations, and authorizations. They must also have proper donor screening and cord blood collection practices to protect donors and recipients from infections. Additionally, strict confidentiality measures must be in place to protect patient and donor identities in accordance with federal and state laws. To be part of the National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network, a bank must have necessary licenses, certifications, and authorizations. They need proper donor screening, cord blood collection practices, and confidentiality measures to protect patient and donor identities as per federal and state laws. Additionally, they must encourage donation from a diverse group of donors, have systems for communication with other banks and transplant centers, and track recipients' clinical outcomes. Education programs are also required. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network requires banks to have necessary licenses, certifications, and authorizations, proper donor screening, cord blood collection practices, and confidentiality measures. They must encourage donation from diverse donors, communicate with other banks and transplant centers, track recipients' outcomes, and educate the public. A Board of Directors administers the Network, establishing a national cord blood stem cell registry and coordinating donor banks. The Board of Directors for the Blood Stem Cell Bank Network is composed of members appointed by the Secretary for 3-year terms, representing cord blood stem cell transplant centers, physicians from birthing hospitals, the research community, transplant recipients, and family members of patients. The Board of Directors for the Blood Stem Cell Bank Network includes members representing various stakeholders such as cord blood stem cell transplant centers, physicians, research community, transplant recipients, family members, social science experts, general public, Health Resources and Services Administration, and network donor banks. Members can serve up to two consecutive 3-year terms. The Board of Directors for the Blood Stem Cell Bank Network includes members representing various stakeholders and network donor banks. Members can serve up to two consecutive 3-year terms, with approximately 1/3 of the Board members' terms expiring each year. The Secretary will establish a National Cord Blood Stem Cell Registry as part of the Network. The Secretary will establish a National Cord Blood Stem Cell Registry as part of the Network, which will operate a system for identifying, acquiring, and distributing donated units of cord blood, provide a website function for searching suitable donor matches, and maintain a database documenting collection, storage, distribution, and transplantation outcomes. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Registry will maintain a database to document the collection, storage, distribution, and transplantation of cord blood units, as well as clinical outcomes. The database will operate according to standards of consent, disclosure, and confidentiality, and the Administrator will report periodically to the Secretary on safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of activities. This information will be made available to the public. The Administrator will report to the Secretary on the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of the National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network's activities. The Board of Directors will ensure donor banks meet requirements and that collection sites are geographically distributed. $15,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2004, $30,000,000 for fiscal year 2005, and additional funds for fiscal years 2006-2008 or until the 150,000 unit inventory is acquired."
