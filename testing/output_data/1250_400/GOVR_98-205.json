    "content": "The House and Senate approved various defense-related bills in FY1999, including appropriations and authorization bills. Additional funding of $8.3 billion was provided for defense, including money for Bosnia operations, military readiness, intelligence, missile defense, year 2000 fixes, storm damage repairs, and other defense-related programs. The omnibus appropriations bill was signed into law on October 21 (P.L. 105-277). The annual defense appropriations bill, signed into law on October 21 (P.L. 105-277), allocated funds for various defense-related programs including missile defense, year 2000 fixes, storm damage repairs, purchasing fissile materials from Russia, antiterrorism activities, and defense counter-drug activities. The majority of the funding is for programs administered by the Department of Defense, with smaller amounts allocated for other agencies such as the Central Intelligence Agency and intelligence community management. The FY1999 budget included $270.6 billion for national defense, with $250.8 billion requested in the defense appropriations bill. Congress also acts on a national defense authorization bill, which addresses defense programs in detail. Differences between the authorization and appropriations bills are minimal, with major defense policy debates usually occurring during authorization bill action. This report tracks congressional action on both measures. Congress completed action on the annual defense authorization and appropriations bills on October 1. The final status of action on these bills and related legislation is as follows: House and Senate 302(b) allocations were approved in May, determining funding for defense and other programs under the jurisdiction of the appropriations committees. The final Senate allocations for the defense subcommittee are $250.290 billion in budget authority and $244.942 billion. The full committee approved initial allocations on June 16, determining funding for defense and other programs. Final Senate allocations for defense subcommittee are slightly below Administration's request. House allocations provide $250.499 billion in budget authority for national security subcommittee. House approved FY1999 defense authorization bill on May 21. The House and Senate completed marking up their versions of the FY1999 defense authorization bill, with the House approving it on May 21 and the Senate passing it on June 25. Conferees reached agreement on the authorization bill on September 17, which was signed into law on October 17. The House also passed the FY1999 defense appropriations bill on June 24. The FY1999 defense appropriations bill was passed into law (P.L. 105-261) on October 17. The House and Senate marked up their versions of the bill in June, with the House passing it on June 24 and the Senate on July 30. Conferees reached agreement on the bill on September 22, and it was signed into law on October 17 (P.L. 105-262). The FY1999 defense appropriations bill (P.L. 105-262) was signed into law on October 17. The Senate approved S.Con.Res. 86 for the congressional budget resolution on April 2, and the House approved H.Con.Res. 284 on June 5. A conference agreement on the resolution was not completed. Additionally, supplemental defense appropriations for FY1998 were approved on April 30 for military operations in Bosnia and Southwest Asia, among other purposes, totaling $2.7 billion for the Defense Department. The President signed the bill into law (P.L. 105-174) on May 1, providing $2.7 billion for the Defense Department, including funding for Bosnia, Southwest Asia, disaster relief, and other defense programs. In FY1999, an omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 4328) approved additional defense-related funding of $8.3 billion for various defense operations and programs. In FY1999, an omnibus appropriations bill approved additional defense-related funding of $8.3 billion for various operations and programs, including Bosnia, military readiness, intelligence, missile defense, year 2000 fixes, storm damage repairs, defense health program, purchasing fissile materials from Russia, defense antiterrorism activities, and defense counter-drug activities. The bill also included rescissions of $67 million. The conference agreements on the defense authorization and appropriations bills resolved issues related to relations with China. The FY1999 defense appropriations bill approved additional funding for various defense operations and programs. The conference agreements resolved issues related to relations with China, including limitations on satellite and missile technology exports. The conference agreed to transfer technology export review from the Commerce Department to the State Department and require congressional notification for satellite sales to China. The conference agreement on the defense appropriations bill addressed the export of satellites to China, transferring technology export review to the State Department, requiring congressional notification for satellite sales, and prohibiting the export of missile equipment to China unless certain conditions are met. It also included measures to prohibit the transfer of port facilities to a Chinese shipping company and condemn forced abortions in China. The appropriations conference agreement does not include measures condemning forced abortions in China or denying visas to foreign officials involved in forced sterilization. The agreement prohibits DOD from doing business with Chinese Army-owned companies and requires a report on the security situation in the Taiwan Strait. Base closures were not approved in the House or Senate authorization bills, and a provision making it difficult for the Defense Department to realign military bases was dropped from the conference agreement. The House-passed bill required separation of men and women in basic training, while the Senate-passed bill did not. The conference agreement dropped a provision regarding COSCO, with the Senate endorsing a substitute allowing current integrated training practices to continue. The House-Senate authorization conference ultimately adopted the Senate language but included a \"sense of the House\" statement urging separate training units. The House-Senate authorization conference addressed issues such as separate training units, exemplary behavior for commanders, and the ban on abortions in military medical facilities. The House-passed bill aimed to prohibit the Department of Energy from buying tritium for nuclear weapons from commercial reactors, potentially requiring costly new facilities for tritium production. The Senate bill allowed DOE to choose the long-term option for tritium procurement. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that it would cost about $3 billion over the next forty years to buy tritium from commercial sources and $10 billion to buy it from new facilities. The Senate-passed authorization bill included a provision allowing DOE to choose the long-term option, but implementation is prohibited for a year to allow Congress to review the decision. The authorization conference report agrees to the Administration's proposed reductions in active duty end-strength levels and a pay raise of 3.6% for military personnel. The authorization conference report agrees to the Administration's proposed reductions in active duty end-strength levels and a 3.6% pay raise for military personnel. Additionally, the Senate approved an amendment to increase the pay raise to 3.6%, offset by a reduction in R&D funds. The authorization and appropriations conference agreements provide a 3.6% pay raise. The Administration requested $1.9 billion for Bosnia in FY1999 as emergency funding, which was included in the Senate-passed version of the defense appropriations bill. The Senate-passed version of the defense appropriations bill in FY1999 included $1.9 billion in emergency funding for Bosnia, while the House bill did not. The authorization conference agreement authorized the funding and allowed for larger expenditures if deemed necessary by the President. The House bill included a provision to cap Bosnia spending at $1.9 billion, with an additional $100 million allowed for troop protection, which the Administration objected to. Both houses rejected measures to withdraw U.S. troops from Bosnia by a specific date, but the Senate version included a statement encouraging a drawdown of forces. The authorization conference agreement authorized $1.9 billion in emergency funding for Bosnia, with the possibility of larger expenditures if deemed necessary for national security. Contentious weapons issues included funding for additional C-130J aircraft, with the final agreement providing funds for 7 aircraft. Funding for the THAAD system was reduced in both House and Senate appropriations bills. The House and Senate authorization and appropriations bills allocated over $400 million for 7 additional aircraft. Funding for the THAAD system was reduced after a test failure in May, with the authorization conference agreement cutting $294 million and the appropriations conference agreement cutting $376 million. The Senate also reduced funding for the MEADS system, a cooperative program with allies, with the authorization conference agreement cutting funding to $24 million and the appropriations conference agreement providing only $10 million. The authorization conference agreement cuts funding for the MEADS program from $44 million to $24 million and prohibits expenditure unless the Defense Department includes it in future budget plans. The appropriations conference agreement provides only $10 million. Funding for the Airborne Laser program was reduced, while funding for Space-Based Laser R&D was increased. Both House and Senate appropriations bills also reduced funding for new aircraft carrier development. The Navy will use some of the money for progressive changes in the current design. The authorization conference agreement provides $110 million, and the appropriations conference agreement provides $105 million out of the $190 million requested. The Navy decided not to pursue a new \"CVX\" carrier design and instead focus on progressive changes in the current design. The authorization and appropriations conference agreements provided funding for new amphibious ships and aircraft procurement, with some objections raised by lawmakers and the Administration. The Administration objected to certain requirements in the Senate authorization bill for aircraft testing and cuts in funding for Department of Energy weapons programs. The authorization conference agreement made smaller cuts in these programs and resolved long-term weapons issues. Both House and Senate bills took steps to ensure military retirees have access to healthcare, with pilot projects approved for alternative approaches. The House and Senate authorization bills addressed military health care for retirees, including pilot projects for alternative approaches and access to the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan. The defense debate also covered budget constraints, military base closures, Bosnia funding, technology exports, efficiency measures, military readiness, and long-term defense funding. The defense debate in Congress for the FY1999 budget included discussions on military base closures, Bosnia funding, technology exports, efficiency measures, military readiness, defense modernization funding, personnel levels, National Guard and Reserve funding, major weapons programs, social issues, and other matters like military health care policy and Year 2000 computer problems. Budget constraints from the 1997 agreement influenced the defense debate. The FY1999 defense budget debate in Congress was influenced by budget constraints from the 1997 agreement. The Administration's request was at the agreed level of $270.5 billion in new budget authority, making it a \"zero-sum game\" for Congress. Despite initial constraints, Congress added $8.3 billion for defense programs in the omnibus appropriations bill. This could have led to a confrontation over defense priorities between Congress and the Administration. The omnibus appropriations bill provided an additional $8.3 billion for defense programs, leading to potential conflicts between Congress and the Administration over defense priorities. However, a contentious debate over priorities within the defense budget did not materialize in House and Senate actions on the FY1999 defense authorization and appropriations bills. Key defense programs were fully funded, including national missile defense development, National Guard and Reserve equipment, defense health program costs, and funding for the next Nimitz-class aircraft carrier. The FY1999 defense authorization and appropriations bills did not spark a contentious debate over priorities. The omnibus appropriations bill added $8.3 billion for defense programs, with $1 billion allocated for ballistic missile defense. The congressional defense debate was influenced by the Quadrennial Defense Review, Defense Reform Initiative report, and National Defense Panel report. The Defense Reform Initiative report, QDR, and National Defense Panel report highlighted key defense policy reassessments and efficiency measures. They emphasized the need for increased efficiency to save money for weapons modernization and endorsed military base closures. The QDR proposed a revised defense strategy, the ability to win two major wars simultaneously, and measures to address post-Cold War challenges. The Defense Reform Initiative, QDR, and National Defense Panel reports emphasized the need for increased efficiency to save money for weapons modernization and endorsed military base closures. The National Defense Panel called for a greater emphasis on homeland defense and preparing for future threats, suggesting more funding for experimental force exercises and new technology. Both reports recommended two more rounds of military base closures to finance future defense modernization programs. The Defense Department proposed two more rounds of military base closures to save money for defense modernization programs. Secretary Cohen prioritized congressional approval for closure rounds in 2001 and 2005. Previous closure rounds are estimated to save $5.6 billion annually, with projections of $2.8 billion in savings for future rounds. The Defense Department proposed two more rounds of military base closures to save money for defense modernization programs. Previous closure rounds are estimated to save $5.6 billion annually, with projections of $2.8 billion in savings for future rounds. Resistance to more base closures in Congress has been hardened by objections to Administration actions following the 1995 base closure round. The White House developed a plan to \"privatize in place\" at two sites instead of closing them, which is now being implemented. The White House developed a plan to \"privatize in place\" at two military facilities instead of closing them, allowing private contractors to bid for contracts. This plan has faced criticism from Members of Congress who argue it politicizes the base closure process and erodes support for further closures. Secretary Cohen has suggested that Congress could include a prohibition on privatization in place in future base closure legislation. In response to criticism of privatization in place at military facilities, Secretary Cohen suggested Congress could prohibit it in future base closure legislation. Despite calls for more base closures, Congress did not approve additional closures in the FY1999 defense authorization. The Senate rejected a proposal for one more base closure round in 2001, and passed an amendment making it harder for DOD to realign facilities without a congressionally established base closure process. The Senate rejected a proposal for one more base closure round in 2001, and passed an amendment making it harder for DOD to realign facilities without a congressionally established base closure process. Additionally, Congress approved supplemental funding for military operations in Bosnia and the Persian Gulf. Congress approved supplemental funding for military operations in Bosnia and the Persian Gulf, including an amendment to the FY1999 defense budget request for $1.9 billion to cover costs of extending the mission in Bosnia through FY1999. The funding was ultimately provided in the omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 4328), with the Administration requesting the additional funding be designated as \"emergency\" appropriations to raise caps on defense discretionary spending. The Administration requested $1.9 billion in emergency appropriations for military operations in Bosnia for FY1999. Congress approved the funding as part of the defense authorization bill, breaking the precedent of including ongoing military operation costs within regular defense appropriations measures. In its version of the defense authorization bill, SASC approved $1.9 billion for Bosnia in FY1999 as emergency appropriations. HNSC set a cap of $1.9 billion for Bosnia with an additional $100 million for emergencies. The House rejected a motion to cut off funds for Bosnia without prior approval. The Senate approved an amendment urging a reduction in U.S. troop levels in Bosnia. The Senate approved an amendment urging the President to reduce U.S. troop levels in Bosnia, but rejected a proposal to cut off funds without Congressional approval. The Senate added $1.9 billion in emergency appropriations for Bosnia to the defense appropriations bill. The House included a provision to prohibit expenditures on offensive military action without advance Congressional approval, which the White House threatened to veto. The Senate approved $1.9 billion in emergency funding for Bosnia, contingent on presidential certification for national security needs. The Skaggs amendment to prohibit offensive military action without congressional approval was dropped from the appropriations conference agreement. Congressional focus on relations with China and technology exports intensified. In FY1999, $1.9 billion was allocated for Bosnia in the Omnibus appropriations bill. Congressional attention shifted to China's technology exports and allegations of assistance from Loral Space Corporation. Nuclear tests by India and Pakistan led to discussions on trade sanctions legislation. The House approved amendments to restrict technology exports to China and other countries, which the White House opposed. The House-passed bill included provisions to restrict technology exports to China and transfer facilities at Long Beach naval shipyard to a Chinese shipping company. The Senate considered various China-related amendments, with Senator Hutchinson planning to offer his amendments during the defense appropriations bill. Senator Stevens delayed floor action on the bill due to concerns about contentious amendments potentially derailing it. Ultimately, the Senate addressed China-related issues in action on other bills, with Senator Hutchinson offering a single, revised amendment. Senator Stevens delayed floor action on the defense appropriations bill due to concerns about contentious amendments potentially derailing it. Senator Hutchinson later offered a revised amendment requiring the State Department to deny visas to foreign officials involved in forced abortions, sterilization, or genital mutilation, which passed unanimously. The authorization conference agreement included provisions shifting technology export review from Commerce to State Department, requiring advanced congressional notification for satellite sales to China, and prohibiting missile equipment exports unless certain conditions are met. The conference agreement includes provisions shifting technology export review to the State Department, requiring advanced congressional notification for satellite sales to China, and prohibiting missile equipment exports unless certain conditions are met. Other efficiency measures recommended include staff reductions in the Office of the Secretary of Defense and military service headquarters, cuts in civilian and military personnel in support functions, and pursuing public-private competitions for activities currently carried out by civilian DOD employees. The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and military service headquarters staff are facing staff reductions and cuts in support functions. Congress is debating whether these cuts are substantial or just on paper, and how to react to privatization measures. The House is pushing for deep cuts in acquisition personnel, while the Senate and Administration are seeking to soften these measures. The House has been pushing for deep cuts in acquisition personnel, while the Senate and Administration are seeking to soften these measures. HNSC urged the Defense Department not to waive cuts in acquisition personnel mandated in last year's defense authorization act and imposed a $500 million across-the-board cut in funding for consultants. The White House objected to the cut in consulting funds and several measures in the House-passed authorization bill. The authorization conference agreement includes a measure to withhold 10% of funds for the Office of the Secretary of Defense unless DOD meets all statutory requirements to cut headquarters staffs. The White House objected to cuts in consulting funds and measures in the House-passed authorization bill, citing restrictions on DOD's pursuit of efficiencies. The authorization conference agreement includes withholding funds for the Office of the Secretary of Defense, cutting acquisition personnel, reducing consultant funding, and decreasing Assistant Secretary of Defense positions. Congressional focus on military readiness highlights concerns such as shortages in spare aircraft engines, lowered Army recruitment standards, personnel skill gaps, and declining pilot retention rates in the Air Force and Navy, signaling a potential readiness crisis due to inadequate funding and administration policies. The White House objected to cuts in consulting funds and measures in the House-passed authorization bill, citing restrictions on DOD's pursuit of efficiencies. The authorization conference agreement includes withholding funds for the Office of the Secretary of Defense, cutting acquisition personnel, reducing consultant funding, and decreasing Assistant Secretary of Defense positions. Concerns about military readiness include shortages in spare aircraft engines, lowered Army recruitment standards, personnel skill gaps, and declining pilot retention rates in the Air Force and Navy, indicating a potential readiness crisis due to inadequate funding and administration policies. Administration officials acknowledge some problems but deny an overall readiness crisis, stating that early deploying units remain fully ready while some later deploying units may take longer to prepare. Problems are being addressed, such as shortages in Air Force engine spares due to projection errors. Officials in the services have expressed concerns about personnel recruitment and retention, with a growing need for higher defense spending to address readiness problems. The President met with senior military officers who identified serious readiness issues, leading to a request for over $17 billion per year in additional defense spending during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing. During a meeting with senior military officers, the President discussed serious readiness problems and the need for higher defense spending. The Joint Chiefs testified before the Senate about the state of military readiness, highlighting a shortfall of up to $135 billion over five years. Congressional actions included restructuring funding for maintenance and implementing changes in readiness reporting. The Senate approved amendments requiring reports on food stamp use by military families and acknowledging that readiness has been impacted by budget cuts and expanded responsibilities. The Senate approved amendments on the defense appropriations bill, including reports on food stamp use by military families and acknowledging readiness erosion due to budget cuts and expanded missions. The bill provides funding for recruiting, troop benefits, and quality of life measures, but did not address changes to military retirement benefits. Long-term funding for defense modernization remains a concern. The Administration has prioritized readiness-related funding over weapons procurement, leading to reallocation of funds. The FY1999 budget requested $48.7 billion for procurement, close to the previous year's level, with potential decline if Bosnia costs were included. The Administration aims to strengthen procurement efforts. The Administration aims to increase procurement funding to $60 billion per year by FY2001, but faces challenges in reaching this target due to potential budget constraints and increasing costs in various areas. Under Secretary of Defense Jacques Gansler noted the difficulty in achieving the $60 billion procurement goal. The $60 billion procurement target is becoming harder to reach due to various challenges such as increased weapons maintenance costs, unplanned quality of life requirements, and health care cost growth. Congressional action does not include substantial increases in modernization funding, with only $1 billion allocated for BMD programs in the omnibus appropriations bill. The QDR mandates a reduction in military personnel end-strength levels, with resistance in Congress to proposed cuts citing strains on active duty forces from contingency operations and forward presence abroad. The QDR mandates a reduction in military personnel end-strength levels, with resistance in Congress to proposed cuts citing strains on active duty forces from contingency operations and forward presence abroad. Congress must agree to reduce or eliminate statutory floors to carry out the QDR reductions, but some Members are hesitant to do so. The Administration requested a reduction of over 35,000 active duty personnel from the authorized FY1998 level. The Administration requested a reduction in active duty personnel levels by over 35,000 from the authorized FY1998 level. Congress must agree to eliminate statutory floors to implement the QDR reductions, but some Members are hesitant. HNSC rejected the request to repeal statutory floors and reduced authorized end-strength by 11,000 fewer positions than requested. SASC approved the end-strength reductions and repeal of statutory floors. The authorization conference report agreed to the Administration's request. A dispute between the active Army and the Army National Guard over the role of ARNG combat units emerged after the QDR. In FY1999, the authorization conference report agreed to the Administration's request for end-strength. A dispute between the active Army and the Army National Guard over the role of ARNG combat units emerged after the QDR. Congress approved the appointment of special advisors for Guard and Reserve officers, and the Defense Department requested more money for Guard and reserve weapons procurement. The Army Chief of Staff is working to ease the ongoing dispute with ARNG leaders. Congress has consistently added funds for Guard and reserve weapons programs to the budget. The Army Chief of Staff is meeting with ARNG leaders to ease ongoing disputes. Congress has added substantial amounts for equipment earmarked for National Guard and Reserve forces, including major weapons programs like Missile defense. The Administration has increased funding for NMD programs, but major policy disputes remain unresolved. The Administration has increased funding for NMD programs to protect U.S. forces from missile attacks. Policy disputes persist, with debates over early deployment of a nationwide defense system and the relevance of the ABM Treaty. Disputes also continue over TMD systems like THAAD and Navy Theater-Wide, with delays in procurement for affordability reasons. The Administration has delayed THAAD development due to test failures and wants to delay Navy Theater-Wide procurement for affordability reasons. MEADS is a cooperative program with European allies for improved air/missile defense. Congressional Action: Senate reported S. 1873 calling for nationwide defense deployment, but failed to pass. Congress has also acted on TMD programs earlier. The Senate Armed Services Committee reported S. 1873, \"The American Missile Protection Act of 1998,\" calling for nationwide defense deployment. Congress also approved additional funding for TMD programs in FY1998. The THAAD program faced test failures and funding cuts due to delays in engineering development. The Senate approved an amendment to trim $253.9 million from the THAAD program due to test failures and delays in engineering development. The House also restructured the THAAD program by requiring a second contractor to compete with Lockheed-Martin and shifting funding from engineering to technology development. Additionally, funding for MEADS was reduced, and the Air Force Advanced Airborne Laser program faced criticism and funding cuts. Funding for Space-Based Laser R&D was increased. The Senate appropriations bill did not add money for NMD and cut funding for the Air Force Advanced Airborne Laser program. They increased funding for Space-Based Laser R&D and the Navy Theater Wide TMD system as an alternative to THAAD. The appropriations conference agreement further cut funding for THAAD, MEADS, and the Airborne Laser program. The appropriations conference agreement cuts funding for THAAD by $376 million, reduces MEADS to $10 million, and cuts the Airborne Laser program by $25 million. Additionally, there is no additional funding for procuring more B-2 bombers in this year's defense bills. In March, an independent commission mandated by Congress issued the latest B-2 study, calling for no more bombers to be produced due to cost concerns. Congressional action shows no additional funding for B-2 bombers in this year's defense bills. Three new fighter aircraft programs are in development and production, including the Navy F/A-18E/F, Air Force F-22, and Joint Strike Fighter. The QDR studied these programs and decided to continue all of them, although they were reduced. Some Members of Congress believe DOD cannot afford all three programs and one should be canceled. The QDR studied three new fighter aircraft programs - Navy F/A-18E/F, Air Force F-22, and Joint Strike Fighter - and decided to continue all of them, despite reductions. Some Members of Congress believe DOD cannot afford all three programs and one should be canceled. Congressional action included reducing F/A-18E/F procurement and imposing a flight test requirement for the F-22. The appropriations conference approved funds for 30 F-18s. The Administration objected to the Senate requirement for the next round of procurement. The authorization conference approved funds for 30 F-18s and allows a flight test requirement for the F-22 to be waived. Congress has added substantial amounts to shipbuilding programs in recent years to avoid gaps in production. The procurement of the CVN-77, the last planned Nimitz-class aircraft carrier, has been moved up to the FY2001 budget. Newport News Shipbuilding proposed the \"Smart Buy\" approach to save the Navy $600 million on the price of the ship. The DOD's alternative plan for funding in FY2002 differs from Newport News Shipbuilding's \"Smart Buy\" proposal, aiming to avoid a big bill in FY1999 and FY2000. The Navy has also addressed concerns about the next generation DD-21 destroyer by forming teams with shipbuilders and combat system integrators for competition in combat systems and design. Plans for a new-design aircraft carrier, the \"CVX,\" have been abandoned. The Navy has reached agreements with shipbuilders and combat system integrators to form teams for competition in combat systems and design. Plans for a new-design aircraft carrier, the \"CVX,\" have been abandoned in favor of incremental improvements to the next three Nimitz-class carriers. Congressional committees largely approved the Administration's shipbuilding program, including funding for a New Attack Submarine (NSSN) and added $50 million for a new LHD-7 class amphibious ship. The Navy has decided not to pursue a new-design aircraft carrier, CVX, opting for upgrades to Nimitz-class carriers instead. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended reducing funding for CVX R&D by $130 million and increasing funding for CVN-77 by $50 million. Additionally, $35.7 million for CVX feasibility studies was cut, with $5 million allocated for a red team study on a futuristic aircraft carrier. The House Appropriations bill cut funding for CVX by $100 million, while the authorization conference agreement provides $110 million for CVX R&D and the appropriations conference agreement provides $105 million. The Administration did not request funding for additional F-16 aircraft in the FY1999 budget. Funding for the Joint Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) aircraft was also an issue, with a recommendation to reduce the total planned procurement from 19 to 13. NATO did not decide to purchase JSTARS. The House authorization added funds for F-16s and JSTARS aircraft, as well as National Guard and Reserve equipment. The House appropriations bill provided funding for additional F-16s, JSTARS, Guard and Reserve equipment, and C-130 cargo aircraft. The Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) allocated funds for JSTARS pending a DOD report on the program. The House appropriations bill provided funding for additional F-16s, JSTARS, Guard and Reserve equipment, and C-130 cargo aircraft. SASC allocated funds for JSTARS pending a DOD report on the program. Funding for C-130J aircraft was a contentious issue, with Rep. Obey proposing to eliminate funds for 4 aircraft to restore F/A-18E/F procurement. The authorization conference agreement provided funds for 7 C-130s, 1 F-16, advance procurement funds for JSTARS, and $60 million. The authorization conference agreement provides funds for 7 C-130s, 1 F-16, advance procurement funds for JSTARS, and $60 million for miscellaneous Guard and Reserve equipment. The National Defense Panel recommends reducing or terminating \"legacy\" programs in favor of leap-ahead technologies for future threats. The National Defense Panel recommends reducing or terminating \"legacy\" programs in favor of leap-ahead technologies for future threats, including lighter equipment for land forces, longer-range fighter aircraft, and ships with lower radar visibility. Some Members of Congress have echoed these concerns, with the SASC approving a measure for a Quadrennial Defense Review and criticizing the Army's Crusader artillery program. Social issues like sexual harassment and gender-integrated training are also being debated. The SASC criticized the Army's Crusader artillery program and ordered a review in light of the National Defense Panel's recommendations. Social issues such as sexual harassment and gender-integrated training are key topics of debate in annual defense funding bills. The Administration and Congress have established commissions to address these issues, with recommendations including separate units and barracks for men and women during basic training. The Kassebaum Baker committee recommended separate units and barracks for men and women during basic training, a policy followed by the Marine Corps. The Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services disagreed with this recommendation. Secretary of Defense Cohen left it to each service to decide on changes, with no services altering their policies yet. Congressional action included a provision in the HNSC authorization bill for separate units and barracks, while SASC prohibited any changes until further investigations are completed. The House and Senate were in disagreement over gender-integrated training, with the authorization conference agreement allowing current unit training practices to continue but requiring separate sleeping quarters for men and women in basic training. Additionally, there was a provision for the Secretary of Defense and the President to display exemplary conduct. The authorization conference agreement allows current unit training practices to continue but requires separate sleeping quarters for men and women in basic training. Congress is evaluating Tricare and established a demonstration program for Medicare subvention. HNSC and SASC are ensuring access to healthcare for military retirees through demonstration projects. The Defense Department is providing care to military retirees eligible for Medicare benefits. Congressional action includes establishing demonstration projects for alternative healthcare for retirees, testing access to the Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan, and earmarking funds for medical research and development. The Senate set aside $250 million for medical R&D earmarks in the defense appropriations bill. The defense appropriations bills have earmarked funds for various medical programs, including breast cancer and prostate cancer research. The Senate version set aside $250 million for medical R&D earmarks, while the House bill included separate amounts for medical earmarks. The appropriations conference agreement provides funds for medical programs, including cancer research. The Defense Department faces potential computer problems in the year 2000, with the House Appropriations Committee adding $1.6 billion in emergency appropriations. The Defense Department faces potential computer problems in the year 2000, with the House Appropriations Committee adding $1.6 billion in emergency appropriations to help fix its computers. The House Republican caucus later decided not to provide emergency funding for the \"Y2K\" problem, leading to the removal of the $1.6 billion in emergency funding from the defense appropriations bill. The issue of emergency funding for Bosnia and Y2K was left to be addressed in a separate supplemental appropriations bill. The caucus decided not to provide emergency funding for the \"Y2K\" problem, leading to the removal of $1.6 billion in emergency funding from the defense appropriations bill. The issue of emergency funding for Bosnia and Y2K was left to be addressed in a separate supplemental appropriations bill. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill provides $1.1 billion for the Defense Department for Y2K conversion and an additional $2.4 billion for other agencies. The defense authorization bill approves funding for Department of Energy weapons-related activities as well as for Department of Defense activities, with a key issue concerning tritium production for Department of Energy nuclear weapons programs. The House-passed authorization bill included a measure that would prohibit the Department of Energy from buying tritium for nuclear weapons from commercial nuclear reactors. The House-passed authorization bill included a measure to prohibit the Department of Energy from buying tritium for nuclear weapons from commercial nuclear reactors. The Senate-passed authorization bill allowed DOE to choose its preferred long-term tritium source, with a conference agreement giving DOE the choice but delaying implementation for a year for Congress to review. Senator Kyl objected to this provision, feeling it was urgent for DOE to pursue a new tritium source. The authorization conference agreement allows DOE to choose a tritium source but delays implementation for Congress to review. Senator Kyl objects to this delay, urging DOE to pursue a new tritium source urgently. H.Con.Res. 284 revises the congressional budget for fiscal year 1998 and establishes the budget for fiscal year 1999. S. 1768 makes emergency appropriations for natural disasters and peacekeeping efforts. H.R. 3579 provides emergency supplemental appropriations for fiscal year 1998. The Senate passed H.R. 3579 with provisions from S. 1768 by unanimous consent on Mar. 31, 1998. The bill made emergency supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1998. It was signed into law as P.L. 105-74 on May 1, 1998. Additionally, H.R. 3616 was introduced to authorize appropriations for military activities in fiscal year 1999.
