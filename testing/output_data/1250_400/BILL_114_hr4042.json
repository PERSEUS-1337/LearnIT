    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Pre-K for USA Act.\" Congress finds that the United States ranks 25th in early learning enrollment, with studies showing that access to high-quality prekindergarten programs leads to academic success and reduces the likelihood of negative outcomes such as grade repetition, drug problems, and incarceration. Additionally, every public dollar spent on prekindergarten programs yields a $7 return through reduced spending on other services. Despite these benefits, about 40 percent of school districts do not offer prekindergarten programs. Children who attend prekindergarten have higher GPAs, are more likely to attend college, and have lower arrest rates. However, 40% of school districts do not offer prekindergarten programs, and over half of those that do only offer part-day programs. Texas missed out on millions in federal funding for prekindergarten programs due to education budget cuts. Some local governments funded full-day prekindergarten programs in response to these cuts, highlighting the need for direct federal funding for prekindergarten programs. SEC. 3.
