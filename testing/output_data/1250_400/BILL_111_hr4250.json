    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\" is a condensed summary of the section's title and purpose. The \"Medicaid DSH Integrity Act\" recognizes the importance of Medicaid DSH payments for safety net hospitals serving low-income individuals. It highlights the need for auditing to ensure funds are used appropriately and raises concerns about recent policy changes narrowing the scope of DSH payments. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services issued regulations implementing reporting and auditing requirements that narrow the scope of DSH payments for many States. These changes could result in significant reductions in DSH payments to safety net providers. Congress did not intend to alter the definition of DSH-eligible costs or the substantive standards of the existing DSH program. SEC. 2. REVISION OF MEDICAID DSH AUDITING AND REPORTING REGULATIONS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with States and disproportionate share hospitals, will not enforce changes in policy related to the calculation of limits under the Social Security Act. An interim final rule will be published to revise the Medicaid DSH auditing and reporting regulations as necessary. The new interim final rule will include regulatory changes such as allowing hospitals to include all costs related to services provided to uninsured patients, regardless of other insurance coverage. Additionally, nominal payments for services will not be considered as health insurance or third-party coverage. This aligns with prior guidance from CMS in 1994. The CMS allows states to define allowable costs in their Medicaid plans as long as they do not exceed Medicare principles. The audit requirement for hospital services is interpreted consistently with the term \"hospital services\" in the Social Security Act. CMS will revise regulations to align the definition of hospital services with the Social Security Act and allow alternative methodologies for determining actual costs in Medicaid audits. Additionally, the initiation of requirements under section 1923(j) of the Social Security Act will be updated from 2004 to 2008. The Code of Federal Regulations is amended to allow alternative methodologies for determining actual costs in Medicaid audits. Section 1923(j) of the Social Security Act will be updated from 2004 to 2008. Definitions include CMS, Medicaid DSH auditing and reporting regulations, Medicaid DSH program, and Secretary. The term \"regulations\" refers to the final regulation issued on December 19, 2008, and published in the Federal Register. The term \"Medicaid DSH program\" refers to the program of payment adjustments under section 1923 of the Social Security Act. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through CMS."
