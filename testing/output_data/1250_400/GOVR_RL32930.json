    "content": "The NLRA, as amended, governs labor-management relations in the private sector by improving workers' bargaining power. It allows workers to join or form a union, bargain collectively, and protects their right not to join. Employers must negotiate in good faith with a union chosen by the majority of employees. The NLRA allows workers to join or form a union, bargain collectively over wages and conditions of employment, and protects their right not to join. The act requires employers to negotiate in good faith with a union chosen by the majority of employees. The NLRB administers and enforces the NLRA, resolving objections to elections, deciding on bargaining unit composition, and hearing appeals of unfair labor practices. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) consists of a five-member board and a General Counsel. The board resolves objections and challenges to secret ballot elections, decides on bargaining unit composition, and hears appeals of unfair labor practices. The General Counsel's office conducts secret ballot elections, investigates complaints of unfair labor practices, and supervises regional and field offices. Bargaining units are groups of employees represented by a union, determined based on a \"community of interest.\" Guards cannot be in the same unit as other employees, and the appropriate unit is decided by the NLRB if not agreed upon by the union and employer. A bargaining unit is a group of employees represented by a union, determined based on a \"community of interest.\" Guards cannot be in the same unit as other employees, and the appropriate unit is decided by the NLRB if not agreed upon by the union and employer. In a specific case, certified nursing assistants (CNAs) at a healthcare center petitioned to be represented by a union, and the NLRB found their unit to be appropriate despite the employer's request to include other nonprofessional service and maintenance employees. The CNAs at the healthcare center requested a review of the decision regarding their bargaining unit, arguing that it should only include nonprofessional service and maintenance employees. They assist residents with daily functions, wear nursing uniforms, and are supervised by licensed practical nurses. The employer argued that other employees like resident activity assistants, a staffing coordinator, a maintenance assistant, a medical records clerk, and cooks should be included in the bargaining unit. These employees have similar educational requirements as the CNAs. The CNAs at the healthcare center, along with other employees, were part of a dispute over their bargaining unit. The board ultimately sided with the CNAs, determining that they shared a community of interest due to their distinct training, certification, supervision, uniforms, pay rates, work assignments, shifts, and work areas. The other employees, such as resident activity assistants and maintenance assistants, have similar educational requirements but are not required to work specific shifts like the CNAs. The board agreed that the CNAs shared a community of interest due to their distinct training, certification, supervision, uniforms, pay rates, work assignments, shifts, and work areas. Campaign rules vary for employers, employees, and union organizers, with exceptions that may apply to specific union organizing campaigns. Employers can campaign against unionization, hold \"captive audience\" meetings, but not within 24 hours before an election. Employers can campaign against unionization and hold \"captive audience\" meetings, but not within 24 hours before an election. Employees can campaign for union support during work hours in both work and nonwork areas. Distribution of union literature is allowed in nonwork areas if not permitted in work areas. Using employer's e-mail for union activities may be restricted if not allowed for other causes or organizations. Employees may distribute union literature in work areas, but using the employer's e-mail for union activities may be restricted. Union organizers cannot conduct campaigns on company property, but they can meet with employees on union property or public areas. Nonemployee union organizers may be allowed in inaccessible workplaces or with employer permission. The NLRA protects the rights of employees and employers regarding union activities. Employers cannot interfere with employees' right to form or join a union, including threatening job loss, plant closure, or discrimination. Unfair labor practices are defined to ensure both parties' rights are upheld. Employees have the right to join or form a union without fear of retaliation from employers. Employers must bargain in good faith with unions on wages, hours, and working conditions. Unions cannot coerce employees to join or not join, threaten job loss, or discriminate against non-members. Unfair labor practices can be filed by any party involved. The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) requires unions to bargain in good faith on wages, hours, and working conditions. Unions cannot boycott or strike an employer connected to the one they are organizing. Unfair labor practice charges can be filed by employees, employers, or unions. The NLRB investigates charges and can issue cease-and-desist orders to stop unfair practices. If necessary, cases are heard by an administrative law judge and can be appealed to the board. The NLRA aims to prevent and remedy unfair labor practices without punishing individuals or organizations. The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) aims to prevent and remedy unfair labor practices without punishing individuals or organizations. The act allows the NLRB to issue cease-and-desist orders and order remedies for violations. Backpay can be awarded to workers who were fired or discriminated against for union activities. Estimates show 1,000 to 3,000 workers are illegally fired for union activities annually. In a study, 25% of union campaigns resulted in workers being fired for union activities. The number of workers illegally fired for union activities ranges from 1,000 to 3,000 annually, with more firings in the 1980s. In a study, 25% of union campaigns resulted in firings. The trend in unfair labor practice charges filed from FY1970 to FY2012 shows a peak in FY1980 at 44,063 charges. Currently, there are three ways for employees to join or form a union as per Section 9(a) of NLRA. Employees can join or form a union through three ways: majority vote in NLRB election, voluntary recognition by employer, or NLRB order due to unfair labor practices. Certification through secret ballot election or employer recognition is required for collective bargaining to begin. A petition can be filed by a union, worker, or employer, with at least 30% of employees required for an election. The NLRB conducts secret ballot elections when a petition is filed by a union, worker, or employer. At least 30% of employees must sign authorization cards for a petition to be filed. If a majority of employees in the NLRB-conducted election choose union representation, the union is certified as the bargaining representative. Certification does not require an initial contract agreement. The NLRA does not specify a timeline for holding an election. If the employer and union do not agree on election details, a hearing may be held in the regional office. The NLRB conducts secret ballot elections after a petition is filed, with the employer and union agreeing on election details. If no agreement is reached, a hearing may be held in the regional office, and the regional director may direct an election. Employees choose whether to be represented by a labor union in the election, with the possibility of a runoff if no choice receives a majority. Challenges to an individual's right to vote can be made by either the employer or union, and objections to the election can be filed if NLRB standards are not met. The NLRB conducts secret ballot elections for certification and decertification of unions. Challenges to ballots can be made by either party, and objections to the election can be filed. A decertification petition must be signed by at least 30% of employees in the bargaining unit. A union certified after a secret ballot election is protected from decertification for a year. The NLRB issued a final rule in December 2011 that made changes to procedures for union representation petitions and secret ballot elections. The rule allowed hearing officers to limit pre-election hearings to matters relevant to representation questions. The NLRB suspended changes to union representation petition procedures in response to a court decision. The rule allowed hearing officers to limit pre-election hearings to relevant matters and consolidated pre- and post-election requests for review. Under the new rule, requests for review of post-election issues will be filed after the election. Special permission for review of pre-election decisions will only be granted in extraordinary circumstances. The 25-day waiting period for election scheduling has been eliminated. Requests for review of decisions by regional directors on challenges and objections to elections will now be discretionary. The 25-day waiting period for election scheduling was eliminated under the December 22, 2011 rule. Requests for review of post-election disputes are now mandatory in stipulated elections. In FY2010, NLRB conducted 1,823 elections with unions winning 62.3% of them. Most elections were based on consent or stipulated agreements between employers and unions. In FY2010, 89.3% of elections were based on consent or stipulated agreements between the two parties. Most elections are held within two months of filing a petition, with a median time of 38 days to proceed to an election. Post-election objections and challenges were filed in 115 cases in FY2011, with a median of 62 days for decisions requiring a hearing and 21 days for those resolved without a hearing. The NLRB does not collect data on the time it takes for a union and employer to reach a first contract agreement after an NLRB election. The NLRB does not collect data on the time it takes for a union and employer to reach a first contract agreement after an NLRB election. A recent study estimated that within two years of winning an NLRB election, a contract had not been reached in over two-fifths of cases. This is a higher percentage than found in estimates from previous studies. The NLRA does not require secret ballot elections. An employer may voluntarily recognize a union when presented with authorization cards signed by a majority of employees in a bargaining unit (\"card check\"). A card check agreement allows for voluntary recognition of a union by an employer based on authorization cards signed by a majority of employees in a bargaining unit. Neutral third parties often validate these signatures. Collective bargaining contracts may include card check arrangements for unorganized branches. Neutrality agreements may also be combined with card check arrangements, where the employer agrees to remain neutral during union organizing campaigns. A card check arrangement, possibly combined with a neutrality agreement, allows for voluntary union recognition based on signed authorization cards. Neutrality agreements involve the employer remaining neutral during organizing campaigns, with provisions such as not attacking the union and providing access to company property for meetings. Unions may engage in corporate campaigns to secure such agreements, which can include consumer boycotts and public relations efforts. Unions may engage in corporate campaigns to gain employer agreement for a card check campaign, possibly combined with a neutrality agreement. These campaigns involve tactics such as consumer boycotts, rallies, public relations efforts, and seeking public support. Another way for a union to be recognized is through a bargaining order by the NLRB, which can be issued if unfair labor practices prevent a fair election. Each case is based on specific facts of the violations. A bargaining order may be issued without a secret ballot election, and can be set aside due to employer unfair labor practices. Each case for issuing a bargaining order is based on specific violations. Certification by the NLRB is only granted to a union that wins a secret ballot election, not through voluntary recognition or a bargaining order. The Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 eliminated certification through any method other than an NLRB election. Certification provides advantages such as protection from decertification or representation by another union for a year (the \"certification bar\"). Certification provides advantages to a union, such as protection from decertification or representation by another union for a year. The duration of an employer's duty to bargain depends on whether a union has been certified by the board or recognized voluntarily by the employer. If a union wins an NLRB election, the employer must bargain in good faith for a year. Under certain circumstances, an employer may withdraw recognition of a union before reaching a contract agreement. If no contract agreement is reached after one year, the employer may withdraw recognition if both parties have engaged in good faith bargaining. Before the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947, only a union or employee could request a secret ballot election. Section 9(c) of the Taft-Hartley Act gave employers the right to request an election if they had \"good faith\" doubt that the union was supported by a majority of employees. The Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 granted employers the right to request a secret ballot election if they had \"good faith\" doubt about union support. The \"Joy Silk doctrine\" required employers to recognize the union if no doubt existed, but this approach was abandoned by the board in 1969. After that, if a majority of employees signed authorization cards, the employer could voluntarily recognize the union or request an election. The NLRB abandoned the Joy Silk doctrine, allowing employers to voluntarily recognize a union if a majority of employees signed authorization cards. In a 1974 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court stated that if an employer insists on an election, the union must file an election petition. Recent NLRB cases involved voluntary recognition, with two cases in 2004 where unions were recognized under card check agreements. In September 2002, Metaldyne recognized the UAW as the bargaining representative of workers at its St. Marys, Pennsylvania plant. The UAW and Dana Corporation entered into card check and neutrality agreements in August 2003, with the company recognizing the union at its Upper Sandusky, Ohio plant in December 2003. Both cases involved card check agreements before union recognition. Employees filed decertification petitions after recognition, but before a contract agreement, leading to NLRB dismissals based on the \"recognition bar\" doctrine. Employees at Dana and Metaldyne petitioned the NLRB for review. Following voluntary recognition of a union, employees have 45 days to file a petition to decertify the union or for a representation election. A rival union also has 45 days to file an election petition. The petitions must be signed by at least 30% of bargaining unit employees, and employees must receive notice of their right to petition. If a petition is not filed within 45 days, an election petition cannot be filed. The National Labor Relations Board reversed its decision in the Dana and Metaldyne cases, returning to the rule that after voluntary recognition of a union, an election petition is barred for a reasonable period of time. In a specific case with Lamons Gasket and the United Steelworkers, a decertification petition was filed within 45 days of voluntary recognition, supported by 30% of employees. The NLRB reversed its decision in the Dana and Metaldyne cases, reinstating the rule that bars an election petition for a reasonable period after voluntary recognition of a union. The board defined this period as at least six months, but not more than a year, after the first bargaining session. The decision in Lamons Gasket prompted a request from the House Committee on Education and the Workforce for case lists related to election petitions under different rulings. The Chairman of the committee's Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions requested case lists from the NLRB related to election petitions under different rulings, including the Dana decision and Lamons Gasket. The committee also asked for information on cases where unfair labor practice charges were filed. The NLRB's decision allows an employer to withdraw recognition of a union after the third year of a longer-term contract. The NLRB's decision allows an employer to withdraw recognition of a union after the third year of a longer-term contract. In January 1999, Shaw's Supermarkets entered into a five-year contract with the UFCW. After three years, a majority of employees signed a petition requesting a decertification election. Instead of going forward with a decertification election, Shaw's withdrew recognition of the union. The action was appealed to the NLRB, where the board disagreed with the General Counsel's argument that Shaw's should not be allowed to withdraw recognition during the term of the contract. The NLRB's decision allows an employer to withdraw recognition of a union after the third year of a longer-term contract. Shaw's Supermarkets entered into a five-year contract with the UFCW in January 1999. A majority of employees signed a petition for decertification after three years, prompting Shaw's to withdraw recognition of the union. The NLRB board, by a vote of 2-1, disagreed with the General Counsel's argument against Shaw's action. The majority members concluded that Shaw's acted properly based on evidence of a loss of majority support for the union. When a union and employer reach an impasse in collective bargaining, a neutral third party can help them reach an agreement. Mediation involves a mediator assisting the parties in defining issues, suggesting solutions, and promoting compromise. Arbitration involves an arbitrator deciding on the resolution of disputes, either in grievance or contract arbitration. Arbitration involves the union and employer presenting their positions to an arbitrator who decides on resolving issues. It can be grievance arbitration for existing collective bargaining agreements or interest arbitration for initial or successor contracts. Interest arbitration can be voluntary or compulsory, conventional or final-offer, and binding or nonbinding. In final-offer arbitration, the arbitrator may choose between complete final offers or final offers on each issue from both sides. Interest arbitration involves using arbitration to resolve a bargaining impasse, with options including conventional arbitration where the arbitrator decides on a final contract agreement, and final-offer arbitration where the arbitrator must choose either the union's or the employer's final offer. The arbitrator may also choose between the complete final offers or final offers on each issue from both sides. Arbitration can be binding or nonbinding, and different forms can be combined, such as voluntary or compulsory conventional arbitration, and binding or nonbinding final-offer arbitration. In binding arbitration, the arbitrator's decision is imposed on both parties, while in nonbinding arbitration, the parties may choose to accept or reject the decision. Different forms of arbitration can be combined, such as voluntary or compulsory conventional arbitration, and binding or nonbinding final-offer arbitration. Med-Arb combines the roles of mediator and arbitrator, where a neutral third party facilitates an agreement and becomes the arbitrator if no settlement is reached. Interest arbitration is mainly used in the public sector where the right to strike is limited, while in the private sector, the legal right to strike can encourage parties to reach a contract agreement. Interest arbitration is commonly used in the private sector to settle bargaining impasses, where the right to strike exists. It can deter strikes or lockouts but may also change negotiating behavior. If a union and employer reach an impasse, they can turn to mediation, arbitration, or resort to strikes or lockouts. The main goal of interest arbitration is to avoid strikes or lockouts, which can lead to economic strikes where workers can be permanently replaced. Interest arbitration is used to resolve contract disputes and avoid strikes or lockouts. It can have adverse effects on negotiations by creating a \"chilling\" effect and a \"narcotic\" effect, leading to extreme positions and reliance on arbitration. Interest arbitration can have adverse effects on negotiations by creating extreme positions and reliance on arbitration. Final-offer arbitration is proposed as a solution to encourage compromise and prevent parties from avoiding serious negotiations. Final-offer arbitration encourages compromise by allowing an arbitrator to choose between the complete final offer of either the union or employer, or between the final offers of each party on each issue. The NLRA does not exempt small businesses, but the NLRB does not certify bargaining units of only one employee. The principle of collective bargaining requires more than one employee to bargain collectively. The NLRB does not certify bargaining units of only one employee and has jurisdiction over employers with operations affecting interstate commerce. Administrative standards based on annual sales or revenue determine NLRB's jurisdiction, such as retail businesses needing at least $500,000 in annual sales. The NLRB establishes jurisdiction based on annual sales or revenue, with specific thresholds for different types of businesses. These standards have been in place since August 1, 1959, as outlined in Section 14(c)(1) of the NLRA. The board may decline jurisdiction over labor disputes if the impact on commerce is not significant enough, but will not do so for disputes falling under the 1959 standards. The NLRB may decline jurisdiction over labor disputes that do not significantly impact commerce, based on standards set since August 1, 1959. Smaller employers not under NLRB jurisdiction can still unionize through other means like voluntary recognition or third-party supervised elections. State agencies or courts are not prevented from intervening in labor disputes by the NLRA. The NLRB may decline jurisdiction over labor disputes not impacting commerce significantly since 1959. Smaller employers can unionize through voluntary recognition or third-party supervised elections. State agencies or courts can intervene in labor disputes despite the NLRA. The Government Accountability Office estimated 5 million small employer employees lack collective bargaining rights under the NLRA due to jurisdictional standards. Adjustments for inflation are not made, potentially affecting current estimates. In recent years, legislation has been proposed to change union certification procedures, with some suggesting certification based on majority employee authorization cards and others advocating for secret ballot selections. These changes could impact unionization levels in the US. Research on different certification procedures' effects on union success rates is reviewed, with supporters and opponents of card check certification using similar arguments. Employers express concerns about potential coercion under card check certification. The section discusses how different union certification procedures, such as card check certification and secret ballot elections, could impact unionization levels in the US. Employers and unions have opposing views on the potential for coercion and access to employees during election campaigns. Unions argue that card check certification is less costly, while employers argue that unionization may be more costly for employees. Research suggests that card check certification may lead to higher union success rates and more unionization drives compared to secret ballot elections. Employers argue that unionization may be costly for employees due to dues and higher wages, potentially resulting in fewer union jobs. Little research directly compares the effects of card check certification versus secret ballots, but evidence from Canada shows higher union success rates with automatic card check recognition. In Canada, union success rates are higher under automatic card check recognition compared to secret ballots. Each province has laws governing union recognition, with some requiring secret ballot elections. Under card check recognition, a union is automatically recognized if a minimum threshold of employees sign authorization cards, typically 50% to 65%. Mandatory voting requires a majority vote in a secret ballot election for union recognition. Studies show a nine percentage point higher union success rate under automatic card check recognition in Canada. The union success rate in Canada is higher under automatic card check recognition compared to secret ballots. A study of 171 union organizing campaigns between 1978 and 1996 in nine provinces showed a nine percentage point increase in union success rate under card check recognition. In British Columbia, union recognition based on card checks was allowed until 1984, then required secret ballot elections until 1992, and card checks were reinstated in 1993. The union success rate dropped by 19 percentage points after mandatory voting was adopted in 1984 but increased when card check recognition was reinstated in 1993. The union success rate in Canada fell almost 19 percentage points after mandatory voting was adopted in 1984 and increased by about the same amount when card check recognition was reinstated in 1993. There were about 50% fewer attempts to organize workers during the period of mandatory voting. After 1993, the number of union organizing drives did not return to pre-1984 levels. In Ontario, card check recognition was allowed before 1995, but secret balloting has been required since November 1995. A study found that the certification rate was higher with card checks, but the union success rate fell from 72.7% to 64.3% under secret balloting. Larger bargaining units were organized under secret balloting compared to card check recognition. The average size of units certified under secret balloting was 63.1 workers, compared to 36.3 employees under card check recognition. Elections are held within five working days after an application. A study on unionization in Canada showed a 0.30 to 0.35 percentage point increase in short-term unemployment for each one percentage point increase in unionization. Evidence suggests card check recognition may be more successful under a neutrality agreement. Union success rates are higher when combining card check and neutrality agreements. Based on union membership data in Canadian provinces from 1976 to 1997, evidence suggests that card check recognition may be more successful under a neutrality agreement. A study in the United States found that combining card check and neutrality agreements resulted in a higher union success rate. Unions had a 78.2% success rate with both agreements, compared to 62.5% with just a card check agreement. Card check recognition may lead to higher success rates due to less employer opposition and lower costs compared to secret ballot elections. Requiring card check recognition for union certification may increase success rates, especially when combined with a neutrality agreement. This approach could reduce employer opposition and costs compared to secret ballot elections. However, the impact on reversing the decline in private sector unionization in the United States is uncertain. Additionally, there may be challenges such as shrinking employment in unionized firms and increased employer opposition during the collection of authorization cards. Despite these challenges, Americans generally support unions according to a Gallup poll from August 2008. Employment in unionized firms and decertifications may offset any increase in union membership due to requiring card check recognition. Requiring card check recognition may also increase employer opposition during the collection of authorization cards. According to polls, Americans generally support unions, with 59% approving and 31% disapproving in August 2008. In March 2009, 53% of Americans favored a law making it easier for labor unions to organize, while 39% opposed it. Another poll showed that 33% agreed Congress should change the law to make it easier for workers to join a union. Sixty-one percent agreed that a secret ballot should be required to determine if workers want to form a union. According to surveys, 61% of respondents agreed that a secret ballot should be required to determine if workers want to form a union. 32% agreed that a union should be formed if a majority of workers sign a card. 57% found it difficult to form a union. Another survey showed that 75% believe a secret ballot election is the most fair way to decide on union membership, while 12% prefer card check recognition. According to surveys, 75% of respondents prefer a secret ballot election as the most fair way for employees to decide on union membership, while 12% prefer card check recognition. The NLRA gives private sector workers the right to organize and bargain collectively, aiming to improve workers' bargaining power. The NLRA grants private sector workers the right to organize and collectively bargain over wages and working conditions. It aims to improve workers' bargaining power and requires employers to negotiate in good faith with a union chosen by the majority of employees. Governments may intervene in labor markets to enhance competition and efficiency, ensuring workers are compensated based on their contribution to output. In competitive labor markets, workers are paid based on their contribution to output. The theory of compensating wage differentials recognizes individual preferences for working conditions. Increasing workers' bargaining power can raise wages and improve benefits, but in competitive markets, it may lead to a misallocation of resources and reduce economic output and consumer satisfaction. In labor markets, unionization can impact wages and employment. However, in competitive labor markets, higher union wages may reduce employment for union workers and lower the relative wages of nonunion workers. It is challenging to determine the competitiveness of labor markets due to various factors such as demographics and technological changes. Governments may intervene in labor markets to reduce earnings. Labor markets can be local, regional, national, or international. Measuring labor market competitiveness is difficult and can change over time due to various factors. Governments may intervene to reduce earnings inequality, with unionization being a means to achieve this. Some economists argue that greater earnings equality during a recession can boost aggregate demand and reduce unemployment. Unions also provide workers with a \"voice\" in the workplace through dispute resolution and grievance procedures. Unions offer workers a way to communicate with management through dispute resolution and formal grievance procedures, potentially improving wages, benefits, and working conditions. The economic impact of card check certification or secret ballot elections depends on policymakers' goals. Collective bargaining may affect resource allocation and economic efficiency based on labor market competitiveness. Requiring card check certification could increase organizing campaigns and union success rates. Requiring card check certification or secret ballot elections can impact unionization rates and economic efficiency based on labor market competitiveness. Card check certification may increase organizing campaigns and union success rates, while secret ballot elections could lower unionization levels. The effects of these changes on economic output, consumer satisfaction, and earnings inequality are uncertain. Requiring secret ballot elections may impact efficiency and earnings inequality, while card check certification could affect unionization rates. Predicting the size of these effects is challenging."
