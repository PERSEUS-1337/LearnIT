    "content": "The renewable electricity PTC is a tax credit for electricity generated using qualified energy resources, sold to an unrelated person. The credit can be claimed for 10 years once a qualifying facility is in service. The maximum credit amount varies by year and technology type. Nonwind facilities may qualify if construction began before January 1, 2018, while wind facilities must begin construction before January 1, 2020. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) applies to renewable energy facilities, with reduced credits for certain facilities. The credit amount decreases based on the year construction begins. The PTC has not been phased out due to electricity market prices not exceeding threshold levels. The corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) has also impacted the ability to claim the PTC in the past. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) has not been phased out as market prices of electricity have not exceeded threshold levels. The corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) previously limited the ability to claim the PTC, but this limitation was eliminated in the 2017 tax revision. Additionally, PTC-eligible taxpayers had the option of claiming the 30% energy investment tax credit (ITC) or an American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) Section 1603 grant in lieu of tax benefits from 2009 to 2017. From 2009 to 2017, PTC-eligible taxpayers could choose the 30% energy investment tax credit (ITC) instead of the PTC. Property placed in service during 2009-2011 had the option of an ARRA Section 1603 grant. Production tax credits are available for Indian coal and refined coal, with specific requirements for eligibility and credit amounts. Indian coal facilities must have been in service before 2009 for credits. The base rate for Indian coal is $2.00 per ton, while refined coal has a base credit amount of $4.375 per ton. Credits are not available for coal produced after 2017. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was first enacted in 1992 as part of the Energy Policy Act of 1992. It has been extended 11 times since 1999. Initially available for wind and closed-loop biomass systems, it was later extended to include poultry waste. The PTC was extended through December 31, 2003, and further extensions were made in subsequent acts. Refined coal facilities must have been placed in service before January 1, 2012, to qualify for credits, with a base credit amount of $4.375 per ton. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) has been extended multiple times since 1999, with additions such as poultry waste as a qualifying technology. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 introduced new qualifying resources like open-loop biomass, geothermal energy, solar energy, small irrigation power, and municipal solid waste. These new resources had a five-year PTC period and reduced credit amounts for some facilities. Additionally, a PTC for refined coal was introduced at a rate of $4.375 per ton. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) has been extended multiple times since 1999, with additions such as poultry waste as a qualifying technology. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 introduced new qualifying resources like open-loop biomass, geothermal energy, solar energy, small irrigation power, and municipal solid waste. These new resources had a five-year PTC period and reduced credit amounts for some facilities. Additionally, a PTC for refined coal was introduced at a rate of $4.375 per ton. The PTC was extended twice during the 109th Congress, with the Energy Policy Act of 2005 extending the PTC for most facilities except solar energy and refined coal for two years, through 2007. Hydropower and Indian coal were added as new qualifying resources, with Indian coal qualifying for a credit over a seven-year period. EPACT05 also extended the credit period from 5 years to 10 years for qualifying facilities placed in service after August 8, 2005. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) has been extended multiple times since 1999, with additions such as poultry waste as a qualifying technology. The PTC was extended for one year through 2008 for most qualifying facilities, excluding solar, refined coal, and Indian coal. The PTC for wind and refined coal was extended through 2009, while other resources like biomass, geothermal energy, and hydropower were extended through 2010. Marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy were added as qualifying resources, along with a new credit for steel industry fuel. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was extended through 2010, with new additions such as marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy qualifying for the credit. A credit for steel industry fuel was introduced at $2.00 per barrel-of-oil equivalent. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extended the PTC for wind through 2012 and for other renewable energy technologies through 2013. Additionally, the Act introduced the Section 1603 grant program, allowing taxpayers to receive a one-time payment from the Treasury in lieu of tax credits. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extended the Production Tax Credit (PTC) for wind through 2012 and for other renewable energy technologies through 2013. It also introduced the Section 1603 grant program, allowing taxpayers to receive a one-time payment from the Treasury in lieu of tax credits. Subsequent legislation extended the PTC for wind through 2013 and changed the credit expiration date to a construction start date for all qualifying technologies. The PTC and Investment Tax Credit (ITC) options were retroactively extended through 2014. The PTC for wind and other qualifying technologies had its expiration date changed to a construction start date. The PTC and ITC options were extended through 2014. The PATH Act of 2015 extended the PTC for nonwind facilities through 2016. The ITC option was also extended through 2016. The PTC for wind was further extended through 2019, with reduced credits for facilities starting construction in 2017. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) for wind was extended through 2019 with reduced credits for facilities starting construction in 2017, 2018, and 2019. The PTC for nonwind technologies and Indian coal was retroactively extended for tax year 2017 but will not be available for facilities starting construction after December 31, 2017. Estimated revenue losses associated with the PTC between 2018 and 2022 are $25.8 billion. Between 2018 and 2022, estimated revenue losses associated with the Production Tax Credit (PTC) are $25.8 billion, with most of the losses attributed to wind energy. Other technologies such as geothermal, biomass, municipal solid waste, and hydropower also contribute to these losses. The tax expenditure estimates by the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) are based on current law and could increase with further extensions of the PTC. Information on PTC claims by corporations is available from the IRS up to the 2013 filing year. The revenue losses associated with production credits for refined coal and Indian coal are $0.1 billion each. JCT's tax expenditure estimates are based on current law and could increase with further extensions of the PTC. In 2013, 230 corporate taxpayers claimed PTCs totaling $2.8 billion, with most credits claimed for renewable electricity production. Taxpayers can carry forward unused credits to offset tax liability in future years, with nearly $1.2 billion in PTCs carried forward from previous tax years in 2010. IRS data on PTC claims show the impact of policy actions on renewable energy tax credit claims. In 2010, taxpayers carried forward nearly $1.2 billion in PTCs from previous tax years. Policy actions in response to the economic downturn affected renewable energy tax credit claims, with a decrease in PTC claims after 2009 due to the availability of Section 1603 grants. These grants, totaling $15.5 billion, were claimed for technologies that would have been PTC-eligible. The economic downturn led to an increase in the amount of PTCs being carried forward, reflecting less net income to offset with tax credits. The economic downturn led to a significant increase in the amount of PTCs being carried forward, reflecting less net income to offset with tax credits. Estimates show that extending various tax credits, including the PTC, would result in reduced federal revenues over the next decade. The PTC was initially enacted in 1992 to promote the development of renewable energy sources. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was enacted in 1992 to promote renewable energy sources. Recent extensions reflect a belief that tax incentives drive investment in wind infrastructure. Further extension may lead to growth, but short-term extensions have limitations. Retroactive extensions provide windfall benefits. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) has driven investment and growth in the wind industry, but short-term extensions have limitations. Research on its impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions is mixed. Government intervention in energy markets is justified by externalities and market failures. The recent extensions of tax credits for wind and solar contribute to reduced emissions, especially when natural gas prices are low. Government intervention in energy markets is justified by externalities and market failures, with pollution creating negative externalities. Tax subsidies for clean energy resources are one policy option, but they may not be the most efficient way to achieve the policy objective as they can encourage energy consumption and offset emissions reductions. Tax subsidies for addressing inefficiencies and market failures in the energy sector may not be the most efficient approach. They reduce energy costs, counter conservation efforts, and favor costly emissions reductions. A direct tax on pollution, like a carbon tax, would be more economically efficient, generating revenue to offset other taxes and achieve environmental goals without favoring specific technologies. A carbon tax could generate revenue to offset other taxes, achieve distributional goals, or reduce the deficit. Tax incentives may not efficiently support renewable energy projects, as they often rely on outside investors for tax benefits. Production-based incentives could lead to more renewable electricity per federal subsidy dollar. The interaction of the Production Tax Credit (PTC) with state Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) policies is also a consideration. Tax incentives that reward production, rather than investment, can increase renewable electricity per federal subsidy dollar. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) interacts with state Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) policies. Options for the PTC include allowing it to expire as scheduled or providing a temporary extension. The PTC expiration date differs for wind projects compared to other technologies. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) for renewable electricity may be extended for nonwind technologies, potentially retroactively for 2018. Options include extending the PTC for all eligible technologies at the same rate and eliminating the phaseout for wind. In 2014, a proposal to eliminate the PTC inflation adjustment factor was introduced, reducing the value of the PTC to 1.5 cents per kWh. Chairman Dave Camp proposed a PTC phaseout in his tax reform proposal, reducing the value of the PTC for renewable electricity to 1.5 cents per kWh. The proposal aimed to raise $9.6 billion in additional federal revenues between 2014 and 2023. President Obama's FY2017 budget suggested a permanent extension of the PTC, making it refundable and adding solar facilities. President Obama's FY2017 budget proposed a permanent extension of the PTC, making it refundable and adding solar facilities. The PTC and ITC would be made permanent, costing $19.8 billion between 2016 and 2026 according to the JCT analysis."
