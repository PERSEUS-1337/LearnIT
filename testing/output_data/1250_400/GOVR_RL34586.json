    "content": "This report focuses on USAID's global health programs for child survival and maternal health from FY2001 to FY2008. UNICEF reported a 60% decrease in under-five mortality since 1960, but still, 26,000 children die each day. The majority of childhood deaths occur before age five, with 37% in the neonatal period, totaling about 4 million annual newborn deaths. The critical number of daily deaths among children under five remains high, with 26,000 deaths each day. Most child deaths occur in developing countries, particularly in Africa. Neonatal infections and five infectious diseases are responsible for nearly 90% of all child deaths. Maternal and child health are crucial indicators of overall health conditions, with Millennium Development Goals aiming for a two-thirds reduction in child and maternal mortality. Supporters use Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to show the link between health and development. MDGs 4 and 5 aim for a two-thirds reduction in child and maternal mortality. Progress in other MDGs like undernourishment (MDG 1) and lack of clean water (MDG 7) affects reaching these goals. UNICEF reports that 62 countries, mostly in Africa, are not progressing towards child survival goals. Maternal health and child survival are interconnected, with over 500,000 women dying annually from pregnancy-related causes. UNICEF found that 62 countries, mostly in Africa, were not progressing towards the Millennium Development Goal on child survival. Maternal health and child survival are linked, with over 500,000 women dying annually from pregnancy-related causes. Maternal mortality rates are significantly higher in developing countries, where access to adequate diets, safe water, and health services during pregnancy and childbirth could prevent most deaths. Undernutrition is linked to 20% of maternal deaths, while obstetric complications cause about 75% of maternal deaths. Maternal mortality is a significant issue, with 75% of deaths caused by obstetric complications. Young mothers under 20 face higher risks, including toxemia, anemia, and delivering low birth weight babies. Adolescents aged 15-19 are at a higher risk of pregnancy-related complications, with 15 million giving birth annually. Girls aged 15-19 are twice as likely to die from childbirth compared to women in their twenties, and those under 15 are five times as likely to die. In Mali, the maternal mortality rate for girls aged 15-19 is 178 per 100,000 live births. Maternal mortality rates vary by age group, with girls aged 15-19 facing higher risks compared to women in their twenties. In Mali, the maternal mortality rate for girls aged 15-19 is 178 per 100,000 live births. Hemorrhage is a significant cause of maternal deaths in Africa and Asia, while regions with fewer skilled health attendants at birth have higher mortality rates. In sub-Saharan Africa, 43% of women give birth with skilled attendants, compared to 99% in industrialized nations. In sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, regions with fewer skilled health attendants at birth have higher maternal mortality rates. UNICEF found that many countries lack the capacity to reduce maternal mortality nationwide, with 80% of priority countries having low health workforce densities. South Africa and Swaziland are the only sub-Saharan African countries meeting the minimum health workforce standard. Access to health workers, immunizations, clean water, mosquito control, and nutritious food are linked to higher child and maternal survival rates. South Africa and Swaziland are the only sub-Saharan African countries meeting the minimum health workforce standard. WHO estimates that there are 57 countries with critical shortages of health care workers, with 36 in Africa. An additional 4.3 million health workers are needed globally, with Africa needing to increase their number of health workers by about 140% to meet the minimum threshold. USAID is leading efforts to improve child survival worldwide. Countries in Africa need to increase their number of health workers by about 140% to meet the minimum threshold of 2.5 health care professionals per 1,000 people. USAID has committed over $6 billion in support of global child survival efforts, with a significant portion allocated to addressing six major health issues causing child deaths. USAID allocates a significant portion of its child survival funds to address health issues like HIV/AIDS, measles, and neonatal complications, which cause 90% of child deaths in developing countries. Undernutrition contributes to half of these deaths, with studies showing that malnourished children are at a higher risk of dying from infectious diseases. Good nutrition improves child survival, health, and cognitive development, while undernutrition impairs these outcomes. Children who are moderately to severely underweight face a significantly higher risk of death, with studies showing that malnourished children are more susceptible to infectious diseases like measles and severe diarrhea. Good nutrition is crucial for child survival, health, and cognitive development, while undernutrition weakens the immune system. USAID's nutrition programs focus on micronutrient supplementation, fortification, and infant and young child feeding to improve children's health. Micronutrient programs funded by USAID aim to enhance the nutritional content of processed foods with vital immune-building micronutrients. Research on biofortified crops is also supported to improve the micronutrient content of basic foods. These programs are integrated with interventions like safe water and hygiene to address malnutrition-related infant and child deaths. USAID emphasizes the importance of exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life to prevent childhood diseases and ensure adequate nutrition. USAID supports exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life to prevent childhood diseases. Introducing foods too early or too late can expose infants to disease. USAID spends $30 million annually on nutrition programs, including Vitamin A, iodine, food fortification, anemia packages, and zinc. UNICEF emphasizes the importance of minimizing indoor pollution, adequate nutrition, exclusive breastfeeding, and Vitamin A and zinc supplements to prevent pneumonia. UNICEF and USAID focus on preventing pneumonia through nutrition programs, immunizations, and access to vaccines. USAID has supported immunizations for millions of children and the treatment of child pneumonia cases. The Integrated Management of Childhood Illness strategy integrates interventions for various childhood illnesses. USAID has been engaged in malaria eradication efforts since the 1950s, with a focus on the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) to increase support for international malaria programs. Malaria affects approximately 40% of the world's population, with most cases and deaths in sub-Saharan Africa. The disease is particularly deadly for children, with at least 1 million infants and children under age five in sub-Saharan Africa dying each year from malaria. USAID has been involved in malaria eradication efforts since the 1950s, focusing on the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) to increase support for international malaria programs. The PMI aims to reduce malaria deaths by 50% in 15 targeted countries by 2010. USAID coordinates all PMI activities in partnership with the CDC. In its first year, PMI reached over 6 million people and within two years, reached over 25 million through activities like indoor residual spraying and distributing insecticide-treated nets. In its first year, PMI reached more than 6 million people and within two years, reached more than 25 million. Activities included indoor residual spraying in 10 PMI countries, distributing insecticide-treated nets, training health workers, and purchasing anti-malarial tablets to reduce the impact of malaria in pregnancy. HIV/AIDS is preventable and treatable, but not curable. Most children who acquired HIV in 2007 got it from their HIV-infected mothers during pregnancy, birth, or breastfeeding. Successful interventions can reduce the risk of mother-to-child HIV transmission to 2%. About 33% of HIV-positive pregnant women in resource-limited countries receive drugs for prevention. Successful interventions can reduce mother-to-child HIV transmission risk to 2%. In resource-limited countries, 33% of HIV-positive pregnant women receive drugs for prevention. Nevirapine, costing $0.29-$0.40 per dose, is commonly used. Early diagnosis and antiretroviral therapy for children are crucial as HIV progresses faster in them. Generic ART for children costs around $260 annually, higher than for adults. Fixed-dosed treatments are effective but pricier for children. In low-income countries, a one-year supply of a standard three-drug regimen for adults costs $148. In 2005, a one-year supply of a standard three-drug regimen for an adult costs an average of $148 in low-income countries, but the regimen for children cost $2,000 per child and $800 for a generic version. The Clinton Foundation negotiated lower prices for pediatric ARTs at $0.16 per day or $60 per year. Cotrimoxazole, used to treat pneumonia, reduces mortality in HIV-positive children by 30% and costs $0.03 per day or $10 per year. Only 10% of children needing the drug receive it. USAID has spent $6 billion on HIV/AIDS interventions since 1986. Cotrimoxazole, a drug used to treat pneumonia, reduces mortality in HIV-positive children by about 30% and costs $0.03 per day or $10 per year. USAID has spent $6 billion on HIV/AIDS interventions since 1986. PEPFAR implementing agencies have provided care and support to 2.7 million orphans and vulnerable children, with food and nutrition programs reaching 332,000 OVC and 50,000 pregnant or lactating women. PEPFAR's child-focus programs provide care and support to over 332,000 orphans and vulnerable children, as well as pregnant or lactating women and severely malnourished individuals on ART. The programs include training for caregivers, promoting technology use, income-generating activities, and connecting families to essential health care. PEPFAR has committed $1.5 billion for HIV/AIDS care and support, with nearly $191.5 million dedicated to pediatric treatment and over 10 million pregnancies supported with PMTCT services. In FY2006 and FY2007, PEPFAR partnerships allocated $191.5 million for pediatric HIV/AIDS treatment, benefiting 85,900 children. PMTCT services supported over 10 million pregnancies, providing ART to HIV-positive women in 827,000 pregnancies and preventing 157,000 infant HIV infections. USAID's anti-diarrhea programs focus on ORS treatment, hygiene promotion, and training health workers, with over $1.5 billion spent on treating child diarrhea since 2002. USAID's anti-diarrhea programs focus on promoting hygiene, including handwashing with soap, which can reduce diarrhea prevalence among children by 42% to 46%. However, handwashing with soap is not common in poorer communities. USAID supports public-private partnerships to promote hygienic practices like safe water storage, which can reduce diarrhea prevalence by 30% to 40%. USAID supports public-private partnerships to promote handwashing with soap and other hygienic practices, which can reduce diarrhea prevalence by 30% to 40%. Measles immunization is a cost-effective intervention, with the vaccine costing less than $1 per dose. The measles vaccine is often combined with rubella and/or mumps vaccines, with bundled doses costing about $0.65 to $1.50 if bought through UNICEF. The combined measles-rubella (MR) or measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is cost-effective, with prices ranging from $0.65 to $1.50 per bundled dose if bought through UNICEF. Immunization coverage rates for measles vaccination have improved, with about 80% of children vaccinated in 2006. Global measles mortality decreased by 68% between 2000 and 2006, with significant gains in Africa where cases and deaths fell by 91%. USAID supports immunization programs as one of its greatest public health success stories. A significant reduction in global measles deaths occurred between 2000 and 2006, with a 68% decrease in mortality. The largest gains were seen in Africa, where measles cases and deaths fell by 91%. USAID supports immunization programs by training health workers, strengthening planning capacity, and improving service delivery in over 100 countries. They also partner with organizations like GAVI, the Vaccine Fund, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to enhance countries' vaccine administration capacity. Additionally, USAID's maternal health programs aim to ensure healthy pregnancy outcomes in low-resource settings through various interventions. USAID implements various interventions in low-resource environments to address key causes of maternal mortality, including nutritional supplementation, treatment for parasitic worms, immunizations, prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission, and detection and treatment of syphilis. They advocate for skilled birth attendants at all births and encourage communities to develop emergency obstetric care plans. USAID trains birth attendants to prevent infant deaths and provides community-based maternal health interventions to recognize birth complications and access emergency care. USAID addresses key causes of maternal mortality by implementing interventions such as training birth attendants to manage postpartum hemorrhage and prevent infections, which can prevent a significant percentage of maternal deaths. They also emphasize the importance of skilled birth attendants and emergency obstetric care plans in low-resource environments. Training birth attendants to actively manage the third stage of labor, including controlled traction of the umbilical cord, uterine massage, and the use of oxytocin, can prevent 60% of hemorrhages according to USAID. Sepsis or infections cause nearly 10% of maternal deaths in various regions, with unhygienic delivery practices identified as a key factor. USAID supports efforts to prevent sepsis by distributing delivery kits, ensuring trained attendants are present at each birth, and educating on infection identification and treatment. USAID trains health care providers to recognize and treat complications during childbirth, such as hypertensive disorders, prolonged or obstructed labor, and obstetric fistula. These efforts aim to prevent maternal and infant deaths and long-term disabilities in low-resource settings. Obstetric fistula is a common consequence of prolonged or obstructed labor in low-resource settings, especially among young girls and women who were stunted due to undernourishment. Delaying pregnancy until the girl's pelvic region is fully developed, ensuring access to emergency obstetric care, and performing caesarean surgery when needed can prevent obstetric fistula. USAID has supported fistula prevention and repair programs since 1989 and 2005, respectively, integrating them with other maternal health initiatives to increase access to emergency obstetrical care. USAID has been supporting fistula prevention programs since 1989 and repair programs since 2005. Key activities include increasing access to emergency obstetrical care, training families and community health practitioners to identify labor complications, and reducing stigma about obstetric fistula. Complications from unsafe abortions account for 13% of maternal deaths worldwide, with regional variations. USAID's international family planning programs have helped avert an estimated 4 million maternal deaths over the last 20 years. In Latin America and the Caribbean, unsafe abortions contribute to 12% of maternal deaths, while in Africa, it accounts for about 4% of deaths. USAID's global health programs have helped prevent an estimated 4 million maternal deaths in the last 20 years. Funding for USAID's CS/MH programs increased by 8% from FY2001 to FY2003, with significant growth in appropriations for HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases. Congress also showed strong support for the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria during this time period. During FY2004 through FY2008, OID funds were mainly directed to tuberculosis and malaria programs, with increased support for the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. Congress questioned the Administration's focus on HIV/AIDS over other global health interventions, urging better integration of HIV/AIDS with TB and nutrition programs. Appropriations for HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs far exceeded support for other USAID health programs. Congress has consistently increased funding for global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs, surpassing support for other USAID health initiatives. From FY2004 to FY2008, $19.7 billion was allocated to these specific diseases, compared to $4.6 billion for child survival, maternal health, and family planning programs. The Administration was urged to consider recipient countries' capacity to handle the growing funds due to strained health infrastructures. Additionally, Congress emphasized the need for better integration of HIV/AIDS with TB and nutrition programs. The U.S. Congress has increased funding for specific disease programs like HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria, with initiatives such as PEPFAR and the President's Malaria Initiative. However, concerns remain about the lack of funding for other health issues, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where preventable child deaths are high. Critics argue that more focus and funding should be directed towards child survival and maternal health programs. The World Health Organization highlights the preventable nature of two-thirds of child deaths, emphasizing the need for increased funding for comprehensive maternal and child health programs. Advocates urge Congress to consider supporting voluntary family planning to improve maternal and child health outcomes, citing benefits such as reducing high-risk pregnancies, preventing HIV/AIDS, and stabilizing population growth. Opposition to funding family planning arises from concerns about potential coercive practices and abortions in some programs. Family planning can help improve the health outcomes of adolescent girls, reducing the risk of complications during pregnancy and childbirth. Young girls are at a higher risk of delivering low-birthweight babies and experiencing pregnancy-related complications. Delaying pregnancy until the girl's pelvic region is fully developed can prevent obstetric fistula, a condition that can be fatal if not treated promptly. In Kenya, a significant percentage of fistula cases occur among adolescents. Young girls, especially those in their teens, are at a higher risk of obstetric fistula, with 45% of cases in Kenya occurring among adolescents. Preventing fistula involves delaying pregnancy until the girl's pelvic region is fully developed and providing necessary medical interventions. However, the cost of treatment, around $300, is often prohibitive for young girls in affected countries. Advocates suggest increasing spending on health systems to address maternal and child mortality by improving access to essential interventions and strengthening healthcare infrastructure. Without donor support, many countries struggle to deliver necessary healthcare services. Improvements in health systems and availability of health workers are crucial for providing essential interventions like vaccinations to reduce mortality nationwide. Supporters urge Congress to direct USAID to coordinate health assistance with other donors and health ministries for better efficiency. The International Health Partnership and related Initiatives (IHP+) aim to improve health outcomes in developing countries by creating compacts with countries for long-term financing from national and international sources. The International Health Partnership (IHP+) aims to improve health outcomes in developing countries by creating compacts with countries for long-term financing from national and international sources. These compacts involve donors and governments committing to support one results-oriented national health plan in a harmonized way, ensuring predictable financing. Critics highlight the importance of political will in increasing health spending in developing countries. Global health experts emphasize the role of recipient governments in improving health systems. Critics argue that political will influences minimal health spending in developing countries. According to the IMF, lack of political will is a major reason for unspent health funds. African countries with health worker shortages spend $33 per person annually, while the US spends $2,548 per capita. African leaders pledged to increase health spending, with the Abuja Declaration calling for at least 15% of national budgets to be allocated to healthcare. African countries pledged to increase health spending with the Abuja Declaration, aiming for at least 15% of national budgets to be allocated to healthcare. By 2004, 33% of AU States allocated 10% or more to health, while 38% spent between 5% and 10%, and 29% allocated less than 5%. Critics argue that structural adjustment programs and lending practices limit African governments' ability to invest in public health and health worker education. Opponents argue that structural adjustment programs and conditional lending practices have hindered African governments' ability to increase investments in public health and health worker education, leading to shrunken health budgets and a decline in the quality of education and training opportunities for medical students. This has resulted in a perpetual shortage of health supplies and equipment, insufficient medicine and vaccine stocks, and a brain drain of African health workers. The International Development Research Center suggests that discussions on the impact of these practices on public health infrastructures are often biased, with mixed results observed. The International Development Research Center found biased terminology in discussions on the impact of structural adjustment programs and conditional lending practices on public health. Results of these practices were mixed, with no clear support for either side. Bills introduced in the 110th Congress aimed to improve maternal and child health, including increased funding and requirements for maternal and child services in international HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria interventions. The Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 authorizes funding for international HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria interventions, with a focus on providing maternal and child services. The House version emphasizes linkages to NGOs for multi-sectoral approaches, while the Senate version does not mention family planning. Additionally, the Global Poverty Act of 2007 requires the President to develop a strategy to reduce global poverty. The Global Poverty Act of 2007, represented by H.R. 1302 and S. 2433, aims to reduce global poverty and achieve the Millennium Development Goal of reducing extreme poverty. It includes provisions for improving maternal and child health. Additionally, the U.S. Commitment to Global Child Survival Act of 2007, H.R. 2266 and S. 1418, provides assistance for the health of newborns, children, and mothers in developing countries. The Focus on Family Health Worldwide Act of 2007, H.R. 1225, seeks to improve family health globally. The House and Senate versions of various bills aim to improve family health globally by providing assistance for newborns, children, and mothers in developing countries. Bills such as H.R. 1225, H.R. 2114, and H.R. 2604 focus on voluntary family planning programs, prevention of obstetric fistula, and support for women's health initiatives. The Women's Health and Dignity Act provides support to the United Nations Population Fund for activities to save women's lives, promote family planning, and improve lives in developing countries. Other bills like the International Child Marriage Prevention Act and United Nations Population Fund Restoration Act aim to reduce child marriage and support maternal and child health. Additionally, the Global Security Priorities Resolution calls for reducing nuclear weapons and preventing their proliferation. The Global Security Priorities Resolution, H.Res. 1045, calls for reducing nuclear weapons and preventing proliferation to enhance global security. It estimates significant savings from arms reduction, directing a portion towards child survival, hunger, and education. H.Res. 1022 affirms commitment to maternal health and child survival through international investment."
