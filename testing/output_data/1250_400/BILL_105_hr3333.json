The proliferation of nuclear weapons is a major threat post-Cold War. The UN Security Council recognizes the threat of weapons of mass destruction. Regional nuclear arms races increase the risk of nuclear weapon use. The United Nations Special Commission on Iraq was an important precedent for addressing nuclear proliferation. Aside from the 5 declared nuclear weapon states, other nations are pursuing nuclear weapons capabilities. Regional nuclear arms races increase the likelihood of nuclear weapon use. Concerns about Russia's ability to secure its nuclear materials have raised the threat of nuclear proliferation. Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as non-nuclear weapon states. Iraq had a clandestine nuclear weapons program undetected by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Iraq, North Korea, Brazil, Argentina, and South Africa had substantial nuclear weapons programs. North Korea signed an agreement with the United States in 1994 to exchange existing nuclear reactors for modern technology. Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as non-nuclear weapon states. Dual-use exports from western countries, including the United States, assisted Iraq's clandestine nuclear weapons program. North Korea, Brazil, Argentina, and South Africa had nuclear weapons programs. However, all three countries renounced nuclear weapons and accepted IAEA safeguards. The United States supports nuclear weapons free zones in various regions to prevent conflicts and arms races. The United States supports nuclear weapons free zones in different regions to prevent conflicts and arms races. The IAEA is crucial in countering proliferation but faces challenges due to institutional and financial constraints. The US advocates for immobilizing plutonium for energy and mixing it with low-enriched uranium for commercial nuclear reactors, while also addressing storage and disposal challenges. The United States supports nuclear weapons free zones in different regions to prevent conflicts and arms races. Plutonium from dismantled warheads poses storage and disposal challenges and could be converted into fuel for nuclear warheads if in the wrong hands. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty has been extended indefinitely, and the US is committed to strengthening the international nonproliferation regime. The goal is to prevent the further spread of nuclear weapons capability. The United States aims to establish more effective controls over the transfer of nuclear equipment, materials, and technology to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons capability and proliferation. The goal is to end the further spread of nuclear weapons capability, roll back proliferation, and prevent the use of nuclear weapons worldwide through a comprehensive nonproliferation policy. The United States aims to establish more effective controls over the transfer of nuclear equipment, materials, and technology to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons capability and proliferation through a comprehensive nonproliferation policy. The United States aims to establish controls over nuclear proliferation by pursuing objectives such as placing fissile materials under international controls, ratifying the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, ending production of new nuclear warheads, reducing strategic nuclear arsenals, and enforcing multilateral agreements for nuclear disarmament. The United States and the Russian Federation aim to reduce their nuclear arsenals to 2,000-2,500 warheads each, with lower levels for the UK, France, and China. Additional multilateral agreements are sought to reduce nuclear arsenals globally. Immediate agreements with Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty states are sought to halt fissile material production, place existing stockpiles under controls, and ensure nuclear facilities are safeguarded by the IAEA. Strengthening IAEA safeguards is also a priority to verify nonproliferation compliance. To strengthen nonproliferation efforts, countries must place nuclear facilities under IAEA safeguards, enhance IAEA verification, improve export controls, impose sanctions on proliferators, reduce regional tensions, and enhance security agreements. To further strengthen nonproliferation efforts, the United States aims to reduce incentives for countries to acquire nuclear weapons, increase the role of the United Nations Security Council in enforcing nonproliferation agreements, adopt a \"no first use\" policy with other nuclear weapon states, and negotiate with Russia to dismantle tactical nuclear weapons. The United States aims to reduce incentives for countries to acquire nuclear weapons, increase the role of the United Nations Security Council in enforcing nonproliferation agreements, adopt a \"no first use\" policy with other nuclear weapon states, and negotiate with Russia to dismantle tactical nuclear weapons. Additionally, they plan to conclude bilateral agreements with Russia to withdraw and dismantle all tactical nuclear weapons, ratify nuclear-free zone treaties, monitor North Korea's nuclear activities, and begin negotiations on START III. The President must report to Congress every year on the actions taken to implement the policy objectives outlined in the Act, including efforts by other countries and obstacles encountered. Reports must be unclassified, with a classified appendix if needed. Definitions are provided in Section 5. The Act defines key terms such as \"fissile materials,\" \"highly enriched uranium,\" \"IAEA,\" \"IAEA safeguards,\" \"no first use,\" \"non-nuclear weapon state,\" \"Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty,\" and \"nuclear weapon state.\" The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty was signed in 1968 in Washington, London, and Moscow. It defines terms like \"nuclear weapon state,\" \"START I treaty,\" \"START II treaty,\" and \"START III treaty.\" START I was signed in 1991, START II in 1993, and START III was discussed in 1997 between President Clinton and President Yeltsin."
