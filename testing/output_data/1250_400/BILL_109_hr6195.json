The Congress recognizes the National Science Foundation's role in enhancing the nation's information infrastructure and the need for expertise in information collection and processing. Basic research and curriculum development are essential for industry to leverage advanced technology. Information management is crucial for sectors like biology, with a projected 49% growth by 2010. There is a lack of a systematic plan for transitioning the workforce to the information age. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Director\" refers to the Director of the National Science Foundation. \"Information\" pertains to data in sectors where the government has a significant role and is transitioning to digital data use. \"Institution of higher education\" is defined as per the Higher Education Act of 1965. The Director, in consultation with other Federal agencies, awards grants for research on innovative approaches to improve information systems, including information studies, population informatics, translational informatics, and data security. Grants are merit-reviewed and competitive, with authorized appropriations of $3.5-3.8 million annually. Additionally, the Director awards Informatics Research Centers in collaboration with other agencies. The Director awards multiyear grants to institutions of higher education to establish Centers for Informatics Research, partnering with government, for-profit, or nonprofit institutions. Grants are merit-reviewed and competitive, with annual appropriations of $3.6-3.8 million for fiscal years 2009-2011. The Centers aim to conduct cutting-edge, multidisciplinary research in innovative information approaches. The Centers for Informatics Research are awarded grants on a competitive basis to conduct innovative, multidisciplinary research in information technology. Institutions of higher education must submit applications detailing research projects and promoting collaboration among professionals from various disciplines. The Center for Informatics Research awards grants for innovative, multidisciplinary research in information technology. Applications are evaluated based on the ability to generate innovative approaches, experience in the information field, and fostering multidisciplinary collaboration. The Director convenes an annual meeting of the Centers to foster collaboration and communication between participants. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the Centers. The Director convenes an annual meeting of the Centers to promote collaboration and communication among participants. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the National Science Foundation for fiscal years 2008 to 2011. SEC. 5. NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION INFORMATION PROGRAMS. The Director, in consultation with other Federal agencies, will establish a program to award grants to institutions of higher education to improve undergraduate and master's degree information programs, increase student enrollment in information fields, provide industry experience, and utilize distance learning. Grants will be awarded based on merit and used to enhance information education quality, certification programs, and student recruitment. Activities funded by grants shall enhance higher education institutions' ability to provide quality information education, including curriculum development, degree programs, research opportunities, equipment acquisition, and faculty collaborations with various entities. The curr_chunk focuses on enhancing information education programs through various activities such as installing testbed networks, collaborating with government agencies and industry, establishing internships, creating bridge programs between colleges and universities, and other activities determined by the Director. The curr_chunk discusses the selection process for institutions of higher education seeking funding under the program, requiring them to submit an application detailing their research and instructional capacity. The curr_chunk outlines the requirements for applicants seeking funding under the program, including a description of research and instructional capacity, a plan to build instructional capacity, collaborations with government or industry, student enrollment and placement data, and a plan for evaluating program success. The Director will ensure grants are awarded in diverse geographic areas and institutions of higher education. A program evaluation will be conducted within 3 years of its establishment. The Director will evaluate the program established under this subsection within 3 years of its establishment to assess the grants' impact on increasing the quality and quantity of students pursuing undergraduate or master's degrees in information fields. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2008 to 2011. The National Science Foundation will provide grants under the Scientific and Advanced Technology Act of 1992 to improve education in information-related fields. Authorized appropriations for fiscal years 2008 to 2011 are $7,000,000 for 2008, $7,200,000 for 2009, $7,400,000 for 2010, and $7,600,000 for 2011. The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology will report to Congress on efforts related to informatics, including standards harmonization and support for digitization. The report will include timetables for information standards, challenges in promulgation, ensuring usability for scientists, and actions to ensure robust and timely standards."
