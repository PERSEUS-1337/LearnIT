    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Federal Reserve Credit Facility Review Act of 2009\". It includes findings related to the Act. The Congress found that in August 2007, liquidity dried up in credit and securities markets, initially affecting financial firms with interests in mortgage-backed securities. This lack of credit access spread globally, leading the Federal Reserve to establish a target range of 0% to 0.25% in response to the crisis. The Board of Governors acknowledged the severity of the situation and acted under \"unusual and exigent circumstances\". The Federal Reserve has exercised its authority to address \"unusual and exigent circumstances\" multiple times since the financial crisis began in 2007, extending assistance to nonmember institutions for the first time since 1959. The Federal Reserve extended assistance to nonmember institutions for the first time since 1959 and purchased debt obligations from government-sponsored enterprises for the first time since 1981. Additionally, joint programs were established with the Department of the Treasury to aid financial markets during the crisis, including guaranteeing assets of Citigroup and Bank of America. Chairman Ben Bernanke affirmed transparency commitment in 2009. SEC. 3. REVIEWS OF SPECIAL FEDERAL RESERVE CREDIT FACILITIES.
