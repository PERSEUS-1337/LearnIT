Payments under this section for a demonstration project will be made periodically from Medicare trust funds, with an annual limit of $50,000,000. Payment amounts may be reduced if the Department of Veterans Affairs fails to maintain effort to avoid shifting costs onto the Medicare program. The Medicare program covers costs for hospital care and medical services for targeted Medicare-eligible veterans. Payment amounts for projects may be reduced if VA medical expenditures for targeted veterans are less than the maintenance of effort level. Maintenance of effort levels are determined based on previous fiscal year expenditures. The maintenance of effort level for VA medical expenditures for targeted veterans is adjusted based on the percentage increase or decrease in the medical care appropriation for the Department of Veterans Affairs compared to the previous fiscal year. Additionally, any decrease in VA medical expenditures for targeted veterans relative to the preceding fiscal year is also taken into account. The VA adjusts its medical care appropriations for targeted veterans based on changes in health care costs and service delivery priorities. VA medical expenditures for targeted veterans are defined as the amount spent by the Department in a fiscal year. The plan developed under Public Law 104-204 defines VA medical expenditures for targeted veterans as the amount spent by the Department of Veterans Affairs in a fiscal year for hospital care and medical services under chapter 17 of title 38, United States Code. This amount excludes expenditures for medical examinations for claims adjudication and services reimbursed under a demonstration project. The Secretaries, in consultation with the Comptroller General, closely monitor the impact on costs to the Medicare program.

The Comptroller General audits the costs of the Secretary of Health and Human Services under the Medicare program annually and submits a report to Congress.

The entity will submit a report to the Secretaries and Congress by March 1 each year, assessing the cost of care, quality compliance, and cost comparisons of participating facilities.

The Secretaries will submit a report to Congress within six months after the final report on whether to extend or make permanent the health services demonstration project for targeted Medicare-eligible veterans. They will also recommend expanding the project to cover more sites, increase reimbursement amounts, and consider modifying project terms if extended. Additionally, a report on establishing a new demonstration project to reimburse the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for health care services will be submitted by March 1, 1999. The Secretaries will submit a report to Congress on the feasibility of establishing a new demonstration project to reimburse the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for health care services provided to targeted Medicare-eligible veterans in managed health-care plans.
