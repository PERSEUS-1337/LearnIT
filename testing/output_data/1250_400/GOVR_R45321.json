    "content": "The Trump Administration requested $76.2 billion for the Department of Transportation (DOT) for FY2019, proposing significant cuts in funding for various programs. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $87.8 billion for DOT, while the Senate passed a bill providing $86.6 billion. The Senate passed H.R. 6147 on August 1, 2018, which includes the FY2019 THUD appropriations bill providing $86.6 billion in new budget authority for the Department of Transportation (DOT). This amount is slightly above the FY2018 level and significantly higher than the Administration's request. Most of DOT's funding comes from mandatory budget authority from trust funds, with only a portion being discretionary funding. The Department of Transportation (DOT) receives most of its funding from mandatory budget authority derived from trust funds, with only a portion being discretionary funding. Two large trust funds, the Highway Trust Fund and the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, typically provide around 90% of DOT's annual funding. Approximately 80% of DOT's funding is distributed to states, local authorities, and Amtrak in the form of grants. The Department of Transportation (DOT) receives most of its funding from trust funds, with the majority being distributed as grants to states, local authorities, and Amtrak. The Federal Aviation Administration, responsible for air traffic control, has a budget primarily focused on operations. Reauthorizations of taxes supporting trust funds and budget authority apportionment are crucial for DOT funding. Highway, transit, and rail programs are authorized through FY2020, while federal aviation programs face reauthorization in 2018, impacting structure and funding levels. The Department of Transportation (DOT) receives funding from trust funds, with grants distributed to states, local authorities, and Amtrak. Reauthorizations of taxes supporting trust funds are crucial for funding. Highway, transit, and rail programs are authorized through FY2020, while federal aviation programs face reauthorization in 2018. DOT's nonemergency annual funding has increased from $70 billion in FY2012 to $86 billion in FY2018 in nominal dollars, but inflation-adjusted funding peaked in FY2010 at $87.5 billion. Highway Trust Fund provides most federal highway and transit funding, largely from the gas tax. In FY2019, DOT funding was lower compared to FY2018, with a shortfall in the Highway Trust Fund due to stagnant federal gas tax rates since 1993. Congress transferred $143 billion to the fund from FY2008-FY2016 to maintain solvency. The fund receives fixed amounts per gallon of fuel sold, leading to a diminished value of the gas tax due to inflation. The federal gas tax has not been raised since 1993, leading to a shortfall in the Highway Trust Fund. The tax is a fixed amount per gallon of fuel sold, resulting in reduced revenue due to inflation and increased fuel efficiency. The Congressional Budget Office predicts stagnant gasoline consumption through 2024, with revenues falling short of projected expenditures. Congress allocated $1.5 billion for infrastructure grants in FY2018. The Highway Trust Fund is expected to have revenues of $39-41 billion annually from FY2018 to FY2027, falling short of projected expenditures. Congress allocated $1.5 billion for infrastructure grants in FY2018, known as BUILD Transportation grants. The Senate Committee on Appropriations directed the Department of Transportation to use selection criteria from the FY2016 grant process, prohibiting the use of an applicant's willingness to create new nonfederal revenue sources as a criterion. The TIGER grant program, originating from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, aims to address criticisms of federal transportation funding structure. It aims to fund projects with national or regional impacts and promote competition between different modes of transportation for funding. The Senate Committee on Appropriations directed the Department of Transportation to use selection criteria from the FY2016 grant process, prohibiting the use of an applicant's willingness to create new nonfederal revenue sources as a criterion. The BUILD program provides grants for projects of national, regional, or metropolitan significance in various transportation modes on a competitive basis. The program aims to address challenges in federal transportation funding structure, such as projects with costs falling on one or two states and funding divided by mode, making it difficult for projects to compete based on comparative benefit. An example is Amtrak's Gateway Program, focused on the Northeast Corridor rail line around the New York/New Jersey border, including the replacement of a deteriorating tunnel under the Hudson River. The BUILD program provides grants for projects of national, regional, or metropolitan significance in various transportation modes on a competitive basis. Congress has directed that funds be distributed equitably across geographic areas, between rural and urban areas, and among transportation modes. The program is heavily oversubscribed, with critics arguing that grants disproportionately go to urban areas. The BUILD/TIGER program, heavily oversubscribed, receives applications exceeding available funding. Congress has directed that a portion of funding should go to rural areas, with the percentage increasing over the years. In FY2019, the House Appropriations Committee recommends 33% for rural projects and prioritizes bridge projects in rural areas. Another 33% is designated for projects around major seaports, and the remaining 33% for urban areas over 200,000 in population. The House report directs that 33% of recommended funding for the BUILD/TIGER grant should go to projects in and around major seaports, with another 33% for projects in urban areas over 200,000 in population. The appropriation process has followed a pattern in recent years where the Obama Administration requests more funding, the House proposes cuts, the Senate proposes a similar amount to previous appropriations, and Congress agrees on a final amount. The Essential Air Service program is funded through a combination of mandatory and discretionary budget authority, with a mandatory annual authorization estimated at $140 million for FY2019. The Essential Air Service (EAS) program is funded through a combination of mandatory and discretionary budget authority, with a mandatory annual authorization estimated at $140 million for FY2019. The Trump Administration requested $93 million in discretionary funding for the EAS program in FY2019, while the House committee bill recommended $175 million. The Senate-passed bill also recommends $175 million in discretionary funding, which combined with the estimated mandatory funding would result in a 10% increase over the FY2018 total funding level. The EAS program is funded through a combination of mandatory and discretionary budget authority, with a recommended $175 million discretionary appropriation in FY2019. The program aims to preserve commercial air service to small communities by subsidizing unprofitable routes. Changes made in 2012 include capping the per-passenger subsidy and limiting subsidies for communities less than 210 miles from a hub airport. The program's cost has doubled since FY2008 due to route reductions and new communities being added. The EAS program aims to preserve airline service to small communities by subsidizing unprofitable routes. Supporters argue that it promotes economic development in rural areas, while critics point out high subsidy costs and proximity of some airports to major hubs. In 2008, Congress mandated the installation of positive train control (PTC) on certain rail segments to prevent incidents caused by operator error. In 2008, Congress mandated railroads to install positive train control (PTC) to prevent incidents caused by operator error. Despite billions spent by freight railroads, most required tracks were not compliant by the end of 2015. Congress extended the deadline to 2018, with an option for further extension to 2020. Funding has been provided by Congress in recent years, but the Trump Administration's FY2019 budget did not include any funding for PTC implementation. The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget did not include funding for PTC implementation. The House-reported bill allocated $150 million for PTC projects, while the Senate-passed bill did not specify an amount but directed DOT to prioritize PTC projects. The Passenger Rail Reform and Investment Act of 2015 restructured Amtrak's federal grants and authorized new programs for intercity passenger rail development. The Administration's FY2019 budget requested a total of $738 million for rail projects. The Passenger Rail Reform and Investment Act of 2015 authorized new programs for intercity passenger rail development, including grants for rail carriers. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $1.9 billion for Amtrak and funding for new grant programs, while the Senate bill proposed $1.9 billion for Amtrak and directed prioritization of Positive Train Control projects. Congress has historically provided little funding for intercity rail. The Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvement program allocated funds for PTC implementation projects, with Congress providing $1.9 billion for Amtrak and $565 million for new grant programs. Funding for intercity passenger rail development has been limited historically, with sporadic appropriations such as $10.5 billion in FY2009 and FY2010 for high-speed rail. In FY2017, Congress allocated $98 million for new intercity passenger rail grant programs, increasing to $863 million in FY2018. The Federal Transit Administration primarily distributes its $13 billion funding to state and local transit agencies through formula-based programs. In FY2017, Congress provided $98 million for new intercity passenger rail grant programs, increasing to $863 million in FY2018. The Federal Transit Administration's funding of roughly $13 billion is mainly distributed to state and local transit agencies through formula-based programs. The Capital Investment Grants program (CIG) is the largest discretionary transit grant program, funding new fixed-guideway transit lines and extensions. The Capital Investment Grants program (CIG) provides funding for various types of transit projects based on their total costs and federal funding needs. There are different categories such as New Starts, Small Starts, and Core Capacity grants, as well as an Expedited Project Delivery Pilot for eligible projects. The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget requested $1.0 billion for CIG, a decrease from the previous year. Funding for large projects is typically disbursed over several years, with a focus on projects with existing grant agreements. The Trump Administration requested $1.0 billion for Capital Investment Grants in FY2019, a decrease from the previous year. Congress expressed concern over the Administration's stance on the CIG program, which prioritizes funding for projects with existing grant agreements and does not support new transit projects. The Trump Administration has taken the position that state and local governments should fund transit projects without federal assistance. However, Congress has not supported this proposal and has provided more funding than requested for the CIG program in both FY2018 and FY2019. The Senate Appropriations Committee report also highlighted FTA's failure to comply with congressional directives for the CIG program. The Senate Appropriations Committee report criticizes FTA for not complying with congressional directives for the CIG program and causing unnecessary delays in transit project development. Transportation for America alleges that FTA is deliberately prolonging the review process for projects, resulting in sponsors facing increased challenges. The FTA has only issued $533 million out of $2.3 billion provided by Congress for new transit projects, causing delays and increased costs for project sponsors. There are concerns about the lengthened review process and the lowering of the federal share for New Starts projects. In the FY2018 DOT appropriations act, the federal share for New Starts projects was lowered to 51%. The House-reported FY2019 bill includes a provision capping the federal share at 50%, while the Senate-passed bill does not have this provision. Critics argue that the higher federal share for highway projects makes them more attractive than public transportation projects. Advocates believe that requiring a higher local match for New Starts funding allows FTA to support more projects and encourages careful cost estimation. The challenges of funding transportation infrastructure include the difficulty of accumulating significant federal funding for projects involving multiple modes. Most federal transportation funding is distributed by mode, making it hard for states to accumulate funds for major projects like Amtrak's Gateway Program. This program aims to increase capacity and reliability, with one highlighted project being the Hudson Tunnel replacement. The Gateway Program, including the Hudson Tunnel replacement project, aims to increase rail capacity between northern New Jersey and Manhattan. The program involves replacing bridges, expanding track capacity, and adding a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River. The estimated cost is at least $24 billion, with the new tunnel alone costing $11.1 billion. Funding challenges arise due to the distribution of federal funds by mode, making it difficult for states to accumulate the necessary funds for major projects. The estimated cost of the Gateway Program, including the new Hudson River Tunnel, is at least $24 billion. Funding for intercity rail projects has been limited, with the largest rail grant program in FY2017 funded at $68 million. The Capital Investment Grants program has more funding available, with $2.6 billion in FY2018, but competition for funding is intense. In 2016, an agreement was reached between DOT, Amtrak, and the States of New Jersey and New York to share the costs of building the new tunnel. The Gateway Program, including the new Hudson River Tunnel, requires at least $24 billion in funding. The Trump Administration does not feel bound by a previous agreement to share costs, leaving it up to Congress to provide the money. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees did not mention the Gateway Program in their FY2019 reports, but recommended significant funding for rail and transit grant programs. The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 authorized grants for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended significant funding for rail and transit grant programs, including $240 million more for Amtrak's Northeast Corridor account than requested for FY2019. The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 authorized grants for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) for preventive maintenance and capital projects, with additional funding from DC, Maryland, and Virginia. The FY2018 grant was the final installment of a $1.5 billion commitment made in 2008, but WMATA's budget assumed continued annual funding. The Administration requested $120 million for FY2019, the House recommended $150 million, and the Senate-passed bill would provide $150 million. The Administration requested $120 million for the WMATA grant for FY2019, with the House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommending $150 million each. WMATA is facing maintenance backlog and safety concerns, leading to FTA restrictions on federal funds and oversight of safety compliance practices. Several incidents have raised concerns about WMATA's safety culture, leading to FTA restrictions on federal funds and oversight of safety practices. FTA assumed control of safety compliance from the Tri-State Oversight Committee in 2015 and continues to monitor WMATA's safety, withholding funds until a new safety oversight agency is operational. FTA is withholding FY2017 transit Urbanized Area formula funds until a new State Safety Oversight Program, the Metrorail Safety Commission, is operational. The National Transportation Safety Board recommends FRA oversee WMATA's rail operations, but Congress would need to grant FRA authority."
