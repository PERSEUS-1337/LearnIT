    "content": "The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" may be cited as the short title. It includes a requirement for cellulosic biofuel. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" requires the provision of estimates for cellulosic biofuel production volumes. The Administrator of the Energy Information Administration is responsible for determining these estimates for the following calendar year. The Energy Information Administration is responsible for providing estimates for cellulosic biofuel production volumes for the upcoming calendar year, specifically for facilities producing cellulosic biofuel from January 1 to October 31 of the current calendar year. The Energy Information Administration determines the average monthly volume of cellulosic biofuel produced by facilities based on actual production during a specific period. The Energy Information Administration determines the estimated annualized volume of cellulosic biofuel production for facilities based on actual production, including those that start production after January 1 of the current year. The Energy Information Administration determines the average monthly volume of cellulosic biofuel produced by a facility based on actual production from initial production to October 31 of the current year. The Energy Information Administration determines the estimated annualized volume of cellulosic biofuel production for a facility based on the average monthly production up to October 31 of the current year. The Energy Information Administration determines the estimated annual volume of cellulosic biofuel production for facilities based on monthly production up to October 31 of the current year. This estimation is used to calculate the total production of cellulosic biofuel for the following calendar year. Amendments to the Clean Air Act specify the exact method for determining the applicable volume and mandate a reduction in the volume if necessary. Amendments to the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(7)(D)(i)) specify changes to the definition of cellulosic biofuel, including using the exact method for calculation and excluding certain sources like compressed natural gas. The regulation addresses the production of natural gas, liquefied natural gas, or electricity for electric vehicles from biogas sources like landfills, wastewater treatment facilities, agricultural digesters, and municipal solid waste digesters. It conflicts with provisions related to cellulosic biofuel pathways under the renewable fuel standard. The regulation addresses the production of natural gas, liquefied natural gas, or electricity for electric vehicles from biogas sources like landfills, wastewater treatment facilities, agricultural digesters, and municipal solid waste digesters. It conflicts with provisions related to cellulosic biofuel pathways under the renewable fuel standard. Technical amendments to the RFS standards and E15 misfueling mitigation requirements are discussed, with a mandate to reissue rules to conform to amendments made. The applicable volume of cellulosic biofuel for calendar year 2014 is to be struck."
