    "content": "The child nutrition programs, including the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program, provide food to children in institutional settings. Other programs like the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program and Special Milk Program operate in schools. The Child and Adult Care Food Program offers meals in child care settings, and the Summer Food Service Program provides food during summer months. These programs were last reauthorized by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010. The child nutrition programs, last reauthorized by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010, had some authorities expire in 2015. Funding from annual appropriations acts has kept the programs running. Reauthorization efforts in the 114th Congress did not pass, and there were no significant efforts in the 115th Congress. The child nutrition programs faced reauthorization legislation in the 114th Congress, which ultimately did not pass. The 115th Congress did not see significant efforts in this area. However, the 2018 farm bill included provisions related to child nutrition programs, raising issues such as the nutritional quality of foods served in schools and access to meals for students. These issues may be relevant for future reauthorization efforts or policymaking opportunities. Stakeholders involved commonly include school food authorities. The report provides an overview of current issues in child nutrition programs, including the nutritional quality of foods served in schools and access to meals for students. Stakeholders involved in these issues include school food authorities, advocacy organizations, and food industry organizations. The report does not cover every issue but highlights key concerns raised by Congress and program stakeholders. References to more detailed information are provided in CRS reports. School meals must meet specific nutritional requirements for federal reimbursement, including standards for competitive foods. These standards were updated after the enactment of the HHFKA, which mandated USDA to update school meal standards and create new standards for competitive foods within a set timeframe. USDA was required to propose regulations for competitive foods nutrition standards within a year of the law's enactment. The HHFKA mandated USDA to update school meal standards and create new nutrition standards for competitive foods. The law required proposed regulations within specific timeframes, increased federal subsidies for compliant schools, and funding for technical assistance. The nutrition standards were based on Dietary Guidelines and championed by various organizations and stakeholders, with final rules published in 2012 and 2016. The nutrition standards for school meals and competitive foods were updated based on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and recommendations from the Institute of Medicine. The standards increased fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, while limiting calories, sodium, and fats. Senior high school students were required to choose a half-serving of fruits or vegetables with their meal. Competitive foods were also subject to calorie, sodium, and fat restrictions, applying only during the school day. The nutrition standards for school meals and competitive foods required high school students to choose a half-serving of fruits or vegetables with their meal. The standards limited calories, sodium, and fat in competitive foods sold during the school day, with exceptions for fundraisers. Implementation challenges included difficulty obtaining whole grain and low-sodium products, student acceptance issues, reduced participation, increased costs, and food waste. These issues were reported by the School Nutrition Association and confirmed by studies from the U.S. Government Accountability Office and USDA. The School Nutrition Association and studies by the U.S. Government Accountability Office and USDA confirmed issues with the nutrition standards in school meals, leading to changes in the standards from SY2012-2013 to SY2019-2020. The USDA loosened milk, whole grain, and sodium requirements for school meals from SY2015-2016 to SY2017-2018. Changes were implemented for SY2018-2019 and finalized in December 2018 for SY2019-2020, allowing flavored, low-fat milk, 50% whole grain-rich products, and maintaining sodium limits. Other nutrition standards for school meals remain largely unchanged. The USDA made changes to milk, whole grain, and sodium requirements for school meals starting in SY2024-2025. Legislation in the 115th Congress proposed revisions to nutrition standards for school meals and competitive foods, but these were not included in the enacted bill. The proposed revisions to child nutrition standards, including those related to milk, were not included in the enacted bill. The House and Senate proposals during the 114th Congress aimed to alter nutrition standards by requiring USDA to review school meal standards regularly and revise them as needed. Additionally, the Senate proposal sought to revise whole grain and sodium requirements for school meals within 90 days of enactment. The Senate committee's proposal (S. 3136) aimed to revise whole grain and sodium requirements for school meals, reducing the whole grain-rich requirement to 80% and delaying the Target 2 sodium requirement. Stakeholders have debated including frozen, dried, and canned fruits and vegetables in the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP), funded by the 2014 farm bill for a pilot project. The 2014 farm bill funded a pilot project in four states to incorporate canned, dried, and frozen fruits and vegetables in the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP). Schools introduced CDF products resulting in decreased vegetable offerings and increased fruit offerings. However, there was no significant impact on students' vegetable consumption, and fruit consumption declined on FFVP snack days. Student participation and satisfaction with FFVP slightly decreased during the pilot. During the FFVP pilot project, there was no significant impact on students' vegetable consumption, and fruit consumption declined on snack days. Student participation and satisfaction slightly decreased. Legislative proposals have been considered to allow CDF and pur\u00e9ed forms of fruits and vegetables in FFVP. The House and Senate proposed legislation for child nutrition reauthorization includes allowing schools to serve various forms of fruits and vegetables, with temporary exemptions for schools facing challenges in sourcing fresh produce. Schools in the National School Lunch Program must comply with Buy American requirements to purchase domestic products whenever possible. Under the Buy American requirements, schools in the NSLP and SBP must purchase domestic products to the maximum extent practicable. \"Domestic commodities or products\" are defined as those produced and processed substantially in the United States. USDA guidance elaborates that products must be processed in the US and contain over 51% domestically grown ingredients. SFAs and state agencies are encouraged to integrate Buy American into their procurement processes according to USDA guidance. According to USDA-FNS guidance, Buy American requirements apply to foods purchased with funds from the nonprofit school food service account. SFAs are encouraged to integrate Buy American into their procurement processes and may make exceptions on a limited basis. State agencies must review compliance with Buy American requirements and take corrective action when necessary. SFAs must comply with Buy American requirements for food purchases, with the 2018 farm bill enforcing full compliance. USDA defines domestic products as those processed in the US and containing US-produced meats, vegetables, fruits, and other agricultural commodities. State agencies must ensure SFAs adhere to these rules and take corrective action when needed. The USDA clarifies that domestic products for food purchases must be processed in the US and contain US-produced meats, vegetables, fruits, and other agricultural commodities. Proponents advocate for stricter requirements citing economic and food safety reasons, while others argue for maintaining schools' discretion in food procurement. Summer meals are provided through the Summer Food Service Program and the National School Lunch Program's Summer Seamless Option. Policymakers have considered various proposals in recent years. Under current law, summer meals are typically provided in group settings through the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) and the National School Lunch Program's Summer Seamless Option (SSO). Policymakers have explored alternatives to congregate meals, especially in rural areas where access to summer meals is challenging. The 2010 Agriculture Appropriations Act allocated $85 million for demonstration projects like the Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer for Children (SEBTC) to improve food access for children in urban and rural areas during the summer months. $85 million in discretionary funding for demonstration projects to develop and test methods of providing access to food for children in urban and rural areas during the summer months. One project is the Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer for Children (SEBTC), providing electronic food benefits to households with children eligible for free or reduced-price school meals. Participants receive $30 or $60 per month on an EBT card for WIC or SNAP. Evaluation from FY2011 to FY2013 showed a significant decline in food insecurity. The Summer EBT program allows SNAP participants to redeem benefits for SNAP-eligible foods at any retailer, while WIC EBT participants are limited to WIC-eligible foods at specific retailers. An evaluation from FY2011 to FY2013 showed a decrease in very low food security among Summer EBT participants, with improvements in children's consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Congress has provided funding for Summer EBT projects, with $28 million allocated in the FY2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act. Awardees for summer 2017 and 2018 included various states and tribal nations. The FY2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act provided $28 million for the Summer EBT demonstration, with awardees including various states and tribal nations. USDA announced a new strategy for grant recipients in FY2019, prioritizing new states, statewide projects, and projects operating from 2019 to 2021. There were proposals in the 114th and 115th Congresses to expand Summer EBT, including allowing SFSP funding to cover Summer EBT and recommending nationwide expansion over 10 years. The 114th Congress proposed using SFSP funding to cover Summer EBT and authorized up to $50 million for the program. The Obama Administration recommended nationwide expansion of Summer EBT over 10 years. The Enhanced Summer Food Service Program (eSFSP) included initiatives to increase summer meal participation rates, such as lengthening operations, adding activities at meal sites, meal delivery in rural areas, and providing food backpacks. Evaluations showed positive results for all four initiatives. The Enhanced Summer Food Service Program (eSFSP) included initiatives to increase summer meal participation rates, such as meal delivery for children in rural areas and food backpacks. Evaluations showed positive results for all four initiatives, with consistent rates of food insecurity from summer to fall for children in the meal delivery and backpack demonstrations. Exemptions from the congregate feeding requirement were provided to outdoor meal sites experiencing excessive heat, with meals being provided in another form on days of excessive heat. The USDA offers exemptions for outdoor meal sites experiencing excessive heat, allowing meals to be provided in another form on hot days. There have been proposals in Congress to allow rural meal sites to provide meals for offsite consumption, especially in areas with high rates of free or reduced-price meal eligibility. The bills proposed allowing congregate feeding sites in rural and high-need nonrural areas to provide meals for offsite consumption under certain conditions. The Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) was created to offer free meals to students in schools with high numbers of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Over 20,700 schools participated in CEP as of SY2016-2017, benefiting roughly 22% of NSLP schools. Support for CEP includes improved meal access, reduced stigma, and lower administrative costs. The Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) offers free meals to students in schools with high numbers of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunches, benefiting roughly 22% of NSLP schools. Support for CEP includes improved meal access, reduced stigma, and lower administrative costs. Some groups have sought to change the option, such as restricting schools' eligibility for CEP to better target resources. CEP has also created data issues for other non-nutrition federal and state programs that rely on free and reduced-price lunch data for eligibility and funding allocations. The federal Title I-A program uses free and reduced-price lunch data to determine funding allocations. Students may qualify for free, reduced-price, or full-price meals, leading to issues of unpaid meal costs and schools' responses, including \"lunch shaming\" practices. Some schools practice \"lunch shaming\" by taking away hot meals from students with unpaid meal debts, leading to financial burdens on school meal programs. Unpaid meal costs can become bad debt that schools must cover with nonfederal funding sources. Schools rely on revenue from full and reduced-price meals to fund operations. If unpaid meal funds cannot be recovered, schools must cover the costs with nonfederal funding sources. Congress and USDA have addressed the issue of unpaid meal costs since 2010, with a focus on examining policies and practices regarding unpaid meal charges. USDA's 2016 report to Congress did not recommend national standards but suggested updating policy guidance on unpaid meal charges. The USDA's 2016 report to Congress did not recommend national standards for unpaid meal charges but suggested updating policy guidance and distributing best practices to support decision-making at the state and local levels. This recommendation was based on findings from a study and a Request for Information (RFI) that showed meal charge policies were mainly determined at the school and district levels. The USDA's 2016 report to Congress did not recommend national standards for unpaid meal charges but suggested updating policy guidance and distributing best practices to support decision-making at the state and local levels. The findings from a study and a Request for Information (RFI) showed that meal charge policies were largely determined at the school and school district levels rather than the state level. Responses to the RFI indicated varying degrees of formality and enforcement in meal charge policies, with a preference for local control expressed by school and district officials. National advocacy groups, on the other hand, generally favored national standards. Lunch shaming and unpaid meal costs were also discussed in the 115th Congress, with provisions in the FY2018 appropriations law aimed at preventing discrimination against children eligible for free or reduced-price meals. The FY2018 appropriations law included provisions to prevent discrimination against children eligible for free or reduced-price meals, such as prohibiting practices like segregating children or identifying them with special tokens. Legislative proposals like the Anti-Lunch Shaming Act of 2017 aimed to establish national standards for how schools handle children unable to pay for meals. States have also enacted legislation addressing unpaid meal costs, with Illinois passing a law in 2018 requiring schools to serve regular meals to students who cannot pay. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) introduced requirements for schools' pricing of paid lunches. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) requires schools to serve regular meals to students who cannot pay and allows districts to request state offset for debts over $500. It also mandates pricing reviews for paid lunches to ensure federal funds are fully utilized. The USDA study found that federal subsidies for free and reduced-price lunches were cross-subsidizing other aspects of the meals programs. Schools must increase prices for paid lunches to match federal reimbursements, with a limit of a 10-cent annual increase. The HHFKA also includes requirements for revenue from competitive foods. The HHFKA required schools to gradually increase the price of paid lunches if they were not charging at least $3.00 per lunch, with a limit of a 10-cent annual increase. Revenue from competitive foods had to accrue to the SFA-run NSFSA, and must equal or exceed the costs of obtaining nonprogram foods. USDA provided exemptions for SFAs in strong financial standing for certain school years. The HHFKA required schools to gradually increase the price of paid lunches if they were not charging at least $3.00 per lunch, with a limit of a 10-cent annual increase. USDA provided exemptions for SFAs in strong financial standing for certain school years, with legislative proposals in recent Congresses aiming to modify the paid lunch equity requirements. The curr_chunk provides a list of abbreviations related to various food programs in schools, such as CACFP, NSLP, SBP, and USDA-FNS. These abbreviations represent programs like the National School Lunch Program and the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service."
