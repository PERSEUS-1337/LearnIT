    "content": "The Act titled \"Protecting the Second Amendment and Hunting Rights on Federal Lands Act of 2008\" allows for possessing or carrying firearms and ammunition in units of the National Park System and the National Wildlife Refuge System. Congress finds that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to bear arms and that firearms are used for self-defense over 2,000,000 times a year in the US. States with laws expanding firearm rights for self-defense have seen a decrease in firearm-related crime. Federal regulations currently restrict firearm possession in National Parks and Wildlife Refuges, hindering individuals from exercising their Second Amendment rights. Federal law should clarify that the second amendment rights of an individual in a unit of the National Park System or the National Wildlife Refuge System will not be infringed, protecting the right to keep and bear firearms and ammunition in these areas. Federal law should clarify that the second amendment rights of individuals in units of the National Park System or the National Wildlife Refuge System will not be infringed, allowing them to possess or carry firearms and ammunition without federal restrictions based on their location. Federal law should clarify that individuals in units of the National Park System or the National Wildlife Refuge System can possess or carry firearms and ammunition without federal restrictions based on their location. The purpose of this section is to require hunting activities as a land use in all Federal land management plans unless clearly incompatible. The head of the agency must ensure hunting is allowed unless incompatible with the land's purposes, and reasons for not allowing hunting must be published in the management plan. The management plan for Federal land must specify reasons for hunting restrictions. Fees for hunting activities on Federal land must cover management costs. Hunting activities are defined as including hunting. The Act specifies that fees for hunting on Federal land should cover management costs necessary for hunting activities. Definitions include hunting, trapping, netting, and fishing. This section applies to all management plans developed, approved, or amended after the enactment of this Act."
