    "content": "The \"Energy Efficient Government Technology Act\" may be cited as the official title. It focuses on energy-efficient and energy-saving information and communications technologies. The National Energy Conservation Policy Act is amended to include a Federal Implementation Strategy for Energy-Efficient and Energy-Saving Information and Communications Technologies for Federal agencies to develop cost-effective strategies based on their specific operating requirements and statutory mission. The Federal agency must develop cost-effective strategies for energy-efficient and energy-saving information and communications technologies. This includes considering advanced metering infrastructure, ICT services, efficient data center strategies, power management, and building information modeling. The Federal agency must establish performance goals for improving energy-efficient ICT strategies, power management, and building information modeling within 180 days of the enactment of the subsection. The agency should also ensure savings and rewards from increased efficiency and utilization. The Director, in consultation with the Secretary, will establish performance goals for Federal agencies to improve energy-efficient information and communications technology systems. This includes specifications for data center operators to make informed decisions on energy efficiency and cost savings, with an initial focus on Power Usage Effectiveness metric and overall asset utilization. The performance goals established for Federal agencies aim to improve energy efficiency in information technology systems by focusing on metrics like Power Usage Effectiveness, overall asset utilization, and cost savings through energy-efficient practices. Agencies are required to evaluate energy savings performance contracting and utility energy services contracting as preferred acquisition methods. The Federal Data Centers Task Force, established under this paragraph, measures IT costs and cost savings over 3 to 5 years. It aims to provide a complete picture of all costs and savings, including energy costs. The Task Force is comprised of Federal data center program managers, facilities managers, and sustainability officers who work together to share progress towards agency goals. The Federal Data Centers Task Force, comprised of Federal data center program managers, facilities managers, and sustainability officers, collaborates to share progress towards agency goals and the overall Federal target for increased energy efficiency. Each Federal agency subject to the requirements of this subsection must include a description of their efforts and results in their agency report. The agency report under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 must include descriptions of efforts and results. The Director will also include Federal agencies' efforts and results in the annual report and scorecard starting from October 1, 2013. SEC. 3. ENERGY EFFICIENT DATA CENTERS. Section 453 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to designate an information technology industry organization for a program and require a study on energy efficiency in data centers. The Administrator is required to update the Report to Congress on Server and Data Center Energy Efficiency by December 31, 2013, including a comparison of estimates from 2007 to 2012, analysis of technology impact, and updated recommendations. Collaboration with a designated organization is also mandated. The Secretary, in collaboration with the organization designated under subsection (c) and the Federal Chief Information Officer, shall maintain a data center energy practitioner program leading to the certification of energy practitioners qualified to evaluate energy usage and efficiency in data centers. Each Federal agency must have its data centers evaluated every 4 years by certified energy practitioners. The Secretary, in collaboration with designated organization and Federal Chief Information Officer, will establish an open data initiative for Federal data center energy usage data to promote innovation while protecting national security interests. Additionally, the Secretary will participate in global efforts to harmonize specifications and metrics for data center energy efficiency. The Secretary, in collaboration with a designated organization, will participate in global efforts to harmonize specifications and metrics for data center energy efficiency, including the development of an efficiency metric for overall data center energy efficiency."
