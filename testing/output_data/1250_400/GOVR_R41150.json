    "content": "Energy and Water Development funding for FY2010 was provided in H.R. 3183, which became P.L. 111-85 when signed by President Obama on October 28, 2009, totaling $33.5 billion. Additional funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act remained to be expended. President Obama's proposed FY2011 budget totaled $35.3 billion. Various bills were approved in the House and Senate, but a continuing resolution was passed on September 30 (H.R. 3081, P.L. 111-242) to fund government programs. The Energy and Water Development subcommittee approved a bill with a total of $35.0 billion, but it did not come to the floor of either the House or the Senate. Funding was extended through various resolutions until March 18, 2011, with reductions in funding levels for some programs. The House passed H.R. 1 with a funding level of $29.9 billion, while the Senate offered a substitute with fewer funding reductions totaling approximately $32.4 billion. The House Appropriations Committee announced that Energy and Water Development funding in H.R. 1 was $29.9 billion. The Senate proposed S.Amdt. 149 with funding totaling $32.4 billion. After rejection of both versions, H.R. 1473 was passed, funding programs at $32.2 billion for FY2011. This bill includes funding for various agencies and projects. The Energy and Water Development bill includes funding for civil works projects of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Department of the Interior's Central Utah Project, Department of Energy, and independent agencies. Budget totals for energy and water development appropriations enacted for FY2004 to FY2011 are provided in tables. Details for each title and key issues in major programs are discussed. Funding levels for various bills are included in the overall tables. The discussion in the curr_chunk focuses on funding levels for the Army Corps of Engineers in various bills, including H.R. 1 and P.L. 112-10. The FY2011 budget request for the Corps was below the appropriated level for FY2010, with different proposed funding amounts from the Senate Appropriations Committee, House Appropriations Subcommittee, and the Continuing Resolution. Ultimately, P.L. 112-10 provided $5.05 billion for the Corps, an increase over previous levels. The House-passed Continuing Resolution, H.R. 1, proposed reducing funding for the Army Corps of Engineers to $4.8 billion, $641 million below the FY2010 enacted level. The Continuing Resolution, P.L. 112-10, provided $5.05 billion for the Corps, an increase of $152 million over the President's requested level but $411 million below the FY2010 enacted level. Federal funds for the Corps are not distributed based on a formula or competitive program, with 85% of appropriations directed to specific projects. Funding debates often involve earmarks, and projects must be previously authorized in a Water Resources Development Act. The Army Corps of Engineers' funding is often debated during congressional deliberations, with appropriations typically tied to previously authorized projects. The backlog of authorized projects ranges from $11 billion to over $80 billion, leading to questions about the disconnect between authorization and appropriations processes. Since Hurricane Katrina, the Corps has received approximately $18.7 billion in supplemental appropriations, including funds for post-hurricane emergency repairs in Louisiana and the Gulf Coast region. Since Hurricane Katrina, the Army Corps of Engineers has received approximately $18.7 billion in supplemental appropriations for post-hurricane emergency repairs in Louisiana and the Gulf Coast region. This funding includes $5.76 billion in FY2009 for Louisiana hurricane protection, $797 million in 2009 for flood control and coastal emergencies, and $4.6 billion from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 for construction projects. Congress is concerned about the backlog of authorized projects that have not received appropriations, with the FY2011 Obama Administration request including $1.69 billion for construction. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided the Corps with an additional $4.6 billion for FY2009 and FY2010. Congress focuses on Corps construction funding due to numerous authorized projects lacking appropriations. The FY2011 Obama Administration request reduced construction funding by $341 million. The request limited new construction starts, with only two included. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed $1.9 billion for construction, utilizing prior year balances for funding. The Committee's markup of the President's request provided $1.9 billion for the Construction account, with $120 million from prior year balances for the Continuing Authorities Program. The Senate Appropriations Committee included one new construction start, while the House subcommittee bill funded Construction at $1.851 billion. P.L. 112-10 allocated $1.78 billion for construction, with a provision barring new starts. The Inland Waterway Trust Fund faces a deficit, with expenses exceeding collections. The Inland Waterway Trust Fund has faced a deficit as expenses have exceeded collections. Current law dictates that federal funds cover construction and rehabilitation costs for inland waterways, with funding split between the IWTF and federal general revenue. Previous proposals to increase IWTF revenues included replacing the fuel tax with a lock user fee, but the FY2011 Budget did not assume additional revenue from this proposal. The FY2011 Budget proposed limiting IWTF spending to current fuel tax revenues, rejecting the user fee approach. The Senate Appropriations Committee agreed with this temporary solution but warned of potential action if a long-term solution is not reached soon. The Corps plays a key role in restoring the Central and Southern Florida ecosystem, with funding from Energy and Water Development and Department of the Interior appropriations. Concerns about funding levels and progress in the restoration effort are discussed. The FY2011 Obama Administration requested $180 million for the Corps' component of south Florida Everglades restoration work, the same as FY2010. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed reducing this to $155 million due to the Corps' inability to utilize the original amount. Since FY2006, there have been no across-the-board reductions for savings and slippage in individual accounts. A $25 million funding shortfall is needed for the Central and Southern Florida restoration element due to the Corps' inability to use the original amount requested for FY2011. Since FY2006, there have been no across-the-board reductions for savings and slippage in individual accounts. The FY2011 budget request did not include reductions for savings and slippage, but the Senate Appropriations Committee markup included reductions for Investigations and Construction. In FY2006, Congress stopped applying an S&S rate to reduce reprogramming allocations among projects. The FY2011 budget request did not include reductions for individual accounts, but the Senate Appropriations Committee markup included reductions for Investigations, Construction, Operations and Maintenance, and Mississippi Rivers & Tributaries. The Obama Administration requested $43.0 million for the Central Utah Project (CUP) Completion Account in FY2011, $1 million more than FY2010. The FY2011 request for the Bureau of Reclamation totaled $1.064 billion, $22 million less than FY2010. The request includes an \"offset\" of $49.9 million for the Central Valley Project (CVP) Restoration Fund, resulting in a \"net\" discretionary authority of $1.015 billion. Additional funds of $167 million are estimated for FY2011, bringing the total to $1.182 billion. The Bureau of Reclamation's FY2011 budget request includes a net discretionary authority of $1.015 billion, with an additional $167 million available from permanent and other funds. The total discretionary budget request for Title II funding was approximately $1.107 billion. The Water and Related Resources Account, Reclamation's largest account, had a requested budget of $913.6 million for FY2011. The Obama Administration requested $913.6 million for the Water and Related Resources Account for FY2011, a reduction from FY2010 of $37.6 million. H.R. 1 proposed funding the account at $911.6 million, with potential policy impacts including eliminating funding for a dam removal study in the Klamath basin and barring funding for the implementation of biological opinions by the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service. The Obama Administration requested reduced funding for the Water and Related Resources Account for FY2011. H.R. 1 proposed funding at $911.6 million, with potential impacts including eliminating funding for a dam removal study in the Klamath basin and barring funding for biological opinions related to the Central Valley Project and the California State Project. The final enacted version of P.L. 112-10 did not include these provisions. Reclamation manages dams and diversion projects in 17 western states, providing water to millions of acres of farmland and a population of 31 million. Reclamation manages hundreds of dams and diversion projects in 17 western states, supplying water to 10 million acres of farmland and 31 million people. It is the largest wholesale water supplier in the region and the second-largest hydroelectric power producer in the nation. Despite past achievements, Reclamation has been criticized for not exerting leadership in water supply provision and infrastructure maintenance. Operations of Reclamation facilities are often controversial due to their impact on fish and wildlife species and conflicts among water users. The House Committee on Appropriations criticized Reclamation for not providing leadership in water supply and infrastructure maintenance. The challenges of balancing needs, increasing demand, and changing hydrology require active leadership in western water resource management. The Central Valley Project (CVP) in California, one of Reclamation's largest projects, has faced water delivery limitations due to drought and environmental restrictions. Previous appropriations bills have included amendments to prevent new Biological Opinions on project operations' impact on fish species. In FY2010 appropriations, an amendment was proposed to prevent Reclamation from implementing new Biological Opinions (BiOps) on the impact of project operations on certain fish species, including Delta Smelt and salmon in California. These species are protected under the federal Endangered Species Act and the California Endangered Species Act. The Operations Criteria and Plan (OCAP) allowed increased pumping from the Delta, which some believe has further imperiled threatened or endangered fish species. Other factors such as invasive species, pollution, and non-federal water withdrawals from the Delta have also contributed to fishery declines. The FY2010 appropriations proposed an amendment to prevent Reclamation from implementing new Biological Opinions on the impact of project operations on fish species like Delta Smelt and salmon. The increased pumping from the Delta has raised concerns about further endangering these species. Other factors such as invasive species, pollution, and non-federal water withdrawals have also contributed to declines in fish populations. Additionally, low water deliveries to certain water districts are exacerbating unemployment in an already struggling economy. The proposed FY2010 amendments were not enacted, but an amendment allowing water transfers among certain contractors without meeting specific conditions was included in the enacted bill. The FY2010 enacted bill included an amendment allowing water transfers among certain CVP contractors without meeting specific conditions. The Administration requested $40.0 million for the California Bay-Delta Restoration Account for FY2011, with funds targeted at water use efficiency, water quality, water storage, conveyance, and ecosystem restoration. Funding for CALFED subaccounts varied in FY2011, with some areas seeing increases while others declined. The enacted Continuing Resolution provided the same amount as the President's budget request for FY2011. The Continuing Resolution (P.L. 112-10) provided funding for the San Joaquin River Restoration Fund, with an increase of $56.2 million over FY2010. The Fund, authorized by the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009, is used for fisheries restoration and water management as part of a settlement agreement. Funding comes from a reallocation of Central Valley Project Restoration Fund receipts and other federal and non-federal sources. The agreement for the Natural Resources Defense Council et al. v. Rodgers lawsuit involves funding from various sources, including a reallocation of funds from Friant Division water users. Actions planned for FY2011 include releasing interim flows from Friant Dam and completing planning for channel improvements to restore salmon migration in the San Joaquin River. The settlement agreement aims to restore salmon migration in the San Joaquin River and mitigate water supply impacts to Friant Division long-term contractors. The Senate Appropriations Committee allocated an additional $8 million for San Joaquin River restoration, in addition to the $72 million already allocated. The House-passed CR (H.R. 1) includes a provision withholding funding for the settlement agreement in FY2011. Reclamation proposed funding for the WaterSMART Program in FY2011 to focus on water conservation and planning. The WaterSMART Program proposed funding for FY2011 by the Department of the Interior focuses on water conservation, re-use, and planning. The program includes WaterSMART Grants, Basin Studies, and Title XVI Projects. Reclamation proposed $62 million for WaterSMART, but the Senate Appropriations Committee decreased funding levels to $20 million for Grants, $4 million for Studies, and $7.7 million for Title XVI projects. P.L. 112-10 did not specify funding levels for the program. The Senate Appropriations Committee decreased funding levels for WaterSMART/Challenge Grants, Basin Studies, and Title XVI projects to $20 million, $4 million, and $7.7 million respectively. The Energy and Water Development bill has funded DOE programs since FY2005, including research on renewable energy, nuclear power, environmental cleanup, and nuclear weapons programs. The FY2010 appropriations funded DOE programs at $27.1 billion, with additional funds from the ARRA remaining unexpended. The FY2010 appropriations funded DOE programs at $27.1 billion, with additional funds from the ARRA remaining unexpended. For FY2011, the Obama Administration requested $29.6 billion for DOE programs, but the final legislation appropriated $26.3 billion. DOE administers various programs with different functions and missions, including EERE programs which saw a reduction in funding in FY2011. DOE's FY2011 request sought $2,355.5 million for EERE programs, an increase of $85.6 million from FY2010. However, P.L. 112-10 provided $1,825.6 million for EERE, a reduction of $416.9 million. Additionally, DOE requested $189.5 million for EDER programs, but only received $144.7 million. A new science and engineering education program, RE-ENERGYSE, was proposed with a $50 million budget to address the need for a skilled clean energy workforce in the U.S. The DOE's FY2011 request included a $50 million budget for a new science and engineering education program called RE-ENERGYSE. This program aims to provide education and training for a highly skilled U.S. clean energy workforce to address the nation's energy challenges and increase competitiveness. It includes funding for higher education programs to develop professionals in the clean energy field and technical training programs for green jobs. The $50 million RE-ENERGYSE program in the DOE's FY2011 request supports education and training for a skilled clean energy workforce. It includes funding for fellowships, internships, post-doctoral opportunities, interdisciplinary masters programs, technical training, education, outreach, and K-12 education activities to inspire students to pursue clean energy careers and adopt sustainable energy practices. The DOE proposed a $115 million RE-ENERGYSE program in FY2010 to promote clean energy careers and sustainable energy practices. However, Congress did not fund the program due to concerns about its alignment with other agencies' activities. Instead, they recommended $7.5 million for a study to define education and workforce needs and assess program effectiveness. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended zero funding for the FY2010 RE-ENERGYSE proposal, opting instead for a $7.5 million study to define education and workforce needs. For FY2011, the committee again recommended zero funding for RE-ENERGYSE but proposed a $55.4 million increase for the Solar Program, with a focus on Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) projects in the desert Southwest. The FY2011 budget request includes a significant increase in funding for solar energy programs, with a focus on Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) projects in the desert Southwest. The CSP subprogram would receive $48.5 million for a demonstration project to accelerate deployment by two to three years, adding 1,000 megawatts of new capacity. The Photovoltaic (PV) R&D Program would also see an increase of $23.5 million for the PV Manufacturing Initiative to reduce technology costs and promote commercialization. The Wind Program would receive a net increase of $42.5 million, with a focus on commercializing offshore wind energy. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended funding for various renewable energy programs, including a $50.0 million for the CSP demonstration project, a $42.5 million increase for the Wind Program, and a $49.0 million allocation for offshore wind development. The DOE anticipates accelerating market deployment of over three gigawatts of offshore wind projects through competitive solicitations. The Geothermal Program would also receive an $11.0 million increase. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended funding for renewable energy programs, including offshore wind projects and geothermal research. The Geothermal Program would receive an $11.0 million increase for collaborative R&D activities addressing geophysical risks. The Vehicle Technologies Program would see a net increase of $13.9 million, with a focus on Battery/Energy Storage subprogram.

The Vehicle Technologies Program would receive a net increase of $13.9 million, with a significant increase for the Battery/Energy Storage subprogram. The Building Technologies Program would also see a net increase of $8.7 million, with a modest increase for the Energy Efficient Building Systems Design Hub. The Senate Committee recommended slightly less funding for the Buildings Program compared to the request. In FY2011, DOE sought more funding for various energy programs. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended funding decreases for the Buildings Program, specifically the Building Design Hub. The Industrial Technologies Program would receive a net increase, including funding for a new Manufacturing Energy Systems subprogram. The Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) would see a significant increase to support DOE efforts in meeting energy goals. The Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) would have increased by $10.3 million, or about 32%, to support DOE efforts in meeting energy goals established by EISA and Executive Orders. The focus would be on energy assessments, retro-commissioning, hardware for emissions, and pilot projects for alternative energy sources. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended similar funding, with a directive for DOE to address identified problems. The Weatherization Program would have grown by $90.0 million, mainly to increase weatherization of low-income households, supporting an additional 13,200 households. The Weatherization Program would have grown by $90.0 million, with $85.8 million supporting the goal to increase weatherization of low-income households, benefiting an additional 13,200 households. A portion of the increase, $4.2 million, would fund the program evaluation. The State Energy Program would have increased by $25.0 million. The Facilities Program would have had a net increase of $38.5 million, primarily for the Energy Systems Integration Facility (ESIF) at NREL. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $100.0 million less for the Weatherization Program, citing sufficient funds from the Recovery Act. The Facilities Program would have a net increase of $38.5 million, with most of the funds going towards completing the Energy Systems Integration Facility (ESIF) at NREL and purchasing research equipment. Program Direction would increase by $60.0 million, mainly for salaries and benefits to handle a higher workload of contracts and agreements. Program Support would receive a $42.3 million increase, with a significant portion going towards the Strategic Priorities and Impact Analysis (SPIA) subprogram. The DOE expects a doubling of transactions from FY2009 to FY2011. Program Support would receive a $42.3 million increase, with $21.0 million allocated to the Strategic Priorities and Impact Analysis (SPIA) subprogram. The increase would focus on policy analysis for energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies as solutions to climate change. Additionally, $15.0 million would expand support for the International subprogram, addressing energy security, economic goals, and climate change through partnerships. The DOE plans to increase funding for Program Support, with a focus on policy analysis for energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies to address climate change. An additional $15.0 million would support the International subprogram, which partners with developing countries like China, India, and Brazil for cooperative R&D and market transformation initiatives. The increased funding would also support new global technology deployment and climate change mitigation initiatives, including the China and India Clean Energy Research Centers and programs under the Major Economies Forum. Regional partnerships with organizations like APEC, ECPA, EDIN, and African energy platforms would also receive support. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended reduced funding for Program Management and congressionally directed projects, cutting the Hydrogen/Fuel Cell Program by $37.0 million and the Market Transformation subprogram by $16.9 million. Funding for regional partnerships and bilateral partnerships with countries like China, India, Russia, Brazil, Canada, and Argentina would continue to advance energy efficiency and renewable energy technology worldwide. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $147.6 million for 134 activities, with cuts to the Hydrogen/Fuel Cell Program and Market Transformation subprogram. The Water Power Program would also see a $9.5 million cut, focusing on technology development and market acceleration. The FY2011 funding would maintain FY2010 levels and support new projects for hydropower opportunities. The FY2011 funding request for the Department of Energy (DOE) aims to build upon activities from previous years and support the development of cost-effective incremental hydropower opportunities. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended additional funding for conventional hydropower and Industries of the Future program, while cutting funding for specific industry subprograms. DOE is shifting towards greater support for cross-cutting technology efforts. The Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability would receive a net increase in funding. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $14.0 million for the Industries of the Future program, with a decrease from FY2010 funding. The FY2011 request includes a net increase of $13.9 million for the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability, with a focus on energy storage research for electric power infrastructure issues. Specifically, research efforts will target lithium-based batteries for stationary applications to reduce system costs and improve performance. The FY2011 increase for storage would focus on lithium-based batteries for stationary applications to reduce costs and improve performance. The Senate Committee recommended funding for programs and added $4.3 million for six projects. The Obama Administration's FY2011 funding request for nuclear energy research totaled $824.1 million, with P.L. 112-10 providing $732.1 million for those programs. An additional $88.2 million was requested for safeguards and security at DOE's Idaho nuclear facilities. The FY2011 nuclear energy request included funding for advanced reactors, fuel cycle technology, and infrastructure support. The total request was 4.8% above the FY2010 appropriation, with $732.1 million provided in P.L. 112-10. An additional $88.2 million was requested for safeguards and security at DOE's Idaho nuclear facilities. The program focuses on generation, safety, waste storage, management, and security technologies to meet energy and climate goals. The Obama Administration reorganized the budget request and established new priorities, discontinuing funding for the Nuclear Power 2010 Program. Opponents criticize the program as providing wasteful subsidies to an industry they believe should be phased out. The FY2011 budget request for nuclear energy included funding for advanced reactors, fuel cycle technology, and infrastructure support. The Nuclear Power 2010 Program was completed in FY2010 with no further funding, but a new Reactor Concepts Research, Development and Demonstration Program was established. Fuel Cycle Research and Development received a 47.8% boost in funding to focus on research for spent nuclear fuel disposal and cycle options. A new program area called Nuclear Energy Enabling Technologies (NEET) was proposed to support various nuclear technologies and advanced power concepts. The FY2011 budget request for nuclear energy included funding for research on spent nuclear fuel disposal, nuclear fuel cycle options, and advanced nuclear technologies. A new program area called Nuclear Energy Enabling Technologies (NEET) was proposed with a budget of $99.3 million. Funding for university nuclear education and research would continue at $5 million under the DOE-wide RE-ENERGYSE initiative.

The Energy Innovation Hub for Modeling and Simulation is to be moved to NEET with increased funding. The Obama Administration requested a decrease in funding for Fossil Energy Research and Development in FY2011. In FY2011, funding for Fossil Energy Research and Development decreased by 12.7% to $586.6 million. The DOE Office of Fossil Energy plans to restructure the budget for the Coal subprogram to focus more on carbon capture and storage technologies. The FutureGen project, originally aimed at clean coal-based power generation, has been abandoned in favor of refitting and repowering existing facilities with $1 billion in funding. The FutureGen project, originally aimed at clean coal-based power generation, has been abandoned in favor of refitting and repowering existing facilities with $1 billion in funding. The Clean Coal Technology program has only project-closeout activities remaining, with no further funding requested in FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a 24% increase in the Fossil Energy budget, bringing it up to $725.95 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a 24% increase in the Fossil Energy budget to $725.95 million. This includes funding for Fuels and Power Systems, the Natural Gas Technologies program, and a new Unconventional Fossil Energy program. The committee also supports research projects for high-quality fuels derived from coal/biomass feedstocks, stored in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for emergency oil supply. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was filled to its capacity of 727 million barrels by early 2010. The Northeast Heating Oil Reserve (NHOR) stores 2 million barrels of home heating oil. The federal government has not purchased oil for the SPR since 1994, instead acquiring oil through royalty-in-kind (RIK) and other provisions. Congress passed legislation in 2008 to suspend RIK fill unless crude oil prices dropped below $75/barrel. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) reached its full capacity of 727 million barrels by early 2010. The federal government acquired oil through royalty-in-kind (RIK) and other methods, with Congress passing legislation in 2008 to suspend RIK fill unless crude oil prices fell below $75/barrel. In response to declining oil prices, the SPR resumed filling, including a purchase of nearly 10.7 million barrels in 2009 to replace oil sold after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The RIK Program was phased out in 2009, with natural gas properties reverting to in-value status as contracts expired. The Secretary of the Department of the Interior announced the phasing out of the RIK Program in 2009, leading to the cancellation of upcoming natural gas sales. The Administration proposed suspending spending on expanding the SPR in its FY2011 request, redirecting $71 million for non-expansion operations and maintenance activities. This decision was based on EIA projections of declining U.S. petroleum consumption and import dependence. The Administration redirected $71 million from the SPR expansion to fund non-expansion operations and maintenance. This decision was supported by EIA projections of declining U.S. petroleum consumption and import dependence, leading to a reduced FY2011 request for the SPR to $138.9 million. Congress approved $11.3 million for the NHOR in FY2010, with the Senate Appropriations Committee recommending $209.9 million for the SPR in FY2011. P.L. 112-10 set the SPR spending level at $209.9 million and rescinded $86.8 million from prior year appropriations. The DOE Office of Science conducts basic research in six program areas and is a major federal funder of research in the physical sciences. For FY2011, DOE requested $5.121 billion for the Office of Science, with varying recommendations from different committees in Congress. P.L. 112-10 appropriated $4,857.7 billion for the Office of Science in the 112th Congress. None of the bills specified how the total should be allocated by program. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $5.012 billion for the Office of Science in the 112th Congress. The House passed H.R. 1 with $4.018 billion, while the Senate amendment S.Amdt. 149 proposed $4.733 billion. P.L. 112-10 appropriated $4,857.7 billion, with no specified allocation by program. The President's Plan for Science and Innovation aims to double R&D funding over a decade. The requested funding for basic energy sciences was $1.835 billion, up 12.1% from FY2010.

Fusion energy sciences had a request of $380 million, down 10.8% from FY2010 due to delays in the construction schedule of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). The U.S. contribution to ITER would have dropped from $135 million to $80 million in FY2011. The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) in France faced delays causing a drop in funding from $135 million in FY2010 to $80 million in FY2011. ITER partners include China, the EU, India, Japan, Russia, South Korea, and the US, with a total project cost estimated at $1.45 billion to $2.2 billion. Start-up date for ITER was pushed to November 2019. Concerns were raised in the 111th Congress about cost, schedule, and US leadership in fusion energy sciences. Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) received funding in FY2009 to support energy technology research projects. The Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) was authorized by the America COMPETES Act to support energy technology research projects. It received funding in FY2009 and announced its first round of contract awards in October 2009. The request for ARPA-E in FY2011 was $300 million, but only $179.6 million was appropriated. President Obama's FY2011 budget called for termination of DOE's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management. DOE had filed a license application for the proposed Yucca Mountain repository in June 2008. The DOE had been developing a permanent nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, NV, as specified by an NWPA amendment in 1987. However, the Obama Administration decided that Yucca Mountain is not a viable option for nuclear waste disposal, leading to no funding being requested for the project in FY2011. DOE filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application in 2010, but faced opposition from states with defense-related waste awaiting disposal. The full NRC commission is now considering the withdrawal. The panel rejected DOE's withdrawal motion for the Yucca Mountain license application, as NWPA requires full NRC consideration. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future will evaluate alternatives, funded by Congress. DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy will lead future waste management activities, with substantial funding for research on disposal technologies and support for the Commission. DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy (NE) has taken over the remaining functions of OCRWM and will lead all future waste management activities. Substantial funding has been requested for research on nuclear waste disposal technologies and options, as well as support for the Blue Ribbon Commission. Utilities have won court cases upholding DOE's obligation to compensate for missed deadlines, with potential liability payments estimated at $11 billion by 2020. The DOE's liability payments could reach $11 billion by 2020 if waste removal from reactor sites begins. The DOE Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program was established to support energy projects with new technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The program requires projects to pay upfront for estimated future government costs, ranging from 1% to 10% of the loan guarantee amount. The FY2009 omnibus funding measure provided DOE with loan guarantee authority of $47 billion. The DOE's loan guarantee program requires projects to pay upfront for subsidy costs, ranging from 1% to 10% of the loan guarantee amount. The FY2009 omnibus funding measure provided DOE with loan guarantee authority of $47 billion, allocated to various energy sectors. President Obama's FY2011 budget requested an increase in the loan guarantee ceiling for nuclear power plants. The first preliminary nuclear loan guarantee was announced in 2010 for a project at the Vogtle nuclear power plant. The DOE announced a preliminary nuclear loan guarantee for the Vogtle nuclear power plant project in Georgia, totaling $8.33 billion. The proposed increase in the nuclear loan guarantee ceiling to $54.5 billion could cover about 13 reactors. Critics argue that this would divert resources from cleaner energy technologies. Critics have attacked the proposed tripling of nuclear loan guarantees as a \"taxpayer bailout\" that would divert financial resources from cleaner energy technologies. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act created a temporary loan guarantee program for renewable energy projects, with $6 billion appropriated to cover subsidy costs. However, $2 billion was transferred to the \"cash for clunkers\" program and $1.5 billion was rescinded for other purposes. The remaining $2.5 billion should support loan guarantees totaling $25 billion. President Obama also requested a $500 million appropriation for subsidy costs. The Education Jobs and Medicaid Assistance Act allocated $2.5 billion for loan guarantees, with an average subsidy cost of 10%. An additional $500 million was requested for energy efficiency and renewable energy loan guarantees. The DOE budget estimated that the $500 million would support loan guarantees totaling $3 billion-$5 billion. Administrative costs of $58 million were also requested, to be offset by receipts. Loan guarantee authority for non-nuclear technologies was reduced to $7.3 billion, with a total of about $9.3 billion available. Nuclear loan guarantees remained at $18.5 billion, and uranium enrichment at $4 billion. The loan guarantee authority for Section 1703 non-nuclear technologies has been increased to $7.3 billion, bringing the total ceiling to about $9.3 billion. Nuclear loan guarantees remain at $18.5 billion, and uranium enrichment totals $4 billion. P.L. 112-10 provides $170 million with no expiration for renewable energy and efficiency projects under the Section 1703 program. Additionally, there is authority for up to $1.183 billion in loan guarantees for renewable energy and efficiency projects. The Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, established by P.L. 110-140, provides loans to automobile manufacturers and parts suppliers for investments in plant capacity. The Stockpile Stewardship Program, created by P.L. 103-160, ensures U.S. nuclear weapons competencies. Funding for administrative expenses in FY2011 was mostly covered by P.L. 112-10. The Stockpile Stewardship Program, established by P.L. 103-160, aims to preserve U.S. nuclear weapons competencies. It is operated by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and ensures the safety, security, and reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile without underground testing. The Stockpile Stewardship Program, established by P.L. 103-160 and continued in P.L. 106-65 and P.L. 111-84, aims to manage the nuclear weapons stockpile effectively. It focuses on increasing reliability, safety, and security without the need for underground nuclear testing. The program includes activities in NNSA's Weapons Activities account and supports the stockpile management program for this purpose. The stockpile management program supports the stockpile stewardship program, which aims to manage the nuclear weapons stockpile effectively without underground testing. The program includes activities at the nuclear weapons complex, consisting of three laboratories and four production sites managed by NNSA. The FY2011 request document includes data from NNSA's Future Years Nuclear Security Program for FY2012-FY2015. The complex was larger during the Cold War in terms of sites, budgets, and personnel. The FY2011 request document includes data from NNSA's Future Years Nuclear Security Program (FYNSP) for FY2012-FY2015. The Complex, consisting of eight sites, has undergone post-Cold War reductions. Congress has pushed for further changes including fewer personnel, lower costs, increased security, and a smaller footprint at each site. In response, NNSA submitted the \"Complex 2030\" plan in 2007. The House Appropriations Committee demanded a comprehensive nuclear defense strategy, a specific nuclear stockpile description, and a long-term expenditure plan before considering funding for Complex 2030 and the Reliable Replacement Warhead program. The Senate Appropriations Committee criticized the lack of linkage between warheads, the Complex, and strategy, rejecting the premature deployment of the NNSA Complex 2030 consolidation effort. Congress agreed to develop a comprehensive nuclear weapons strategy for the 21st century. NNSA announced its plan, Complex Transformation, in December 2007, aiming to reduce the weapons program footprint by up to one-third and retain existing sites. NNSA announced its plan, Complex Transformation, in December 2007, to reduce the weapons program footprint by up to one-third, close or transfer about 600 structures, and build new facilities. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended eliminating funds for the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) and several programs in their FY2009 reports. They emphasized the need for a modern nuclear deterrent strategy, determination of the nuclear stockpile size, and the nuclear weapons complex needed to support it. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended eliminating funds for the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) and other programs in their FY2009 report. The FY2010 and FY2011 budgets did not request RRW funds, with the Administration citing it as inconsistent with moving towards a nuclear-free world. The FY2011 budget request for Weapons Activities was $7,008.8 million, an increase from the previous year. The Department of Defense submitted its Nuclear Posture Review Report in April 2010, outlining the role of U.S. nuclear forces and plans for sustaining the arsenal. The FY2011 budget request for Weapons Activities was $7,008.8 million, an increase from the previous year. The Department of Defense submitted its Nuclear Posture Review Report in April 2010, setting forth the role of U.S. nuclear forces and plans for sustaining the arsenal. The President provided Congress with a classified report on maintaining delivery platforms, sustaining a safe nuclear stockpile, and modernizing the nuclear weapons complex, with an intended investment of $80 billion over the next decade. Projections for weapons stockpile and infrastructure costs show an increase over the years. The FY2011 budget request for Weapons Activities was $7.0 billion, with projections for weapons stockpile and infrastructure costs increasing over the years. In the 112th Congress, there was a contentious reduction in funding proposed for the nuclear weapons complex. The Administration aimed to increase funding for Weapons Activities to modernize the complex and maintain nuclear weapons, as part of a compromise to gain support for the New START treaty. The President's FY2012 budget requested an increase in Weapons Activities funding to $7,629.7 million, with concerns about Congress providing the funds. The FY2011 budget allocated $6,946.4 million for Weapons Activities, involving work on nuclear weapons in the stockpile, including maintenance, R&D, and dismantlement. Life Extension Programs (LEPs) aim to extend the life of existing warheads. The Defense Stockpile Work (DSW) involves direct work on nuclear weapons in the stockpile, such as monitoring their condition, maintenance, repairs, refurbishment, life extension, and modifications. Specific items under DSW include Life Extension Programs (LEPs) to extend the life of existing warheads through design, certification, manufacture, and component replacement. An LEP for the B61 mods 7 and 11 bombs was completed in FY2009, and an ongoing LEP for the W76 warhead for the Trident II submarine-launched ballistic missile. The FY2010 appropriation was $223.2 million, and the FY2011 request was $249.5 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount and required reports on completed studies. The NNSA completed a study on the B61 bomb's Life Extension Program, which aims to extend the weapon's life for both strategic and tactical missions for 30 years. The program involves routine maintenance, component replacement, and ongoing assessment for all weapon types in the stockpile. The FY2011 budget request includes significant increases for the B61 bomb, W78 warhead, and W87 warhead. Funding for the B61 bomb falls into two categories: system sustainment and phase 6.2/6.2A study to support a life extension study of nuclear and non-nuclear components. The FY2011 budget request includes significant increases for the B61 bomb and B61 phase 6.2/6.2A study. The latter aims to support a life extension study of nuclear and non-nuclear components, including enhanced surety and compatibility with modern aircraft. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding for Stockpile Systems, with a focus on surveillance activities to monitor the status of nuclear weapons and ensure safety and reliability. The B61 bomb and B61-12 variant were subjects of controversy in the FY2010 appropriations cycle. The House bill recommended no funds for the B61-12, citing the need for a clearly defined nuclear weapons strategy. The Senate bill included the requested amount, and the conference bill allocated $92.0 million for B61 stockpile systems activities, including a study of nonnuclear components for the proposed B61-12. The bill allocated $92.0 million for B61 stockpile systems activities, with $32.5 million designated for a study of nonnuclear components for the proposed B61-12. An additional $15 million could be reallocated for the B61-12 non-nuclear upgrade study upon completion of the Nuclear Posture Review. Approval from the Appropriations Committees is required for funds for B61-12 nuclear components. Two reports on the B61-12 were called for in the conference agreement. The appropriations language authorizes the NNSA to reallocate $15 million for the B61-12 nonnuclear upgrade study after the Nuclear Posture Review. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount for FY2011 and directed NNSA to submit reports on safety and security features for a refurbished B61 and cost-benefit analysis. The President and Congress aim to reduce the stockpile, leading to the need for dismantling warheads. The B61 Weapons Dismantlement and Disposition (WDD) program aims to reduce the stockpile of warheads while maintaining national security. Funding for FY2011 is $58.0 million, with a decrease in dismantlements and component dispositions compared to FY2010. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $64.4 million, with a focus on restoring weapons dismantlement activities at Pantex. Various components of WDD have been reassigned within the DOE or to different budget categories. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $64.4 million for the B61 Weapons Dismantlement and Disposition program, with $27.5 million allocated to restore weapons dismantlement activities at Pantex. Components of the program have been reassigned within DOE or to different budget categories in recent years. The major activity for FY2009 was the Pit Disassembly and Conversion Facility (PDCF), which was moved to a different account for FY2010. The PDCF converts plutonium pits into plutonium oxide for use in a Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF). The plutonium pits are converted into plutonium oxide for use in a Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) to be used as fuel for commercial nuclear reactors. The Waste Solidification Building (WSB) converts liquid wastes from PDCF and MFFF into solids for disposal off-site. Stockpile Services includes Production Support, R&D, Certification, Safety, Management, Technology, and Plutonium Sustainment. It provides the foundation for production capability within the nuclear security enterprise and supports various weapons types. The FY2010 appropriation for Stockpile Services was $828.8 million. Stockpile Services plays a crucial role in providing base development, production, and logistics capabilities for meeting program requirements. The FY2010 appropriation was $828.8 million, with a $941.5 million request for FY2011. The largest increase was for Plutonium Sustainment, aimed at maintaining technical skills and restoring the capability to build up to 10 pits per year. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended adjustments to the funding allocation, emphasizing support for surveillance, plutonium sustainment, and weapons assembly, disassembly, and dismantlement at Pantex. These efforts are described as multi-year, multi-functional initiatives providing specialized scientific knowledge and technical support. The funds provided for Stockpile Services include allocations for surveillance, plutonium sustainment, and weapons assembly, disassembly, and dismantlement at Pantex. These efforts are multi-year, multi-functional initiatives that support the nuclear weapons stockpile. Campaigns aim to improve warhead performance assessment, readiness for nuclear tests, and maintain scientific infrastructure. The Science Campaign focuses on enhancing scientific capabilities for nuclear explosives without underground testing. The National Ignition Facility at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory is requesting $365.2 million for the Science Campaign in FY2011, with a focus on improving scientific capabilities for nuclear explosives. The Advanced Certification program within this campaign would see a significant increase in funding to improve weapons certification processes and study system requirements. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a reduction of $10.9 million from the request. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended reducing the request for certain experiments at the Nevada Test Site and the Dual-Axis Radiographic Hydrodynamic Test Facility. Funding was allocated to the Z facility at Sandia for experiments on plutonium, critical for nuclear stockpile safety. The Engineering Campaign aims to improve nuclear explosive package safety and reliability without underground testing. The campaign aims to enhance the safety, reliability, and performance of nuclear weapons without underground testing. The FY2010 appropriation was $150.0 million, with a $141.9 million request for FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended an increase of $8.0 million to simulate a nuclear environment. The Inertial Confinement Fusion Ignition and High Yield Campaign focuses on creating high temperatures and pressures for weapons research. The Inertial Confinement Fusion Ignition and High Yield Campaign aims to create high temperatures and pressures in the laboratory to support weapons-related research and attract scientific talent. The National Ignition Facility (NIF) is the centerpiece of this campaign, using high energy density physics experiments to validate theoretical models for stockpile certification. NIF, the world's largest laser, successfully fired 192 laser beams in January 2010, marking a significant scientific achievement. The National Ignition Facility (NIF) is the world's largest laser, dedicated in May 2009. In January 2010, scientists successfully fired 192 laser beams at a target, heating it to 6 million degrees Fahrenheit. The facility received a FY2010 appropriation of $457.9 million and a FY2011 request of $481.5 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount and supported the creation of an independent advisory board for NIF experiments. The NIF has received funding for its Advanced Simulation and Computing Campaign, which aims to develop computational models for nuclear weapons testing. Some analysts question the reliability of simulations and advocate for a return to testing. The Readiness Campaign focuses on improving manufacturing safety and efficiency. Funding for these campaigns has increased for FY2011. The Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount for the Readiness Campaign, which aims to improve manufacturing safety and efficiency. The FY2011 request is $112.1 million, with the largest dollar increase for Stockpile Readiness and the largest decrease for Tritium Readiness. The increase will advance manufacturing capabilities for weapon components, while the decrease is due to the fixed-price contracting approach. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended reducing the Tritium Readiness component funding from $50.2 million to $30.2 million for FY2011 due to technical challenges in tritium production at the Watts Bar reactor. This program funds infrastructure and operations at Complex sites with a total FY2011 request of $1,849.0 million. The FY2010 appropriation for the Tritium Readiness program was $1,842.9 million, with a FY2011 request of $1,849.0 million. It has six subprograms including Operations of Facilities, Program Readiness, Material Recycle and Recovery, and Construction. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended increasing funds for the program by $71.0 million above the request due to concerns about insufficient funding for Pantex and Y-12. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended increasing funds for the Tritium Readiness program by $71.0 million above the FY2011 request. Concerns were raised about insufficient funding for Pantex and Y-12, with the increase aimed at avoiding layoffs and disruptions to dismantlement and life extension schedules. Additionally, funding was restored for the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center, and concerns were expressed about NNSA's use of funds for a replacement facility for the Kansas City Plant. The most costly item in Construction is the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Facility Replacement (CMRR) at Los Alamos National Laboratory, with a request of $225.0 million for FY2011 to replace the over 50-year-old CMR building. The Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Facility Replacement (CMRR) at Los Alamos National Laboratory is a costly project aimed at replacing the over 50-year-old CMR building. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees have expressed concerns about the project's mission and worker safety, with potential delays in construction leading to continued operations in the existing facility. The CMRR project at Los Alamos National Laboratory faces funding challenges and concerns about worker safety. The House Appropriations Committee recommended no funds for the project, while the Senate recommended an increase of $24.8 million to address previous funding shortfalls. The NNSA states that the current capabilities at the CMR are restricted, necessitating the need for additional funding. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended an increase of $24.8 million for the CMRR project at Los Alamos National Laboratory to address previous funding shortfalls. The NNSA justifies the increase by stating that current capabilities at the CMR are restricted, hindering necessary operations. Additionally, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount for various programs under Weapons Activities, including Secure Transportation Asset and Nuclear Counterterrorism Incident Response. The FY2010 appropriation for Nuclear Counterterrorism Incident Response was $221.9 million, with a request of $233.1 million for FY2011. The Facilities and Infrastructure Recapitalization Program focused on eliminating deferred maintenance, with an appropriation of $93.9 million in FY2010 and a request of $94.0 million for FY2011.

Site Stewardship, a new program for FY2010, aimed to ensure environmental compliance and energy efficiency with a request of $90.4 million. The House Appropriations Committee supported the program but reduced funding to $62.4 million due to budget limitations. The Senate bill included $61.3 million and denied funding for the stewardship planning initiative. The FY2011 request for Site Stewardship was $105.5 million, with a recommended reduction of $5.0 million by the Senate Appropriations Committee. The Defense Nuclear Security budget for FY2011 was reduced by $38.8 million due to efficiency measures. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $668.0 million for operations and maintenance, and $43.0 million for construction. Cyber Security aimed to protect NNSA information assets with a requested budget of $124.3 million for FY2011. The National Nuclear Security Administration's FY2010 funding was $2.137 billion, with increases due to major construction projects returning to the Fissile Materials Disposition program. The FY2011 budget request included further increases for additional construction projects. The FY2011 budget request for the National Nuclear Security Administration included increases for construction projects such as the Pit Disassembly plant and Nonproliferation and International Security programs. The request for FY2011 was $351.6 million for Nonproliferation and Verification R&D program and $155.9 million for international safeguards, export controls, and treaties. International Materials Protection, Control, and Accounting received $590.1 million for FY2011 to reduce the threat posed by unsecured Russian weapons. The International Materials Protection, Control, and Accounting program, funded at $572.1 million in FY2010 and $590.1 million in FY2011, aims to reduce the threat posed by unsecured Russian weapons. The Elimination of Weapons-Grade Plutonium Production program focuses on persuading Russia to shut down nuclear reactors producing weapons-grade plutonium. The Fissile Materials Disposition program aims to dispose of U.S. surplus weapons plutonium by converting it into fuel for commercial power reactors. Funding for this program was controversial due to lack of progress on disposing of Russian plutonium. The Obama Administration requested funding for the Fissile Materials Disposition program to convert U.S. surplus weapons plutonium into reactor fuel. The program also included a similar initiative in Russia, with a focus on disposing of Russian surplus weapon-grade plutonium. The FY2011 budget included funds for the construction of the Savannah River project and research on a gas-turbine modular helium reactor in Russia. The Global Threat Reduction Initiative aimed to convert research reactors worldwide from using highly enriched uranium. The FY2011 budget included funds for the Savannah River project and research on a gas-turbine modular helium reactor in Russia. The Global Threat Reduction Initiative aims to convert research reactors worldwide from using highly enriched uranium. The Office of Environmental Management was established in 1989 to consolidate the cleanup of former nuclear weapons production facilities, including disposal of radioactive waste and decontamination of facilities. The Office of Environmental Management oversees cleanup of nuclear materials, soil and groundwater contamination, and decommissioning of buildings. Cleanup continues at larger, more complex facilities with high-level radioactive waste. Costs to complete cleanup at remaining facilities could range between $192.8 billion and $247.2 billion. Additional funds may be needed for operation and maintenance of cleanup remedies. DOE estimates that completing cleanup at 18 facilities could cost between $192.8 billion and $247.2 billion. Additional funds may be required for ongoing operation, maintenance, and monitoring of cleanup remedies. Some facilities have been transferred to other offices within DOE and the Army Corps of Engineers, including smaller, less contaminated sites under the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP). In 1997, Congress directed the Office of Environmental Management to transfer responsibility for cleanup of smaller, less contaminated facilities under FUSRAP to the Army Corps of Engineers. Once cleanup is complete, the Corps handles activities for the first two years, then jurisdiction is transferred back to DOE. The Office of Legacy Management oversees long-term operation, maintenance, and monitoring at FUSRAP sites and facilities cleaned up under the Office of Environmental Management. Funding for these offices is discussed in three appropriations accounts. The Office of Environmental Management oversees cleanup of facilities under FUSRAP and other programs. Funding for these offices is allocated through three appropriations accounts. In FY2011, a total of $5.69 billion was allocated for the Office of Environmental Management, which was a decrease from the President's request. Additionally, $22.7 million in unobligated balances from previous fiscal years were rescinded. In FY2011, $22.7 million in unobligated balances from previous fiscal years were rescinded for three accounts funding DOE's Office of Environmental Management, including Defense Environmental Cleanup, Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund, and Non-Defense Environmental Cleanup. Cleanup challenges exist at nuclear weapons production facilities like Hanford, Savannah River Site, and Idaho National Laboratory. The Hanford, Savannah River Site, and Idaho National Laboratory are three facilities with complex cleanup challenges due to nuclear weapons production. They require significant funding from DOE's Office of Environmental Management, with cleanup expected to continue for decades. Cleanup at Hanford may not be complete until 2062, at Savannah River Site until 2040, and at Idaho National Laboratory until 2044, due to the substantial volumes of high-level radioactive wastes stored at these sites. The DOE estimates that Hanford, Savannah River Site, and Idaho National Laboratory have significant volumes of high-level radioactive wastes stored in tanks, presenting technical difficulties for disposal. Delays in waste treatment facilities construction raise environmental concerns, with some tanks at Hanford leaking into groundwater. Funding for cleanup efforts is also a growing concern. The DOE monitors water quality in the Columbia River for contaminants from leaked wastes at Hanford. Funding for cleanup of uranium enrichment facilities in KY, OH, and TN is supported by the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund established by the Energy Policy Act of 1992. The Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund was established by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to reimburse licensees for cleanup costs. Congress authorized special assessments from nuclear utilities and federal payments to the fund. The authority expired in 2007, but federal payments have continued through annual appropriations. The Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund was established in 1992 to reimburse licensees for cleanup costs. The authority for utility assessments and federal payments expired in 2007, but federal payments have continued through annual appropriations. Congress is debating whether to reauthorize the utility assessments and federal payment due to insufficient funds for future cleanup costs. The fund currently has $4.5 billion available, but DOE estimates cleanup costs to be between $13.9 billion to $27.7 billion. The President proposed reinstating nuclear utility assessments in the FY2011 budget to increase cleanup resources. The President proposed reinstating nuclear utility assessments in the FY2011 budget to increase cleanup resources. The estimated cost for cleanup is between $13.9 billion to $27.7 billion, while the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund currently has $4.5 billion available. Congress is debating reauthorizing the utility assessments and federal payments to address the shortfall in funds for future cleanup costs. In FY2011, the President requested $730.5 million from the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund for cleanup, with $507.0 million approved in P.L. 112-10. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $550.0 million, citing the need for reauthorization of nuclear utility assessments to generate $200 million in offsetting receipts. The fund has a surplus exceeding the request by a few billion dollars. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $33.6 million for the federal payment to the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund in FY2011, which was significantly lower than the President's request of $496.7 million. The committee noted that additional federal funds may be necessary in the future to ensure cleanup, as required by the Energy Policy Act of 1992. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 requires DOE to pay for cleanup costs even if the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund is depleted. Additional federal funds may be needed for future cleanup of uranium enrichment facilities. Responsibility for long-term maintenance is transferred to DOE's Office of Legacy Management, funded through the Other Defense Activities Account. In FY2011, P.L. 112-10 allocated $788.4 million for the Other Defense Activities Account, with no specified amount for DOE's Office of Legacy Management. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $188.6 million for the Office of Legacy Management, which is expected to see increased funding needs as nuclear weapons production facilities are cleaned up and transferred for long-term operation. DOE's Power Marketing Administrations were established to sell power from dams operated by the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers. The Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) were established to sell power from dams operated by the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers. PMAs prioritize \"preference customers\" like municipal utilities and cooperatives, selling power at low rates to cover expenses and repay debt. The Obama Administration's FY2011 request for PMAs was $118.5 million, a 4% decrease from FY2010. The Obama Administration's FY2011 request for the Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) was $118.5 million, a 4% decrease from FY2010. The budget request reclassified receipts from PMAs from mandatory to discretionary, offsetting expenses for WAPA, SWPA, and SEPA. SWPA requested $12.7 million and WAPA requested $105.5 million in discretionary funding. SEPA's receipts are expected to cover operating costs in FY2011. Additionally, $220,000 was requested for Falcon and Amistad operations and maintenance, with $23 million from Colorado River basins as an offset. P.L. 112-10 appropriated the requested amount with a 0.2% rescission. The Obama Administration's FY2011 budget request for the Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) was $118.5 million, a 4% decrease from FY2010. SWPA requested $12.7 million and WAPA requested $105.5 million in discretionary funding. Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) is a self-funded agency under authority granted by P.L. 93-454 and receives no appropriations. BPA's borrowing authority was increased to $4.45 billion in FY2003. ARRA further increased BPA's borrowing authority to $7.7 billion. The FY2011 budget proposed Bonneville accrue expenditures for operating expenses, projects funded in advance, capital investments, and capital transfers. ARRA provided $10 million in non-reimbursable appropriations to WAPA. The budget for Bonneville Power Administration includes $77 million for operating expenses, $758 million for capital investments, and $387 million for capital transfers. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) provided $10 million in non-reimbursable appropriations to Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) for activities authorized in section 402. WAPA also received borrowing authority from the United States Treasury for building new transmission lines. Independent agencies funded by the Energy and Water Development bill include the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC), and the Denali Commission. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requested $1.053 billion for FY2011, a decrease of $13.3 million from the previous year. The budget included $272.5 million for new reactor activities to handle new nuclear power plant license applications prompted by volatile fossil fuel prices and incentives from the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requested $1.053 billion for FY2011, with $272.5 million allocated for new reactor activities to handle new nuclear power plant license applications. Electric utilities and generating companies applied for licenses for 30 reactors since September 2007, with some projects suspended. The NRC's proposed budget also included $10 million from the Nuclear Waste Fund for licensing DOE's Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, which the Obama Administration wants to cancel. The funding request would cover costs related to adjudicating the license withdrawal motion and closing Yucca Mountain licensing support activities. The NRC's FY2011 budget request included funding for adjudicating the license withdrawal motion and closing Yucca Mountain licensing support activities. The budget also covered activities for operating reactors, including safety inspections, license renewals, and security oversight. Homeland security spending within the NRC was set to increase by $3.8 million in FY2011. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 extended NRC's budget offset requirement to 90% by fees on licensees. Expenditures from the Nuclear Waste Fund, homeland security, and DOE defense waste oversight are not subject to the offset. The FY2011 request includes offsets resulting in a net appropriation decrease to $138.3 million. P.L. 112-10 provides for a net appropriation of $138.1 million, including the inspector general's office."
