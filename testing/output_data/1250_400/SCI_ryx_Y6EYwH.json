A differentially private estimator is proposed to address this issue, providing strong privacy guarantees while maintaining good utility. The method can be extended to provide confidence intervals and test statistics without extra privacy budget. The disclosure of user-level data from published survival function estimates is highlighted as a privacy risk. The study focuses on the privacy risks associated with disclosing sensitive patient data through published survival function estimates. The survival function is used in various domains, including healthcare, where information leakage is a serious issue. The Kaplan-Meier estimator is used for survival function estimation. The study focuses on privacy risks related to disclosing sensitive patient data in survival function estimates, particularly in the healthcare domain. The Kaplan-Meier estimator is commonly used for survival function estimation in clinical research, with no existing model providing formal privacy guarantees for this method. To the best of our knowledge, there is no model that offers formal privacy guarantees for estimating survival functions using the Kaplan-Meier method. Existing related work focuses on perturbation for regression modeling of discrete time-to-event data, limited to multivariate regression models. Generative models like differentially private GANs could be used to generate synthetic data for survival function estimation, but they do not perform well with small sample sizes and constrained dimensionalities. A novel differentially private method is proposed for estimating survival functions based on the KM method, addressing privacy risks in disclosing sensitive patient data. We propose a differentially private method for estimating survival functions based on the Kaplan-Meier method. Our method guarantees privacy while providing estimation of survival functions, confidence intervals, and test statistics without extra privacy cost. It extends to estimating competing risk cumulative incidence functions and has been validated on nine clinical datasets. The method is released as an R package for easy adoption. Our proposed method for estimating survival functions ensures privacy while providing accurate estimates, confidence intervals, and test statistics. It extends to competing risk cumulative incidence functions and has been validated on nine clinical datasets. The method is available as an R package for easy adoption. The survival function models time to event data, accounting for censored observations, and estimates the probability of an event not occurring by a certain time. The survival function estimates the probability of an event not occurring by a certain time using parametric or non-parametric methods. The Kaplan-Meier estimator is commonly used in clinical literature, defining the survival function based on distinct failure times and the number of failures at each time point. The KM estimator of the survival function is defined based on distinct failure times and the number of failures at each time point. It results in a \"step\" function, characteristic of the KM estimate. Differential privacy ensures privacy by making randomized algorithms behave similarly on similar input datasets, with smaller values of (\u03b5, \u03b4) providing stronger privacy guarantees. The method introduces differentially private estimation of the survival function using the Kaplan-Meier's method. It follows the principles of differential privacy to ensure privacy and shows that the estimate is immune to post-processing, maintaining privacy guarantees. Our method introduces differentially private estimation of the survival function using the Kaplan-Meier's method. It ensures privacy by following basic principles of differential privacy. By creating a dataset matrix with event and at-risk numbers for unique time points, we can estimate various statistics in a differentially private way without extra privacy budget. Our method introduces differentially private estimation of the survival function using the Kaplan-Meier's method. It ensures privacy by following basic principles of differential privacy. A dataset matrix is created with event and at-risk numbers for unique time points, allowing for estimation of various statistics in a differentially private manner. The algorithm presented simplifies the process with minimal changes required for differential privacy, making it easily implementable with existing software packages. Algorithm 1 introduces differentially private estimation of survival function using the Kaplan-Meier method. It simplifies the process with minimal changes required for privacy, making it easily implementable. The method provides formal privacy guarantees and can be extended for estimating other associated statistics. The L1 sensitivity of the method is established as two, ensuring -differential privacy. The L1 sensitivity of the method is two, ensuring -differential privacy. Algorithm 1 is -differentially private by adding Laplace noise. The approach can be easily extended to other essential statistics with privacy guarantees. The approach ensures differential privacy by adding Laplace noise, with easy extension to other essential statistics like confidence intervals and test statistics for survival function estimates. The privacy guarantees are formally defined, with a focus on providing differentially private counterparts for confidence intervals and test statistics in group comparisons. Confidence intervals are calculated point-wise to reflect uncertainty in estimates. Confidence Intervals for survival function estimates are calculated in a \"point-wise\" fashion, ensuring differential privacy by using Laplace noise. The calculations for obtaining these intervals are proven to be differentially private, with a focus on Greenwood's linear-point-wise confidence intervals. The confidence intervals for \u015c(t) are -differentially private, making use of the post-processing theorem. No additional access to sensitive data is needed for calculating these differentially private confidence intervals. The confidence intervals for survival function estimates are differentially private, calculated using Laplace noise. The Logrank test for hypothesis testing is also shown to be differentially private. Using Algorithm 6, the Logrank test for hypothesis testing is proven to be -differentially private. By replacing sensitive quantities with their differentially private counterparts, the test statistic Z becomes differentially private. This allows for outputting confidence intervals and test statistics without using additional privacy budget. After proving the Logrank test to be -differentially private using Algorithm 6, Algorithm 1 can be used to extend privacy to competing risk scenarios. Competing events, such as death before progression to AIDS, require specialized estimates like competing risk cumulative incidence. Theorem 5 states that this estimate is -differentially private, similar to the Kaplan-Meier estimator. Using Algorithm 1, we can extend privacy to competing risk scenarios. The competing risk cumulative incidence is proven to be -differentially private. This estimate extends the Kaplan-Meier estimator and ensures privacy for associated statistics like confidence intervals and hazard ratios. Additionally, our method provides a differentially private version of the Nelson-Aalen estimate of the cumulative hazard. The method extends privacy to competing risk scenarios, ensuring privacy for statistics like hazard ratios. The differentially private version of the Nelson-Aalen estimate of the cumulative hazard is also provided. The empirical evaluation on nine real-life clinical datasets is presented, comparing the approach to the non-private version. The evaluation on nine real-life datasets compares the differentially private survival function estimation to the non-private version, showing little utility loss with increased privacy budget. In Figure 1, the private estimation of the survival function is shown, with the green line representing the privacy-preserving estimate closely matching the original black line. The estimation deteriorates with increased privacy budget, as indicated by the orange line. The method provides good utility while protecting privacy, but smaller datasets result in worse estimation due to the need for larger noise to ensure privacy. The differentially private estimation deteriorates with increased privacy budget for small datasets, requiring larger noise for privacy protection. However, for moderate to medium-sized datasets, good results are achieved even in the high privacy regime. The median survival time and confidence intervals are important estimates reported with the survival function. Our method shows high precision in estimating the median survival time, even in the high privacy regime. In some cases, such as Myeloid and Ovarian datasets with high survival rates, upper bounds on confidence intervals cannot be estimated. Precision increases with larger dataset sizes. Our method accurately estimates the median with high precision, even in high privacy settings. In cases with high survival rates like Myeloid and Ovarian datasets, upper bounds on confidence intervals cannot be determined. Precision improves with larger dataset sizes. Differentially private estimation performs comparably to non-noisy estimation, even in high privacy scenarios. Test statistic Z follows a \u03c72 distribution with one degree of freedom, maintaining statistical significance thresholds. For cumulative incidence, our method shows good utility while safeguarding individual privacy. Our proposed method accurately estimates cumulative incidence with competing risk information while protecting privacy. Various works have explored differentially private methods for regression modeling, including a limited approach for survival analysis. Nguy\u00ean & Hui (2017) developed a differentially private regression model for survival analysis, limited to multivariate regression models. Differentially private generative models like generative adversarial networks are not suitable for survival function estimation. Their method allows for estimation of survival function and other statistics with good privacy-utility trade-off, demonstrated on nine real-life datasets including cancer survival data. The proposed method for survival analysis provides good privacy-utility trade-off, as demonstrated on nine real-life datasets including cancer, Gehan, kidney, and Miller Jr datasets. These datasets involve survival data for patients with advanced lung cancer, leukemia patients, kidney patients, and subjects with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. The dataset includes information on survival in various medical trials, such as monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, acute myeloid leukemia, ovarian cancer, Stanford heart transplant data, and lung cancer treatment regimens. Time is measured in months, and groups compared include males vs females, maintenance chemotherapy given or not, treatment arms, age groups, and different treatment groups. The curr_chunk discusses transplant data from various medical trials, including lung cancer treatment regimens and liver transplant waiting lists. The datasets involve events such as receipt of a liver transplant, death, and censoring. The results show the differential private estimation of competing risk cumulative incidence functions. The curr_chunk discusses the excellent performance of a differentially private extension in estimating competing risk cumulative incidence functions. The proof shows that Algorithm 1 is -differentially private. The results are visually represented in Figure 2, demonstrating the method's accuracy in estimating competing risk cumulative incidence while ensuring strong privacy guarantees.
