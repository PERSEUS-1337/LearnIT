    "content": "The \"After School Education and Anti-Crime Act of 2001\" aims to improve academic and social outcomes for students, reduce juvenile crime, and decrease the risk of youth becoming victims of crime by offering productive activities during after school hours. Congress finds that today's youth face greater social risks, spend more time unsupervised, and are most at risk of violence between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. Academic failure consequences are dire, and after school programs help address social issues. Governors and law enforcement support increasing after school programs. Many governors and law enforcement officials advocate for increasing after school programs to provide safe and positive learning environments for school-age children and teens in the United States. The Act aims to enhance students' academic success, create safe after-school environments, offer alternatives to negative activities, and reduce juvenile crime. It also amends the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Act to increase program authorization. Section 10904 of the Century Community Learning Centers Act is amended to require recipients to provide a minimum of 35% of the annual project cost from sources other than federal funds, and a maximum of 25% from funds provided by the Secretary under other federal programs. The Century Community Learning Centers Act now requires recipients to provide 35% of the annual project cost from non-federal sources and up to 25% from funds provided by the Secretary under other federal programs. Recipients must also maintain their fiscal effort from non-federal sources each year for activities funded under this part. SEC. 7. USES OF FUNDS. Section 10905 of the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Act is amended to allow grants for establishing or expanding community learning centers that offer various activities, including job skills preparation. After school programs must include mentoring, academic assistance, recreational activities, and technology training, with the option to include drug prevention, health counseling, and job skills preparation activities. After school programs funded under the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Act must include activities like mentoring, academic assistance, recreational activities, and technology training. Additionally, they may offer drug, alcohol, and gang prevention activities, health and nutrition counseling, and job skills preparation. At least two-thirds of the funding for each fiscal year must be used for after school programs, which can also provide expanded opportunities for children and youth. The 21st Century Community Learning Centers Act amends Section 10905 to include provisions for administration, such as involving volunteers from various communities, engaging youth in designing activities, conducting outreach, requesting donations, and collaborating with park and recreation agencies to avoid duplication of activities. SEC. 9. Community Learning Center defined as including law enforcement organizations like the Police Athletic and Activity League. SEC. 10.
