    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"United Nations Accountability Act of 2004\". Congress finds allegations of mismanagement, fraud, and corruption in the United Nations Oil-for-Food program, as identified in audits by the United Nations Office of Internal Oversight Services. The audits revealed inadequate management of contracts and failure to adhere to contractual duties by the inspection services contractor in Iraq. The OIOS audit found that the contractor did not adhere to certain provisions of the contract, including failing to maintain required staffing levels, overcharging the United Nations, engaging in unprofessional conduct, and reporting inaccurate figures for goods. The United Nations Office of Iraq Programs was criticized for not managing contracts effectively and lacking oversight in the absence of a contract manager. The United Nations policy is to not release OIOS audit reports to member states, and access to audits of the Oil-for-Food Program was denied to the United States. The United Nations policy of not releasing OIOS audit reports to member states, including denying the United States access to audits of the Oil-for-Food Program, undermines member states' ability to fulfill their responsibilities. The text urges the President to ensure that OIOS audit reports are shared with member states of the United Nations. Additionally, a report on financial disclosure rules for UN officials must be submitted to congressional committees within 180 days. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to the Oil-for-food program and the Office of Internal Oversight Services established by the United Nations. The appropriate congressional committees are also specified. The curr_chunk defines \"appropriate congressional committees\" as specific committees in the House of Representatives and Senate."
