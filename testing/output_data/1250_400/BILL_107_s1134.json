    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Venture Capital Gains and Growth Act of 2001\" and includes modifications applicable to qualified small business stock. The \"Venture Capital Gains and Growth Act of 2001\" includes amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986:\n- Repeal of Minimum Tax Preference by striking paragraph (7) in subsection (a) of section 57.\n- Increase in Rollover Period for Qualified Small Business Stock from 60-day to 180-day.\n- Reduction in Holding Period for gains from certain small business stock from 5 years to 3 years. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to reduce the holding period for gains from certain small business stock from 5 years to 3 years. Additionally, the per-issuer limitation on taxpayer's eligible gain is repealed, and modifications are made to the qualified trade or business requirements and working capital limitations. (f) Other Modifications include amending the working capital limitation to 5 years and removing the last sentence. An exception from redemption rules is added for purchases with a business purpose. (g) Increased Exclusion is also addressed in section 1202 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The corporation must show a business purpose for the purchase, and the main goal should not be to avoid limitations. Section 1202 of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to increase the exclusion from 50% to 100%. Various conforming amendments are made to related sections. Paragraph (9) of section 1(h) of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to remove certain gain descriptions and redesignate paragraphs. Section 1202 is also amended to change the heading from \"partial\" to \"100-percent\" exclusion for gains from small business stock. The amendment to section 1202 of the Internal Revenue Code changes the exclusion for gains from small business stock from \"partial\" to \"100-percent\" and increases the eligibility threshold for larger businesses from $50,000,000 to $300,000,000. Additionally, stock held among members of a controlled group is not eligible for the exclusion. The exclusion for gains from small business stock is changed to \"100-percent\" and the eligibility threshold for larger businesses is increased to $300,000,000. Stock held within a controlled group is not eligible for the exclusion. The cost-of-living adjustment for the taxable year is determined based on the calendar year 2001. Any adjusted amount not a multiple of $10,000 will be rounded to the nearest multiple of $10,000. These amendments apply to stock issued after the enactment of the Act."
