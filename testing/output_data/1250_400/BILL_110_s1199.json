    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nanotechnology in the Schools Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings section. The rapidly growing field of nanotechnology is generating breakthroughs that will benefit society by improving design and production. Nanotechnology is expected to have a positive impact on security, economy, and health in the US. To maximize benefits, the US must maintain leadership in nanotechnology despite competition from other nations. Foreign students on temporary visas earned a significant percentage of science and engineering doctorates in the US in 2003. Foreign students on temporary visas earned a significant percentage of science and engineering doctorates in the US in 2003, with many intending to return to their home countries after completing their studies. To maintain leadership in nanotechnology, the US must invest in educating its own students in secondary schools and higher education institutions, providing access to necessary scientific tools and training for teachers and professors. The Act aims to enhance US secondary schools and higher education institutions' capacity in nanotechnology by providing grants for necessary scientific tools and training. The Act aims to enhance US secondary schools and higher education institutions' capacity in nanotechnology by providing grants for necessary scientific tools and training. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines \"eligible institution\" as a public or charter secondary school offering advanced placement or international baccalaureate science courses, a community college, or a 4-year institution of higher education. It also defines terms like \"institution of higher education\" and \"qualified nanotechnology equipment.\" The term \"qualified nanotechnology equipment\" refers to equipment used for teaching nanotechnology in the classroom, manufactured in the US with at least 50% domestic materials. The program authorized under Section 4 focuses on qualified nanotechnology equipment for teaching purposes, emphasizing the use of equipment made in the US with at least 50% domestic materials. The Director of the National Science Foundation will establish a nanotechnology in schools program to strengthen institutions' capacity to teach nanotechnology. Grants of up to $150,000 will be awarded for acquiring equipment, providing educational services, and offering teacher education and certification. The program aims to provide teacher education and certification in nanotechnology for students and faculty seeking approved degrees. Only a quarter of the grant funds can be used for software, educational services, or teacher education. Grants can only be used in undergraduate programs at community colleges or higher education institutions. Eligibility for grants is based on applications and selection criteria. The grant funds awarded under this Act can only be used in undergraduate programs at community colleges or higher education institutions. Eligible institutions must submit an application to the Director and follow the selection criteria outlined in the Act. The Director will establish a procedure for accepting applications within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Director will select eligible institutions for grants based on geographic diversity, historical Black colleges and universities, minority institutions, and institutions in EPSCoR states. Matching requirements and limitations apply to grant awards. The Director selects eligible institutions for grants based on geographic diversity, historical Black colleges and universities, minority institutions, and institutions in EPSCoR states. Grants require non-Federal contributions equal to 1/4 of the grant amount, with a waiver for institutions with low endowments. The Director can waive the matching requirement for institutions with low endowments. Branches or other eligible institutions that receive grants over $100,000 cannot apply for another grant under this Act for 2 years. SEC. 5. ANNUAL REPORT AND EVALUATION. Each institution receiving a grant must submit a report on grant fund usage within a year. The Director will review these reports annually and evaluate the program every third year. A report to Congress with recommendations on the program's Federal support is required within six months of the evaluation. The Director must submit a report to Congress with recommendations on the Federal support of the program within six months of evaluating institutions. Authorization of appropriations for the Director to carry out the Act includes $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2008 and necessary sums for fiscal years 2009 through 2011."
