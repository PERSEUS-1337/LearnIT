    "content": "In recent years, there has been interest in increasing financial support for individuals pursuing non-degree instructional and work-based learning programs, such as apprenticeships and certificate programs. There is a growing demand for workers in jobs that require training or postsecondary education but not a college degree. Despite the federal government providing over $100 billion in financial aid for postsecondary education annually, most of these funds do not support non-degree programs. The federal government provides over $100 billion in financial aid for postsecondary education annually, but most of these funds do not support non-degree programs. Some traditional colleges are exploring creative approaches to increase enrollment, including offering short programs for quick reentry into the workforce. Congress may consider providing direct federal support to students pursuing non-degree programs to meet the demand for workers with specific credentials. Congress may consider providing direct federal support to students pursuing non-degree programs to meet the demand for workers with specific credentials. Recent proposals aim to increase federal support for short-term non-degree programs, such as the College Affordability Act (H.R. 4674) which expands Pell Grant eligibility for these programs. Additionally, options have been presented to bring individuals back into the workforce with necessary skills, including providing unemployment benefits for training and offering Pell Grants for short-term programs. In 2018, the President's Council of Economic Advisers proposed options to bring 25- to 64-year-olds back into the workforce with necessary skills to boost economic growth. Suggestions included providing unemployment benefits for training, expanding Pell Grants to short-term programs, and creating a retraining program for displaced workers. Some stakeholders support extending Pell Grants to shorter programs, but concerns exist about the quality and effectiveness of non-degree programs in improving employment outcomes. Some concerns exist regarding the quality and effectiveness of non-degree programs in improving employment outcomes. Issues include federal oversight, high costs, potential income inequalities, and diminishing labor market returns for technical non-degree programs. Employers are increasingly favoring degree holders, posing challenges for non-degree credential holders in securing jobs. Non-degree educational programs may not be preferred by employers who are increasingly relying on degrees for hiring. This could lead to challenges for non-degree holders in securing employment. Federal programs supporting non-degree training and education are discussed in this report to consider policy approaches for this sector. The report discusses the landscape and key characteristics of non-degree programs, including work-based learning and formal instructional methods. It also details federal programs and tax benefits providing financial support to students in non-degree programs, highlighting gaps and limitations in support. The report highlights gaps in federal programs supporting individuals in non-degree programs, emphasizing the importance of non-degree credentials for economic growth. Data shows that 6.2% of jobs require a non-degree postsecondary credential. Approximately 6.2% of jobs in the national economy require a non-degree postsecondary credential, with mean annual wages for these occupations being similar. However, there are earnings differentials within these categories, with some research showing earnings premiums for individuals with long-term certificates in technical and health fields. Postsecondary non-degree programs provide training primarily to individuals beyond typical secondary education age, preparing them for specific occupations. These programs may be instructional or work-based, combining postsecondary courses to fulfill educational or professional requirements. Non-degree instructional programs prepare individuals for specialized jobs and general employment by offering postsecondary courses or curriculum without awarding a degree. Upon completion, individuals receive a postsecondary educational certificate to expand knowledge, skills, prepare for further education, employment, or promotion. These programs exclude postbaccalaureate certificates. Non-degree instructional programs provide specialized job training and general education without awarding a degree. These programs help individuals expand knowledge, skills, prepare for further education, employment, or promotion. They exclude postbaccalaureate certificates and are different from certifications and licenses. Non-degree instructional programs offer specialized job training and general education without awarding a degree. They are provided by various entities such as colleges, trade schools, businesses, and government organizations. These programs vary in length and can range from a few days to over two years, depending on curriculum requirements and industry expectations. In AY 2009-2010, there were over 4,500 for-profit non-traditional postsecondary educational institutions enrolling almost 670,000 students. Non-degree instructional programs vary in length, related to curriculum requirements, industry expectations, and skills instilled. Program duration may be affected by federal, state, and private entities, and can be broken into stackable units. Programs are offered in various formats, and students must fund program costs and related expenses. Non-degree instructional programs are offered in various formats, including classrooms, online, and through correspondence. Students are responsible for funding program costs, living expenses, and lost wages. The average cost for tuition and fees at public less-than-two-year colleges was over $9,000, and approximately $15,000 at private institutions in AY2018-2019. Credit courses and noncredit courses may be offered for the same vocational objective, with credits earned being transferable to other programs. Credit programs offer courses that can be transferred for credit at different institutions, while noncredit programs do not offer transferable credits but may provide vocational certificates. Noncredit programs are more affordable, cover a wider range of topics, and can be quickly adapted to industry needs. Noncredit programs are less expensive, cover a broader range of topics, and can be quickly adapted to industry needs. They may satisfy career entry requirements, offer ABE and ESL instruction, provide personal enrichment, and customized training. Approximately 38% of enrollments in one state community college system were in noncredit courses. National data on non-degree instructional programs are incomplete, with some states and the federal government not collecting data. A 2016 survey found that 8% of adults aged 16-65 had a postsecondary certificate. The 2016 survey found that 8% of adults aged 16-65 had a postsecondary certificate. Work-based learning includes various training activities to impart workplace skills, occurring at different career stages and forms. Work-based learning in the federal context includes various types such as on-the-job training, apprenticeships, internships, and earn and learn programs. Registered Apprenticeship (RA) programs, overseen by the Department of Labor (DOL), must meet federal standards and include a work process schedule outlining competencies. RA programs are reviewed every five years to maintain registration. Work-based learning encompasses a broad range of training activities offered by various entities like employers, labor unions, training providers, and educational institutions. Programs must include a work process schedule and are reviewed every five years to ensure compliance with standards. Deregistration may occur if there is persistent failure. Work-based learning programs, such as Registered Apprenticeship (RA) programs, can be structured by labor unions, training providers, or educational institutions. RA programs typically last four years and include supervised on-the-job training (OJT) along with related instruction. The costs of these programs are usually covered by the provider. Work-based learning programs, like Registered Apprenticeship (RA) programs, verify skill attainment through demonstrating proficiency. Hybrid programs combine time-based and competency-based approaches. RA program designs must include related instruction. Program costs are primarily covered by the provider, but trainees may need to cover living costs. Costs may include lost work time, trainer fees, and trainee wages. Trainees may need to pay for related instruction. Data on work-based training are limited and vary in methodology and purpose. Some trainees may not receive remuneration and must provide for their own expenses. In the 1990s, government surveys showed that while most establishments offer training, only 16% to 70% of workers receive it. A 2016 survey found that 21% of adults aged 16-65 completed work-based learning programs, with healthcare and teaching being the most common fields. The Department of Labor reported 633,000 active apprentices in about 25,000 programs in FY2019. The Department of Labor reported approximately 633,000 active apprentices in about 25,000 programs in FY2019, with healthcare and teaching being the most common fields for work-based learning programs among adults aged 16-65. The construction industry has the largest share of apprenticeships, but they are also available in industries like manufacturing and transportation. Federal programs provide financial support for training and education to help individuals enter the workforce and reach their potential, although none exclusively focus on non-degree programs. Federal programs like the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) Title I program, federal student aid programs, federal tax benefits, and veterans educational assistance support training and education through non-degree programs. WIOA Title I, administered by the Department of Labor, subsidizes training costs for workforce development. Federal student aid programs provide grants and loans for postsecondary education, while federal tax benefits and veterans educational assistance also offer support. The federal student aid programs, authorized under Title IV of the Higher Education Act, provide grants and loans to students for postsecondary education. The IRS administers tax benefits for post-education financial support. The Department of Veterans Affairs offers programs like the Post-9/11 GI Bill and VET TEC for educational and training support. Additionally, programs like SNAP Employment & Training provide education opportunities for individuals at high risk. The report discusses federal programs that provide training and education assistance to needy families, such as SNAP Employment & Training and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. These programs aim to support individuals at high risk for educational failure and develop a more skilled workforce through training and education. The report also highlights key program design elements and differences among the programs, including those under Title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. The report discusses federal programs under Title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) aimed at increasing coordination among workforce development programs. WIOA Title I, administered by DOL, focuses on increasing employment, earnings, and postsecondary credentials attainment to improve the workforce, reduce welfare dependency, and meet employer skill requirements. Formula grants are provided to states for Adult and Dislocated Worker Employment and Training Activities, with funds allocated to local Workforce Development Boards for specific purposes. The Adult and Dislocated Worker Employment and Training Activities program under WIOA Title I provides formula grants to states, which are then allocated to local Workforce Development Boards for various purposes like establishing a One-Stop delivery system, providing career and training services, building relationships with employers, and developing industry partnerships. WIOA offers consumer choice to participants, with services structured around career services and training. Career services include basic and individualized assistance, while training can be pursued at an Eligible Training Provider of choice listed on the state's ETPL. The WIOA program offers basic and individualized services to participants, including job postings and skills assessment. Eligible participants can pursue training at an Eligible Training Provider of their choice listed on the state's ETPL. Training activities supported by WIOA funds include non-degree and degree programs, work-based learning, and incumbent worker training for in-demand occupations. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) program supports various training programs, including on-the-job training, customized training, and incumbent worker training for occupations in demand. Training must lead to industry-recognized certificates, licenses, degrees, employment, or skill gains. Local areas can allocate up to 20% of funds for incumbent worker training. WIOA ensures universal access to career services for adults aged 18 and older in the United States. Under WIOA, local areas can reserve up to 20% of adult and dislocated worker funds for incumbent worker training. The program provides universal access to career services for adults aged 18 and older, without the need for specific qualifying characteristics. Individualized career services are offered to help individuals secure and maintain employment. Eligibility for training requires the individual to demonstrate the need for training to achieve economic self-sufficiency, possess the necessary skills for successful participation, choose a training service linked to a local occupation in demand, and not be able to access other grant assistance for training. Under WIOA, local areas allocate funds for adult employment and training activities, prioritizing recipients of public assistance, low-income individuals, and those with basic skills deficiencies for career and training services. One-Stop operators assess individuals for access to training services based on their skills, qualifications, and economic self-sufficiency needs. The discretion to allocate funds among priority groups lies with the local WDB in consultation with the state's governor. Under WIOA, local areas prioritize recipients of public assistance, low-income individuals, and those with basic skills deficiencies for career and training services. Training can be provided through ITAs or contracts, with funds also available for supportive services like child care and transportation. Local WDBs have the authority to set limits on training type, duration, and ITA amounts based on individual circumstances. Local WDBs, in consultation with the One-Stop operator, have the authority to set limits on training type, duration, and ITA amounts. WIOA participants can use ITA funds for non-degree instructional and degree programs, as well as supportive services like transportation and child care. Training can be provided through the ITA model or a contract for services with employers or RA sponsors. Local WDBs can provide training through a contract for services with employers or RA sponsors, including various forms of work-based learning. The contract is an agreement for occupational training for WIOA participants in exchange for reimbursement. It may be used if consumer choice requirements are met, and for services like OJT, RA, customized training, incumbent worker training, or transitional employment. The local WDB may determine the need for training providers, effectiveness of local training programs, or the appropriateness of contracting for multiple individuals in in-demand occupations. Reimbursement rates can be up to 50% of the wage rate, or 75% in limited circumstances. State and local WDBs can also enter into contracts with RA sponsors. Local WDBs can provide training through contracts with employers or RA sponsors for in-demand occupations. Reimbursement rates can be up to 50% of the wage rate, or 75% in limited circumstances. State and local WDBs can also enter into contracts with RA sponsors for apprentice wages reimbursement. Quality assurance for training providers is established through eligibility processes. The governor and state WDB establish criteria for eligible training providers to receive funding. RA programs are automatically eligible for state ETPL inclusion. Non-RA training providers must meet specific criteria to receive funding. The governor and state WDB establish criteria for eligible training providers to receive funding. RA programs are automatically eligible for state ETPL inclusion. Non-RA training providers must apply for initial eligibility and follow procedures for continued eligibility. Local WDBs have discretion on specific factors such as the length of OJT contracts and determining employer eligibility for WIOA incumbent worker training funding. The length of OJT contracts is determined by local WDBs based on occupation, training content, and participant's work experience. WIOA requires consideration of individual characteristics and training impact on competitiveness without setting specific targets. ETPs and states must report program participation and outcomes, while RA programs do not need to submit ETP performance reports. Providers must report participant performance and cost information every two years to maintain eligibility under WIOA Title I. The WIOA Title I program requires reporting on performance and cost information for participants, including employment rates, earnings, credential attainment, type of credentials received, cost of attendance, and program completion rates. States must publish annual ETP performance reports, and governors may request additional performance data for continued eligibility. The WIOA Title I program mandates annual ETP performance reports with specific performance data on participants, including training services, costs, barriers to employment, and demographics. The first report is pending, but some participation data is available, showing significant adult and dislocated worker participation in work-based learning in 2017. The WIOA Title I program requires annual ETP performance reports with detailed participant data by demographics and training services. Data from 2017 shows high participation in work-based learning, with a majority of participants being adults aged 30 and over, unemployed or facing layoffs. Many participants have no postsecondary education experience, but a notable percentage have a degree. Training services in 2018 mainly focused on skills training and upgrading through non-degree programs, with popular occupations including healthcare, transportation, and production. Less than 20% of participants engage in work-based learning under contract. In program year 2018, fewer than 20% of WIOA Title I participants engage in work-based learning. The majority pursue skills training through non-degree instructional and degree programs with ITAs. Popular occupations for adults include healthcare, transportation, and production, while dislocated workers focus on transportation, computer, office support, and management. WIOA Title I supports adult workforce entry by providing career services and short-term training. Recommendations for improvement include increasing access to non-degree training, additional funding for wage reimbursement and ITAs, relaxing the 20% limit on incumbent training, and ensuring current workers remain employed despite changing skill requirements. Education pursuits could be bolstered by increasing focus on non-degree training, additional funding for wage reimbursement and ITAs, relaxing the 20% limit on incumbent training, and eliminating restrictions on recipients obtaining other grant assistance. Non-degree program quality may vary due to state and local flexibility in developing the ETPL. Title IV of the Higher Education Act authorizes financial assistance for higher education at certain institutions, administered by the Department of Education. Grants and loans are available to financially needy students. Title IV of the Higher Education Act provides financial assistance for higher education at certain institutions. Grants and loans are available to financially needy students, with Federal Pell Grants and federal student loans being the primary types of aid. Pell Grants and Direct Loan program loans are accessible to all eligible individuals regardless of congressional appropriations. The Direct Loan program is a mandatory entitlement program, while the Pell Grant program is often referred to as a quasi-entitlement. Other smaller aid programs authorized by Title IV are not discussed in this report. The Pell Grant program is considered a quasi-entitlement, providing eligible students with grants regardless of appropriations levels. Pell Grants and Direct Loans can be used for Title IV-eligible programs at various types of institutions. Non-degree programs must meet specific eligibility requirements. Title IV-participating IHEs are classified as public, private nonprofit, proprietary, and vocational institutions. Non-degree programs must meet eligibility requirements, leading to a recognized credential. Title IV aid is not available for noncredit programs. OJT must be supervised by an IHE, with less than 50% offered by a contracted entity. Non-degree programs have specific durational requirements for instructional time and credit hours. Non-degree programs offered by Title IV-participating IHEs must meet specific durational requirements for instructional time and credit hours. For Pell Grants, these programs must be at least 15 weeks long with 600 clock hours or 16 semester hours. For the Direct Loan program, non-degree programs must be at least 10 weeks long with 300-599 clock hours. Students must be enrolled at least half-time to borrow through the Direct Loan program. Nonprofit postsecondary vocational institutions and proprietary institutions must offer programs that are at least 10 weeks long with 300-599 clock hours. Students need to be enrolled at least half-time in an eligible program to borrow through the Direct Loan program. Non-degree programs at public and private nonprofit IHEs that are at least one academic year long and lead to a certificate are eligible for Pell Grants and Direct Loans. Students must meet specific eligibility criteria to receive Title IV funds for higher education. To be eligible for Pell Grants or Direct Loan program loans, students must meet specific criteria including being a U.S. citizen, having a high school diploma or equivalent, and meeting program-specific requirements. Pell Grant recipients must be enrolled in an undergraduate program, demonstrate financial need, and are subject to a lifetime eligibility cap. Direct Loan program loan recipients must be enrolled at least half-time. Additional eligibility criteria may be required for specific Direct Loan programs. To receive Pell Grant aid, students must meet specific criteria and be enrolled in an undergraduate program. Direct Loan program loans have different eligibility requirements, including being enrolled at least half-time. The primary loan types include Direct Subsidized Loans for undergraduates with financial need, Direct Unsubsidized Loans for all students, and PLUS Loans for parents and graduate students. New borrowers after July 1, 2013, have limits on borrowing Direct Subsidized Loans. Title IV aid is limited by statutory rules and cannot exceed a student's cost of attendance. The amount of Title IV aid for which a student is eligible is guided by statutory award rules and cannot exceed the student's cost of attendance (COA). The COA includes tuition, fees, books, supplies, room and board, transportation costs, and dependent care expenses. Pell Grant award rules determine the grant amount without considering other financial assistance. The maximum Pell Grant award for AY 2020-2021 is $6,345 for a full-time student in a 26-30 week academic year. Annual appropriations acts and the HEA establish the maximum Pell Grant award amount for AY 2020-2021 at $6,345 for full-time students. Pell Grant awards may be reduced based on various factors like COA, financial need, enrollment rate, or program duration. Pell Grants for non-degree programs are generally taxable, while those for degree programs are taxable only if used for non-tuition purposes. Direct Loan program rules vary by loan type, with limits based on dependency status and class level. Other types of financial aid must be considered when awarding Direct Loans. The Direct Loan program awards loans based on dependency status and class level, with annual and aggregate limits. For example, a dependent undergraduate student can borrow up to $5,500 in loans for the first year. The Office of Federal Student Aid administers Title IV aid programs, with various actors involved in program administration tasks. The Federal Student Aid (FSA) administers Title IV aid programs, with various actors involved in program administration tasks. FSA handles high-level functions like system maintenance, customer service, and program integrity. Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs) manage day-to-day tasks such as verifying student eligibility, disbursing aid, and managing funds. HEA provisions ensure program quality and protect students and taxpayers. The Pell Grant program under the Department of Education (ED) pays administrative cost allowances to participating Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs). Provisions under the Higher Education Act (HEA) aim to ensure program quality and protect students and taxpayers through the program integrity triad of state authorization, accreditation, and ED certification. Non-degree programs may also need to meet gainful employment requirements. State authorization provides consumer protection, accreditation ensures quality assurance, and ED certification offers direct oversight of Title IV program compliance. An IHE must be authorized within its state to participate in Title IV programs. To participate in Title IV programs, an Institution of Higher Education (IHE) must meet state approval and licensure requirements, which vary among states. States evaluate program curricula, objectives, enrollment projections, student outcomes, and program need justification. Some states require programmatic accreditation or approval by another state agency. In order to participate in Title IV programs, an Institution of Higher Education (IHE) must be accredited by a recognized accrediting agency. These agencies evaluate various criteria such as faculty, curricula, facilities, student support services, and student achievement. Regional or national accreditation is typically sufficient for Title IV program participation. Accrediting agencies evaluate whether an Institution of Higher Education meets criteria for Title IV program participation, including faculty, curricula, facilities, student support services, and student achievement. Programmatic accreditation is optional but can be sought to meet employer and licensure requirements. ED evaluates IHEs for Title IV program participation. Programmatic accreditation evaluates educational programs based on established standards, such as curriculum alignment with professional guidelines. Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs) seeking Title IV program participation must meet certification requirements from the Department of Education (ED), including eligibility criteria for each educational program. New programs must demonstrate Title IV eligibility through self-certification or approval from ED. Non-degree programs must prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation, as defined by 2014 regulations. The HEA requires non-degree programs to prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. The 2014 GE regulations established debt-to-earnings rates for program quality assessment, but were rescinded in 2019. Programs failing to meet D/E rates may lose Title IV eligibility for three years. No program has lost eligibility yet. Programs subject to GE rules must also meet third-party standards for approval. Programs subject to GE rules must meet D/E rates and third-party standards for approval. Failure to meet minimum standards may result in Title IV ineligibility for three years. No program has lost eligibility yet. HEA requires reporting on enrollment, certificates, student charges, and other relevant information. ED collects data on non-degree instructional programs annually. The Higher Education Act (HEA) requires Title IV participating institutions to report information on enrollment, certificates, degrees conferred, student charges, and other relevant data. In the academic year 2017-2018, 4,618 out of 6,418 Title IV-participating institutions offered non-degree for-credit programs. Approximately half of these programs are offered by private for-profit institutions, while over two-thirds of credentials are awarded by public institutions. In the academic year 2015-2016, around 765,000 Pell Grant recipients pursued non-degree credit programs, receiving $2.7 billion in Pell Grant awards. Additionally, about 10% of undergraduates who borrowed a Direct Loan were pursuing certificate programs. In AY2015-2016, approximately 765,000 Pell Grant recipients pursued non-degree credit programs and received about $2.7 billion in Pell Grant awards. Support for non-degree programs is limited to Title IV-participating IHEs and certain eligibility criteria. Non-degree program quality is primarily assessed through the program integrity triad. Non-degree programs are supported by Pell Grants for students without a high school diploma or not in a career pathway program. Quality assessment is done through the program integrity triad, with state authorizers and accreditors having flexibility in criteria application. State authorization requirements vary, hindering assessment of institutional experiences. Researchers highlight potential weaknesses in some states' authorization processes. Researchers have pointed out potential weaknesses in some states' authorization processes, including oversight issues, input requirements hindering innovation, lengthy authorization timeframes, conflicts in state laws for institutions offering programs in multiple states, and few states basing renewal decisions on student outcomes. The accreditation system has strengths such as tailored peer reviews and programmatic alignment, but weaknesses include conflicting interests, lack of resources, and difficulty in assessing innovative education modes. Education tax benefits help offset higher education costs for eligible taxpayers. The education tax benefits, administered by the IRS, provide advantages to upper middle income taxpayers and are claimed when filing federal income tax returns. These benefits offset some higher education costs but are only received after expenses have been paid. Some benefits are available to individuals in non-degree programs, reducing federal revenues. Education tax benefits are available to individuals in non-degree programs, reducing federal revenues. Taxpayers in non-degree programs may be eligible for the Lifetime Learning Credit, a nonrefundable tax credit for 20% of the first $10,000 in qualifying expenses. The Lifetime Learning Credit, Employer Provided Educational Assistance, and 529 accounts are available for education expenses. These options help reduce tax liability and support individuals pursuing education, including non-degree programs at Title IV-eligible institutions. Qualified expenses for the credit include tuition and related expenses, while employer assistance covers a broader range of non-degree programs. The Lifetime Learning Credit allows for employer-provided educational assistance to cover tuition, fees, books, supplies, and equipment for courses that improve job skills. This assistance can be used for non-degree programs and does not have to be work-related or part of a degree program. According to IRS Publication 970, educational assistance can cover various expenses for improving skills, not limited to work-related or degree programs. Employers can pay up to $5,250 for an employee's course without it being included in their wage income. Tax-free withdrawals from 529 accounts are allowed for qualified expenses, including tuition, fees, room and board, books, supplies, and equipment. Training eligibility is separate from tax incentives, which require filing a federal income tax return or being claimed as a dependent or spouse. Participants can claim tax benefits for qualified education expenses paid for themselves, spouses, or dependent children if they file a federal income tax return or are claimed as dependents. The tax credit cannot be claimed if filing as married filing separately, if they are nonresident aliens, or if income exceeds $68,000 ($136,000 if married filing jointly). Employers must offer an educational assistance program for participants to use this tax benefit. Beneficiaries of a 529 account are designated at its establishment, and funds can be transferred to another 529 account for certain relatives. Individuals apply for the LLC when filing their tax return after incurring qualified educational expenses. The Lifetime Learning Credit (LLC) is a tax credit calculated as 20% of the first $10,000 of qualified education expenses, with a maximum credit of $2,000 per taxpayer. The credit phases out for taxpayers with income between $58,000 and $68,000 ($116,000 and $136,000 for married joint filers) in 2019. Employers can provide up to $5,250 in tax-free tuition assistance per year under an educational assistance program. Taxpayers with low income may not benefit much from non-refundable tax credits like the LLC. Employers can offer up to $5,250 in tax-free tuition assistance per year. Funds from 529 accounts can be withdrawn tax-free for education expenses. Taxpayers apply for the LLC by filing their federal tax return. Taxpayers can transfer 529 account balance tax-free to certain relatives. IRS relies on taxpayers, employers, and states for benefit administration. Taxpayers apply for LLC by filing Form 1040 and Form 8863. Employers' educational assistance programs must meet specific requirements. Employers' educational assistance programs must meet specific requirements, including being in written form and not discriminating in favor of certain employees. Employees eligible for the program must receive reasonable notice of its terms. 529 plans are typically sponsored by states, allowing individuals to establish accounts for beneficiaries. Withdrawals from a 529 plan result in a Form 1099-Q showing the total amount withdrawn and the breakdown between earnings and basis. When a taxpayer withdraws from a 529 plan, they receive a Form 1099-Q showing the total amount withdrawn and the breakdown between earnings and basis. If the withdrawal is used for a non-eligible expense, it may be subject to taxation. Taxpayers do not need to document how they spend their withdrawals unless audited. The IRS does not have rules on the quality of education programs for tax benefits. In 2015, 2.5 million taxpayers claimed $2.1 billion of the LLC, with an average credit of $830 per taxpayer. The IRS does not collect or publish measures of non-degree program performance for tax benefits. In 2015, approximately 2.5 million taxpayers claimed $2.1 billion of the LLC tax credit, with an average credit of $830 per taxpayer. Half of the LLC dollars were claimed by taxpayers with AGI between $50,000 and $200,000. No studies have evaluated the impact of the LLC on enrollment in non-degree programs or its effectiveness in improving job skills. Data on employer-provided educational assistance and 529 plans are unavailable. Data from the IRS on employer-provided educational assistance and 529 plans are unavailable. Studies have not evaluated the impact of these benefits on enrollment in non-degree programs or their effectiveness in improving job skills. Research on education tax benefits has shown limited effect on increasing enrollment, highlighting limitations such as delayed assistance and various types of benefits available. The research highlights limitations of education tax benefits for non-degree programs, including delayed assistance and confusion over eligibility. These benefits only help taxpayers with income tax liabilities, excluding many low-income individuals. Veterans education programs have evolved to support servicemembers in civilian life and promote military retention. The benefits for discharged soldiers have evolved over the years to provide reintegration into civilian life, avoid veteran unemployment, and promote military retention. Programs like VET TEC incentivize training providers for program completion and employment. GI Bills and VET TEC offer financial assistance to eligible students enrolled in approved education programs, primarily administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The GI Bills and VET TEC, administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs, provide financial assistance for education and training programs. The Post-9/11 GI Bill is the primary program, supporting degree pursuit, work-based learning, and non-degree instructional programs. Non-degree programs include various courses and apprenticeships aimed at achieving educational or vocational objectives. VET TEC benefits are available for non-degree high-technology programs at contracted training providers. These programs focus on computer programming, software, media application, data processing, and information science. Training providers must meet specific criteria, including not offering degrees and adhering to annual tuition caps set by the VA. Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits are available to eligible servicemembers, veterans, and their family members, but the program is not open to the general public and is not income-based. The VET TEC program offers benefits for non-degree high-technology programs at approved training providers, focusing on computer programming, software, media application, data processing, and information science. Eligibility criteria include being a GI Bill-eligible veteran enrolled full-time in a VET TEC-eligible program. Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits are available to eligible servicemembers, veterans, and their family members, with living stipend payments and program cost coverage. Transfer of benefits to family members is possible, and eligibility extends to spouses and children of servicemembers who die in the line of duty. The VET TEC program offers benefits for non-degree high-technology programs at approved training providers. Eligibility criteria include being a GI Bill-eligible veteran enrolled full-time in a VET TEC-eligible program. Both the Post-9/11 GI Bill and VET TEC provide living stipend payments and payments for program costs. Program costs are paid differently by each program, with VET TEC paying costs during and after pursuit. In addition to payments, personalized counseling is available to help individuals with their career paths and VA benefits. The Post-9/11 GI Bill provides educational assistance payments over 36 months, with options for transferring benefits to family members. Various benefit payments are available based on benefit level, program pursued, enrollment rate, and actual charges. Under the Post-9/11 GI Bill, benefit payments depend on an individual's level of benefits, type of education pursued, enrollment rate, and location. Payments can include tuition, housing allowance, books stipend, tutorial assistance, and test fee reimbursements. In AY2019-2020, a veteran at a private institution could receive up to $24,476.79 for tuition and fees. In AY2019-2020, veterans enrolled in educational programs may receive tuition and fees reimbursement, housing allowance, books and supplies stipend, and test fee reimbursements. Veterans in OJT or apprenticeship programs receive a decreasing housing allowance to offset wage increases.

VET TEC provides payments to veterans and training providers, including a monthly housing allowance similar to the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The VA reimburses training providers for tuition and fees, paying 25% upon enrollment and 25% upon program completion, with the remaining 50% upon employment in a suitable field. Training providers cannot charge tuition and fees directly to VET TEC participants. Eligible individuals apply to the VA for either the Post-9/11 GI Bill or VET TEC, enroll in approved programs, and certifications are made to the VA for payment distribution. The VA verifies eligibility, calculates payment amounts, and distributes payments to eligible individuals and educational institutions. Program quality for GI Bill-approved programs is determined by state approving agencies (SAAs) with oversight from the VA. VET TEC programs focus on participant employment outcomes. The VA and SAAs share responsibility for ongoing oversight to ensure program quality and proper administration of GI Bill benefits. Quality standards apply to each program of education. The quality of programs of education and administration of GI Bill benefits are ensured through statutory and regulatory provisions. Standards have been established in response to reports of poor quality or abuse, with key standards including program objectives, restrictions on independent study, the 85-15 rule, and contractual arrangement restrictions. These standards apply to most programs to maintain quality and integrity. Under the 85-15 rule, no more than 85% of students in a program can have tuition covered by institutional aid or GI Bill. Additional requirements vary by program type, such as facilities, instructor qualifications, and curriculum standards. Programs preparing for licensure must meet specific instructional criteria. Non-degree programs must meet quality standards if not approved by another government agency. The VA determines eligibility for VET TEC programs, which must meet various quality standards and criteria. Payment is based on program completion and finding meaningful employment within 180 days. Key requirements include faculty qualifications, curriculum alignment, and meeting licensure or certification standards. The VET TEC program focuses on program quality and value, with payment based on program completion and finding meaningful employment within 180 days. Key requirements include training providers being licensed or approved, meeting the 85-15 rule, and not offering self-paced programs. The VA is required to report annually on the qualifications earned by participants to assess program effectiveness. Performance measures include program admittance rate, job placement and retention rates, and employment duration in the field of study. The VET TEC program performance measures include program admittance rate, job placement and retention rates for completers, median annual salary, and transfer rates. GI Bill participants mostly pursue degrees over certificates, with a small percentage in OJT or apprenticeship programs. Many approved training providers do not offer degrees, with thousands of locations not awarding any degrees. Approximately 0.4% of Post-9/11 GI Bill participants were pursuing OJT or an apprenticeship. Over 18,000 school locations, 500 flight school locations, and 9,000 OJT/apprenticeship locations did not award any degrees. The most popular certificates completed were in welding, information technology, HVAC, healthcare, and gunsmithing. Program eligibility is limited to individuals who have served in the uniformed services and their family members. Concerns have been raised about the quality oversight process. Program eligibility is limited to individuals who have served in the uniformed services and their family members. Recent examinations found that oversight of the program may be compromised, with limitations on conducting thorough oversight due to funding constraints and lack of controls by SAAs. SNAP, administered by the Department of Agriculture, provides benefits for eligible low-income households to purchase food. Federal funding for SNAP includes benefits and additional funding for SNAP Employment & Training programs. The federal government provides funding for SNAP Employment & Training programs to assist participants in gaining skills for employment. States have the option to make these programs mandatory or voluntary. Each state agency administering SNAP is required to implement an E&T program. The majority of state agencies operate voluntary SNAP Employment & Training programs, which include job search programs, workfare, education, and job retention programs. Funding for these programs includes mandatory funding of nearly $124 million without a state match, as well as federal matching funds for administrative expenses and dependent care. Total funding varies annually based on states' use of matching funds. Since October 2015, USDA-FNS, in partnership with Seattle Jobs Initiative (SJI), has been operating SNAP to Skills, a capacity-building project aimed at providing technical assistance and resources to states for more effective SNAP E&T programs. The project integrates with the WIOA Title I program and must be delivered through the statewide workforce development system. Services can be accessed through WIOA One-Stop centers. The SNAP E&T program must be integrated with the WIOA Title I program and delivered through the statewide workforce development system. SNAP E&T recipients can receive services at WIOA One-Stop centers, with staff experienced in addressing their unique challenges. Services and programs vary by state, with allowable educational activities including basic skills improvement, high school equivalency programs, literacy education, and English as a second language instruction. The SNAP E&T program offers educational activities to enhance job search abilities and employability. Activities include high school or equivalent programs, remedial education, and English as a second language instruction. Education must directly enhance employability and have a link to job readiness. Vocational training, basic education, work experience, apprenticeships, subsidized employment, and unpaid internships are offered. Some states may target services to specific populations. SNAP E&T offers vocational training, basic education, work experience, apprenticeships, subsidized employment, and unpaid internships. Participants must meet income and nonfinancial eligibility criteria. General work requirements are in place for non-disabled adults. The program targets SNAP participants subject to work requirements. Under current law, SNAP participants must meet work requirements, including registering for work, accepting job offers, and maintaining at least 30 hours of work per week. States have flexibility in designing SNAP E&T programs for this population, with the 2018 farm bill now requiring case management services. E&T funds cannot be used for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families cash assistance. The 2018 farm bill requires states to include case management services in SNAP E&T programs. E&T funds cannot be used for TANF cash assistance. Some individuals enrolled half-time or more in an IHE may be ineligible for SNAP, but eligible if in a specified program. SNAP E&T funds cover education costs like dependent care and transportation, administered by state agencies and contracted programs. SNAP E&T funding can cover education costs such as dependent care and transportation, administered by state agencies and contracted programs. Third-party partnerships are encouraged for program development, with federal funds reimbursing partners based on specific criteria. Pell Grant-eligible students must use the Pell Grant as the primary payer for college expenses before utilizing E&T funds for remaining costs. The Pell Grant must be the first payer for college expenses for Pell Grant-eligible students, with E&T benefits covering expenses not included in the Pell Grant. E&T funds can be used for reasonable and necessary expenses, with workforce partnerships added to the program by the 2018 farm bill. Each state designs its SNAP E&T program within federal rules, with varying capacity and services offered. Each state designs its SNAP E&T program within federal rules, with varying capacity and services offered. The 2018 farm bill requires programs to be implemented in consultation with the state workforce development board or private employers. States monitor and assess provider and program quality, with USDA-FNS providing technical assistance. USDA has established a performance indicators reporting process, with the first annual report due in January 2018. The 2014 farm bill mandated USDA to establish performance indicators for SNAP E&T programs. USDA has not yet published a compilation of the reports. The national reporting measures include employment and wages after program completion. Most participants received services other than education, with only 38 states offering an education component in their programs. In FY2016, most SNAP E&T participants received services other than education. Only 38 states offered an education component in their programs, serving almost 70,000 participants. Less than 10% of participants receive education, and information on program quality and subsequent employment outcomes is lacking. Wages earned through SNAP E&T may affect household income and eligibility for benefits. The 2014 farm bill pilot projects evaluation may guide future policymaking. Wages from SNAP E&T could raise household income, affecting eligibility for benefits. TANF aims to assist needy families with children and promote work and marriage. States have flexibility in using TANF funds for various purposes. TANF is a broad-purpose block grant administered by HHS, providing monthly assistance to needy families with children. Funds can be used for a wide range of benefits, services, and activities, including subsidized employment and career pathways. The TANF program allows for a variety of vocational education and training programs to help low-income families with children advance in their careers. State programs may use TANF funds to support coordinators at community colleges who recruit students and provide access to support services. Financial eligibility rules vary among states. TANF funds are used to assist low-income families with children, with eligibility determined by the state. In 2015, a significant portion of adult TANF recipients had limited education. States receive funds from TANF to provide assistance to families based on their own eligibility rules and benefit amounts. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 requires states to determine how funds are spent, including activities for adult recipients. TANF funds are used by states to assist low-income families with children, with eligibility determined by state legislatures. States decide on benefit amounts and required activities for adult recipients. Benefits may be reduced or ended if recipients refuse to participate in required activities, which can include training and education. TANF also provides funding for various support services such as advising, career planning, and employment services, delivered at the state and local level. States determine which participants receive which services, and some may refer recipients to WIOA One Stop Centers for education or employment. State TANF programs may refer assistance recipients to WIOA One Stop Centers for education or employment, but some states operate employment and training services separately. There are no federal rules on the quality of training programs, and states set their own standards. The minimum work participation rate (WPR) is TANF's main performance measure, requiring a percentage of recipients to be working or engaged in activities. States can meet this rate by reducing the cash assistance caseload. Program-wide data is limited. Training in TANF is limited to 12 months in a lifetime, with restrictions on GED counting and work-related activities. States can use TANF funds for child care, but educational barriers hinder non-degree program participation. Most TANF recipients are single mothers with limited education, facing restrictions on vocational training and apprenticeships. The quality of training programs is unknown."
