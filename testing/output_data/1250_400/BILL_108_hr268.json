The United States Weather Research Program Act of 2003 prioritizes research on hurricanes, heavy precipitation, floods, and two-to-fourteen day forecasting to improve weather predictions and warning systems. This includes enhancing landfall location forecasts, hurricane strength predictions, winter and rain storm forecasts, flood forecasting, and advanced data assimilation. The United States Weather Research Program Act of 2003 focuses on improving weather predictions and warnings, conducting research to fill observational gaps, testing advanced data assimilation techniques, assessing societal and economic impacts of adverse weather, and testing research concepts at designated centers. The United States Weather Research Program Act of 2003 aims to improve weather predictions, fill observational gaps, test data assimilation techniques, assess societal and economic impacts of adverse weather, and transfer technology to operational meteorologists through research concepts testing at designated centers. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration leads the US Weather Research Program, coordinating with other federal agencies and entities to develop a five-year plan addressing research needs, dissemination of weather information, and transferring research results to forecasting operations. Reporting requirements are also outlined. The Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration must provide annual reports to specific congressional committees, detailing the five-year plan, funding sources, any plan changes, and an assessment of plan objectives. Authorization of appropriations for the Office of Atmospheric Research of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration includes $15 million for fiscal year 2004, $15.5 million for fiscal year 2005, and $16 million for fiscal year 2006, with at least 50% allocated for grants to institutions of higher education."
