    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Electricity and Environmental Technology Research and Development Act.\" It includes findings related to the development of electricity and environmental technology. Congress finds that reliable, affordable, increasingly clean electricity is crucial for the growing US economy. The increasing use of electrotechnologies, environmental concerns, competitive electricity market, and rising energy prices highlight the importance of clean electricity. Coal, the most abundant fossil energy resource in the US, accounts for over half of electricity generation and can supply the country for 250 years at current rates. Investments in emissions control technology have reduced pollutants from coal-based facilities by 21% in the past 30 years. Investments in emissions control technology have reduced pollutants from coal-based facilities by 21% in the past 30 years. Continuous improvement in efficiency and environmental performance from electricity generating facilities would allow continued use of coal and preserve less abundant energy resources for other uses. New technologies for converting coal into electricity can eliminate health-threatening emissions and improve efficiency by up to 50%, but there is significant risk in the initial commercial deployment of these technologies in a competitive electricity market. Continued research and development are needed for environmental improvement in coal-based generation. Investments in emissions control technology have reduced pollutants from coal-based facilities by 21% in the past 30 years. New coal generation technologies can improve efficiency by up to 50%, but there is significant risk in their initial commercial deployment in a competitive electricity market. Continued research and development towards near-zero emissions in coal-based generation is important and desirable. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"cost and performance goals\" refers to the goals set under section 4. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy. SEC. 4. TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT. The Secretary is required to assess technologies for coal use in electricity generation, chemical feedstocks, and transportation fuel, setting cost and performance goals for 2007, 2015, and 2020. Consultation with various industry representatives and agencies is mandated. The Secretary is mandated to set cost and performance goals for coal technologies, consult with industry representatives and agencies, and submit draft goals for public comment within 120 days of enactment. The final goals must be submitted to Congress within 180 days. SEC. 5. STUDY. The Secretary, in cooperation with other agencies, must provide Congress with a report every two years identifying technologies and assessing costs for achieving goals. Recommendations for technology development programs and additional authorities should also be included. The Department of Energy, in collaboration with industry, should develop and demonstrate technologies to meet cost and performance goals. Recommendations for additional authorities needed to achieve these goals should also be provided, with due consideration given to expert advice. The Secretary will conduct a research and development program on coal-based technologies under various Acts to achieve cost and performance goals. Authorization of appropriations is also provided. Authorization of $100,000,000 annually from 2002 to 2012 for sections 4, 5, and 6. This funding is in addition to existing authorizations and does not limit Department of Energy fossil energy research. Additionally, a Clean Coal Power Commercial Applications Initiative is established. The Secretary will establish a clean coal power commercial applications initiative to demonstrate advanced coal-based technologies for power plants. The technologies must advance efficiency, environmental performance, and cost competitiveness beyond current standards. A plan outlining program elements, management structure, and technical milestones must be submitted to Congress within 120 days of enactment. The Secretary will submit a plan to Congress outlining program elements, management structure, technical milestones, and demonstration activities for advanced coal-based technologies at electric generation units. The plan aims to achieve efficiency improvements and enhance environmental performance. The plan aims to achieve efficiency improvements and enhance environmental performance through significant improvements in environmental control technologies, recycling of coal combustion wastes, and carbon dioxide capture at coal-based generating units. The plan includes capturing, separating, and reusing or disposing of carbon dioxide at coal-based generating units, excluding commercially available practices. The plan includes capturing, separating, and reusing or disposing of carbon dioxide at coal-based generating units, excluding commercially available practices. Financial assistance is provided for this purpose. The Secretary will solicit proposals for projects at new or existing facilities to achieve specified performance levels within 180 days of transmitting the plan to Congress. Proposals may include demonstrating efficiency improvements and emission reductions without increasing pollutants. In the case of sulfur dioxide emissions from coal combustion, the percentage of allowable emissions varies based on the sulfur content of the coal. For nitrogen oxide emissions, different limits apply depending on the type of boiler being used. In the case of coal combustion emissions, the allowable emission levels are specified based on the type of boiler used and the pollutants involved. The emissions must meet certain standards set by the Clean Air Act or be lower if specified by new source performance standards. Additionally, the production of coal combustion byproducts with significant economic value is required. The Secretary will provide financial assistance to projects that demonstrate cost reductions in coal utilization for energy generation, improve coal competitiveness, meet specified criteria, and showcase applicable technologies. The Secretary will provide financial assistance to projects that demonstrate cost reductions in coal utilization for energy generation, improve coal competitiveness, meet specified criteria, and showcase applicable technologies. The Federal share of project costs funded under this section shall not exceed 50 percent. $100,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2002 to 2012 for this purpose, with alternative funding sources available to the Secretary. The Secretary may use unobligated funds for fossil energy programs or funds from clean coal technology projects to carry out this section. Appropriations for each fiscal year will be reduced by the amount used from these alternative funding sources."
