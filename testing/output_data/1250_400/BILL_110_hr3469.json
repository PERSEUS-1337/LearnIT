Cameras in the program are required to function automatically, with motion sensor alerts activating corresponding cameras. Camera views and positions are not fixed, and surveillance videos are captured for monitoring purposes. The Integrated and Automated Surveillance Program utilizes cameras that pan and tilt towards triggered sensors automatically. The cameras do not require manual operation and can be viewed at designated communication centers. A standard process is used to collect intrusion data, and future technology upgrades can be integrated with existing systems. Performance measures are in place to evaluate the program's effectiveness in detecting illegal intrusions along US borders. Plans are developed to enhance response effectiveness.
