    "content": "The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) provides federal funding to states for education of children with disabilities, ensuring a free, appropriate public education (FAPE). Prior to P.L. 105-17 in 1997, states had to ensure participation of children with disabilities in private schools, leading to differences in interpretation among states and courts. The IDEA Amendments of 1997 revised the law regarding the participation of children with disabilities in private schools, rejecting the \"equitable participation\" standard and emphasizing provision for these children in programs assisted by Part B. The IDEA Amendments of 1997 rejected the \"equitable participation\" standard for children with disabilities in private schools, ensuring provision for special education services. The 2004 reauthorization further clarified the responsibilities of LEAs to provide fair and equitable services to these children. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA clarified the responsibilities of LEAs to provide services to children with disabilities in private schools. Changes were made to ensure fair and equitable services, resolving contentious issues. Children with disabilities can be placed in private schools by the LEA or SEA to fulfill the FAPE requirement, with costs covered by the LEA. A child with a disability may be placed in a private school by the LEA or the State Educational Agency (SEA) to fulfill the FAPE requirement, with costs covered by the LEA. Parents can also unilaterally place their child in a private school, but the LEA may not cover the cost unless certain findings are made. IDEA requires some services for children in private schools, even if parents place them there. The 2004 reauthorization made changes for children placed in private schools by parents, while provisions for children placed by public agencies remained unchanged. Children in private schools are entitled to special education and related services consistent with district requirements. Children with disabilities enrolled in private schools by parents are entitled to special education services consistent with district requirements. The 2004 reauthorization added a new requirement that these children must be located in the school district served by the LEA, aiming to streamline services and prevent LEAs from working with private schools across district lines. This change has sparked controversy due to its disproportional impact on LEAs with high concentrations of private schools. The provision to prevent LEAs from working with private schools across district lines has sparked controversy due to its disproportional impact on LEAs with high concentrations of private schools. One requirement is that funds expended by the LEA for parentally placed private school children must be equal to a proportionate amount of federal funds under IDEA. The emphasis is on providing direct services like instructional activities rather than indirect services like professional development for private school personnel. The Senate report emphasizes providing direct services to children with disabilities in private schools, rather than indirect services like professional development. New provisions include calculating the proportionate amount after consultation with private school representatives, allowing services on private school premises, and adding a provision on supplementing funds. The law requires services for children with disabilities in private, including religious schools. P.L. 108-446 added \"religious\" and removed \"parochial.\" Funds must supplement, not supplant, federal funds. Each LEA must report on children evaluated and served. Child find requirements remain the same. New provisions ensure equitable services. The new law, P.L. 108-446, includes provisions for equitable participation, activities, cost, and completion period for finding children with disabilities in private schools. It replaces \"parochial\" with \"religious\" and requires LEAs to consult with private school officials and parents of children with disabilities. Child find activities must ensure accurate counting and be completed in a timeframe comparable to public schools. P.L. 108-446 mandates LEAs to consult with private school officials and parents of parentally placed private school children with disabilities. This consultation includes the child find process, determining federal funds for services, discussing service delivery mechanisms, and providing a written explanation. The new law mandates LEAs to consult with private school officials and parents of parentally placed private school children with disabilities. This consultation includes discussing types of services, apportioning funds, providing written explanations, and requiring a signed affirmation of the consultation. Compliance procedures are also outlined for private school officials to submit complaints to the SEA if meaningful engagement is not achieved. The new law mandates LEAs to consult with private school officials and parents of parentally placed private school children with disabilities. Private school representatives must sign within a reasonable period, or documentation is forwarded to the SEA. Compliance procedures allow private school officials to submit complaints to the SEA if meaningful engagement is lacking. If dissatisfied, complaints can be escalated to the Secretary of Education. Equitable services must be provided by public agency employees or through contract, and must be secular, neutral, and nonideological. The 2004 reauthorization mandates equitable services for pupils attending private schools, to be provided by public agency employees or through contract. Funds for private school pupils are controlled by the public agency. Reimbursement for private school placement of children with disabilities may be reduced or denied if certain notice is not given, with exceptions outlined in the new law. The new law allows for reimbursement of private school placement for children with disabilities to not be reduced or denied if certain notice requirements are not met, with exceptions for situations where the school prevented the parent from providing notice, the parents were unaware of the requirement, or compliance would likely harm the child. Additionally, reimbursement may not be reduced or denied if the parent is illiterate, unable to write in English, or if compliance would result in serious emotional harm to the child. The issue of whether parents are entitled to reimbursement for private school placement even if the child never received special education services from the school district is not specifically addressed in the statute. The Supreme Court's recent decision in Board of Education of the City School District of the City of New York v. Tom F. ruled that parents of a child with a disability are entitled to private school reimbursement, even if the student never received special education services from the school district. This decision does not set a precedent for lower courts, and the issue remains unsettled."
