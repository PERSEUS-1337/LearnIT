    "content": "Public and private health care spending is increasing due to factors like rising enrollment in health insurance and demographic changes. The tax subsidies in the Internal Revenue Code for private and publicly provided health care are often overlooked. These subsidies, known as tax expenditures, confer preferential tax status to certain forms of income, resulting in revenue foregone. Congressional attention to health-related tax expenditures raises questions about their value, changes over time, impact of the Affordable Care Act, and comparison to total revenue collected. The report analyzes historical data on health-related tax expenditure estimates published by the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) to understand changes over time and the impact of the Affordable Care Act. It compares the value of health tax expenditures to total revenue collected and examines federal support for health programs in terms of direct outlays versus revenue losses from tax expenditures. The report relies on the tax expenditure definition and estimation methodology used by the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT), which defines tax expenditures as revenue losses attributable to provisions of the Federal tax laws that allow special exclusions, exemptions, deductions, credits, preferential tax rates, or deferrals of tax liability. JCT uses a modified Haig-Simons baseline definition of income. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) defines tax expenditures as revenue losses from provisions in Federal tax laws that provide special exclusions, exemptions, deductions, credits, preferential rates, or deferrals of tax liability. These provisions cause a deviation from the baseline definition of income, resulting in revenue forgone. JCT categorizes tax expenditures by budget function, such as health, commerce, and energy, and publishes estimates during each session of Congress. The Department of the Treasury also has its own list of tax expenditures by budget function. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) categorizes tax expenditures by budget function, such as health, commerce, and energy. The Department of the Treasury also has its own list of tax expenditures by budget function. The health budget function used by JCT for tax expenditures is broader than that used for outlays by agencies like the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). This is due to historical practices and the challenge of categorizing cross-cutting health provisions. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analyzes tax expenditures by different forms. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) categorizes tax expenditures by budget area and forms, such as exclusions, exemptions, deductions, preferential tax rates, and tax credits. Economists evaluate tax expenditures based on economic efficiency, equity, and administrative simplicity, which can help identify potential impacts on certain groups of people. Academic researchers also categorize tax expenditures in ways that substitute for social policy or economic spending programs. The Congressional Budget Office categorizes tax expenditures by budget area and forms, such as exclusions, exemptions, deductions, preferential tax rates, and tax credits. Economists evaluate tax expenditures based on economic efficiency, equity, and administrative simplicity. Tax expenditures could correct inefficiencies in the health care market while potentially undermining tax progressivity. Administering social programs through the tax code may have advantages for lower-income households but could increase tax filing complexity and administration costs. JCT currently identifies 14 health tax expenditures. Tax expenditures in the health care market can be administered as direct spending or grant programs to reduce administrative costs. JCT identifies 14 health tax expenditures, with the largest being the tax exclusion for employer-sponsored insurance (ESI). The annual expenditure for ESI is projected to increase from $145.5 billion to $169.4 billion from FY2015 to FY2019. The largest tax expenditure in the health care market is the tax exclusion for employer-sponsored insurance (ESI), projected to increase from $145.5 billion to $169.4 billion from FY2015 to FY2019. The second largest health tax expenditure is for subsidies for insurance purchased in the exchanges, estimated to increase from $29.6 billion to $84.8 billion during the same period. These tax provisions subsidize private health insurance costs and activities with positive societal benefits. Some health tax provisions aim to reduce costs of private activities with societal benefits, such as interest exclusion on private activity bonds for nonprofit hospitals and deductions for charitable giving to nonprofit health organizations. These provisions have origins in older tax laws and may have been influenced by other policies. For example, the ESI tax exclusion dates back to 1918. The ESI tax exclusion, originating in 1918, saw significant expansion post-World War II due to administrative decisions. The Internal Revenue Code Act of 1954 excluded employer health contributions from income. JCT data from FY1974 to FY2019 shows changes in health-related tax expenditures. The Code Act of 1954 excluded employer health contributions from income. JCT data from FY1974 to FY2019 shows changes in health-related tax expenditures, including Medicare-related provisions. Multiple tax expenditure provisions are analyzed together to track changes over time, excluding de minimus values. After adjusting for inflation, health-related tax expenditures have increased over time. From FY2004 to FY2014, these expenditures rose by 43.0% in real terms. The annual tax expenditure value for health-related provisions has increased by 11.5% in nominal dollars from FY1974 to FY2014. Post-ACA in 2010, annual growth rates fluctuate around historical averages. The annual value of health tax expenditures is estimated to increase from $210.4 billion. The annual growth rates of health-related tax expenditures have increased by 11.5% in nominal dollars and 7.5% in real dollars on average. The estimated annual value of health tax expenditures is projected to rise from $210.4 billion in FY2015 to $296.2 billion in FY2019. Factors contributing to this growth include changes in demographics, health care costs, and policy changes affecting tax expenditures. Before FY2015, JCT identified Medicare-related tax expenditures as the value of benefits exceeding insurance payments. Medicare benefits are excluded from income tax, but a positive tax expenditure was measured if insurance benefits exceeded enrollees' payments. Tax expenditures for Medicare increased over time, with a 10.2% nominal and 7.7% real annual increase from FY1987 to FY2014. From FY1987 to FY2014, Medicare-related tax expenditures increased by 10.2% (nominal) and 7.7% (real) annually, indicating a higher value of benefits to beneficiaries compared to payments. In FY2014, these provisions accounted for 26.8% of total health tax expenditures, which have risen from 1.9% of total revenue in FY1974 to 8.4% in FY2014. Health tax expenditures are projected to increase to 7.7% in FY2019, with a value of 6.6% in FY2016. The value of health-related tax expenditures has been increasing at a rate higher than total revenue collections. In FY2019, health tax expenditures are estimated to be 7.7% of total revenue, up from 6.4% in FY2015. Various taxes imposed by the ACA, such as the Cadillac tax, individual mandate, employer mandate, and medical device tax, contribute to revenue. Despite these taxes, the revenue generated is small compared to health tax expenditures. Figure 3 shows health-related tax expenditures as a share of GDP from FY1974 to FY2014. The comparison between federal outlays and health-related tax expenditures from FY1974 to FY2014 shows that the costs of Medicare and Medicaid are mostly mandatory. The OMB organizes health budget functions differently from JCT's tax expenditure categories, but tracking federal support to the health sector over time can be useful. The comparison between federal outlays and health-related tax expenditures from FY1974 to FY2014 shows that Medicare and Medicaid costs are mostly mandatory, while health research and veterans' health care are funded through discretionary spending. Health-related tax expenditures historically exceeded health discretionary outlays but were still less than health mandatory outlays. Mandatory outlays for health increased from 1.0% of GDP in FY1974 to 5.0% of GDP in FY2014. Health-related tax expenditures have grown over the years, from 0.3% of GDP in FY1974 to 1.5% in FY2014. Health discretionary outlays remained between 0.3% and 0.5% of GDP from FY1974 to FY2014. The appendix provides a description and legislative origins of each health tax expenditure provision identified by the Joint Committee on Taxation. Tax expenditure provisions for health have a long history in the Internal Revenue Code, with origins in past legal definitions or administrative rulings.
