    "content": "Both House and Senate bills for the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2012 address detainee issues at Guantanamo Bay and counterterrorism measures. The Senate passed S. 1867 on December 1, 2011, incorporating provisions from S. 1253. Differences between the House and Senate versions will be resolved in conference. The White House has criticized aspects of both bills and threatened to veto any legislation that limits the President's authority. The Senate passed H.R. 1540 with provisions from the Senate bill inserted, which will be reconciled with the House version in conference. The White House has criticized both bills and threatened to veto any legislation that limits the President's authority on intelligence collection and detainee handling. The report provides an analysis of the bills' detainee provisions and compares their approaches to key issues. The House and Senate bills aim to confirm and possibly expand the President's detention authority granted after 9/11. The Authorization for Use of Military Force allows the President to use force against those involved in the attacks. Many detainees captured in U.S. operations have been placed in preventive detention to prevent future terrorist activities. Some have faced military commissions for related crimes. The Authorization for Use of Military Force allows the President to detain enemy combatants captured while fighting U.S. forces in Afghanistan, including U.S. citizens, to prevent them from participating in hostilities or terrorist activities. The scope of detention authority conferred by the AUMF is being defined by lower courts, particularly in the D.C. Circuit, where numerous habeas petitions have been considered. The AUMF grants detention authority for members or supporters of Al Qaeda, the Taliban, or other groups captured outside Afghanistan. The D.C. Circuit has mostly sided with the government on detention legality. Congress has not passed laws to clarify detention authority, but the courts have looked at military commission jurisdiction for guidance. The D.C. Circuit has used post-AUMF legislation on military commissions to define detention authority under the AUMF. It concluded that the government can detain those associated with Al Qaeda or the Taliban, including supporters in hostilities. Most detainees are picked up during military operations in Afghanistan or abroad and held at Guantanamo Bay. Most detainees under the AUMF are combatants captured during military operations in Afghanistan or abroad and held at Guantanamo Bay or Parwan, Afghanistan. Those arrested in the U.S. for terrorist activities are usually prosecuted in federal court, not placed in military detention. The Bush Administration did transfer some U.S. citizens into military custody as \"enemy combatants.\" The Bush Administration transferred some U.S. citizens into military custody as \"enemy combatants,\" but they were ultimately transferred back to civil authorities and tried in federal court. The legal validity of their prior military detention remains uncertain. There has been controversy over how to handle suspected belligerents and terrorists in U.S. custody. There has been controversy over the appropriate method for handling suspected terrorists and belligerents in U.S. custody, with debates between military custody, civilian law enforcement, or executive discretion for each case. The debate over the appropriate model for handling suspected terrorists in U.S. custody continues, with disagreements on whether executive discretion or a specific method should be used. Funding restrictions have been put in place to prevent the transfer of Guantanamo detainees into the United States for criminal prosecution. The 2012 Minibus Appropriations Act extends the prohibition on transferring Guantanamo detainees into the United States through FY2012. This restriction limits options for prosecuting detainees, with military commissions being the primary choice. Controversy surrounds the handling of terrorist suspects, such as the case of Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame, who was brought to the U.S. for trial in a civilian court after being detained on a naval vessel for interrogation. The controversy surrounding the handling of terrorist suspects like Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame, who was brought to the U.S. for trial in a civilian court after being detained on a naval vessel for interrogation, has raised questions about whether individuals should be held in military custody abroad or transferred to civilian custody immediately. Additionally, criticism has been directed at the Administration for bringing civilian charges against individuals suspected of insurgent activities in Iraq, despite the war in Iraq being treated separately from hostilities authorized by the AUMF. The 2012 NDAA is expected to address the disposition of persons apprehended in the conflict with Al Qaeda. The 2012 NDAA is expected to address the disposition of persons apprehended in the conflict with Al Qaeda. H.R. 1540 contains provisions reaffirming the conflict, imposing restrictions on detainee transfers, and requiring foreign nationals involved in terrorist offenses to be tried by military commission. The White House criticized these provisions and threatened to veto any bill challenging executive branch authority. S. 1253 is also mentioned. The White House criticized provisions in H.R. 1540 regarding detainee matters and threatened to veto any bill challenging executive branch authority. S. 1253 authorized detention of certain persons and required military detention for some, leading to delays in the bill's consideration. Senate Armed Services Committee reported a revised version, S. 1867, on November 15, 2011. The Senate passed S. 1867 with revised detainee provisions, clarifying that it did not affect existing authorities related to detaining U.S. citizens or residents. Differences between the House and Senate versions will be discussed in conference. The Senate amended H.R. 1540 with provisions from S. 1867, addressing detainee matters in the FY2012 NDAA. The scope of detention authority under the AUMF and current practices for detainee cases are discussed, along with concerns about recidivism and transferring detainees from Guantanamo. The AUMF is the primary legal basis for detaining individuals in the conflict with Al Qaeda, but the extent of its authority is not clearly defined. The Obama Administration's detention authority under the AUMF allows for the detainment of individuals involved in terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, as well as those who supported Taliban or al-Qaida forces engaged in hostilities against the United States. Membership in these groups is a key factor in determining detainment. The Obama Administration's detention authority under the AUMF allows for the detainment of individuals involved in terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, as well as those who supported Taliban or al-Qaida forces engaged in hostilities against the United States. The inclusion of \"associated forces\" and the concept of \"substantial support\" in the executive's detention authority may raise questions about exceeding the AUMF's mandate. The Supreme Court's interpretation of detention authority in Hamdi with reference to law of war principles has led to disputes over indefinite detention based solely on providing support to a belligerent force. The government has not clarified these aspects of its detention authority. The Obama Administration's detention authority under the AUMF allows for the detainment of individuals involved in terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, as well as those who supported Taliban or al-Qaida forces engaged in hostilities against the United States. Recent court decisions have not shed much light on the \"substantial support\" prong of the test to determine detention eligibility, with cases relying on proof that a detainee was functionally part of Al Qaeda, the Taliban, or an associated force. Recent court decisions have not clarified the \"substantial support\" prong for detention eligibility, with cases relying on proof of detainee involvement with Al Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces. The executive branch has included \"associated forces\" in its detention authority since 2004, expanding beyond just Al Qaeda and the Taliban. This allows for the detention of individuals involved in terrorist activities to prevent future attacks. The AUMF does not limit the organizations it covers to just al-Qaida or the Taliban, allowing for the detention of individuals associated with groups that have ties to them. This authority extends to individuals who would be detainable under principles of co-belligerency in a traditional international armed conflict. The D.C. Circuit rejected the government's argument that affiliation with certain groups automatically makes someone an \"enemy combatant,\" emphasizing the need for specific criteria to determine membership in an \"associated force.\" The court rejected the government's argument that affiliation with ETIM made the petitioner an \"enemy combatant\" under the AUMF. The government's evidence did not support the claim that ETIM was associated with al Qaida or the Taliban, so the court did not need to address the issue. The government's definition of \"associated force\" would require a close operational nexus in the current armed conflict. The court did not find sufficient evidence to establish that ETIM is closely connected to Al Qaeda to be considered an \"associated force\" under the AUMF. The government's definition of \"associated forces\" may need further development through application to specific cases. In its 2009 brief, the government indicated that the definition of \"associated forces\" would require further development through application to specific cases. Habeas cases have interpreted \"associated forces\" to cover armed groups assisting the Taliban or Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. For example, membership in groups like \"Zubayda's militia\" or Hezb\u2013i\u2013Islami Gulbuddin (\"HIG\") has been considered \"associated forces\" under the AUMF. The D.C. Circuit also affirmed the detention of individuals associated with armed forces defending the Taliban. The Administration has suggested that groups outside of Afghanistan may also be considered \"associated forces.\" The D.C. Circuit affirmed the detention of a cook for the 55th Arab Military Brigade, a force defending the Taliban. There is uncertainty about the AUMF's detention authority for individuals captured outside Afghanistan, especially U.S. citizens. The Supreme Court's Hamdi case allowed detention of a U.S. citizen in Afghanistan, but the extent of AUMF's application outside Afghanistan remains unclear. The D.C. Circuit believes the AUMF allows detention of anyone functionally part of Al Qaeda. The AUMF's detention authority for individuals captured outside Afghanistan, especially U.S. citizens, remains uncertain. The D.C. Circuit believes the AUMF allows detention of anyone functionally part of Al Qaeda, including non-U.S. citizens captured outside the United States. The Fourth Circuit upheld the military detention of a U.S. citizen and a resident alien captured in the United States as enemy combatants. The Pentagon established CSRTs in response to Supreme Court decisions related to \"enemy combatants\" in 2004. The Pentagon established Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRTs) in response to Supreme Court decisions related to \"enemy combatants\" in 2004. CSRTs are an administrative process to determine detainee status at Guantanamo, with 539 enemy combatants confirmed between 2004 and 2009. The process has been largely inactive since 2007, but new detainees brought to Guantanamo would likely go through a CSRT. The CSRT process, largely inactive since 2007, confirmed the status of 539 enemy combatants at Guantanamo between 2004 and 2009. Non-citizen detainees in Afghanistan have different status review processes with fewer rights. President Obama created task forces to study Guantanamo detention and U.S. detention policy. The Obama Administration established new review processes for detainees at Guantanamo and Bagram Theater Internment Facility in Afghanistan. President Obama issued Executive Order 13567 for periodic review of Guantanamo detainees' continued detention. President Obama established a process for periodic review of Guantanamo detainees' continued detention through Executive Order 13567. The Periodic Review Board assesses if detention is necessary to protect against a significant threat to the US security. If continued detention is not warranted, efforts are made to find a suitable transfer location outside the US. The Executive Order 13567 established a process for periodic review of Guantanamo detainees' continued detention. The Secretaries of State and Defense are responsible for finding a suitable transfer location outside the US if continued detention is not necessary. detainees have the right to challenge their detention and present evidence in a hearing before the PRB. The process is discretionary and does not create additional detention authority. Detainee transfers from Guantanamo have raised concerns about potential terrorist activities post-release. Congress requires certification for transfers to ensure measures are in place to prevent recidivism. Statistics on post-release activities are limited and classified, but some detainees have engaged in terrorist activities after release. Debate surrounds the significance of such activities and the policy implications for long-term detention without trial. The Pentagon reported that some former Guantanamo detainees engaged in militant activities or anti-U.S. propaganda post-release, sparking controversy over the policy implications and fairness of long-term detention without trial. Researchers challenged the Pentagon's data, citing discrepancies and lack of identifying information for verification. They disputed the classification of the detainees' activities as \"recidivism\" or \"reengagement.\" Guantanamo detainees disputed Pentagon's data on recidivism, citing lack of verification and disputed classification of activities. Some ex-detainees engaged in terrorism post-release, with reports of 36 confirmed or suspected cases in 2008 and 74 out of 534 prisoners in 2009. In 2009, the Pentagon reported that 74 out of 534 Guantanamo prisoners were believed to have engaged in terrorism. The Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2010 required the DNI to release a report on recidivism rates of detainees, stating that 13.5% are confirmed and 11.5% are suspected of reengaging in terrorist activities. Of the 150 recidivist detainees, 13 are deceased, 54 are in custody, and 83 are still at large. The report indicates that 81 detainees (13.5%) are confirmed and 69 (11.5%) are suspected of reengaging in terrorist activities after transfer. Out of 150 recidivist detainees, 13 are dead, 54 are in custody, and 83 are at large. Since Executive Order 13492, 2 detainees are confirmed and 3 are suspected of terrorist activities post-transfer. The accuracy of these numbers has been questioned, with estimates suggesting a lower threat level. The DNI's report on detainee recidivism remains classified, leading to discrepancies with publicly available estimates. The DNI's report on detainee recidivism remains classified, leading to discrepancies with publicly available estimates. Subtitle D of title X of H.R. 1540, passed by the House of Representatives on May 26, 2011, defines \"individual detained at Guantanamo\" and does not limit the term to those detained under the AUMF. The provision in Subtitle D of title X of H.R. 1540 defines \"individual detained at Guantanamo\" broadly, covering detainees under the effective control of the Department of Defense, even if not in its physical custody. This includes foreign nationals brought to Guantanamo for reasons unrelated to hostilities. The term \"individual detained at Guantanamo\" is defined broadly to cover foreign nationals brought to Guantanamo for reasons unrelated to hostilities. Section 1033 of H.R. 1540 amends the Military Commissions Act to allow guilty pleas in capital cases before military commissions, permitting the death penalty in such cases. Section 1033 of H.R. 1540 amends the Military Commissions Act to allow guilty pleas in capital cases before military commissions, permitting the death penalty in such cases if military commission panel members vote unanimously to approve the sentence. Section 1034 clarifies the armed conflict with Al Qaeda and other entities, affirming the President's authority to detain captured belligerents for the duration of hostilities. Section 1034 of H.R. 1540 affirms the President's authority to detain captured belligerents for the duration of hostilities in the armed conflict with al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces. It states that the President is authorized to use necessary force and detain individuals supporting these groups until the end of hostilities, which is a controversial provision in the bill. Section 1034 of H.R. 1540 affirms the President's authority to detain belligerents supporting al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces until the end of hostilities. This provision is controversial, with supporters arguing it aligns with the 2001 AUMF and opponents fearing it expands the conflict to new terrorist groups. The proposed language in Section 1034 of H.R. 1540 expands the President's authority to detain belligerents associated with Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and related forces, potentially including new terrorist groups. Critics are concerned about the broad scope of this expansion, while supporters argue it falls within the 2001 AUMF's authorization. The proposed language in Section 1034 of H.R. 1540 expands the President's authority to detain belligerents associated with Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and related forces, potentially including new terrorist groups. This includes nations, organizations, and persons who have engaged in or supported hostilities against the United States. The requirement for engagement in hostilities seems to require a nexus to armed hostilities, while the use of the past tense could suggest entities could be deemed belligerents even if their support occurred prior to September 11, 2001. The proposed language in Section 1034 of H.R. 1540 expands the President's authority to detain belligerents associated with Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and related forces, potentially including new terrorist groups. It describes the enemy parties in armed conflict and reaffirms the current interpretation of the AUMF. The intent behind Section 1034 is to address the evolving terrorist threat post-9/11 due to military and diplomatic pressure. The Armed Services Committee report accompanying H.R. 1540 supports expanding the President's authority to detain belligerents associated with Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and related forces to address the evolving terrorist threat post-9/11. The committee endorses the Executive Branch's interpretation of the Authorization for Use of Military Force, consistent with Congress's scope of authorities. The Executive Branch's interpretation of the Authorization for Use of Military Force aligns with Congress's scope of authorities. The language in H.R. 1540 Section 1034 may not expand the authority to use force beyond what is already permitted under the AUMF. The term \"associated forces\" could be interpreted differently, potentially superseding the AUMF. The language in paragraph (3) mirrors that used by Combatant Status Review Tribunals at Guantanamo for detainment. The language in paragraph (3) of H.R. 1540 Section 1034 echoes the criteria used by Combatant Status Review Tribunals at Guantanamo for detainment, allowing for the detention of individuals associated with Taliban or al Qaida forces. The White House opposes this section, stating it could redefine the scope of the conflict and create confusion over applicable standards. The White House strongly objects to section 1034 of H.R. 1540, arguing that it could redefine the scope of the conflict and create confusion over applicable standards. Section 1036 requires the Secretary of Defense to establish a review process for Guantanamo detainees to determine if continued military detention is necessary for national security. This process differs from the one established earlier this year, as it involves military officers on the initial review panel and imposes stricter criteria for assessing detainee detention. Section 1036 requires military officers to conduct detailed reviews of Guantanamo detainees to assess the necessity of continued detention. The Secretary of Defense must report to Congress on the establishment of this review process within 180 days. Full reviews are to be conducted every three years, with limited reviews annually, excluding detainees undergoing trial or ordered released by a federal court. A full review cannot occur sooner than 21 days after arrival at Guantanamo, and the panel consists of military officers with expertise in operations, intelligence, and counterterrorism. Detainees at Guantanamo undergo detailed reviews every three years by a panel of military officers with expertise in operations, intelligence, and counterterrorism. A full review cannot occur sooner than 21 days after arrival, and detainees have the right to be assisted by a military personal representative during the process. They can present statements, evidence, and call witnesses to advocate for their release or prove they do not pose a threat to the US or its allies. The detainee at Guantanamo undergoes a limited annual file review by a military panel to assess any new information regarding the threat posed, including mitigating factors. Relevant information from any military commission case is considered during the review to determine if continued internment is warranted. Outside parties, with detainee authorization, can provide written submissions to the panel. The military panel conducts an annual review of Guantanamo detainees to assess the threat they pose and determine if continued internment is necessary. Factors considered include the likelihood of resuming terrorist activity, reestablishing ties with hostile organizations, behavior in custody, and potential intelligence value. An interagency review board is also established to oversee the process. The government's submission to the panel aims to mitigate threats posed by individuals and assess the intelligence value to national security. An interagency review board, consisting of senior officials from various departments, reviews the military panel's recommendations for errors and can reject them by majority vote. If a detainee is recommended for release, the board identifies a suitable country for transfer based on various factors. The interagency review panel assesses detainee recommendations for transfer to a suitable country based on factors like terrorism support, control over detention facilities, and prevention of terrorist activities. Recommendations can be reevaluated or approved by the Secretary of Defense, with detainees having no right to seek redress in U.S. courts. The White House has raised concerns about Section 1036 of H.R. 1540 in relation to detainee provisions. The White House has raised concerns about Section 1036 of H.R. 1540, which could lead to a presidential veto due to its impact on the periodic review process for detainees. This section undermines the President's Executive Order by imposing a rigid review system that limits input from intelligence and law enforcement professionals, hindering the Executive branch's ability to make informed decisions. Additionally, it interferes with the Department of Defense's management of detention operations. Section 1039 restricts the transfer or release of non-citizen detainees held abroad in U.S. military custody. Section 1039 limits the transfer or release of non-citizen detainees held abroad in U.S. military custody, including those at Guantanamo, into the United States. Funding measures have been enacted to restrict executive discretion in transferring or releasing Guantanamo detainees into the country. Recent funding limitations, including those in the 2012 Minibus (P.L. 112-55), prohibit the transfer of Guantanamo detainees into the United States for any purpose, including criminal prosecution. These restrictions were motivated by plans to transfer Khalid Sheik Mohammed and other detainees to the US for trial in civilian courts, making military commissions the only viable forum for prosecution until the end of FY2012. Section 1039 of House-passed H.R. 1540 broadens the detainee category covered by funding restrictions for FY2012, applying to all non-citizen detainees. The funding restrictions in Section 1039 of House-passed H.R. 1540 cover a broader category of Guantanamo detainees than the 2012 Minibus. It applies to all non-citizen detainees held at Guantanamo and restricts transfer or release into the US of detainees held at foreign locations. These restrictions expire at the end of FY2012. The 2012 Minibus restricts detainee transfers to the United States, while House-passed H.R. 1540 imposes broader funding restrictions on Guantanamo detainees, including a permanent bar on prosecuting enemy belligerents in Article III courts. The White House strongly objects to these restrictions, claiming they interfere with executive discretion in prosecuting detainees. The White House strongly objects to Section 1039 of H.R. 1540, which challenges Executive branch authority in prosecuting detainees. It also criticizes Section 1037 for restricting funds for constructing facilities to house Guantanamo detainees in the US. The 2012 Minibus restricts funds for transferring Guantanamo detainees to foreign countries, except under certain criteria or court orders. These restrictions mirror those in previous defense authorization acts and appropriations acts, motivated by concerns over detainee recidivism. The 2011 NDAA and CAA imposed funding restrictions on transferring Guantanamo detainees, with supporters citing reduced terrorist activity risk and critics arguing for more flexibility. No detainees have been transferred since these acts, and Section 1039 requires the Secretary of Defense to certify destination countries before transfers can occur. The 2011 NDAA and CAA imposed funding restrictions on transferring Guantanamo detainees. Section 1039 requires the Secretary of Defense to certify destination countries before transfers can occur, with specific requirements to ensure security measures are in place. The 2011 NDAA and CAA imposed funding restrictions on transferring Guantanamo detainees, requiring certification of destination countries to ensure security measures. Section 1040 establishes additional requirements for transferred detainees related to US security and access by US agencies, mirroring previous certification requirements. The White House has expressed disapproval of these restrictions on detainee transfers. The White House disapproves of restrictions on transferring Guantanamo detainees, claiming they interfere with foreign policy decisions. Section 1035 mandates a national security protocol for communication limitations and privileges for each detainee. The protocol requires a description of limitations and privileges for Guantanamo detainees' communications, including access to legal representation and enforcement measures. Additionally, DOD funds in FY2012 cannot be used for family visits to detainees, and repatriated detainees to certain countries are not afforded rights under the Compact of Free Association. Section 1043 prohibits Guantanamo detainees repatriated to certain countries from receiving rights under the Compact of Free Association, potentially restricting their travel to the United States. This provision may affect detainees returned to Micronesia, Palau, or the Marshall Islands, but not those resettled in these countries. Section 1042 mandates consultation among key officials regarding detainee matters. Section 1042 requires consultation among key officials before prosecuting a non-citizen for an offense that could be tried by a military commission. The White House opposes this provision, stating that it could undermine existing interagency coordination in terrorism-related prosecutions. Section 1042 mandates consultation among officials before prosecuting a non-citizen for a military commission-eligible offense, opposed by the White House for potentially disrupting existing interagency coordination in terrorism-related prosecutions. Section 1046 requires foreign nationals involved in terrorism-related conduct to be tried solely by military commission, without defining terms. The provision in question applies to terrorist attacks in the United States or against U.S. government property or personnel abroad, but lacks clear definitions. It is unclear if the provision covers attempted attacks that are not carried out. The case of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who attempted to destroy an airliner in 2009, may provide insight into how the provision could be applied to failed attacks. The provision in question applies to terrorist attacks in the United States or against U.S. government property or personnel abroad. It is unclear if the provision covers attempted attacks that are not carried out. The case of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who attempted to destroy an airliner in 2009, may provide insight into how the provision could be applied to failed attacks. If the attack takes place within the United States, it may be covered. If the attack occurs in international airspace or another country, it must be shown that U.S. government property or personnel were on board. The offense related to the attack must be one that can be tried by military commission, and the accused must be subject to the jurisdiction of such a commission. The attempted use of an explosive device to bring down a civilian aircraft could be prosecuted under criminal prohibitions within military commission jurisdiction. Jurisdiction also requires that the offense was committed in the context of hostilities defined by the laws of war. The jurisdiction of military commissions requires the offense to be committed in the context of hostilities, defined as any conflict subject to the laws of war. To establish jurisdiction, the accused must be a non-U.S. citizen and an unprivileged enemy belligerent. This includes individuals who have engaged in hostilities against the U.S. or its coalition partners, supported hostilities, or were part of al Qaeda at the time of the alleged offense. If the offense is associated with hostilities, the accused would qualify for military commission jurisdiction. The bill outlines criteria for determining unprivileged enemy belligerents, including those who have engaged in hostilities against the US or its coalition partners, supported hostilities, or were part of al Qaeda. The provision may complicate extradition and trial of terrorism suspects. The provision in the bill applies to foreign nationals engaged in relevant conduct, potentially complicating extradition and trials of terrorism suspects. It may only apply to those in U.S. custody and could be challenged through habeas corpus. The bill does not exclude trials in Article III courts but specifies that certain offenses must be tried in military commissions. The bill allows for habeas challenges for foreign nationals in the United States, specifying that certain offenses must be tried in military commissions. This provision may be avoidable by framing the offense under a terrorism-related provision of title 18, U.S. Code. Section 1042 grants broader discretion to executive branch officials over prosecutorial decisions compared to Section 1046. If a federal criminal offense is charged, a defendant could challenge the Article III court's jurisdiction. The bill allows for habeas challenges for foreign nationals in the United States, specifying that certain offenses must be tried in military commissions. If a federal criminal offense is charged, a defendant could challenge the Article III court's jurisdiction based on the language of the provision. Executive branch officials have criticized this provision for constraining executive discretion in prosecuting detainees. Section 1032 extends the authority to provide rewards for information or assistance in military operations against terrorism. Section 1041 requires the Secretary of Defense to provide quarterly briefings to congressional defense committees. The provision in Section 1041 of the bill extends the authority for military operations against terrorism outside the US and requires the Secretary of Defense to provide quarterly briefings to congressional defense committees. Section 1044 expresses Congress's approval of DOD anti-terrorism efforts, while Section 1045 addresses the need for improved interagency strategic planning to deny safe havens to Al Qaeda and affiliated groups. The President is required to issue planning guidance to strengthen \"at-risk states\" by identifying geographic areas of concern, setting goals, and outlining agency roles. Agencies must enter into a memorandum of understanding to carry out the guidance. The Senate bill S. 1867 covers \"Detainee Matters\" and was passed on December 1, 2011, with revisions to address Administration concerns. S. 1867, passed by the Senate on December 1, 2011, includes provisions affirming the legal authority to detain persons captured in the conflict with Al Qaeda. The bill clarifies that this authority does not modify existing powers related to detaining U.S. citizens or lawful residents. Section 1031 of the bill defines \"covered persons\" as those who planned or participated in the conflict. The bill, S. 1867, passed by the Senate on December 1, 2011, affirms the legal authority to detain persons involved in the conflict with Al Qaeda. Section 1031 of the bill defines \"covered persons\" as those who planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, or supported Al Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces engaged in hostilities against the United States. The earlier version of Section 1031 directly authorized the Armed Forces to detain covered persons captured in hostilities authorized by the AUMF. The Senate-passed bill S. 1867 affirms the legal authority to detain persons involved in the conflict with Al Qaeda. Section 1031 defines \"covered persons\" as those connected to the 9/11 attacks or supporting Al Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces. The provision allows for detention without trial until the end of hostilities authorized by the 2001 AUMF, trial by military commission, transfer for trial by another court, or transfer to a foreign country or entity. The language \"may include\" suggests the possibility of adding or removing options. The Senate-passed bill S. 1867 affirms the legal authority to detain persons involved in the conflict with Al Qaeda. Section 1031 defines \"covered persons\" as those connected to the 9/11 attacks or supporting Al Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces. The provision allows for detention without trial until the end of hostilities authorized by the 2001 AUMF; trial by military commission; transfer for trial by another court or tribunal with jurisdiction; or transfer to the custody or control of a foreign country or foreign entity. The language \"may include\" suggests the possibility of adding or removing options. Section 1031 does not clarify whether U.S. citizens or lawful resident aliens may be considered \"covered persons.\" The revised provision of S. 1867 aimed to reinforce the executive branch's view of detention authority under the AUMF. There was significant debate on the potential application of Section 1031 to U.S. citizens and other persons within the United States, with an amendment rejecting the bar on long-term military detention of U.S. citizens based on enemy belligerent status. Ultimately, an amendment was adopted to clarify that existing law or authority relating to the detention of United States citizens would not be affected. An amendment rejecting the bar on long-term military detention of U.S. citizens based on enemy belligerent status was considered and rejected during significant floor debate. Ultimately, an amendment was adopted to clarify that existing law or authority relating to the detention of United States citizens would not be affected by Section 1031. This language aims to maintain the executive's existing authority to detain U.S. citizens, resident aliens, and other persons captured in the United States, without expanding or limiting it. The Supreme Court in Hamdi recognized that persons captured while fighting U.S. forces in Afghanistan could be militarily detained in the conflict with Al Qaeda potentially for the duration of hostilities. Section 1031 does not clarify the circumstances in which a U.S. citizen, resident alien, or person captured with the United States may be held as an enemy belligerent in the conflict with Al Qaeda. The revised provision in S. 1867 does not provide additional clarification for terms such as \"substantial support,\" \"associated forces,\" or \"hostilities,\" potentially allowing for a broadening of the conflict scope. The revised provision in S. 1867 requires the Secretary of Defense to brief Congress on how the detention authority applies, including identifying \"covered persons.\" The Administration has not objected to the language but cautions against opening new legal questions that could distract from national security efforts. Future legislative action must address these concerns. The revised Section 1031 in S. 1867 requires the Secretary of Defense to brief Congress on the detention authority for \"covered persons.\" Congress must be cautious not to raise new legal questions that could hinder national security efforts. Section 1032 mandates temporary military custody for certain Al Qaeda members and associated forces, excluding U.S. citizens but including U.S. resident aliens. The revised Section 1031 in S. 1867 mandates the detention of \"covered persons\" captured during hostilities authorized by the AUMF, excluding U.S. citizens but including U.S. resident aliens. Covered persons must be members of al-Qaeda or associated forces involved in planning or carrying out attacks against the U.S. or its partners, and are to be detained by military authorities pending disposition under the law of war. The revised Section 1031 in S. 1867 mandates the detention of \"covered persons\" involved in planning or carrying out attacks against the U.S. or its partners. These individuals, who are members of al-Qaeda or associated forces, are to be detained by military authorities pending disposition under the law of war. The provision specifies that covered forces are those that act in coordination with or pursuant to al-Qaeda. Section 1032 of S. 1867 mandates detention for members of \"associated forces\" acting in coordination with or directed by al-Qaeda. The absence of a reference to the Taliban suggests they may not be considered associated unless their actions are coordinated with al-Qaeda. Questions may arise regarding the detention of members who act independently but coordinate with al-Qaeda. The determination of whether an individual should be detained under Section 1032 of S. 1867 depends on their involvement in attacks coordinated with Al Qaeda. The provision may not apply to Taliban insurgents unless they are working with Al Qaeda. The definition of an \"attack against the United States coalition partners\" is not clearly defined, leaving room for interpretation. The provision only applies to individuals captured during hostilities, potentially limiting its scope. The provision in Section 1032 of S. 1867 regarding the detention of individuals captured during hostilities is ambiguous. It is unclear whether it only applies to attacks in a military theater or if it includes terrorist acts against civilian targets. The reference to lawful resident aliens being detained based on conduct in the United States supports a broader interpretation. The provision may not apply to insurgents in Iraq unless they are affiliated with Al Qaeda. The provision in S. 1867 regarding detention of individuals captured during hostilities is ambiguous and may not apply to insurgents in Iraq unless affiliated with Al Qaeda. The bill includes a new requirement for the President to submit a report to Congress within 60 days of enactment, detailing procedures for implementing the provision. This includes designating who can determine a covered person, preventing interruption of surveillance, and precluding implementation of the determination process during ongoing interrogation sessions. The provision in S. 1867 addresses the detention of individuals captured during hostilities, with a focus on preventing interruption of surveillance and interrogation sessions. It also includes procedures for determining a covered person and allowing waiver authority for transfer from a third country if needed. The interaction with procedures under Section 1036 for status determinations is unclear. The bill addresses detention of individuals captured during hostilities, focusing on preventing interruption of surveillance and interrogation. It includes procedures for determining a covered person and waiver authority for transfer. The interaction with status determinations under Section 1036 is unclear, potentially implicating constitutional due process requirements. The Obama Administration opposes Section 1032, as it could complicate trials and limit counterterrorism tools according to Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta. Panetta also criticizes the provision for not clearly limiting its scope to persons captured abroad. The Obama Administration and Secretary Panetta oppose Section 1032, citing concerns about complicating trials and limiting counterterrorism tools. They argue that the provision fails to clearly limit its scope to persons captured abroad and could restrict the executive branch's ability to effectively combat terrorist threats. The White House strongly objects to the provision, calling it an unnecessary and legally controversial restriction on the President's authority. The Obama Administration opposes Section 1032, arguing that it could limit the President's authority to defend the nation from terrorist threats. The revised text only directs the President to develop procedures to address the problems, which may cause confusion in counterterrorism operations. Section 1033 extends the restriction on transferring Guantanamo detainees to foreign countries for another fiscal year. Section 1033 extends the restriction on transferring Guantanamo detainees to foreign countries for another fiscal year, requiring certification from the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, and Director of National Intelligence.

The Senate bill extends the restriction on transferring Guantanamo detainees to foreign countries for another fiscal year, requiring certification from the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, and Director of National Intelligence. The certification includes various conditions for the destination country or entity to meet, related to security and prohibiting transfers if there is a confirmed case of a detainee engaging in terrorist activity. The prohibition on transferring Guantanamo detainees to foreign countries is extended, requiring certification from key officials. The certification includes conditions for the destination country to meet, such as security measures and barring transfers if a detainee engages in terrorist activity. Waivers may be granted if alternative actions mitigate risks. The Secretary may issue a waiver for transferring detainees from Guantanamo if alternative actions will mitigate the risk of recidivism. The transfer must be in the national security interests of the United States and must be reported to congressional defense committees 30 days prior. The transfer restrictions apply to detainees at Guantanamo, excluding U.S. citizens, servicemembers, or detainees transferred by court order or military commission agreement. This includes foreign refugees intercepted at sea and brought to Guantanamo's Migrant Operations Center. Section 1033 of the 2012 NDAA applies to individuals detained at Guantanamo, excluding U.S. citizens or servicemembers. It may also cover foreign refugees brought to Guantanamo's Migrant Operations Center. The White House and Department of Defense disapprove of certain provisions in the NDAA.

The 2012 NDAA includes Section 1034, which prohibits the use of DOD funds to construct facilities in the U.S. or its territories for Guantanamo detainees. The White House and Department of Defense disapprove of this provision. The Senate bill for the 2012 NDAA does not include a provision prohibiting the transfer of Guantanamo detainees into the United States. It allows for transfers to civilian law enforcement for criminal prosecution and does not prevent the release of detainees cleared of enemy belligerency status. The only restriction is on transfers for continued military detention, especially if new facilities are needed. Section 1035 addresses detention reviews at Guantanamo but does not seek to replace the periodic review process established by Executive Order 13567. The Senate bill clarifies procedures for detention reviews at Guantanamo under Executive Order 13567. It emphasizes that reviews are to determine ongoing threat to U.S. security, not legality of detention. The Secretary of Defense has final decision on detainee release or transfer, not bound by panel recommendations. Factors like security threat and likelihood of reengagement are considered in the review process.

The Secretary of Defense has the final decision on detainee release or transfer, considering factors like security threat and likelihood of reengagement. The Administration objects to this provision as it shifts responsibility to the Defense Department from a collaborative interagency review process. Section 1036 requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a report to congressional committees within 90 days explaining procedures for determining detainee status under the AUMF. The Senate bill clarifies procedures for detention reviews at Guantanamo under Executive Order 13567, focusing on determining ongoing threat to U.S. security. Section 1036 requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a report to congressional committees within 90 days explaining procedures for determining detainee status under the AUMF, including the role of a military judge and representation by military counsel for unprivileged enemy belligerents in long-term detention. The provision allows unprivileged enemy belligerents to be represented by military counsel during status determination hearings, regardless of their location. It may provide detainees in Afghanistan with greater privileges during such hearings, but its impact on Guantanamo detainees and habeas challenges is unclear. The provision under Section 1036 may impact Guantanamo detainees and their habeas challenges, as it raises questions about how it would affect their status hearings and long-term detention. The provision allows for representation by military counsel during status determination hearings for unprivileged enemy belligerents, potentially affecting detainees in Afghanistan as well.

It allows for military counsel representation during status determination hearings for unprivileged enemy belligerents, potentially impacting detainees in Afghanistan. The White House has expressed disapproval of this provision, claiming that it establishes \"onerous requirements [and] conflicts with procedures for detainee reviews in the field that have been developed based on many years of experience.\" Section 1037 of the MCA allows plea agreements in capital cases, similar to a provision in House-passed H.R. 1540. The White House opposes this, citing concerns about conflicting with established military procedures for detainee reviews."
