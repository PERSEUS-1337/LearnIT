The Bureau serves as the primary federal consumer financial supervisor and has the authority to implement regulations for federal consumer laws. The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, established by the Dodd-Frank Act, is the primary federal supervisor for consumer financial products and services. It has the authority to implement regulations for federal consumer laws, such as the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. Some of its powers took effect when the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law, with the rest becoming effective on the designated transfer date. The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, established by the Dodd-Frank Act, has powers that took effect upon enactment. The designated transfer date is July 21, 2011. The Bureau is to be headed by a Director appointed by the President with Senate approval. Until a Director is appointed, the Secretary of the Treasury has limited authority over the Bureau as outlined in Section 1066 of the CFP Act. The Secretary of the Treasury has interim authority over the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection until a Director is appointed, as outlined in Section 1066 of the CFP Act.

These services include human resources and securing access to communication services. The Treasury Department's administrative support powers expire on the transfer date. The Treasury Department's administrative support powers under section 1066(b) include providing human resources services and securing access to communication services. The Secretary's interim authority under subsection 1066(a) allows them to perform the functions of the Bureau until a Director is appointed, but does not grant full Bureau powers. These authorities do not expire until a Director is appointed. The Secretary's authority under subsection 1066(a) allows them to perform Bureau functions until a Director is appointed. Unlike administrative powers under subsection (b), these authorities do not expire until a Director is appointed. Subtitle F transfers consumer financial protection functions from seven agencies to the Bureau. The Bureau will receive consumer financial protection functions from seven transferor agencies, including rulemaking authority and enforcement powers over larger depository institutions. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) will receive authority over larger depository institutions with assets over $10 billion, including rulemaking and enforcement powers.

The Bureau will receive authority over larger depository institutions with assets over $10 billion, including rulemaking and enforcement powers. The Secretary has the power to exercise all transferred authorities under subtitle F of the CFP Act, including consumer compliance supervisory and enforcement powers. The CFPB's powers under subtitle F are expansive but do not cover all its powers. The Bureau's newly established authorities include enhanced supervisory powers over non-depository financial institutions, new rulemaking powers, and limited enforcement powers over smaller depository institutions. These powers are provided for in CFP Act section 1024. The CFPB has newly established powers to supervise certain non-depository financial institutions with $10 billion or less in assets. Section 1024 of the CFP Act allows the Bureau to supervise providers of payday loans, mortgage loans, mortgage brokerage services, foreclosure relief services, and student loans. The Bureau also has the authority to identify other institutions for supervision and conduct examinations to ensure compliance with consumer laws and assess risks to consumers. The CFPB has the authority to conduct examinations and impose reporting requirements on covered non-depository financial institutions to ensure compliance with consumer laws and detect risks to consumers. Section 1024 also allows the Bureau to require registration and maintain eligibility standards for these institutions. Additionally, the CFPB has consumer compliance enforcement powers over covered non-depository financial institutions.

The Bureau also has the authority to require disclosures and establish model disclosure forms for consumer financial products and services. The CFPB has rulemaking authority to regulate consumer financial products and services, including disclosures and model forms. The Bureau's enforcement powers over smaller depository institutions are limited, with a back-up role to banking regulators. The CFP Act allows the Bureau to refer enforcement actions against smaller depository institutions to their regulators and participate in examinations on a sampling basis. The CFPB has limited supervisory and enforcement authority over smaller depository institutions, with the ability to refer potential enforcement actions to banking regulators and participate in examinations on a sampling basis. The Bureau can access examination reports prepared by banking regulators and may require smaller depository institutions to submit reports directly. These powers are separate from the Secretary's interim Bureau authorities and will take effect on the designated transfer date. The newly established powers of the Bureau may not fall under the Secretary's interim authorities and may require a Bureau Director for exercise. Actions taken by the Bureau so far have been mainly administrative or preparatory, with no formal regulations, enforcement actions, or supervisory powers exercised. The Bureau has engaged with various stakeholders but has not taken any binding actions. The Bureau has taken administrative and preparatory steps, such as engaging with stakeholders, collecting information, hiring personnel, and securing office space. These actions align with its responsibilities outlined in the Treasury Department's 2010 annual report and the planned activities mentioned in the Federal Register notice. No formal regulations, enforcement actions, or supervisory powers have been exercised yet. The CFPB has taken steps to prepare for its responsibilities outlined in the 2010 annual report and the Federal Register notice. The Bureau's transferred powers will go into effect on the designated transfer date, expanding its supervisory and enforcement authority over depository institutions and rulemaking abilities under consumer laws. The Secretary's interim powers may be more extensive if a Director has not been appointed, potentially increasing the Bureau's authority. The Secretary's interim Bureau powers may expand after the designated transfer date if a Director has not been appointed, potentially allowing the Bureau to take substantive actions impacting financial institutions in consumer markets. For example, the FRB proposed regulations under TILA to impose mortgage origination standards, which must be prescribed by the Bureau after the transfer of authority on July 21, 2011. On July 21, 2011, the authority to prescribe regulations under TILA will transfer to the Bureau. Final regulations imposing mortgage origination standards must be prescribed by the Bureau, not the FRB. The Secretary may also have the authority to issue these regulations until a Bureau Director is appointed. The limits of the Secretary's authorities under the CFP Act may not always be clear, leading to potential lawsuits from parties impacted by certain actions. The CFP Act grants the Secretary authority that may be subject to various interpretations, leading to potential lawsuits from parties affected by the Secretary's actions. The outcomes of such lawsuits are unpredictable due to the numerous factors that could influence legal claims."
