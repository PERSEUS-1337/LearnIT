The alternative minimum standard for domestically manufactured passenger automobiles is determined by the greater of 27.5 miles per gallon or 92 percent of the average fuel economy projected by the Secretary for all manufacturers in a model year.

If standards are prescribed based on vehicle attributes, a transition period is provided during the first 3 model years. The Secretary prescribes standards for passenger automobiles based on vehicle attributes, allowing a transition period for manufacturers to comply with either the attribute-based standard or the single corporate average fuel economy level.

SEC. 2. CREDIT TRANSFERRING WITHIN A MANUFACTURER'S FLEET. The Secretary of Transportation will establish a credit transferring program for manufacturers to transfer fuel economy credits within their fleet.

Transfers to certain categories are limited based on the manufacturer's fleet fuel economy level. The credit transferring program allows manufacturers to transfer fuel economy credits within their fleet, with a maximum increase of 1.0 mile per gallon in a single model year. Transfers are limited for certain categories based on the manufacturer's fleet fuel economy level, excluding transfers from other categories. Credits can only be transferred if earned in model year 2010 or later. The term 'compliance category of automobiles' refers to the 3 categories for which compliance is separately calculated under this chapter: passenger automobiles manufactured domestically, passenger automobiles not manufactured domestically, and non-passenger automobiles. The Secretary of Transportation will partner with industry groups to create a public education campaign on fuel conservation for drivers. The campaign will use various methods to reach a wide audience and the Secretary will provide up to 50% of the campaign's cost, with the option to accept private funds. Funding will be authorized as needed for this program."
