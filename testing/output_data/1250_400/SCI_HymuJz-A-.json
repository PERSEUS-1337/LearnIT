    "content": "The limitations of modern machine vision algorithms in learning visual relations are highlighted through controlled experiments. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) struggle with visual-relation problems when intra-class variability exceeds their capacity. Relational networks (RNs) also face similar limitations in abstract visual reasoning tasks. Feedback mechanisms like working memory and attention are proposed as key components for successful visual reasoning, contrasting with the success of biological vision. Feedback mechanisms like working memory and attention are crucial for abstract visual reasoning, as demonstrated by the limitations of convolutional neural networks in recognizing simple visual relations. The CNN struggles to learn simple visual relations, such as the concept of \"sameness,\" despite being able to accurately detect objects like a flute. This difficulty has been overshadowed by the success of relational networks in visual question answering tasks. Contemporary computer vision algorithms, including CNNs, struggle with visual reasoning tasks such as recognizing visual relations. This issue has been overlooked due to the success of relational networks in visual question answering tasks. However, relational networks have only been tested on toy datasets, showing similar limitations as CNNs. Previous work has not systematically explored the limits of machine learning algorithms on relational reasoning problems. Previous work has not systematically explored the limits of machine learning algorithms on relational reasoning problems, including failures of existing models in visual reasoning tasks. Studies have shown that black-box classifiers and CNN architectures struggle with solving visual-relation problems, raising questions about the choice of hyperparameters or a systematic failure of neural networks in these tasks. In this study, the authors investigate the limitations of CNNs and other visual reasoning networks on visual-relation tasks. They argue that current computer vision models lack key brain mechanisms like working memory and attention, necessary for solving complex visual reasoning problems. Their research highlights the need for feedback mechanisms to enhance computer vision models' ability to learn and reason about visual relations effectively. The authors argue that key brain mechanisms like working memory and attention are essential for solving complex visual reasoning tasks. They conducted a systematic analysis of CNN architectures on twenty-three SVRT problems, revealing a dichotomy between hard same-different and easy spatial-relation problems. They also introduced a visual-relation challenge showing that CNNs solve same-different tasks through rote memorization. Additionally, they demonstrated that a simple modification of the sort-of-CLEVR challenge can break state-of-the-art relational network architectures. Their goal is to inspire the computer vision community to look to neuroscience and cognitive science for designing better visual reasoning architectures. The SVRT challenge consists of twenty-three binary classification problems with abstract rules. Nine CNNs were trained on each problem, with the best-performing network's accuracies ranked. The authors aim to inspire the computer vision community to seek inspiration from neuroscience and cognitive science for designing visual reasoning architectures. High-throughput screening approach tested CNNs of different depths and receptive field sizes on twenty-three SVRT problems. CNNs produced lower accuracies on same-different problems compared to spatial-relation problems. The approach involved training nine networks with varying parameters and generating 2 million examples for each problem. The study tested CNNs on twenty-three SVRT problems, using nine networks with different parameters. Each problem had 2 million examples split into training and test sets. The best networks' accuracy for each problem was sorted and colored red for Same-Different (SD) problems and blue for Spatial-Relation (SR) problems based on problem descriptions. The study tested CNNs on twenty-three SVRT problems, with SD problems colored red and SR problems colored blue based on descriptions. CNNs performed much worse on SD problems compared to SR problems, indicating a visual-relation dichotomy. Larger networks yielded higher accuracy on SD tasks, while SR problems were equally well-learned across all network configurations. The study found that larger networks performed better on SD problems, while SR problems were equally well-learned across all network configurations. Experiment 1 supported previous findings that feedforward models struggle with visual-relation problems. The SVRT challenge, while useful, has limitations in its sample selection of visual relations. The SVRT challenge is useful for evaluating algorithm efficacy on various visual relations, but it has limitations in its sample selection. Direct comparison between problems is difficult due to unique image structures and generation methods. The SVRT challenge evaluates visual relations with different problems that have unique image structures and generation methods, making direct comparison challenging. For example, Problem 2 requires specific object configurations conflicting with other problems. Using closed curves in images hinders quantification of image variability. The PSVRT challenge addresses issues with SVRT by introducing two new problems: Spatial Relations (SR) and Same-Different (SD). SR involves classifying images based on horizontal or vertical arrangements of items, while SD involves identifying identical items in an image. This new dataset aims to overcome difficulties in quantifying image variability and task difficulty in SVRT. Experiment 1 (Fig. 3) focuses on Spatial Relations (SR) and Same-Different (SD) tasks using a gray-scale image generator with parameters controlling item size, image size, and number of items. The image dataset can be used for both tasks by labeling images differently based on specific rules. The size of the input image (n) controls image variability by setting the spatial extent of individual items. The number of items (k) controls both item and spatial variability. The SD category label is determined by the presence of at least 2 identical items, while the SR category label is based on the average orientation of item displacements. The number of possible images in the dataset is quantified as O(P n 2 ,k 2 km 2) using Parametric SVRT (PSVRT) test. Each image is generated by drawing class labels for SD and SR from a uniform distribution. The Parametric SVRT test, or PSVRT, quantifies the number of possible images in a dataset using permutations. Images are generated by drawing class labels for SD and SR from a uniform distribution. The difficulty of learning PSVRT problems was examined over a range of image variability parameters. A baseline architecture was found to easily learn both types of problems. In an experiment to examine the difficulty of learning PSVRT problems, a baseline architecture was used to learn same-different and spatial-relation problems for various image variability parameters. The number of training examples required for the architecture to reach 95% accuracy was measured as a measure of problem difficulty. Different image parameters were varied separately to assess their impact on learnability. The study examined the difficulty of learning PSVRT problems by training a baseline CNN architecture with various image variability parameters. The network was trained from scratch without a holdout test set, and training accuracy was measured. Three sub-experiments were conducted by varying different image parameters separately. The baseline CNN had four convolution and pool layers, with different kernel sizes. The best-case result for each experimental condition was reported out of 10 random initializations. The baseline convolutional network had multiple layers with varying kernel sizes and units. Different experimental conditions were tested, with a larger network control also examined. A strong dichotomy in learning curves was observed, with a sudden rise in accuracy from chance-level in conditions where learning occurred. Results showed a strong dichotomy in learning curves, with a sudden rise in accuracy from chance-level in conditions where learning occurred. The learning event typically occurred within 20 million training images, leading to accuracy close to 100%. No straining effect was found in all image parameters across random initializations. In different experimental conditions, final accuracy showed a strong bi-modality - either chance-level or close to 100%. Minimum TTA in each condition was reported in FIG1 over 10 random initializations. In SR, no straining effect was found across all image parameters. However, in SD, a significant straining effect was observed from image size (n) and number of items (k). Increasing image size led to higher TTA and decreased likelihood of learning, with the network struggling to learn on larger images. The number of items also had a strong straining effect, with the network failing to learn when there were 3 or more items in an image. The network never learned the problem when there were 3 or more items in an image, even with a relaxation of the same-different rule. Increasing image size and number of items led to a severe strain on CNNs due to exponential increase in image variability. Increasing image size and number of items results in a quadratic-rate increase in image variability, while increasing the number of items leads to an exponential-rate increase. The straining effect on CNNs is strong, with a constant rightward shift in the TTA curve over image sizes. However, increasing item size has no visible straining effect. Learnability is preserved and stable over different item sizes. It is possible to construct feedforward feature detectors that can generalize to coordinated item variability. The study explores the construction of feedforward feature detectors that can generalize to coordinated item variability. Results suggest that CNNs build a feature set tailored for a specific dataset rather than learning a general rule. The features learned are not invariant rule-detectors but rather a collection sensitive to image variations. The Relational Network (RN) is an architecture designed to detect visual relations and outperforms a baseline CNN on various visual reasoning problems. It sits on top of a CNN, learns from pairs of high-level CNN feature vectors, and can be trained end-to-end. The RN was able to beat a CNN on the \"sort-of-CLEVR\" VQA task using images with simple 2D items. The Relational Network (RN) outperforms a baseline CNN on visual reasoning tasks, including the \"sort-of-CLEVR\" VQA task. The RN is trained to answer relational and non-relational questions about scenes with simple 2D items, showing superior performance compared to a CNN. The sort-of-CLEVR task has limitations due to low item variability, leading the RN to rely on rote memorization for solving relational problems. The task involves comparing attributes of cued items without requiring the concept of sameness. With only twelve possible items, low variability leads to reliance on rote memorization. To assess RN performance without these limitations, the model was trained on a two-item same-different task and PSVRT stimuli. The architecture details include a convolutional network with four layers and specific kernel sizes and activations. The model used a software for relational networks with a convolutional network having four layers, specific kernel sizes, and activations. The RN part consisted of a 4-layer MLP followed by a 3-layer MLP, with ReLu activations and dropout. The system was trained with a cross-entropy loss using an ADAM optimizer. The study utilized a CNN+RN architecture trained on a modified sort-of-CLEVR dataset to detect sameness in color+shape combinations. The model did not generalize well to left-out combinations, learning significantly faster than CNNs on PSVRT. The CNN+RN model trained on a modified sort-of-CLEVR dataset did not generalize to left-out color+shape combinations. Despite rapid learning, the model's validation accuracy remained at chance, indicating a lack of transfer of same-different ability to the left-out conditions. The CNN+RN model trained on a modified sort-of-CLEVR dataset showed rapid learning but did not generalize to left-out color+shape combinations. Validation accuracy remained at chance level, indicating a lack of transfer of same-different ability to the left-out conditions. The model's performance improved to over 95% accuracy for image sizes of 120 pixels or below, but did not learn for sizes of 150 and 180 pixels, suggesting a limitation in the model's representational capacity.

The study highlights the challenge of representing visual relations with feedforward networks compared to biological visual systems. The limitations of feedforward networks in representing visual relations have been overlooked by computer vision scientists. Humans excel at learning and generalizing complicated visual rules, while the best performing network struggles even after a million training examples. Visual reasoning abilities are not exclusive to humans, as birds and primates have also shown the ability to recognize same-different relations. Birds and primates, like humans, can be trained to recognize same-different relations and transfer this knowledge to novel objects. Ducklings have shown the ability to perform a one-shot version of a visual reasoning experiment from birth, demonstrating a preference for novel objects based on learned relationships. This contrasts with the limitations of CNN+RN in transferring abstract concepts even after extensive training. The neural substrate of visual-relation detection may rely on reentrant/feedback signals beyond feedforward processes. While some visual recognition tasks can be achieved with minimal cortical feedback, object localization in clutter likely requires attention. The neural substrate of visual-relation detection may rely on reentrant/feedback signals beyond feedforward processes. Object localization in clutter requires attention and working memory, as spatial relations between objects in a scene necessitate attention even when objects can be recognized pre-attentively. Working memory plays a role in processing visual relations, particularly in tasks requiring spatial and same-different reasoning. The computational role of attention and working memory in detecting visual relations involves flexible representations constructed dynamically through attention shifts, avoiding template storage in synaptic weights. Humans excel at detecting object sameness and spatial relations, effortlessly creating structured descriptions of the visual world.

The exploration of attentional and mnemonic mechanisms is crucial for computational understanding of visual reasoning, aiming to prevent capacity overload in neural networks."
