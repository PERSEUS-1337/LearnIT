    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Improvement of Information Access Act of 1993\". The Congress finds that a well-informed citizenry is essential for democracy, access to Government information is crucial for accountability, and citizens should have timely and affordable access to such information. Government information is a national resource and economic asset that belongs to the public, and taxpayers should not have to pay excessive fees for it. Many Federal agencies hinder citizens' access to Government information by imposing excessive fees, making it difficult for the public to provide feedback on information policies, and delaying the development of standards for easier access. Additionally, timely and affordable access to Government information products and services is not consistently provided by these agencies. Improved public access to government information is addressed by adding a new chapter to Title 44, United States Code, focusing on information dissemination policies and practices. The new chapter in Title 44, United States Code, requires executive departments to annually report on their information dissemination policies and practices, including plans for new products, efforts to improve information accessibility, and progress in creating comprehensive indexes. The annual report must include details on query command structures, user interfaces, progress in creating indexes, methods for accessing information, protecting access to obsolete records, promoting information resources, and public comments received. Each department must publish this report by February 1 each year. Each year, executive departments, military departments, and independent establishments must publish a notice in the Federal Register by February 1. This notice allows for a 90-day period for the public to submit comments on information dissemination policies and practices, including the types of information collected, methods of dissemination, and pricing. The establishment must disclose methods of storing and disseminating information, pricing, and the quality of information. Comments received must be made public, and there should be opportunities for dialogue with the public. Agencies must publish in the Federal Register before discontinuing information products or services. Before discontinuing an information product or service, an agency must publish a notice in the Federal Register for a 120-day comment period, provide reasons for the discontinuation, and consider received comments. Each agency is required to disseminate information through various modes and outlets to enhance public access to government information.
