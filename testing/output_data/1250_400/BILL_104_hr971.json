The Homeowners Empowerment and Protection Act of 1995 recognizes the importance of preserving and enhancing the value of homeowners' properties. The value of a home is closely tied to the quality of the neighborhood and environment, including factors like water quality, air clarity, risk of flooding, scenic beauty, and wildlife resources. The Homeowners Empowerment and Protection Act of 1995 emphasizes the significance of safeguarding homeowners' property values. Factors such as scenic beauty, wildlife resources, and the impact of neighboring activities on home values are crucial. Current public participation procedures may not adequately inform homeowners about activities that could affect their property values. The Homeowners Empowerment and Protection Act of 1995 highlights the importance of protecting homeowners' property values. Homeowners have the right to access information about activities that could impact the value of their homes. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget must establish uniform Federal procedures for agencies to require notice for property impacting activities within 90 days of this Act. This includes applications for permits, licenses, or approvals that may generate pollutants or reduce the value of private homes. The notice requirement for property impacting activities includes providing written notice to homeowners within a 1/4 mile radius of the site and publishing notice in local newspapers. The agency may also notify homeowners likely to suffer a reduction in property value. The agency must provide notice to homeowners within a 1/4 mile radius of the site and may also notify owners likely to experience a decrease in property value. The notice should include details about the proposed activity, potential impacts on property value, contact information for the applicant and agency representative, and opportunities for public comment. Additionally, homeowners can call a toll-free number to express concerns and explore alternatives to minimize property impacts. Each agency must establish a toll-free number for homeowners to register concerns about potential property value impacts from proposed activities. The agency is required to thoroughly investigate the impact on property values and identify alternatives to minimize adverse effects. SEC. 4. HOMEOWNER RIGHT OF ACTION. SEC. 4. HOMEOWNER RIGHT OF ACTION. Any person conducting authorized activities that generate pollutants causing a significant reduction in the value of private homes can be sued by affected homeowners. Prior notice must be given before legal action is taken. Affected homeowners can file a lawsuit against individuals conducting activities that decrease the value of their homes. The homeowner must notify the defendant and relevant agency before taking legal action. The burden of proof lies with the homeowner to show that the defendant's actions caused the home value reduction. Class actions can be filed by similarly affected homeowners in federal court. The defendant's activities causing a reduction in the homeowner's home value can lead to a lawsuit. Homeowners can file class actions in federal court and may receive compensation for the decrease in home value. Attorney's fees and injunctions may also be awarded in such cases. The court may award attorney's fees and other costs in lawsuits related to violations of federal statutes. The United States district court has jurisdiction over such actions, and frivolous cases may result in the plaintiff paying the defendant's legal fees.

There is a statute of limitations of 5 years and a $10,000 threshold for actions concerning private homes. The Act does not limit other legal claims or require using it as a condition for other claims. SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE.
