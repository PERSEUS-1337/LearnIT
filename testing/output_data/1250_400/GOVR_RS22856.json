    "content": "Most civilian federal employees are covered by either the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) or the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS). CSRS employees hired before 1984 do not pay Social Security taxes or earn benefits, while FERS employees do. Both systems allow contributions to the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), with only FERS employees receiving employer matching contributions. CSRS and FERS are not subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), which protects spouses and former spouses of participants in private-sector retirement plans. ERISA establishes rights for spouses and former spouses of participants in private-sector retirement plans. It requires certain provisions such as joint and survivor annuities, compliance with QDROs, spousal consent for beneficiary designations, and default forms of annuities. Federal employees' retirement benefits are governed by Title 5 of the United States Code, which is similar to ERISA but with some differences. Retirement benefits for federal employees under Title 5 of the United States Code are similar to ERISA for private-sector plans but with some differences. Both require joint and survivor annuities and written consent for waiving the survivor annuity. However, ERISA allows pension payments to a former spouse to begin when the plan participant reaches retirement age, while Title 5 prohibits payment until the federal employee retires. ERISA allows pension payments to a former spouse to begin when the plan participant reaches retirement age, while Title 5 prohibits payment until the federal employee retires. Additionally, ERISA requires written consent from a spouse to name a beneficiary in defined contribution plans, whereas federal regulations allow participants in the Thrift Savings Plan to name anyone as a beneficiary without spousal consent. Federal regulations allow a participant in the Thrift Savings Plan to name anyone as the plan beneficiary without spousal consent. A state court decree can award a former spouse of a federal employee a share of the retirement annuity or survivor annuity. OPM will only pay benefits specified in the court order, and CSRS retirement annuity can be awarded to a former spouse according to state court decree. Federal regulations allow a participant in the Thrift Savings Plan to name anyone as the plan beneficiary without spousal consent. A state court decree can award a former spouse of a federal employee a share of the retirement annuity or survivor annuity. OPM will divide the retired employee's monthly annuity as directed by the court order and pay the specified share to the former spouse. The right of a former spouse to receive a share of a retired federal employee's retirement annuity terminates when the retired employee dies. A former spouse of a deceased federal employee may receive a CSRS survivor annuity if the employee had elected a survivor annuity for the former spouse or if a court order specifies it. A federal employee's retirement annuity terminates upon death. A former spouse can receive a survivor annuity if the retiree elected it or if a court order specifies it. The CSRS survivor annuity is 55% of the retiree's single-life annuity. The annuity is funded by reducing the retiree's pension. The total survivor annuities paid to spouses and former spouses cannot exceed 55% of the retiree's single-life annuity. The survivor annuity for a federal employee's spouse or former spouse is equal to 55% of the retiree's single-life annuity. If a former spouse has been awarded the full survivor annuity, the current spouse is not entitled to it unless the former spouse dies or remarries before age 55. An exception exists for remarriages lasting at least 30 years after January 1, 1995. If the remarriage ends, the annuity restarts. Changes to survivor annuity elections can only be made before the retiree's death. If a former spouse's marriage to the employee lasted at least 30 years, the survivor annuity restarts in the same amount if the remarriage ends in death, divorce, or annulment. An employee's election or court order for a survivor annuity to a former spouse can only be modified before retirement or death. Refunding contributions forfeits the right to a CSRS annuity, and state courts can block refunds if a former spouse is awarded a share of the annuity. FERS retirement annuities can be divided between a federal annuitant and former spouse according to a state court decree. Section 8470 of Title 5 exempts FERS from state court proceedings, but Section 8467 allows division of a FERS retirement annuity between a federal annuitant and former spouse based on a court decree of divorce, annulment, or legal separation. OPM will divide the annuity as directed by the court order and pay the specified share to the former spouse. The former spouse's right to receive a share of the annuity ends upon the retiree's death, unless a survivor annuity was elected or specified in a court order. The right of a former spouse to receive a share of a retired federal employee's retirement annuity ends upon the retiree's death unless a survivor annuity was elected or specified in a court order. A FERS survivor annuity for a former spouse can be elected by the retiree or awarded by a state court. The survivor annuity is equal to 50% of the retiree's single-life annuity, funded by a 10% reduction in the retiree's annuity amount. An employee can provide for only one FERS spouse survivor annuity, with the total amount paid to spouses and former spouses not exceeding 50% of the annuity. The worker's spouse or former spouse is entitled to a survivor annuity equal to 50% of the worker's full annuity before any reduction. The total amount of FERS survivor annuities paid to spouses and former spouses cannot exceed 50% of the single-life annuity. A survivor annuity terminates upon the death or remarriage of the spouse or former spouse before the age of 55. An exception applies if the former spouse's marriage to the employee lasted at least 30 years. If a former spouse's marriage to the employee lasted at least 30 years, there is an exception to the termination of a survivor annuity paid to them before age 55. The annuity restarts in the same amount if the remarriage ends in death, divorce, or annulment. A court order awarding a survivor annuity to a former spouse can be modified before the employee retires or dies. If an employee dies after completing at least 18 months but fewer than 10 years of service, the spouse is eligible for a lump-sum survivor benefit. This benefit may be paid to a former spouse or divided between a current and former spouse according to a state court order. If an employee dies after completing at least 10 years of service, the surviving spouse (or former spouse, pursuant to a court order) receives a lump sum and an annuity equal to 50% of the annuity that the employee had earned at the time of his or her death. A separating employee who elects to receive a refund of contributions to the retirement system forfeits the right to receive a FERS annuity. A state court can block this refund if a former spouse has been awarded a share of the employee's FERS retirement annuity or a FERS survivor annuity. An employee or former employee can designate a beneficiary or beneficiaries who will receive his or her TSP account balance in the event of the participant's death. An employee can designate beneficiaries for their TSP account balance by filing Form TSP-3. Spouse consent is not required for beneficiary designation or loans for FERS participants. CSRS participants do not need spousal consent for loans but spouses will be notified. Spouses of married FERS participants are entitled to a joint and survivor annuity with a 50% survivor benefit from the TSP. The spouse of a married FERS participant is entitled to a joint and survivor annuity with a 50% survivor benefit from the TSP. The participant's spouse must waive this right in writing before the participant can withdraw money. The TSP can recognize state court orders for divorce, annulment, property settlements, alimony, and child support. Former spouses may be eligible for Social Security benefits if married for at least 10 years. A divorced spouse can receive Social Security benefits if married for at least 10 years. Remarriage can affect survivor benefits unless the later marriage ends by death, divorce, or annulment. Children of a deceased worker can still receive survivor benefits regardless of the divorced spouse's marital status."
