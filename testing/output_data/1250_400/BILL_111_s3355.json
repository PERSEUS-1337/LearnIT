    "content": "The \"Veterans One Source Act of 2010\" establishes a one-stop internet website for information on benefits, resources, services, and opportunities for veterans and their families and caregivers. Congress finds that veterans and their families lack easily accessible information on benefits and resources. The Department of Veterans Affairs aims to modernize and streamline services, including using the internet for outreach to the veteran community. The lack of a comprehensive, user-friendly internet website with all necessary information on benefits, resources, and services for veterans and their families hinders the smooth transition from military to civilian life. Veterans seek personalized assistance from the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Department of Defense has successfully implemented interactive online tools for members of the Armed Forces, such as Military One Source. A consolidated and interactive Internet website is needed for the veterans community to streamline access to information and benefits. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will establish a single, consolidated, expanded, and interactive Internet website to provide information on benefits, resources, services, and opportunities for veterans and their families and caregivers. The Secretary may contract with a Federal or private entity to create and maintain a website consolidating information on benefits for veterans. The website will integrate dynamic features to provide a personalized and interactive experience for veterans and their families.
