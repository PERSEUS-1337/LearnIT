    "content": "The Act titled \"Women and AIDS Research Initiative Amendments of 1993\" establishes a program for research on women and AIDS. This program is added to the Public Health Service Act. The Act establishes a program for biomedical and behavioral research on HIV cases in women, including prevention research. Research includes transmission of HIV to women, prevention measures, and clinical trials on preventing HIV through treating sexually transmitted diseases. The Act focuses on research for preventing HIV transmission in women, including measures such as rapid STD diagnostic tests, single-dose therapy, prevention methods, and substance abuse prevention programs. Research also covers symptoms like gynecological infections, breast changes, hormonal changes, and menopause. The Act emphasizes research on preventing HIV transmission in women, including gynecological infections, breast changes, hormonal changes, and menopause symptoms. It also includes clinical trials for treatment and behavioral research on prevention programs. The Secretary must ensure that female subjects infected with HIV undergo gynecological examinations before participating in trials and receive follow-up services. Results of these exams must be analyzed to understand the relationship between gynecological conditions and HIV infection. Clinical trials will be conducted to determine the effectiveness of standard treatments for gynecological conditions arising from HIV infection. The Secretary will conduct clinical trials to determine the effectiveness of standard treatments for gynecological conditions arising from HIV infection in women. Support services, including transportation, child care, medical and mental health services, treatment for drug abuse, and services addressing domestic violence, will be provided to female participants in these trials. The Secretary will provide women participating in clinical trials with transportation, child care, medical and mental health services, treatment for drug abuse, and services addressing domestic violence. Services will be tailored to meet the specific needs of women in these trials, including training for trial conductors. Additionally, research will be conducted on barrier methods for preventing sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV. The Secretary will conduct research on barrier methods for preventing sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV, that women can use without their partner's knowledge. Priority will be given to identified research needs and opportunities from a 1993 meeting on topical microbicides. Research areas include early infectious processes, formulation of new preparations, and clinical testing for safety and efficacy. The Secretary will conduct or support research on early infectious processes, formulation of new preparations, clinical testing for safety and efficacy, and epidemiological research on factors of risk regarding HIV infection in women, including contraceptive methods, tampon use, and substance abuse. The Secretary will conduct research on HIV infection in women, including the use of contraceptive methods, tampons, relationship with other STDs, substance abuse, and sexual activity. The Women's Interagency HIV Study will include at least 5,000 infected women and expand the study sites. The Women's Interagency HIV Study will include at least 5,000 infected women and expand the study sites to ensure a minimum 8-year study period. The study will address the relationship between CD4 cells and the development of serious illnesses in women with HIV, including gynecological and other conditions specific to women. The Women's Interagency HIV Study aims to include 5,000 infected women to study the relationship between CD4 cells and serious illnesses in women with HIV, including gynecological conditions. Funding of $20 million for clinical trials in 1994 and subsequent years is authorized. For fiscal years 1994 through 1996, funding is authorized for prevention programs under subsections (c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4) totaling $10,000,000, $10,000,000, and $15,000,000 respectively. Additionally, $30,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 1994 for prevention programs under subsection (d)(1). For fiscal years 1994 through 1996, funding is authorized for prevention programs under subsections (d)(1) and (d)(2) totaling $30,000,000 and $10,000,000 respectively. Additionally, $15,000,000 is authorized for an interagency study under subsection (e)."
