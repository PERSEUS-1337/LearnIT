FINDINGS.\" \"Congress finds that Jackie Roosevelt Robinson, born in 1919 in Cairo, Georgia, was a multi-talented athlete who made history as the first black player in Major League Baseball. His exceptional skills led to numerous accolades, including Rookie of the Year in 1947 and Most Valuable Player in 1949. He was later inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962.\" Jackie Robinson's achievements extended beyond athletics, influencing civil and human rights in America. He was the first black player in Major League Baseball, preceding significant events in desegregation and civil rights movements. Robinson was voted the National League's Most Valuable Player in 1949 and elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962. He quickly gained public admiration for his fortitude, integrity, and athletic ability. Jackie Robinson's influence extended beyond athletics, as he was regarded as a person of exceptional fortitude and integrity. By 1947, he was more popular than President Harry Truman and other prominent figures in America. Robinson later became vice president of Chock Full O' Nuts and co-founded the Freedom National Bank of Harlem. He worked with various organizations to improve the lives of Americans and his legacy is upheld by the Jackie Robinson Foundation, providing educational opportunities for children from low-income families. The Jackie Robinson Foundation preserves his legacy by providing educational opportunities for children of low-income families, based on his principles and life. Robinson's personal achievements as an athlete, business leader, and citizen have positively influenced civil rights in the United States. The President is authorized to present a gold medal to Jackie Robinson's family in recognition of his contributions. The Secretary of the Treasury will design and strike the medal. Duplicates may be sold in bronze. The medals are considered national medals. Authorization of appropriations is also included. The medals struck under this Act are national medals for purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, United States Code. An amount not to exceed $30,000 is authorized to be charged for the cost of the medal. Proceeds from the sale of duplicate bronze medals will be deposited in the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund. Congress suggests designating a national day to recognize Jackie Robinson's accomplishments. The Senate passed S. 300 on October 17, 2003, awarding a congressional gold medal to Jackie Robinson posthumously for his contributions to the nation. Congress also suggests establishing a national day in his honor."
