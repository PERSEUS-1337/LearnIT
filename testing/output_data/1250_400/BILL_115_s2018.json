A qualifying child is defined as a child under 19 years of age, as outlined in section 152(c) of the Act. The term 'qualifying child' refers to a child under 19 years of age as defined in section 152(c). Non-citizens are excluded from this definition. The $3,000 amount in subsection (a)(1) will be adjusted for inflation after 2017 based on the cost of living adjustment. The tax credit adjustment for the calendar year is based on the cost of living adjustment. Any increase not a multiple of $50 will be rounded to the nearest multiple of $50. Taxpayers must include the name and taxpayer identification number of qualifying children on their tax return. No credit is allowed if the taxpayer's identifying number was issued after the due date for filing the return.
