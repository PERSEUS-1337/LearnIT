    "content": "The Department of Defense was funded by continuing resolutions until FY2011, with restrictions on new programs. The omnibus funding bill for FY2011 provided $659.9 billion for DOD activities, a reduction from the President's request. Military construction budget received $17.8 billion, a decrease from the President's request. H.R. 1473 provided $17.8 billion for DOD's military construction budget, a reduction of $2.2 billion from the President's request. The bill incorporated $4.4 billion worth of reductions to the President's request, including cuts to specific programs and major weapons programs like the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The bill H.R. 1473 made significant reductions to the President's DOD budget, including cuts to major weapons programs like the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, a new ground combat vehicle for the Army, and a new mid-air refueling tanker for the Air Force. It also added funds for various programs such as Navy strike fighters, equipment for the National Guard, medical research, Israeli missile defense systems, and the Military Career Advancement Account program. The FY2011 National Defense Authorization Act included funding for Navy strike fighters, National Guard equipment, medical research programs, Israeli missile defense systems, and the Military Career Advancement Account program. It did not allocate funds for the development of an alternate engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The House version authorized $725.9 billion, while the Senate version proposed $725.7 billion, with opposition to a provision repealing a law barring openly gay individuals from military service. The Senate Armed Services Committee proposed a $725.7 billion authorization bill in 2010, which was reduced from the Administration's request. The bill included a provision to repeal the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy, but it was dropped in a compromise version (H.R. 6523) that was signed into law on January 7, 2011. Both the House and Senate versions of the bill generally supported the Administration's budget request. The authorization bill in 2010, signed into law on January 7, 2011, supported the Administration's budget request. It included a 1.4% basic pay raise for military personnel and $485 million for an alternate engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The FY2011 bill authorized a 1.4% basic pay raise for military personnel and $485 million for an alternate engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, which was not requested in the budget. The President's FY2011 budget included $738.7 billion for national defense, with $733.3 billion in discretionary spending. The FY2011 budget for the 050 function includes $5.3 billion in mandatory spending, with a large portion allocated for military retirees receiving concurrent pension and disability benefits. The total Department of Defense budget request for FY2011 is $708.3 billion, including $159.3 billion for ongoing military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Additionally, $33 billion in supplemental appropriations was requested for FY2010 war costs to cover the deployment of additional troops to Afghanistan. The Obama administration announced a surge of 30,000 troops to Afghanistan in FY2011, bringing the total number of U.S. troops in the country to 98,000. The requested supplemental funds for war costs in FY2010 amounted to $162.6 billion. The budget request for war costs in FY2011 was $159.3 billion, $3 billion lower than FY2010. An additional $655 million was allocated for humanitarian relief operations in Haiti after the devastating earthquake in January 2010. The Obama administration amended its FY2010 DOD supplemental funding request to include an additional $655 million for humanitarian relief operations in Haiti after the devastating earthquake. The DOD relief effort involved deploying 18 Navy ships, 830 cargo flights, and nearly 21,000 military personnel. The budget request for FY2011 included a 3.4% increase for the DOD base budget and real growth in spending for other security agencies like the Department of State, Veterans Affairs, Homeland Security, and the National Nuclear Security Administration. The total requested amount for discretionary programs of security agencies was $719.2 billion, a 5.2% increase from the previous year. The Obama administration requested $719.2 billion for discretionary programs of security agencies in FY2011, a 5.2% increase from FY2010. The Department of Defense (DOD) base budget saw a 3.4% increase to $548.9 billion, continuing an upward trend since FY1998. Adjusted for inflation, this would be DOD's third largest budget since the Korean War. The requested FY2011 DOD base budget would be the third largest since the Korean War, with annual increases projected to exceed inflation by 0.8% for the following four years. Defense Secretary Robert Gates proposed reducing DOD's overhead costs by $10 billion annually to bridge the gap between sustaining the current force and future budgets. Defense Secretary Robert Gates proposed reducing DOD's overhead costs by $10 billion annually to bridge the gap between sustaining the current force and future budgets, aiming to increase funding for combat forces while cutting spending on administrative and support activities. Defense Secretary Robert Gates proposed increasing funding for combat forces by reducing spending on administrative and support activities, aiming to shift $10 billion annually to directly support combat units and achieve a 3% real increase in the \"tooth\"-related part of the budget. This involves making sustainable root-and-branch changes to cut overhead costs and transfer savings to force structure and modernization within the programmed budget. Defense Secretary Robert Gates proposed shifting $10 billion annually from administrative and support activities to directly support combat units, aiming for a 3% real increase in the \"tooth\"-related part of the budget. Initiatives included reducing funding for service support contractors, cutting the number of generals and admirals, and eliminating certain departments to increase efficiency in contracting for goods and services. Secretary Gates announced 23 initiatives to increase efficiency in DOD contracts for goods and services, totaling $400 billion of the annual $700 billion spending. Initiatives included affordability targets for new systems, contracting revisions to reward efficiency, and rule changes to reduce service contract costs. Some Members of Congress argue that projected budget increases may be insufficient due to rising personnel and operational costs. Some Members of Congress are concerned about the projected budget increases for the Department of Defense, as rising personnel and operational costs may not be adequately addressed. Representative Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon has mentioned that the planned budgets could lead to scaling back acquisition programs. Additionally, there are objections to exempting DOD from the budget freeze on discretionary spending, with calls for reductions in the military budget by terminating unnecessary weapons programs and overseas military deployments. Representative Barney Frank has called for reductions in the DOD budget by terminating unnecessary weapons programs and overseas military deployments. President Obama's announcement to begin deficit reduction exempts the military budget, which could lead to devastating cuts in federal programs. The FY2011 DOD base budget request amounts to 3.6% of the GDP, marking a leveling off of the DOD share of GDP since 9/11. The FY2011 budget sustains initiatives launched in FY2010. The FY2011 DOD budget request marks a leveling off of the DOD share of GDP since 9/11, reflecting the strategy and force planning assumptions from the Quadrennial Defense Review. The budget sustains initiatives from FY2010 and focuses on the readiness of U.S. forces for a diverse array of missions. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) emphasizes the need for U.S. forces to be ready for a diverse array of missions, with a focus on ongoing campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. Recommendations include increased funding for helicopters, UAVs, intelligence capabilities, counter IED technologies, and AC-130 gunship aircraft. Longer-term initiatives include converting one heavy Army brigade combat team into a Stryker brigade. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) recommends increased funding for helicopters, UAVs, intelligence capabilities, counter IED technologies, and AC-130 gunship aircraft. It also suggests converting one heavy Army brigade combat team into a Stryker brigade to address future global demands. The report anticipates adversaries challenging U.S. forces asymmetrically rather than directly confronting conventional military capabilities. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) emphasizes the need for the military to adapt to unconventional tactics and technologies used by adversaries, including cyber-warfare. It calls for strengthening capabilities to defend cyber-networks and operate effectively in cyberspace, alongside traditional domains like air and sea. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) highlights the military's focus on adapting to unconventional tactics, including cyber-warfare. It emphasizes the need to strengthen capabilities for defending cyber-networks and operating effectively in cyberspace, alongside traditional domains like air and sea. The report calls for specific steps to enhance cyber security and collaboration with other agencies for this purpose. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) emphasizes the importance of preparing U.S. forces to handle various missions concurrently around the globe, including stabilizing countries, deterring aggressors, counter-insurgency operations, and providing support after disasters or terrorist attacks. It also highlights the need to address the \"anti-access, area-denial\" capability that China and other adversaries are developing to target U.S. forward bases and naval forces. China or Iran could use various technologies to target U.S. forward bases and naval forces, which are crucial for U.S. power projection capabilities. These capabilities are expensive and make up a significant portion of U.S. defense spending. Overseas bases and naval forces are increasingly vulnerable to attacks from ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, submarines, mines, and small boats with explosives. Naval forces, including aircraft carriers, are at risk from various anti-ship threats such as cruise missiles, submarines, mines, and small boats with explosives. The QDR recommends using long-range strike weapons and submarines to counter these threats. Missile defense and electronic attack capabilities are also crucial for protecting forward deployed forces. The FY2011 budget request reflects initiatives to address these challenges. The FY2011 budget request includes funding for 1.43 million active duty personnel in the regular components, representing a 4.7% increase over FY2000. This follows a reduction in active-duty manpower that began in FY1987 and accelerated during the 1990s. The end strength of the Army and Marine Corps has rebounded since the start of combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. The FY2011 budget request includes funding for 1.43 million active duty personnel in the regular components, with a 4.7% increase over FY2000. The end strength of the Army and Marine Corps rebounded to 562,400 and 202,100, respectively, meeting goals three years earlier than planned. Congress authorized a temporary increase in the Army's active duty strength to 569,400, with a $1 billion budget for a 1.4% raise in basic pay effective January 1, 2011. Basic Allowance for Housing was scheduled to increase by 4.2% in FY2011. The FY2011 budget request includes funding for 1.43 million active duty personnel in the regular components, with a 4.7% increase over FY2000. Basic Allowance for Housing was scheduled to increase by 4.2% in FY2011. Congress approved raises in military basic pay higher than the ECI increase in most years since FY2004. DOD officials argue that service members are better paid than 70% of private sector workers and prefer to allocate funds to reenlistment bonuses and special pays. Military advocacy groups argue for a higher pay increase to close the pay gap between military personnel and civilians. The FY2011 DOD funding bills provided a platform for legislative initiatives regarding the revision of a 1993 law and DOD regulations on openly homosexual individuals in the military. Some Members of Congress argue that openly homosexual personnel in combat units could undermine cohesion and effectiveness, while others call for immediate repeal or a moratorium on discharges under the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. Two bills in the 111th Congress aimed to replace the law with a nondiscrimination policy. The tempo of deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan is stressing the services. Legislators are calling for the repeal of the 1993 law on openly homosexual individuals in the military. President Obama and two bills in the 111th Congress support nondiscrimination based on sexual orientation. DOD is conducting a study on implementing this change, while Secretary Gates has opposed repeal until the study is completed. Changes in enforcement procedures were announced on March 25, 2010. On March 25, 2010, changes were announced in the department's procedures for enforcing the law regarding openly homosexual individuals in the military. A proposal was made to repeal the 1993 legislation barring openly homosexual persons from military service after certain conditions are met. The repeal of the ban on openly homosexual individuals in the military was supported by the Administration and Congress, despite the Defense Department's preference for completing a review before any legislative action. Federal Judge Virginia A. Phillips later ruled the 1993 law unconstitutional and enjoined the DOD from enforcing it. Federal Judge Virginia A. Phillips ruled the 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' law unconstitutional on September 9, 2010. A month later, she enjoined the DOD from enforcing the law. The Ninth Circuit temporarily stayed the injunction on October 19, 2010. Under Secretary of Defense Clifford Stanley limited the authority to discharge service members for homosexual behavior. The DOD health care system budget request for FY2011 was $50.7 billion, serving 9.5 million beneficiaries through various medical facilities. The FY2011 DOD health care system budget request was $50.7 billion, serving 9.5 million beneficiaries through hospitals, medical facilities, and dental clinics. The system's cost has more than doubled in the past 10 years and is projected to increase annually at a rate of 5-7% through FY2015. Various factors contribute to the rising costs, including increased retiree usage of TRICARE, legislative benefit increases, and stagnant fees since 1995. The Bush and Obama administrations proposed fee increases for TRICARE beneficiaries, but Congress passed legislation to prevent them. The FY2011 DOD budget did not include fee increase proposals, but Secretary Gates expressed the need for cost control measures. The FY2011 DOD budget did not include fee increase proposals, but Secretary Gates expressed the need for cost control measures. The budget requested an increase in funding for development and procurement of weapons and equipment, with a shift towards more funding for procurement and less for R&D, reflecting the transition into production of major programs like the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The FY2011 DOD budget requested $11.2 billion for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, with $2.3 billion for R&D and $9.0 billion for procurement. The budget did not include funds for additional C-17 cargo jets or an alternate jet engine for the F-35, which Congress had added funding for in 2009. Some Members of Congress questioned the Army's Brigade Combat Team Modernization program, which aimed to develop new ground combat equipment and requested $3.2 billion in FY2011. The FY2011 DOD budget requested funds for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program and questioned the Army's Brigade Combat Team Modernization program, specifically the design of the proposed new Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) to replace current combat equipment. Secretary of Defense Gates recommended cancelling the manned ground vehicle component of the Future Combat System (FCS) due to design strategy concerns. On April 6, 2009, Secretary of Defense Gates recommended cancelling the manned ground vehicle (MGV) component of the Future Combat System (FCS) due to design strategy concerns. The Army then launched the GCV program to field a family of fighting vehicles based on mature technologies by 2015-2017. The development of the GCV was later revised after the existing competition for the contract was cancelled in August 2010. The Army cancelled the existing competition for the GCV development contract in August 2010, restarting it in November 2010. The FCS program's MGV component was terminated, but other elements were incorporated into the Army's Modernization program. The Army plans to deploy these components to all 73 Army BCTs by 2025, although their effectiveness has not been demonstrated in field exercises. The Navy's proposed FY2011 budget included funding for nine new battle force ships. The Army plans to deploy FCS components to all 73 Army BCTs by 2025, but their effectiveness has not been demonstrated in field exercises. The Navy's FY2011 budget includes funding for nine new battle force ships, with a total of 50 new ships planned over five years. The Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan projects a fleet growth to 315 ships by FY2020, peaking at 320 ships in FY2024 before declining. The Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan includes 276 ships, projecting fleet growth to 315 ships by FY2020, peaking at 320 ships in FY2024. However, the plan falls short of the 313-ship goal in the long run, with concerns about insufficient support for attack submarines and cruiser-destroyer forces. The estimated cost for executing the plan is $15.9 billion per year, but a Congressional Budget Office report suggests it would require $19.0 billion annually.

However, the plan falls short of the 313-ship goal in the long run, with concerns about insufficient support for attack submarines and cruiser-destroyer forces. The estimated cost for executing the plan is $15.9 billion per year, but a Congressional Budget Office report suggests it would require $19.0 billion annually. Specific shipbuilding issues discussed include the Navy's plans for next-generation ballistic missile submarines, known as the SSBN(X) program, with estimated procurement cost of $6 billion per submarine. The Navy's FY2010 budget included $672.3 million for research and development funding for the SSBN(X) program. The Navy plans to procure the first SSBN(X) in FY2019, with a procurement cost estimated at $6 billion to $7 billion per submarine. Concerns have been raised about the affordability of the program and its potential impact on the procurement rates of other Navy ships. The Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan may be limited in its ability to procure other ship classes while the SSBN(X) is being procured. The Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan may be limited in its ability to procure other ship classes while the SSBN(X) is being procured. Options for reducing the cost of the SSBN(X) program include procuring fewer submarines, reducing the number of ballistic missiles carried, stretching out the procurement schedule, using split funding, funding from a different DOD budget, or increasing the Navy's shipbuilding budget. The Navy's FY2011 budget proposed ending procurement of Zumwalt class destroyers and resuming procurement of Arleigh Burke class Aegis destroyers. The budget also called for procuring two DDG-51s in FY2011 and six more in FY2012-FY2015. The Navy plans to build an improved version of the DDG-51, called the Flight III version, starting in FY2016, carrying a smaller version of the new Air and Missile Defense Radar. The Navy plans to procure the Flight III version of the DDG-51 starting in FY2016, which will carry a smaller version of the new Air and Missile Defense Radar. The Aegis ballistic missile defense program aims to increase the number of BMD-capable Navy Aegis ships from 20 to 38 by the end of FY2015. Concerns have been raised about the growing demand for BMD-capable Aegis ships outpacing the supply. The Aegis BMD program aims to increase the number of BMD-capable Navy Aegis ships from 20 to 38 by the end of FY2015. Concerns have been raised about the growing demand for BMD-capable Aegis ships outpacing the supply, especially with the intention to use Aegis-BMD ships to defend Europe against potential ballistic missile attacks. Funding for the program comes mostly from MDA's budget, with additional funding from the Navy. FY2011 issues for Congress included decisions on the development of the Flight III DDG-51 design, funding requests for the Aegis BMD program, and providing additional funding to MDA or the Navy. The FY2011 budget requested $457.0 million for BMD-related efforts, including funding for the Aegis BMD program and Littoral Combat Ships (LCS). The Navy planned to buy two different versions of LCS before selecting one design for the fleet. The Navy planned to buy two different versions of LCS before selecting one design for the fleet. They accelerated the timetable for choosing between the two designs and announced a plan to have the winning contractor build 10 LCSs over a five-year period. Navy officials later sought approval to buy 10 ships from each of the competing industry teams. The Navy planned to buy two different versions of LCS before selecting one design for the fleet. They accelerated the timetable for choosing between the two designs and announced a plan to have the winning contractor build 10 LCSs over a five-year period. Navy officials later sought approval from Congress to pursue a different acquisition strategy, buying 10 ships from each of the competing industry teams. Concerns about fighter aircraft shortages due to budgetary limits on procurement rates were raised by Air Force and Navy officials. Congress is also concerned about the affordability of DOD's plans for modernizing the tactical aircraft force. The Navy and Marine Corps are facing a fighter aircraft shortfall of up to 800 aircraft by 2024, with concerns about the affordability of modernizing the tactical aircraft force. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, with an estimated acquisition cost of over $300 billion, is key to DOD's plans for tactical aircraft modernization. This program is the largest weapon procurement program for the DOD. The F-35 program is DOD's largest weapon procurement program with an estimated total acquisition cost of over $300 billion. The Administration's FY2011 budget requested $11.3 billion for the program, raising concerns about affordability in the face of constrained DOD resources. The F-35 program may not be affordable in the quantities planned by DOD without reducing funding for other programs. The British government reduced their planned purchase of F-35s from 138 to as few as 40 due to budget constraints. Congress has rejected proposals to terminate the program to develop the F136 engine. The British government plans to buy as few as 40 F-35 planes, excluding the vertical-takeoff \"B\" model. Congress has rejected proposals to terminate the program developing the F136 engine as an alternative to the F135 engine. Approximately $2.5 billion has been provided for the alternate engine program, with an estimated additional $2.9 billion needed to complete development. Critics argue that termination of the F136 engine program is driven by immediate budget concerns. Critics argue that terminating the F136 alternate engine program was driven by immediate budget pressures rather than considering long-term benefits. They believe engine competition on the F-15 and F-16 programs saved money and increased reliability. Some support the termination, stating that single-source engine contracts are more common and long-term affordability is best achieved through multiyear contracts from a single source. Concerns include operational risks of fleet grounding with a single engine design, impact on the defense industrial base, and relations with allied countries involved in the program. The cancellation of the F136 engine raises concerns about operational risks, impact on the defense industrial base, and relations with allied countries. It also questions the efficiency of the DOD's acquisition system and the challenge of cost control in a single-supplier environment. Additionally, continuing F136 development may affect the F-35 acquisition program and raise issues of supporting two different engines in the field. The Administration's proposed FY2011 defense budget requested $863.9 million for a new fleet of mid-air refueling tankers, KC-X, to replace aging KC-135 tankers. The competition for the contract involved Boeing and Northrop Grumman/EADS, with bids submitted in 2010. The Department of Defense released a Request for Proposals for 179 new KC-X tankers, valued at $35 billion. Boeing offered a tanker based on its 767 jetliner, while EADS proposed one based on the Airbus A330. The Air Force awarded a $35 billion contract for the KC-X tanker program to Boeing, with EADS and a team of Antonov and U.S. Aerospace also submitting bids. Boeing's design was based on the 767 airliner, EADS on the Airbus A330, and the Antonov/U.S. Aerospace bid was excluded for being late. DOD announced the contract award to Boeing on February 24, 2011, and EADS decided not to challenge the decision on March 4. The KC-X acquisition program has been highly contentious due to its value, job creation potential, and importance to U.S. military operations. The George W. Bush Administration had planned to deploy a modified version of the land-based BMD system in Poland and the Czech Republic, but the Obama Administration dropped that plan in favor of the Phased Adaptive Approach. This approach involves deploying BMD-capable Aegis ships to defend Europe and the United States against potential ballistic missile attacks from Iran. Similar BMD capabilities could be pursued in other regions like the Middle East and Northeast Asia. The Obama Administration's Phased Adaptive Approach involves deploying Aegis ships with BMD capabilities to defend Europe and the United States against potential ballistic missile attacks from Iran. The Administration requested $2.27 billion in FY2011 for PAA programs, including $712 million for unique development efforts and $1.56 billion for Aegis ship-borne BMD system development and procurement. The FY2011 base budget for military construction and family housing saw a significant reduction to $18.7 billion, mainly due to decreased spending on BRAC-related construction projects. The FY2011 DOD budget saw a reduction in military construction and family housing spending, mainly due to decreased spending on BRAC-related construction projects and privatization of military family housing. The budget for military family housing dropped from $2.3 billion to $1.8 billion, with an increase in Basic Allowance for Housing to cover a larger proportion of service members' housing costs. The FY2011 DOD budget reduced military construction and family housing spending, with an increase in Basic Allowance for Housing to cover more of service members' housing costs. The Navy's plan to establish Mayport as a second Atlantic Fleet carrier home port was endorsed in the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review, citing the need to mitigate risks and shift economic activity from Norfolk to Mayport. The proposal to homeport an aircraft carrier at Mayport, near Jacksonville, has received support from certain Members of Congress from Florida. The Navy estimates the total cost of moving a carrier to Mayport would be $589.7 million, including $46.3 million for dredging. Some Members of Congress from Virginia have expressed skepticism or opposition to the proposal, questioning the benefits and funding needed. The FY2010 DOD budget includes $139 million for facilities on Guam for 8,000 Marines and their families moving from Okinawa. Additional military personnel will also be relocated to Guam by 2014-2016. Guam's population is about 178,000 and is expected to increase due to the influx of military personnel. The plans to move additional military personnel to Guam from their current stations in the United States are expected to be completed by 2014-2016. Guam, a mountainous island with a population of about 178,000, is expected to see a significant increase in population due to the influx of military personnel, their families, DOD personnel, and supporting contractors. Analysts question whether Guam's current infrastructure could support this surge in population. Additionally, the U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) was created to centralize command of DOD networks and coordinate their protection and operation. The U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) was established to centralize command of DOD networks and coordinate their protection and operation. This involved integrating offensive and defensive cyber operations under one organization, marking a departure from historical segregation. In 2009, the U.S. Strategic Command established USCYBERCOM as one of its components, with the director of the NSA nominated to lead the new command. Gates directed the establishment of U.S. Cyber Command under the U.S. Strategic Command, combining offensive and defensive cyber operations. The NSA director was nominated to lead the new command. Some concerns were raised about the militarization of cyberspace and privacy issues. The FY2011 budget included $139 million for Cyber Command, mainly for infrastructure at Ft. Meade, MD. The FY2011 budget request for Air Force Operations and Maintenance includes $139 million for U.S. Cyber Command, an increase of $105 million from the previous year. This funding will be used for temporary facilities and infrastructure at Ft. Meade, MD. Additionally, the budget reflects a shift in roles between the Department of Defense and the State Department for foreign assistance, with controversial programs like the \"Section 1207\" and Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund being transferred to the State Department budget. The State Department/USAID Complex Crisis Fund and the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund are up for funding, with a total of $1.3 billion allocated in the State Department budget. The State Department will also take over Iraq police training responsibilities. There is a shift in roles between the Department of Defense and the State Department for foreign assistance, with programs like \"Section 1207\" and the PCCF being transferred to the State Department budget. The Administration is reviewing the division of security assistance authorities between DOD and State. Secretary of Defense Gates emphasized the importance of advising and mentoring foreign security forces, aligning with recommendations in the Quadrennial Defense Review Report. The Senate Armed Services Committee welcomes the review and looks forward to proposals for enhancing U.S. security assistance. Secretary Gates and Admiral Mullen emphasized the need for the military to strengthen their capability to train and advise partner nations' security forces, aligning with recommendations in the Quadrennial Defense Review Report. They also highlighted the importance of combining military power with diplomacy and other national instruments. This new approach aims to integrate defense and diplomacy to complement each other in international relations. The FY2011 DOD budget request aims to bolster civilian capabilities for conflict prevention and recovery, emphasizing the integration of defense and diplomacy. It includes funding for various security assistance programs, such as the Combating Terrorism Fellowship Program and new initiatives like the Stability Operations Fellowship Program. The FY2011 DOD budget request includes funding for programs like the Defense Institution Reform Initiative and legal instruction for foreign military members. Secretary Gates emphasized the need for a modernized national security system, with potential legislation for a pooled fund for security assistance. The FY2011 National Defense Authorization Act authorizes $725.9 billion for defense activities, $2.7 million less than requested. The FY2011 National Defense Authorization Act authorizes $725.9 billion for defense activities, slightly less than the Administration's request. The Senate version of the bill proposed a reduction of $240.7 million from the request, but was set aside due to opposition to repealing the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. Members of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees later negotiated a compromise version. The Senate rejected S. 3454, known as \"don't ask, don't tell,\" on December 9, 2010. A compromise version of the authorization bill, H.R. 6523, was signed into law on January 7, 2011, dropping the provision related to the policy. Funding allocations were not included in the bill. The defense authorization bill, H.R. 5136, S. 3454, and the final version, H.R. 6523, authorized a total end-strength of 1.43 million members for the armed services, with a 7,400 increase over FY2010. The final bill included a 1.4% increase in military basic pay, while the House-passed bill proposed a 1.9% raise. The final bill did not include provisions for increased allowances for married personnel or those at risk of hostile fire. The final version of the FY2011 defense authorization act did not include provisions for increased allowances for married personnel or those at risk of hostile fire. The Senate Armed Services Committee directed the Government Accountability Office to assess DOD's use of cash incentives to recruit and retain highly qualified individuals into hard-to-fill specialties essential in wartime. The FY2011 defense authorization act did not include a provision to repeal the 1993 legislation barring openly homosexual persons from military service. The House had adopted an amendment to repeal the ban after certain conditions were met. The FY2011 defense authorization act did not include a provision to repeal the ban on openly homosexual persons from military service. The Senate Armed Services Committee voted to include a provision for repeal in S. 3454, similar to the one in the House bill. Senator John McCain argued against Senate action, stating that the Department of Defense had not completed its review on the effects of repealing the policy. The Senate failed to invoke cloture on the defense authorization bill, with Senator John McCain arguing that action was premature without DOD's review on repealing \"don't ask, don't tell.\" The final bill did not include provisions for repealing the ban on military facility abortions or a pilot program for officers. The Senate committee provision aimed to protect U.S. service members overseas by applying to all DOD facilities, foreign and domestic. The enacted bill did not include a House-passed provision for a pilot program allowing officers to pursue varied mid-career educational programs. The bill also included provisions from a DOD commission on sexual assault in the military, establishing the position of director of DOD's Sexual Assault Response. The final version of the bill, H.R. 6523, includes provisions from a DOD commission on sexual assault in the military.

Navy and Marine Corps leaders agree that a fleet of 38 amphibious landing ships would be ideal for supporting two brigade-sized assault landings. The Congressional Budget Office is tasked with assessing the Navy's shipbuilding plans and their impact on the Marine Corps's ability to conduct amphibious landings. While Navy and Marine Corps leaders agree that 33 amphibious ships would be sufficient for two brigade-sized assault landings, cost increases and delays may hinder reaching this goal.
