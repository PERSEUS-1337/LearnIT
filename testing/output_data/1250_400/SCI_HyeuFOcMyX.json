This study introduces a planning phase in neural machine translation to control sentence structure. The model generates planner codes to guide word prediction, improving translation performance. Evidence from linguists suggests that speakers plan ahead during speech, a process not present in NMT models. In this research, a planning phase is introduced in neural machine translation to improve sentence structure control. Linguists have found evidence of speakers planning ahead during speech, a process absent in NMT models. The proposed framework inserts planner codes at the beginning of output sentences to guide word prediction. In this research, a planning phase is introduced in neural machine translation to improve sentence structure control. Planner codes are inserted at the beginning of output sentences to guide word prediction and disambiguate uncertain information about sentence structure. The model plans the coarse structure of the output sentence before decoding real words, increasing the effectiveness of beam search. In this work, planner codes are used to disambiguate uncertain information about sentence structure in neural machine translation. The codes are learned through a network that reconstructs the sentence structure with both input and planner codes. Experiments show improved translation performance and the ability to control the structure of output sentences by manipulating the planner codes. The goal is to provide a structural annotation that describes the overall \"big picture\" of the sentence to reduce uncertainty during decoding. The text discusses the extraction of structural annotations to simplify POS tags for sentence decoding in neural machine translation. It outlines a two-step process to generate coarse structural annotations and learn planner codes to remove uncertainty in sentence structure. The goal is to provide a clear \"big picture\" of the sentence for improved translation performance. The text discusses generating coarse structural annotations and learning planner codes to simplify POS tags for sentence decoding in neural machine translation. It involves computing discrete codes based on POS tags and using Gumbel-Softmax trick for vector discretization. The information from X and C is combined to initialize a decoder LSTM for sequential prediction of tags. The architecture of the code learning model involves generating planner codes from POS tags using Gumbel-Softmax trick. These codes are then used to train a regular NMT model for sentence decoding. The training data for machine translation consists of (X, Y) sentence pairs, which are modified to include planner codes (CY) connected to the target sentence with an \"eoc\" token. A regular NMT model is trained on this modified dataset using beam search during decoding. Various methods have been proposed to improve syntactic correctness in translations, such as restricting the search space with a lattice and incorporating target-side syntactic structures explicitly. Some approaches include interleaving CCG supertags with output words, training NMT models to generate parse trees, and generating words and parse actions simultaneously.

Some approaches include interleaving CCG supertags with output words, training NMT models to generate parse trees, and generating words and parse actions simultaneously. Different models have been evaluated on bilingual pairs from IWSLT 2014 Germanto-English and ASPEC Japanese-to-English tasks. The code learning model uses bytepair encoding and has hidden layers with 256 hidden units. The code learning model is evaluated on IWSLT 2014 Germanto-English and ASPEC Japanese-to-English tasks. Different settings of code length and number of code types are tested, showing a trade-off between accuracy in reconstructing source sentences and guessing correct codes. The setting of N = 2, K = 4 is found to have a balanced trade-off. The NMT model uses 2 layers of bidirectional LSTM encoders and 2 layers of LSTM decoders with 256 units for IWSLT De-En task and 1000 units for ASPEC Ja-En task. Key-Value Attention is applied in the first decoder layer, and residual connection is used between the hidden states in two decoder layers. Dropout with a rate of 0.2 is applied outside of the recurrent function. The NMT models are trained using the NAG optimizer with a learning rate of 0.25, annealed by a factor of 10 after 20K iterations without improvement. Conditioning word prediction on generated planner codes improves translation performance over a strong baseline.

Conditioning word prediction on generated planner codes improves translation performance over a strong baseline. By planning ahead and exploring diverse candidates, beam search performance is enhanced, but not greedy search. The results suggest that beam search performance depends on candidate diversity. Additionally, manually choosing planner codes can also impact translation results. The NMT model uses bidirectional LSTM encoders and LSTM decoders for translation tasks. Conditioning word prediction on planner codes improves performance. Beam search benefits from exploring diverse candidates, while manually choosing codes can also impact results. Different planner codes lead to translations with varied structures. The proposed method improves translation performance by conditioning word prediction on planner codes. Manipulating the codes results in translations with diverse structures. The distribution of learned codes in the dataset indicates room for improvement. Predicting structural annotations directly can degrade performance. In this paper, a planning phase is added to neural machine translation to generate planner codes that control the output sentence structure. An end-to-end neural network with a discretization bottleneck is designed to predict simplified POS tags of target sentences. The proposed method improves translation performance by removing uncertainty in sentence structure and allows for sampling translations with different structures. The framework can be extended to plan other latent factors like sentiment or topic."
