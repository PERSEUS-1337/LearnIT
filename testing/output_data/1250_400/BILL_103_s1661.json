    "content": "The \"Worker Protection Warnings Act of 1993\" is referenced in the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that the lack of uniform warnings for personal protective equipment in the workplace leads to confusion among employers and employees, increasing the risk of injuries and illnesses. The absence of federal standards for these warnings results in varying state requirements, creating a burden on interstate commerce. The purpose of this Act is to enhance workplace safety by establishing uniform warnings for personal protective equipment for occupational use and preempting any conflicting state standards. Section 6 (29 U.S.C. 655) is amended to include a new subsection requiring the Secretary, in consultation with the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, to establish uniform warnings for personal protective equipment within 12 months. Personal protective equipment includes gear for various body parts to protect against workplace hazards, and warnings are statements directing actions or prohibitions related to their use. The amended Section 6 (29 U.S.C. 655) requires the establishment of uniform warnings for personal protective equipment within 12 months. Personal protective equipment includes gear for various body parts to protect against workplace hazards, and warnings are statements directing actions or prohibitions related to their use. Standards will prescribe the full text of warnings and how they should be communicated to employers and employees. The amended Section 6 requires uniform warnings for personal protective equipment within 12 months. It mandates communication of warnings to employees, training on proper use, and consequences of non-compliance. The standards become effective 6 months after publication in the Federal Register, with exemptions for equipment already in interstate commerce. The Secretary must consider various factors when promulgating standards for personal protective equipment warnings, including manufacturer experience, means of communication, worker opinions, and expert input. This information must be submitted in written data and comments during the submission process. SEC. 6. PREEMPTION. Section 4 and Section 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act are amended to ensure that no state or political subdivision can establish different standards for personal protective equipment than those set by the Secretary under the Act. The Secretary cannot approve a state plan that includes requirements different from those set in occupational safety and health standards under the Act."
