Despite efforts through negotiations, aid, and sanctions, North Korea's capabilities have continued to grow. The U.S. has security, political, and human rights concerns in the region due to military alliances with South Korea and Japan. Thousands of U.S. troops and civilians in these countries are at risk from North Korean missiles. The United States is obligated to defend South Korea and Japan from North Korean attacks, with U.S. troops and civilians in the region at risk. North Korea's nuclear and missile capabilities pose a threat to the U.S. homeland. Negotiations on North Korea's weapons program impact U.S. relations with major powers like China and South Korea. Dealing with North Korea's totalitarian regime presents challenges due to its self-reliant philosophy. North Korea, founded on the philosophy of juche (self-reliance) by Kim Il-sung, has maintained near-totalitarian control over its people. The regime's large military acts as a deterrent to outside intervention and allows Pyongyang to extract concessions from foreign powers. Despite its provocative behavior and defiance of international norms, North Korea's militarization has given it leverage in diplomatic and economic negotiations with its neighbors. North Korea's militarization acts as a deterrent to outside intervention and provides leverage in diplomatic and economic negotiations. Despite indications of economic strengthening, internal difficulties persist with widespread poverty. Congress influences U.S. policy on North Korea through sanctions legislation and the North Korean Human Rights Act. Congress plays a significant role in shaping U.S. policy towards North Korea through sanctions legislation, the North Korean Human Rights Act, and oversight of nuclear agreements. It authorizes funds for aid and holds hearings on various aspects of North Korea's capabilities and intentions. North Korea's rapid advances in missile and nuclear weapons capabilities have shifted U.S. policymakers' assessment of the regime's threat to the United States. Recent tests have shown that North Korea is capable of striking the continental United States with a nuclear-armed ballistic missile, making it a top-line U.S. foreign policy and national security problem. Pyongyang's threats have increased in various domains, including nuclear weapons, missile technology, artillery, and cyberattacks. North Korea's rapid advances in missile and nuclear capabilities have made it a top U.S. foreign policy and national security concern, surpassing the Middle East and terrorism in the Trump Administration's first 18 months. Pyongyang has demonstrated threats in nuclear weapons, long-range missiles, submarine-based missiles, artillery, and cyberattacks. The regime conducted three nuclear tests from January 2016 to September 2017, with the sixth test being the most powerful. North Korea also tested missiles capable of reaching the continental U.S. and is developing a submarine-based ballistic missile program. The Trump Administration accused North Korea of the \"WannaCry\" cyberattack in 2017, highlighting its disruptive cyber capabilities. Initially, the administration pursued a \"maximum pressure\" policy to coerce Pyongyang into changing its behavior. The Trump Administration blamed North Korea for the \"WannaCry\" cyberattack in December 2017, showcasing North Korea's cyber disruption capabilities. They implemented a \"maximum pressure\" policy to pressure Pyongyang through economic and diplomatic means, similar to the Obama Administration's approach. The Administration successfully led the UNSC to pass four new sanctions resolutions against North Korea. The Trump Administration successfully led the UNSC to pass four new sanctions resolutions against North Korea, expanding requirements for member states to halt interactions with the DPRK. Trump emphasized the option of a preventive military strike, causing confusion with contradictory statements on U.S. conditions for negotiations. North Korea accepted an invitation from South Korea in early 2018. In early 2018, North Korea accepted an invitation from South Korea, leading to warmer North-South relations and setting the stage for the unprecedented meeting between U.S. and DPRK heads of state. Opinions vary on why Kim pursued diplomacy after a series of provocations. Kim Jong-un adjusted course to pursue diplomacy after meeting with Moon and Xi, driven by factors like harsh rhetoric from the Trump Administration, sanctions limiting North Korea's economy, Moon's outreach, and Kim's confidence in his nuclear deterrent. Trump and Kim met in Singapore on June 12, 2018, to discuss North Korea's nuclear program and future relations. On June 12, 2018, President Trump and Kim met in Singapore to discuss North Korea's nuclear program and future relations. The summit resulted in a brief joint statement committing to security guarantees, denuclearization, establishing new bilateral relations, working towards a lasting peace regime, and recovering the remains of U.S. troops. No mention was made of North Korea's ballistic missile program. Follow-on negotiations were agreed upon. The agreement between President Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore included commitments to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and recovering the remains of U.S. troops from the Korean War. It did not address North Korea's ballistic missile program. Trump announced the suspension of U.S.-South Korea military exercises and expressed a desire to withdraw U.S. troops from South Korea. The annual \"Ulchi Freedom Guardian\" exercises were subsequently canceled. The agreement between President Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore included commitments to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. The Defense Department announced the cancellation of the annual U.S.-South Korea \"Ulchi Freedom Guardian\" exercises. Critics point out the lack of a timeframe or verification mechanisms for denuclearization, as well as Kim's commitment to dismantle North Korea's ballistic missile program. The definition of denuclearization, sequencing of the process, and establishment of a peace regime were left uncertain. Some analysts believe North Korea's push for a peace treaty as a precondition for denuclearization talks is a tactic to delay and gain recognition. The definition of denuclearization, sequencing of the process, establishment of a peace regime, and normalization of diplomatic ties were left uncertain. Some analysts believe North Korea's push for a peace treaty as a precondition for denuclearization talks is a tactic to delay and gain recognition. Maintaining political momentum to implement existing sanctions is challenging amidst engagement initiatives. U.N. sanctions are a key tool to hold North Korea accountable for its weapons programs. The UNSC, led by the United States, adopted resolutions requiring member states to impose sanctions against North Korea for its weapons programs. A total of 10 sanctions resolutions were passed between 2006 and December 2017, expanding requirements to halt military, diplomatic, and economic interactions with North Korea. Sanctions initially targeted arms sales, materials aiding WMD programs, North Korean entities involved in WMD activities, and luxury goods transfers. Following North Korea's fourth nuclear test in January 2016, six more sanctions resolutions were adopted, the latest in December 2017, banning various financial interactions and trade with North Korean entities. Since North Korea's fourth nuclear test in January 2016, there has been a significant expansion of U.N. sanctions, with six resolutions adopted by December 2017. These sanctions now ban various financial interactions and trade with North Korean entities, leading to a decline of over 30% in North Korean exports in 2017. The Obama and Trump Administrations also urged countries globally to cut ties with North Korea beyond UNSC requirements. The value of North Korean exports declined by over 30% in 2017 compared to 2016. The Obama and Trump Administrations pushed countries to cut ties with North Korea beyond UNSC requirements. The US imposed unilateral sanctions on North Korea to increase pressure, with executive orders issued by Presidents Bush, Obama, and Trump targeting North Korean entities. Congress passed North Korea-specific statutes, including the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of 2016. In 2016, North Korea was designated as a primary money laundering concern by the Obama Administration, and in 2017, it was redesignated as a state sponsor of terrorism by the Trump Administration. Congress passed two North Korea-specific statutes since 2015, imposing sanctions that limit trade to humanitarian goods, prohibit financial transactions, new investments, and give the President authority to restrict certain sectors. U.S. foreign aid to North Korea is minimal and emergency-based, with strict controls to prevent the government from benefiting. U.S. persons are prohibited from engaging in trade with designated North Korean entities. North Korea's transportation, mining, energy, and financial sectors are targeted by U.S. sanctions. U.S. foreign aid is minimal and emergency-based, with strict controls to prevent the North Korean government from benefiting. U.S. persons are prohibited from trading with designated North Korean entities. Pyongyang's demands in negotiations regarding its weapons programs have been inconsistent, including requests for U.S. recognition as a nuclear weapons state and a peace treaty as prerequisites for denuclearization. North Korea's demands in negotiations for its weapons programs have varied over the years, including requests for U.S. recognition as a nuclear weapons state and a peace treaty as prerequisites for denuclearization. Pyongyang's behavior fluctuates between limited cooperation and overt provocations, driven by internal conditions like food shortages or economic desperation. North Korea has exploited divisions among parties and political transitions in Washington to stall nuclear negotiations. North Korea's ability to manipulate negotiations for aid and exploit divisions among parties has led to debates on the effectiveness of negotiating with them. Some analysts believe negotiations are necessary to prevent conflict and are feasible due to Kim Jong-un's focus on economic development. This could lead to a potential agreement where North Korea gives up nuclear weapons in exchange for improved relations, an end to the Korean War, and economic benefits. Kim Jong-un's emphasis on economic development in 2018 is seen as a possible sign of willingness to denuclearize. Many analysts doubt North Korea's willingness to give up its nuclear weapons, viewing their demands as tactical moves to ensure regime survival. Despite Kim Jong-un's focus on economic development, achieving denuclearization may be challenging without sanctions relief. Pyongyang's repeated statements affirming its nuclear weapons program cast doubt on any significant shift in intentions following the Singapore summit. North Korea has consistently reaffirmed its commitment to maintaining its nuclear weapons program, even declaring that its nuclear weapons are not negotiable and will not be relinquished for any amount of money. The country has also stated that it will only consider giving up its nuclear stockpile once all nuclear weapons worldwide are eliminated. This stance has raised doubts among analysts about the effectiveness of the pledge made at the Singapore summit to denuclearize North Korea. North Korean news outlets announced that the DPRK had realized completing the state nuclear force. North Korea suggested it will not give up its nuclear stockpile until all nuclear weapons are eliminated worldwide. The 2011 military intervention in Libya may have reinforced the value of nuclear arms for regime security. North Korean leaders fear overthrow without nuclear weapons. The 2018 Singapore summit conferred legitimacy on North Korea as a nuclear state. The summit met some of North Korea's demands, including canceling U.S.-ROK military exercises and easing sanctions. The President met with Kim and agreed to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula, satisfying some of North Korea's demands. Previous nuclear negotiations with North Korea involved halting nuclear programs for economic and diplomatic concessions. North Korea's nuclear activities were detected in the 1980s and 1990s. In the 1980s and 1990s, North Korea's nuclear activities were detected, leading to discussions on sanctions and diplomatic negotiations. A preemptive military strike was considered, but diplomatic efforts, including the 1994 Agreed Framework, resulted in North Korea freezing its plutonium program in exchange for economic incentives. The U.S.-North Korea 1994 Agreed Framework led to North Korea freezing its plutonium program in exchange for economic incentives. Despite delays, North Korea froze its plutonium program, received heavy fuel oil, and started construction on light water reactors. However, North Korea failed to declare all nuclear facilities to the IAEA, leading to tensions with the U.S. and the halt of fuel oil shipments and reactor construction. During the George W. Bush Administration, North Korea denied having a secret uranium enrichment program, leading to the halt of fuel oil shipments and reactor construction by the United States. North Korea then expelled IAEA inspectors, withdrew from the NPT, and restarted its reactor and reprocessing facility. In response to opposition to the Agreed Framework, the Clinton Administration negotiated with North Korea to curb its missile program and exports. North Korea agreed to a missile testing moratorium in exchange for lifting of U.S. sanctions and bilateral talks. Madeleine Albright visited Pyongyang in 2000 to finalize an agreement on ending ballistic missile development in exchange for international assistance. During the George W. Bush Administration, negotiations expanded to include China, South Korea, Japan, and Russia in an attempt to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. Six rounds of the \"Six-Party Talks\" from 2003 to 2008 yielded occasional progress but ultimately failed to resolve the issue. In 2005, a Joint Statement was issued where North Korea agreed to abandon its nuclear weapons programs in exchange for aid, a U.S. security guarantee, and talks over normalization of relations with the United States. Despite the promise of the statement, the process eventually broke down. The 2005 Joint Statement with North Korea aimed to abandon nuclear weapons programs in exchange for aid and security guarantees from the US. However, the process broke down due to verification issues. The Obama Administration's \"strategic patience\" policy involved pressuring Pyongyang to return to the Six-Party Talks and coordinating with allies for denuclearization steps. The goal was a comprehensive deal for denuclearization in exchange for normalization of relations and aid. The Obama Administration's policy towards North Korea involved pressuring Pyongyang through sanctions and military exercises, seeking a comprehensive deal for denuclearization in exchange for normalization of relations and aid. Sanctions targeted entities involved in weapons sales and illicit activities funding North Korea's WMD programs. Additionally, the administration issued executive orders to implement UN sanctions and declared unilateral sanctions. The Obama Administration's policy towards North Korea involved pressuring Pyongyang through sanctions and military exercises, targeting entities involved in weapons sales and illicit activities funding North Korea's WMD programs. President Obama issued E.O. 13687 after the cyberattack on Sony Pictures, enabling the seizure of assets of designated DPRK officials. Despite attempts at engagement, provocations by Pyongyang led to a cycle of action and reaction, with the US focusing on building consensus at the UNSC and pressuring North Korea through multilateral sanctions. The \"Leap Day Agreement\" in February 2012 was a notable exception to this pattern. The \"Leap Day Agreement\" in February 2012 committed North Korea to a moratorium on nuclear tests, missile launches, and uranium enrichment at Yongbyon in exchange for US assistance. However, North Korea violated the agreement by launching a long-range rocket and conducting a nuclear test in 2013. US policy towards North Korea relies heavily on China, its largest trading partner and diplomatic ally. China plays a crucial role in US policy towards North Korea, being its largest trading partner and providing essential aid to the regime. Despite not supporting Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions, China prioritizes stability on the Korean Peninsula to prevent North Korea's collapse. Beijing's strategic interests include having North Korea as a buffer against South Korea and the US. China's stance often hinders US efforts to impose harsher sanctions on North Korea in international forums. China's strategic interests in North Korea include using it as a buffer against South Korea and the US. Beijing often obstructs US efforts to impose harsher sanctions on North Korea, with Chinese companies violating sanctions and enforcement being inconsistent. However, in 2017, China increased its enforcement of UNSC sanctions, possibly to deter a US military strike. China's trade and aid to North Korea are limited, reflecting Beijing's desire to appear responsible internationally. Relations between Beijing and Pyongyang have deteriorated since Kim Jong-un came to power in 2011. Chinese President Xi Jinping has held summits with South Korean leaders but not with Kim, reflecting a shift in China's stance towards North Korea. Chinese academics are also questioning the benefits of maintaining friendly ties with North Korea due to the costs involved. Since Kim Jong-un came to power in 2011, relations between Beijing and Pyongyang have deteriorated. Chinese President Xi Jinping has met with South Korean leaders but not with Kim, signaling a change in China's approach towards North Korea. Chinese academics are reevaluating the advantages of maintaining friendly relations with North Korea due to the associated costs. Chinese public opinion has also shifted against North Korea, with many supporting a U.S. preemptive airstrike on North Korea's nuclear sites. China has agreed to stricter UNSC sanctions resolutions in 2017 and appeared to be implementing them. Trump and Kim's diplomatic efforts in 2018 seemed to improve the North Korea-China relationship, with Kim visiting Beijing for the first time to reaffirm ties ahead of a meeting with Trump. Since Kim Jong-un came to power in 2011, relations between Beijing and Pyongyang have deteriorated. However, Trump and Kim's diplomatic efforts in 2018 appeared to restore some of the previous closeness of the North Korea-China relationship. Kim's visits to Beijing suggested he was seeking to reaffirm ties with China ahead of the meeting with Trump. Kim likely has new goodwill and leverage in his relationship with Beijing after achieving results perceived as victories by China. Kim Jong-un's bold emergence on the global stage in 2018 may reveal more about the Pyongyang regime and its priorities. Kim Jong-un, who took power in 2011 after his father's death, has been assertive on the global diplomatic stage. He has pursued a two-track policy of economic development and nuclear weapons, aiming to strengthen his regime and improve the economy. Kim's efforts have led to better relations with South Korea, China, and the United States, as he seeks to secure his position as the leader of North Korea. Kim Jong-un has rejected external pressures to choose between nuclear weapons and economic development. He has pursued better relations with South Korea and China through a charm offensive. Despite initial hopes of political reform, Kim's ruthless consolidation of power shows his commitment to the dynastic dictatorship. Kim has carried out purges of senior officials and is believed to have authorized the assassination of his half-brother. Kim Jong-un has displayed a different ruling style than his father, allowing Western influences and being informal in public appearances. His wife has been introduced to the public, but their children remain hidden. Analysts see these changes as an attempt to appear young and modern, evoking his grandfather's \"man of the people\" image. Kim Jong-un's wife has been introduced to the North Korean public, while their children remain hidden. Analysts view these changes as an effort to appear modern and evoke his grandfather's image. North Korea, one of the world's poorest countries, has seen economic growth under Kim, with increased domestic production and sanctions evasion helping to mitigate the impact of international sanctions. North Korea has seen economic growth under Kim Jong-un, with increased domestic production and sanctions evasion helping to mitigate the impact of international sanctions. Market principles have been permitted to govern some sectors of North Korean business, industry, and agriculture, leading to an expansion in markets and ancillary services. Kim emphasizes domestic manufacturing and a shift in consumption from imported to domestically produced goods. International trade with China has played a significant role in North Korea's marketization process. Kim Jong-un emphasizes domestic manufacturing and a shift in consumption to domestically produced goods. International trade with China accounts for over 90% of North Korea's trade. Agricultural liberalization and favorable planting conditions have led to larger harvests since 2010. Food prices have been stable since around 2012, but food insecurity and undernutrition affect over 10 million North Koreans. Analysts debate whether Kim's changes can be considered sweeping reforms. North Korea estimates that over 10 million North Koreans, or over 40% of the population, suffer from food insecurity and undernutrition. Analysts debate the extent of Kim's reforms, as the regime prohibits private enterprise and cracks down on market activity. Limited access to healthcare and significant food shortages persist, with only the elite having access to better facilities in Pyongyang. The regime tightly controls where families can live based on loyalty to the state. The North Korean regime controls access to healthcare and housing based on loyalty to the state. Limited medical care and food shortages persist, with only the elite having access to better facilities in Pyongyang. The government tries to restrict outside information flow but some citizens are turning to foreign news sources. The North Korean government attempts to block foreign broadcasts like VOA, RFA, and the BBC, but some citizens have illegal or modified radios to access them. A 2015 survey found that 29% of defectors listened to foreign broadcasts in North Korea. North Korea restarted a mobile phone network in 2009 with over 3 million subscribers in 2017. Chinese cellphones are used near the border for international calls, despite being illegal. The regime allows increased mobile-phone use for surveillance purposes, and some reports suggest that North Korean officials consume foreign media and are involved in smuggling operations. Some North Korean cadres consume foreign media and are involved in smuggling operations. Chinese cellphones, although illegal, can be used near the border for international calls. The spread of cell phones enables faster dissemination of information in North Korea. Access to information could weaken the Kim regime, as indoctrination has portrayed the outside world as inferior. Thae Yong-ho believes spreading information within North Korea could bring positive changes in the political system. Thae Yong-ho, a former North Korean deputy ambassador to Britain, highlights the regime's indoctrination tactics to maintain loyalty to the Kim family. North Korea's large military, with significant defense spending, is concentrated near the DMZ for rapid deployment in conflict. The regime's reliance on WMD capabilities is to offset military deficiencies. North Korea concentrates 50% of its ground, air, and naval forces near the DMZ for quick deployment in a conflict with South Korea. The regime is developing WMD capabilities, including nuclear weapons and long-range missiles, to compensate for its outdated conventional military. Additionally, North Korea possesses a stockpile of chemical weapons and potentially biological weapons. Pyongyang has also developed offensive cyber capabilities, with 6,000 cyber warfare troops according to South Korea's Defense Ministry. North Korea's conventional military capabilities have significantly declined since 1990, with outdated weapons systems and inadequate training. Despite this, they could still cause significant damage to Seoul with artillery and rocket attacks. Analysts believe that in a war on the Korean Peninsula, the United States and South Korea would ultimately prevail, but at a high cost. North Korean artillery forces could fire thousands of rounds at Seoul in the first hour of a conflict. Most of North Korea's major combat equipment is old and inferior to modern systems. To compensate for this, North Korea has been focusing on improving its asymmetric capabilities in recent years. North Korean military's major combat equipment is outdated, based on Soviet designs from the 1950s-1970s. To compensate, they have focused on improving asymmetric capabilities like UAVs, cyber operations, special forces, GPS jamming, and stealth. Recent advancements include long-range artillery, tanks, infantry weapons, and submarines. Weaknesses in command and control structure would limit effectiveness in a major conflict. North Korea has constructed new helicopter-carrier corvettes and may be developing a larger submarine for ballistic missiles. The military suffers from institutional weaknesses that would hinder its effectiveness in a major conflict due to a highly centralized command and control structure. War plans are rigid and lack flexibility, with mid-level officers lacking training and authority for independent action. Resource scarcity affects military readiness, including fuel shortages for training, logistical issues, spare parts shortages, and food scarcity impacting combat endurance. U.S. analysts are concerned about North Korea's nuclear weapons development. North Korea's military faces challenges such as lack of spare parts affecting equipment availability and food shortages impacting combat endurance. U.S. analysts are worried about the pace of North Korea's nuclear weapons development and doubt Pyongyang's willingness to denuclearize despite talks with the United States. The North Korean nuclear arsenal is seen as a deterrent against potential attacks from the U.S. North Korea's nuclear arsenal, developed to deter potential attacks from the United States, includes long-range missiles and smaller, lighter warheads. Despite announcing a halt to nuclear tests in 2018, the regime continues to emphasize the importance of its weapons for survival. North Korea's nuclear program began in the late 1950s with cooperation agreements with the Soviet Union on a nuclear research program near Yongbyon. Its first research reactor began operation in 1967 and later built a small nuclear reactor capable of producing plutonium. Despite announcing a halt to nuclear tests in 2018, fissile material production and related facilities have not been shut down. Since the late 1950s, North Korea's nuclear program has evolved to include high explosives testing, plutonium separation, uranium enrichment, and construction of new reactors. Despite international safeguards, North Korea has produced enough plutonium for several nuclear weapons and has also pursued a second route to a bomb using highly enriched uranium. The country openly acknowledged a uranium enrichment program in 2009, claiming it is for nuclear power production. North Korea's nuclear program includes plutonium-based weapons and a uranium enrichment program for nuclear power. In 2010, they displayed a light-water reactor and uranium enrichment plant at Yongbyon. Additional clandestine enrichment facilities are suspected, with one identified at Kangson in 2018. Estimates on warhead and material stockpiles are challenging due to lack of transparency. Scholarly analyses provide scenarios for potential nuclear warheads by 2020. North Korea's nuclear program includes plutonium-based weapons and a uranium enrichment program. Estimates on warhead and material stockpiles are challenging due to lack of transparency. Recent scholarly analyses provide scenarios for potential nuclear warheads by 2020, with estimates ranging from 20 to 100 warheads. North Korea has conducted numerous ballistic missile test launches since 2011, aiming to improve offensive capabilities and evade U.S. missile defense systems. In 2016, they conducted 26 ballistic missile flight tests, and in 2017, they test-launched 18 ballistic missiles, including suspected ICBM tests. North Korea's nuclear weapons program aims to develop warheads small enough to be mounted on long-range ballistic missiles. They have conducted numerous missile tests, including 26 in 2016 and 18 in 2017, with a focus on improving offensive capabilities and evading U.S. missile defense systems. The country also possesses a significant number of short-range ballistic missiles, but their effectiveness is limited due to their age and inaccuracy. The medium-range Nodong missile poses a threat to the Korean Peninsula, mainland Japan, and some U.S. military bases. Experts believe North Korea likely has the capability to mount a nuclear warhead on these missiles. North Korea's nuclear weapons program aims to develop warheads small enough to be mounted on long-range ballistic missiles. The country has conducted numerous missile tests, including 26 in 2016 and 18 in 2017, to improve offensive capabilities and evade U.S. missile defense systems. The medium-range Nodong missile poses a threat to the Korean Peninsula, mainland Japan, and some U.S. military bases. Experts believe North Korea likely has the capability to mount a nuclear warhead on these missiles, as well as on hypothetical ICBMs like the KN-08 and Taepodong-2. North Korea has displayed mock-ups of these ICBMs, and the intelligence community has assessed that North Korea has taken initial steps towards fielding this ICBM system. North Korea has shown progress in its missile programs, including medium-range ballistic missiles and solid fuel MRBMs. The country aims to defeat missile defense systems and has not yet flight-tested its ICBM system. Successful tests of solid fuel MRBMs have led to plans for mass production. North Korea is also moving towards solid rocket motors for its ballistic missiles. North Korea's ballistic missile test program aims to defeat missile defense systems like Patriot, Aegis BMD, and THAAD. Tests in 2016 showed missiles launched at high altitudes and short ranges, making interception more difficult. The country demonstrated the ability to launch multiple missiles in quick succession in 2017, potentially overwhelming defense systems. Progress with SLBMs suggests a strategy to counter land-based THAAD defenses by launching attacks from sea positions outside radar coverage. North Korea's ballistic missile program aims to defeat missile defense systems like Patriot, Aegis BMD, and THAAD by launching large ballistic missile attacks with large raid sizes. Progress with SLBMs suggests a strategy to counter land-based THAAD defenses by launching attacks from sea positions outside radar coverage. Previous attempts to negotiate limits on North Korea's missile program have been unsuccessful. The Six-Party Talks did not address ballistic missiles. UNSC Resolutions 1718 and 1874 imposed restrictions on North Korea's missile activities. The 2012 Leap Day Agreement included a moratorium on ballistic missile tests. North Korea is reported to have a significant chemical weapons stockpile. North Korea is reported to have one of the world's largest chemical weapons stockpiles, including mustard, phosgene, and sarin gas. They have multiple facilities and storage depots for chemical weapons, with an estimated production capability of up to 4,500 metric tons in a typical year. North Korea is not a signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention and could potentially target South Korea and Japan with chemical weapons. North Korea's chemical weapons stockpile, including sarin, could cause mass casualties if used. South Korea and Japan are potential targets. North Korea is not part of the Chemical Weapons Convention. They have used VX nerve agent in assassinations and are suspected of having biological weapons capability. The U.S. is concerned about North Korea's proliferation of WMD and missile technology. North Korea's proliferation of WMD and missile technology is a serious concern. The DPRK possesses anthrax and smallpox, among other weapons agents. Pyongyang has sold missile parts and technology to various countries, including Egypt, Iran, and Syria. North Korea has cooperated with Iran on missile development since the 1980s. The U.N. Panel of Experts reported transfers of chemical weapons-related materials to Syria by North Korea. Iran's scientific advisors were seen in North Korea before the December 2012 missile launch. North Korea has engaged in illicit activities to earn hard currency, including production and trafficking of drugs, counterfeit currency, cigarettes, and pharmaceuticals. China has assisted North Korea's missile program, with a Chinese company selling heavy transport vehicles that were converted into missile transport-erector-launchers. The regime uses a global network of entities to support these activities. North Korea's regime engages in illicit activities to earn foreign currency, including drug production and trafficking. Office 39 oversees many of these dealings, potentially generating $500 million to $1 billion annually. The regime produces methamphetamine and supplies smuggling networks, with reports of increased production in 2017 due to sanctions. The direction of North Korea's illicit activities is often unclear. North Korea has increased its production of illegal narcotics, including methamphetamines, possibly due to tighter sanctions. It is unclear who is directing these illicit activities, whether it is state authority or local criminal gangs. The regime has also been involved in selling Cold War-era weapons to various countries, such as the seizure of a shipment of rocket-propelled grenades in 2016. North Korea has cooperated with Iran and Syria in developing ballistic missiles and supplying weapons and equipment. The regime uses front companies to conceal its illicit dealings. North Korea has cooperated with Iran and Syria in developing ballistic missiles and supplying weapons and equipment. The regime uses front companies to conceal its illicit dealings, often based in China with assistance from North Korean diplomats. The U.S. government has been sanctioning companies working on behalf of the North Korean regime, such as banning a Chinese bank from the U.S. financial system in November 2017. The U.S. government has sanctioned companies working on behalf of North Korea, including banning a Chinese bank from the U.S. financial system in November 2017. In the past, Banco Delta Asia in Macau was identified for distributing North Korean counterfeit currency and laundering money for the regime's criminal enterprises. North Korea's human rights record has also been a focus, with Congress passing bills and holding hearings on the topic. The State Department's annual human rights reports highlight the dire situation for most North Koreans. The U.S. government has sanctioned companies working on behalf of North Korea, including banning a Chinese bank from the U.S. financial system in November 2017. Past Administrations have drawn attention to North Korea's abysmal human rights record, with Congress passing bills and holding hearings on the topic. Reports highlight extreme human rights abuses by the North Korean regime, including a total denial of political, civil, and religious liberties, severe physical abuse, and a system of prison camps housing political prisoners. The North Korean regime enforces extensive ideological indoctrination and severe physical abuse on citizens who violate laws. There are reports of prison camps housing roughly 100,000 political prisoners, where conditions are extremely harsh and many do not survive. Close to 400,000 prisoners perished while in captivity over a 31-year period, with starvation, disease, executions, and torture being common practices. The number of political prisoners in North Korea has declined in recent years. Reports indicate that close to 400,000 prisoners died in North Korean captivity over a 31-year period due to starvation, disease, executions, and torture. The number of political prisoners has decreased recently, possibly due to high mortality rates in the camps. The United Nations has been actively addressing human rights violations in North Korea, establishing positions like the Special Rapporteur and the Commission of Inquiry to investigate and bring accountability to the grave violations in the country. The Commission of Inquiry (COI) investigated human rights violations in North Korea, concluding that the regime committed \"crimes against humanity.\" Despite recommendations to refer North Korea to the International Criminal Court (ICC), no action has been taken due to resistance from China and Russia. The UN Human Rights Council established a repository to archive evidence of violations for potential future prosecutions. The U.N. Human Rights Council established a repository to archive evidence of North Korea's human rights violations, which could be used for future prosecutions. Tens of thousands of North Koreans have fled to China, facing abuse and trafficking, with some seeking passage to South Korea. The UNHCR has not been able to conduct a systematic survey, and many women and children are victims of human trafficking in China. Many women and children are victims of human trafficking in China, with some refugees making their way to Southeast Asia to seek passage to South Korea. The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has decreased in recent years, possibly due to tightened border patrols. Elite defections in 2016 highlighted a changing demographic profile, with defectors of higher social status increasing. This may reflect increased border security, making it harder for less fortunate individuals to escape. The profile of North Korean defectors has changed, with a decrease in annual numbers since Kim Jong-un's rule but an increase in defectors with good songbun. Border security has tightened, making it harder for less fortunate individuals to escape. Diplomats responsible for earning foreign currency may defect if unable to meet expectations.

In 2004, the North Korean Human Rights Act was passed to support human rights efforts and improve information flow in North Korea. The North Korean Human Rights Act (NKHRA) includes provisions for U.S. nonhumanitarian assistance to be tied to human rights improvements in North Korea. It also established the position of a Special Envoy on Human Rights in North Korea, which was later merged with the Under Secretary of State for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights. The act allows North Koreans to apply for asylum in the U.S. and requires the State Department to assist with their applications. Congress has reauthorized the NKHRA in 2008, 2012, and 2018, with updates to enhance efforts for resettling North Korean refugees and increasing freedom of information in North Korea.
