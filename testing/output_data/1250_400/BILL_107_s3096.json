    "content": "The \"Ballistics, Law Assistance, and Safety Technology Act\" or the \"BLAST Act\" aims to increase public safety by assisting law enforcement in solving gun-related crimes through ballistics technology. It requires ballistics testing of all new firearms for sale and those in custody of Federal agencies to aid in identifying firearms used in crimes. Additionally, it adds ballistics testing to existing firearms enforcement programs. SEC. 3. DEFINITION OF BALLISTICS. Amends Section 921(a) of title 18, United States Code to define ballistics as a comparative analysis of fired bullets and cartridge casings to identify the firearm used. \n\nSEC. 4. TEST FIRING AND AUTOMATED STORAGE OF BALLISTICS RECORDS. Amendment to Section 923 of title 18, US Code requires licensed manufacturers or importers to test fire firearms, prepare ballistics images, store records in a database, and store fired bullet and cartridge casings as specified by the Secretary. This subsection does not create civil liability, except for civil penalties. The Attorney General and the Secretary will assist manufacturers and importers in compliance. The Attorney General and the Secretary will assist firearm manufacturers and importers in complying with requirements for ballistics equipment, database maintenance, education on ballistics, coordination with law enforcement, and any other necessary steps for effective ballistics testing. The Attorney General and the Secretary will establish a computer system for prompt access to ballistics records by law enforcement agencies and encourage training for ballistics examiners. They will also submit annual reports on the impact of the section on criminal investigations and prosecutions. The Attorney General and the Secretary will submit annual reports to Congress on the impact of the section, including the number of investigations where ballistics records were valuable, accessibility of records across jurisdictions, and statistical evaluation of test programs. $20,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2001-2004 for equipment installation and testing sites. The Department of Justice and the Department of the Treasury are authorized $20,000,000 for fiscal years 2001-2004 for ballistics equipment, testing sites, personnel salaries, and research. The Secretary and the Attorney General are required to conduct mandatory ballistics testing on firearms in their possession. The amendment will take effect once interoperability of ballistics systems is certified by the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Treasury. The Attorney General and the Secretary of the Treasury must certify the interoperability of ballistics systems for mandatory ballistics testing of new firearms to be possible. Section 923(m)(1) of title 18, United States Code, will take effect 5 years after the enactment of this Act, while Section 923(m)(6) will be effective immediately upon enactment. Privacy rights of law-abiding citizens are protected under this Act, stating that ballistics information can only be used for prosecutorial purposes if law enforcement officials have a reasonable belief that a crime has been committed and the information would assist in the investigation."
