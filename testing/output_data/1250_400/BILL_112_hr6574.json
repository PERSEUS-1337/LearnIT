Since September 11, 2001, around 30,000 veterans have been discharged from the Armed Forces due to personality or adjustment disorders. These veterans are then restricted from receiving disability compensation, severance pay, and retirement pay. Many of them struggle to find employment due to the stigma attached to their discharge status. The Department of Defense's compliance in separating veterans based on these disorders was as low as 40 percent between 2001 and 2007. A Mental Health Discharge Board of Review is proposed to review such separations. The Department of Defense had a low compliance rate of 40 percent in separating Armed Forces members based on personality or adjustment disorders between 2001 and 2007. A Mental Health Discharge Board of Review is recommended to ensure veterans wrongly separated on these grounds can access disability benefits and employment opportunities. The Department of Defense is reviewing military separations based on mental conditions that do not amount to disability. The Department of Defense is amending Chapter 79 of title 10, United States Code to establish Mental Health Discharge Boards of Review within each military department to review separations based on mental conditions not amounting to disability. Each board will consist of at least five members, including a licensed psychologist and psychiatrist, and will be equipped with adequate support staff. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review is established within each military department to review separations based on mental conditions not amounting to disability for members and former members of the armed forces since September 11, 2001. The board must consist of a licensed psychologist and psychiatrist, and be supported by administrative and behavioral health staff. Covered individuals are notified of their right to the review process. The Defense Department must ensure that covered individuals are informed of their right to request a review by the Mental Health Discharge Board of Review for separations from the armed forces. The Secretary of the military department is responsible for providing this notification, and failure to do so allows the covered individual or their representative to request a review. Legal counsel must also be provided to inform the covered individual of their rights. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review allows for a review of the separation of covered individuals from the armed forces. Legal counsel must inform individuals of their right to obtain representation and review includes assessing the diagnosis, decisions of the separation authority, and adherence to separation processes. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review reviews the separation of covered individuals from the armed forces, assessing the findings, decisions, and adherence to separation processes. The board considers evidence from Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs records, as well as private mental health records submitted by the individual. If the board proposes a review, consent must be obtained from the individual or their representative. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review notifies the individual or their representative before reviewing the separation process. After the review, the board provides a statement of reasons and allows for a motion for reconsideration with new evidence. The board may recommend against negative recharacterization of the separation to the military department concerned. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review can recommend various actions regarding a covered individual's separation, including no negative recharacterization, retirement for disability, new disability rating, and different types of separation. Compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act Transparency Requirement is also required. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review can recommend actions for a covered individual's separation, including retirement for disability and issuing a new disability rating. If no recharacterization is recommended, a brief statement of reasons must be provided. Military records will be corrected based on the Board's recommendation, effective from the separation date. The Secretary of the military department will correct the military records of a covered individual as recommended by the Mental Health Discharge Board of Review. Corrections will be effective from the separation date. Regulations for this process will be set by the Secretary of Defense. The Secretary of Defense will set regulations for the correction of military records as recommended by the Mental Health Discharge Board of Review, with specified deadlines for reviews. The Secretary of Defense will establish Mental Health Discharge Boards of Review within 90 days of the enactment of the Act, as required by section 1554b of title 10, United States Code. Regulations for the boards will also be prescribed."
