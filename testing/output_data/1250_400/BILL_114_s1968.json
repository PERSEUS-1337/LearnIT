    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Business Supply Chain Transparency on Trafficking and Slavery Act of 2015\". It includes findings and the sense of Congress. Congress finds that in 2014, the Department of Labor identified 136 goods from 74 countries made by forced labor and child labor. The United States, as the largest importer, faces increasing demands for information on human rights impacts of products. Courts have limited consumer actions for enforcing anti-forced labor laws, resulting in few enforcement actions in the past 80 years under Federal law. The United States faces challenges in preventing and punishing forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor in supply chains. Federal laws have limited scope and lack information on tainted goods. The Trafficking Victims Protection Acts allow for the termination of Federal contracts with contractors engaging in trafficking or forced labor. The Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2005 allows for the termination of Federal contracts with contractors engaging in severe forms of trafficking in persons or forced labor. Executive Orders and legislation have also prohibited Federal contractors and subcontractors from participating in trafficking-related activities. Federal contractors, subcontractors, and their employees are prohibited from engaging in trafficking-related activities such as charging labor recruitment fees, confiscating passports, and using fraudulent recruitment practices. They must maintain an anti-trafficking compliance plan with a complaint mechanism and procedures to prevent subcontractors from trafficking in persons. Congress recognizes forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor as egregious forms of exploitation. The sense of Congress emphasizes the need for legislation to prevent goods produced by forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor from entering the US market. Businesses and consumers should have access to information on products free of these abuses to avoid inadvertently supporting them. Public disclosures can help in avoiding promoting or sanctioning these crimes through the purchase of tainted raw materials or finished products.
