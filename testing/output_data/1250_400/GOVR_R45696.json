    "content": "The report analyzes forest management provisions enacted in the 115th Congress through two legislative vehicles, the FY2018 omnibus and the 2018 farm bill. These provisions address forest management on federal lands, federal programs for nonfederal lands, and forestry research. The focus is on changes to Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management operations. This report analyzes forest management provisions enacted in the 115th Congress, focusing on changes to how the Forest Service (FS) and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manage their lands. FS manages 193 million acres of the National Forest System (NFS), while BLM oversees 246 million acres of public lands. The provisions affect project planning, implementation, and procedural requirements for forest management activities. The report summarizes and analyzes forest management provisions enacted in the 115th Congress, focusing on project planning, wildland fire management, forest management and restoration programs, and miscellaneous issues. It discusses changes made in Congress, potential issues, and compares provisions to prior laws. The National Forest System consists of 193 million acres, with Congress addressing overall issues related to forest management. The National Forest System comprises 193 million acres, with a focus on protecting watersheds, forests, and providing timber supply for US citizens. Congress has expanded the uses of national forests to include recreation, livestock grazing, energy development, and wildlife protection. Management under the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act aims for coordinated resource use without prioritizing monetary gains or single-use dominance. The Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960 (MUSY) and the National Forest Management Act of 1976 (NFMA) guide the management of resources in national forests. NFMA requires the preparation of comprehensive land and resource management plans for each National Forest System unit, developed with public involvement and compliance with various laws. These plans aim to maintain resource outputs without impairing land productivity in perpetuity. The Forest Service must comply with cross-cutting laws such as NEPA, ESA, and NHPA. Forest plans outline resource conditions but do not authorize specific projects. Projects like timber harvests and trail maintenance must align with forest plan objectives and follow FS procedures for compliance. BLM manages 246 million acres of public lands. BLM manages 246 million acres of public lands, including 38 million acres of woodlands and forests. These lands are managed under the principles of multiple use and sustained yield, similar to the NFS. The 2.6 million acres of Oregon and California Railroad Lands are managed for permanent forest production, providing timber, protecting watersheds, offering recreational opportunities, and supporting local economies. Lands in western Oregon are managed for permanent forest production, sustained yield, timber provision, watershed protection, recreation, and economic stability. BLM must prepare and maintain resource management plans, ensuring compliance with laws like NEPA, ESA, and NHPA for proposed activities. NEPA requires environmental impact assessment for actions affecting the human environment, leading to an EIS and Record of Decision for significant impacts. NEPA compliance for proposed actions depends on impact levels. Significant impacts require an EIS and Record of Decision, while uncertain impacts may need an EA or FONSI. Agencies evaluate impacts and alternatives, including a no-action alternative. Categorical exclusions are actions with no significant environmental effects exempt from EIS or EA requirements. FS and BLM have identified CEs based on agency-specific criteria. The agency's decision-making process for proposals is informed by categorical exclusions (CEs) under NEPA regulations. CEs are actions with no significant environmental effects that do not require an EIS or EA. Agencies like FS and BLM have identified CEs based on past experience and statutory requirements. Each agency lists actions that require an EIS, EA resulting in a FONSI, or can be approved using a CE in their NEPA procedures. The agency's decision-making process for proposals is guided by categorical exclusions (CEs) under NEPA regulations. Federal agencies like FS and BLM have identified actions that can be approved using a CE, actions that require an EIS or EA resulting in a FONSI, and actions that may have extraordinary circumstances requiring further analysis. These extraordinary circumstances include flood plains, municipal watersheds, endangered species habitats, wilderness areas, roadless areas, and archaeological sites. The NEPA process helps identify potential environmental impacts and any additional environmental requirements for a project. The NEPA process helps identify potential environmental impacts and additional requirements for projects. Compliance with NEPA serves as an umbrella process for identifying impacts triggering other environmental laws. HFRA aims to expedite planning for hazardous fuel reduction projects on NFS and BLM lands to reduce wildfire risk. Compliance with other federal laws would still apply even if NEPA requirements are waived for certain actions. HFRA was created to expedite planning for hazardous fuel reduction projects on NFS and BLM lands to reduce wildfire risk. It defines specific projects and authorizes an expedited planning process for up to 20 million acres of federal land. It also defines terms like At-Risk Community as areas prone to large-scale wildfires with a threat to human life or property. Compliance with other federal laws would still apply. The curr_chunk discusses Hazardous Fuels Reduction Projects (HFRA Projects) which involve methods for reducing hazardous fuels in areas prone to large-scale wildfires. It also explains Fire Regimes and Condition Classes used to prioritize and assess fuel reduction projects, as well as the concept of Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) areas near at-risk communities with wildfire protection plans. The curr_chunk discusses Hazardous Fuels Reduction Projects (HFRA Projects) in areas prone to wildfires, including Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) areas near at-risk communities. HFRA projects are conducted in specified areas with departure from historical fire regimes and must be consistent with land management plans. Certain projects are excluded from HFRA, such as those in designated wilderness areas. HFRA projects focus on thinning, prescribed fire, or removing small-diameter trees to modify fire behavior while maximizing large or old-growth tree retention. FS must establish an objection process for proposed projects, with objections limited to parties who submitted specific comments during the comment periods. The HFRA projects require objections to be filed within 30 days of the agency's publication of draft decision documents. Objections are limited to parties who submitted specific comments during the comment periods. Judicial review is available if the objector is not satisfied after the administrative review process. FS replaced the post-decisional appeals process with the pre-decisional objection process for all projects. The administrative review process may be considered during judicial proceedings, unless significant new issues arise after the conclusion of the administration review. Congress directed FS to replace the post-decisional administrative appeals process with the pre-decisional objection process for all projects. The Agricultural Act of 2014 added a new Section 602 to HFRA, authorizing the establishment of landscape-scale insect and disease treatment areas within the NFS. Eligibility for this designation is based on declining forest health, risk of substantial tree mortality, or hazard areas. The Forest Service designates insect and disease treatment areas within the NFS based on declining forest health, risk of tree mortality, or hazard trees. Approximately 74.5 million acres nationwide have been designated for this purpose. Projects within these areas aim to reduce insect and disease infestations, prioritize hazard fuel reduction, involve collaboration with government entities, and consider scientific evidence while maximizing old-growth tree retention. Projects within designated insect and disease treatment areas aim to reduce infestations, prioritize fuel reduction, involve collaboration with government entities, consider scientific evidence, and maximize old-growth tree retention. Projects planned within the Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) require analysis of the proposed action and one action alternative, while projects outside the WUI must also consider the no-action alternative. Congress authorized the Forest Service to identify eligible National Forest System (NFS) areas for designation as insect and disease treatment areas, prioritize projects in those areas, and implement them through an expedited process. The Forest Service has proposed 206 projects in designated insect and disease treatment areas across 59 national forests and 18 states. Projects are evaluated using different analysis procedures, with some being processed using a categorical exclusion. The 2014 farm bill added a new section to prioritize projects aimed at reducing insect or disease infestations within these areas. The 2018 Farm Bill added a new section to prioritize projects aimed at reducing insect or disease infestations within designated areas. Projects eligible for this categorically excluded status must comply with specific requirements, including consideration of the best available science and collaboration in the development process. The 2018 Farm Bill prioritizes projects to reduce insect or disease infestations in designated areas. Projects must maximize retention of old-growth trees, be transparent and collaborative, and not exceed 3,000 acres. They must be located in designated areas and may involve road maintenance. The Farm Bill CE is used to document decisions on proposals, considering resource conditions and extraordinary circumstances. The FY2018 omnibus and 2018 farm bill expanded HFRA authorities. The FY2018 omnibus and the 2018 farm bill expanded HFRA authorities to include projects for fuel and fire breaks, with the farm bill reauthorizing procedures for priority projects in I&D areas. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized procedures under HFRA to expedite priority projects in I&D areas, including hazardous fuels reduction projects. It also established new statutory CEs for wildfire resilience projects and projects related to greater sage grouse or mule deer habitat. Additionally, the bill included provisions affecting interagency consultation requirements under the Endangered Species Act. The FY2018 omnibus and the 2018 farm bill established new statutory CEs for wildfire resilience projects and projects related to greater sage grouse or mule deer habitat. These CEs allow for larger projects (up to 3,000 to 4,500 acres) to be planned and implemented more efficiently, potentially improving agency efficiency. Some argue that larger project sizes, with or without a Categorical Exclusion (CE), can help the Forest Service (FS) achieve landscape-level goals more efficiently. A 2014 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report found that FS took less time to complete CEs compared to Environmental Assessments (EAs). However, concerns exist about conducting landscape-scale projects without detailed environmental reviews, as it may lead to undesirable resource effects. The FY2018 omnibus established a Wildfire Resilience CE for hazardous fuel reduction projects, similar to the Farm Bill CE. The FY2018 omnibus established a Wildfire Resilience CE for hazardous fuel reduction projects on NFS lands. Projects must comply with CFLRP eligibility requirements or focus on retaining old-growth trees for resiliency. No new permanent roads can be established, and temporary roads must be decommissioned within three years. Maintenance and repairs are allowed. The Wildfire Resilience CE for hazardous fuel reduction projects on NFS lands prioritizes projects in the WUI but allows projects outside the WUI in high wildfire hazard areas. Projects must not exceed 3,000 acres and follow specific location and purpose requirements. The Secretary must submit an annual report on the use of CEs authorized under this section. Seven projects were proposed in FY2018. Maintenance and repairs of existing roads are allowed for project implementation. The Wildfire Resilience CE requires projects in the WUI and high wildfire hazard areas, with specific location and purpose requirements. Seven projects were proposed in FY2018. The CE is only for hazardous fuels reduction projects, while the Farm Bill CE also addresses insect and disease infestation. Congress directed FS to apply evaluation procedures for the Wildfire Resilience CE. The Farm Bill CE does not prioritize projects within the WUI, unlike the Wildfire Resilience CE. While the Wildfire Resilience CE is for hazardous fuels reduction projects, the Farm Bill CE also covers projects for insect and disease infestation. Congress directed FS to evaluate if extraordinary circumstances are present for the Wildfire Resilience CE, but similar language was not included for the Farm Bill CE. Section 8611 of the 2018 farm bill mandates the establishment of a CE for projects to protect sage-grouse and mule-deer habitat. Section 8611 of the 2018 farm bill directs the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior to establish a CE for projects to protect, restore, or improve greater sage-grouse and/or mule-deer habitat within one year. Projects must be in sagebrush steppe ecosystems, consistent with resource management plans, and comply with specific activities like vegetation removal and targeted grazing. Projects are not allowed in designated wilderness areas or inventoried roadless areas, and no new permanent roads are permitted. The CE for projects to protect, restore, or improve greater sage-grouse and/or mule-deer habitat allows for targeted livestock grazing and herbicide use within specific guidelines. Projects are limited to 4,500 acres, must not include new permanent roads, and must be developed through a collaborative process. Monitoring plans and consideration of habitat restoration are required before using the CE. The CE for projects to protect greater sage-grouse and mule-deer habitat requires a 20-year monitoring plan and habitat restoration. The Endangered Species Act aims to conserve endangered species and their ecosystems, administered by FWS and NMFS. Species can be listed as endangered or threatened, with prohibitions applying once listed. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) allows for the listing of individual plant and animal species as endangered or threatened, with specific prohibitions applying once listed. Federal agencies must ensure actions do not harm listed species or their critical habitat, consulting with FWS or NMFS if needed. A Section 7 consultation is required for discretionary actions that may impact listed species, with exemptions possible under certain circumstances. The Endangered Species Act requires federal agencies to consult with FWS or NMFS to ensure actions do not harm listed species or their critical habitat. A Section 7 consultation is necessary for discretionary actions that may impact listed species, with exemptions possible under certain circumstances. The Secretary issues a biological opinion specifying terms and conditions for federal actions to avoid jeopardy or adverse modification of critical habitat. The FY2018 omnibus made changes to Section 7 consultation requirements for land and resource management plans. The FY2018 omnibus enacted changes to Section 7 consultation requirements for land and resource management plans on NFS, O&C, and CBWR lands in Oregon. The law specifies exemptions for updating forest plans unless they are older than 15 years and 5 years have passed since the listing of a species. Some view these changes as controversial and setting a new precedent for implementing the Endangered Species Act. The FY2018 omnibus enacted changes to Section 7 consultation requirements for land and resource management plans on NFS, O&C, and CBWR lands in Oregon. The law specifies exemptions for updating forest plans unless they are older than 15 years and 5 years have passed since the listing of a species. Some argue that these changes set a new precedent for implementing the Endangered Species Act, with controversy surrounding the need for Section 7 consultations for projects implementing forest plans or plan updates/amendments. Proponents believe the changes provide flexibility and consistency in plan implementation, while opponents fear negative impacts from not allowing consultation for changes in listed species and critical habitat. The FY2018 omnibus enacted changes to Section 7 consultation requirements for land and resource management plans on NFS, O&C, and CBWR lands in Oregon. The exceptions in the law allow for changes in plans reflecting updates to listed species and critical habitat. Critics argue that not allowing consultation for changes in listed species and critical habitat could harm species and their habitat. Proponents argue that projects under a plan still require consultation, making additional consultation redundant. The federal government's wildland fire management responsibilities include various activities such as fuel reduction, prevention, and suppression. The federal government's wildland fire management responsibilities include fuel reduction, preparedness, prevention, detection, response, suppression, and recovery activities. The FY2018 omnibus and 2018 farm bill made changes to wildfire suppression funding, wildfire risk mapping requirements, and reporting requirements. Congress provides discretionary appropriations for wildland fire management to both FS and DOI. The laws also changed aspects of hazardous fuel reduction programs, including expediting priority projects in NFS areas and expanding the definition of authorized fuel reduction projects. The federal government provides discretionary appropriations for wildland fire management to both FS and DOI through the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. Funding is allocated to the Office of Wildland Fire and four agencies\u2014BLM, Bureau of Indian Affairs, National Park Service, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Within FS's and DOI's Wildland Fire Management account, funding is provided for Suppression Operations program to control wildfires on federal land, including firefighter salaries, equipment, aviation operations, and incident support. If suppression funding is exhausted, FS and DOI can transfer funds from other accounts for wildfire response. Overall, appropriations for wildland fire management have increased significantly since the 1990s, with a large portion of the increase going towards rising suppression costs. The Forest Service (FS) and Department of the Interior (DOI) often require more suppression funds than allocated, leading to \"fire borrowing\" from other accounts. This practice has raised concerns that increased suppression spending may negatively impact other agency programs. Congress typically enacts supplemental appropriations to repay transferred funds and replenish wildfire accounts. The 115th Congress established a new mechanism for wildfire suppression funding in the FY2018 omnibus, known as the wildfire funding fix. Discretionary spending, including wildfire spending, is subject to statutory limits enforced through sequestration if exceeded. Congress has explored providing wildfire spending outside of these constraints. The Budget Control Act of 2011 sets limits on discretionary spending from FY2012 to FY2021. Exceeding these limits triggers sequestration, with certain spending exempted. The FY2018 omnibus added an adjustment for wildfire suppression spending starting in FY2020. The FY2018 omnibus amended BBEDCA to add a new adjustment for wildfire suppression operations starting in FY2020. This adjustment applies to spending above the 10-year average for FY2015, capped at $2.95 billion in FY2027. The FY2018 omnibus amended BBEDCA to add a new adjustment for wildfire suppression operations starting in FY2020, with funding capped at $2.95 billion in FY2027. Congress could appropriate up to $3.64 billion in total in FY2020 for suppression operations, effectively outside of the discretionary limits. The FY2018 omnibus amended BBEDCA to add a new adjustment for wildfire suppression operations starting in FY2020, with funding capped at $2.95 billion in FY2027. Agencies could be appropriated up to $3.64 billion in total in FY2020, effectively outside of the discretionary limits. This potentially removes budget process barriers for providing additional wildfire suppression funds for FY2020 and FY2021. The wildfire adjustment would still be applicable if new limits are statutorily established between FY2022 through FY2027, but would no longer apply if no new limits are enacted. Congress's continuation of fire borrowing authority to the agencies once the wildfire adjustment is in effect starting in FY2020 is unclear. The FY2018 omnibus amended BBEDCA to add a new adjustment for wildfire suppression operations starting in FY2020, with funding capped at $2.95 billion in FY2027. If no new limits are enacted, the wildfire adjustment would no longer apply. It is unclear if Congress would continue to provide fire borrowing authority to the agencies once the wildfire adjustment is in effect. Congress would need to take additional action to ensure agencies have access to funds for federal services in response to wildfires. The wildfire funding fix raises concerns, such as the lack of reporting on the 10-year suppression obligation for FY2020 by FS. The wildfire funding fix raises concerns for Congress, including lack of reporting on 10-year suppression obligations and no ties to inflationary factors. It is a temporary procedural change that does not address various concerns related to suppression costs and management. The Fire Modeling Institute developed a Wildfire Hazard Potential index to aid in strategic planning and fuel management decisions. The Fire Modeling Institute created a Wildfire Hazard Potential (WHP) index to assist in strategic planning and fuel management decisions. The index estimates that 226 million acres in the US have high or very high WHP, with 53% being federal land and the rest state, tribal, other public, or private lands. High or very high WHP indicates fuels with a higher chance of extreme fire behavior under certain weather conditions. The Wildfire Hazard Potential (WHP) index estimates that 226 million acres in the US have high or very high WHP, with 53% being federal land and the rest state, tribal, other public, or private lands. High or very high WHP indicates fuels with a higher chance of extreme fire behavior under certain weather conditions. The FY2018 omnibus directs FS to pair the WHP with appropriate spatial data for community use and develop web-based wildfire hazard severity maps for at-risk communities adjacent to NFS lands or affected by wildland fire. The FY2018 omnibus and the 2018 farm bill require FS and BLM to submit reports to Congress on wildland fire management. The report must document the use of the wildfire funding fix, overall spending, and analyze fire size, costs, and regional location. It should be prepared in consultation with the OMB Director and submitted to specific House and Senate Committees. The 2018 farm bill mandates the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior to submit a report to Congress on wildfire, insect infestation, and disease prevention on federal land. The report must include analysis on wildfire funding, spending, fire size, costs, regional location, and risk-based factors influencing suppression management decisions. It should also cover lessons learned from a statistically significant sample of large fires and the effectiveness of fuel treatments and preparedness activities. The 2018 farm bill mandates a report to Congress on wildfire, insect infestation, and disease prevention on federal land. The report includes data on treated acres, fire risk levels, wildfires' impact on treated and untreated land, federal response time, timber production, road and trail maintenance needs, and measures for water quality improvement. Forest restoration activities on federal land aim to establish or reestablish ecological processes for resilience and resistance to disturbances like insect infestation or wildfire. This may involve thinning trees to reduce density or using prescribed fire to manage vegetation and prevent intense wildfires. Forest restoration on federal land involves activities such as thinning trees and using prescribed fire to reduce tree density and prevent intense wildfires. The authority for these projects comes from laws like FLPMA for BLM and responsibilities like protecting the NFS for FS. Congress has also authorized specific programs for forest restoration on federal lands. The Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management have specific forest restoration programs authorized by Congress, including the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program and stewardship contracting authority. These programs allow partnerships with stakeholders to address forest restoration needs and mitigate wildfire risks. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP) and stewardship contracting authority are part of the Forest Service's \"Shared Stewardship\" approach to address landscape-scale land management concerns. These programs aim to accelerate forest restoration, mitigate insect and disease infestations, reduce wildfire risks, and provide benefits to surrounding communities. Stakeholders generally support these programs, although some have raised concerns. The CFLRP, established by the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009, funds collaboratively developed restoration proposals for priority forest landscapes through a transparent and inclusive process. The CFLRP, established by the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009, funds restoration proposals for priority forest landscapes through a transparent and inclusive process. Priority landscapes must be at least 50,000 acres of NFS lands in need of restoration, accessible by wood-processing infrastructure. Proposals must incorporate the best available science, maintain old-growth stands, reduce hazardous fuels, and not include new permanent roads. Annual accomplishments reports and 5-year status reports are required. The CFLRP funds restoration proposals for priority forest landscapes, focusing on maintaining old-growth stands and reducing hazardous fuels. Proposals cannot include new permanent roads, and any temporary roads must be decommissioned. The law requires annual accomplishments reports and 5-year status reports to specified congressional committees. The Secretary of Agriculture can select and fund up to 10 proposals per fiscal year, with a funding commitment of up to $4 million per year for up to 10 years. The CFLRP program funds forest restoration projects with a funding commitment of up to $4 million per year for up to 10 years. The program received $40 million annually in appropriations from FY2014 through FY2019. It is perceived as successful in achieving land management objectives and contributing to local economies. The dedicated funding provides stability for project implementation, but some feel it may divert resources from other areas. The CFLRP program provides long-term stability and predictability for project implementation and coordination, funded up to $4 million per year for 10 years. While it offers economic benefits, some criticize its lack of support for new markets and high treatment costs. Collaboration with community stakeholders is seen as positive, but mainly focuses on simple issues. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized the program with up to $80 million in annual appropriations through FY2023, allowing for a one-time waiver to extend funding for existing projects. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized the CFLRP program with up to $80 million in annual appropriations through FY2023. It allowed for a one-time waiver to extend funding for existing projects for up to an additional 10 years. The law also added the House and Senate Committees on Agriculture as recipients of program status reports. The funding commitment for selected proposals is set to expire at the end of FY2019, so reauthorization and extension of eligibility could result in projects continuing beyond the initial time-frame. Additionally, more projects could be selected and funded if Congress appropriates to the new authorization level. The 2014 farm bill authorized FS and BLM to enter into good neighbor agreements with state governments for restoration work on NFS and BLM public lands. The 2014 farm bill authorized FS and BLM to enter into good neighbor agreements (GNAs) with state governments for restoration work on NFS and BLM public lands. States are authorized to do restoration work including treating insect- and disease-infested trees, reducing hazardous fuels, and other activities to improve forest, rangeland, and watershed health. The law prohibits treatments in designated wilderness areas and does not include construction, repair, or restoration of paved roads. States may perform the work, but FS and BLM retain responsibility to comply with federal laws. The 2014 farm bill authorized FS and BLM to enter into good neighbor agreements (GNAs) with state governments for restoration work on NFS and BLM public lands. States may perform the work, but FS and BLM retain responsibility to comply with federal laws. MAs and SPAs outline the scope and terms of the agreements, with a primary emphasis on specific project types like timber production, wildlife, hazardous fuels management, and other activities. The good neighbor authority is generally perceived as successful. The good neighbor authority allows for a variety of activities with a focus on specific project types like timber production, wildlife, hazardous fuels management, and other activities. It has been successful in enhancing state-federal relationships and performing cross boundary restoration work. Changes enacted in the FY2018 omnibus and the 2018 farm bill expanded the authority to include road construction on NFS roads and include federally recognized Indian tribes and county governments. Funding and resource capacity varied across participating states, with some concerns about sustained future work. The 2018 farm bill expanded the Good Neighbor Authority (GNA) to include federally recognized Indian tribes and county governments, allowing for road construction and other restoration activities on defined NFS roads. Funds received through GNA timber sales can be retained by states for additional projects until FY2023. This expansion may increase cross-boundary restoration work opportunities but could also lead to increased administrative demands on agencies like FS or BLM. The Good Neighbor Authority (GNA) was expanded in the 2018 farm bill to include tribes and county governments, allowing for road construction and restoration activities on NFS roads. This may lead to increased opportunities for cross-boundary restoration work but could also increase administrative demands on agencies like FS or BLM. Stewardship end-result contracting was established as a pilot program in 1999 and made permanent in the 2014 farm bill, allowing FS and BLM to enter into multi-year contracts to achieve land management goals. FS and BLM can enter into multi-year dual service and timber sale contracts to achieve land management goals, including restoring water quality, improving forest health, reducing fire hazards, and restoring native plant species. Excess revenue from timber sales can be deposited into a Stewardship Contracting Fund for use on other projects. Stewardship contracting allows FS and BLM to use excess timber sale revenue for various projects without further appropriation. Contracts are awarded based on best value, considering past performance and proposal quality. Annual reports are required on the progress of stewardship contracts, which are generally well-received for increasing restoration goals and economic benefits. Stewardship contracting is generally viewed favorably by stakeholders, with increased opportunities for restoration goals and economic benefits. Concerns include the incentive to remove ecologically important trees for service work, distribution of contract receipts, up-front financial obligations, and slow implementation pace. Initial implementation challenges were attributed to contract complexity and poor record-keeping. The stewardship contracting program faced challenges with revenue-sharing requirements, up-front financial obligations, and slow implementation pace. Initial difficulties were due to contract complexity and poor record-keeping. Despite improvements in integrating contracting systems and offering more contracts annually, a 2015 USDA OIG report highlighted issues with contract administration and record-keeping. Changes in the FY2018 omnibus authorized 20-year stewardship contracts for FS and BLM. The FY2018 omnibus authorized FS and BLM to enter into 20-year stewardship contracts in Fire Regime Groups I, II, and III areas. The law also allows a procurement preference for innovative forest product use and includes a cancellation ceiling provision. Funds can be obligated in stages for cancellation ceilings, with excess revenues used for outstanding liabilities. Congressional notification is required for cancellation ceilings over $25 million without proposed funding. The law authorizes FS and BLM to use excess revenues to pay for outstanding liabilities from cancelled contracts. Congressional notification is needed for stewardship contracts over $25 million without proposed funding. The cancellation ceiling provision allows funds to be obligated in stages, providing flexibility. 20-year stewardship contracts and procurement preference aim to increase market certainty for forest products industries. Protection of watersheds is an authorized activity of many FS programs. The Forest Service (FS) and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) can use excess revenues for outstanding liabilities from cancelled contracts. Congressional notification is required for stewardship contracts over $25 million. The cancellation ceiling provision allows funds to be obligated in stages, providing flexibility. 20-year stewardship contracts and procurement preference aim to support forest products industries. FS identified inadequacies in watershed programs in a 2006 assessment report, leading to the development of a Watershed Condition Framework (WCF) to prioritize watershed management on NFS lands. The Forest Service developed a Watershed Condition Framework (WCF) to prioritize watershed management on NFS lands. In 2017, a USDA OIG report highlighted inadequacies in FS' management of the WCF program. Section 8405 of the 2018 farm bill codified the WCF program in statute and provided guidance on program priorities. The 2018 farm bill codified the Watershed Condition Framework (WCF) program in statute, assigning specific responsibilities and priorities for watershed protection and restoration on NFS land. The law allows the Forest Service to evaluate watershed conditions, identify priority watersheds for protection and restoration, and develop action plans in coordination with nonfederal landowners. Additionally, an emergency designation process is authorized for prioritizing watershed rehabilitation after significant wildfire impact. The 2018 farm bill authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a Water Source Protection program for watershed restoration and enhancement purposes on NFS lands. This includes activities like improving fish, wildlife, and other resources within the watershed through cooperative agreements with federal, tribal, state, and local governments, as well as private and nonprofit entities. Federal funds may be shared with nonfederal partners if deemed in the public interest. The 2018 farm bill amended HFRA to establish a Water Source Protection program on NFS lands. This allows FS to enter into partnership agreements with nonfederal partners to protect and restore NFS watersheds serving as municipal water sources. FS may develop a water source management plan with nonfederal partners, conducting forest management activities to protect water supply and restore forest health. FS is authorized to conduct a single environmental analysis for each project proposed under the plan and accept various forms of contributions for the projects. The 2018 farm bill amended HFRA to establish a Water Source Protection program on NFS lands, allowing FS to partner with nonfederal entities to protect and restore municipal water sources. FS can develop a water source management plan, conduct forest management activities, and accept various forms of contributions for projects. Congress authorized $10 million annually to the Water Source Protection Fund through FY2023, with additional provisions related to federal forest land management included in the legislation. The 2018 farm bill included provisions related to federal forest land management, such as designating NFS lands as part of the National Wilderness Preservation System. One new wilderness area was designated in Tennessee, with expansions to five existing areas on the Cherokee National Forest. These areas are to be managed in accordance with the Wilderness Act, prohibiting most commercial activities and motorized access within the designated areas. The 2018 farm bill designated new wilderness areas in Tennessee and expanded existing ones on the Cherokee National Forest, including Joyce Kilmer-Slickrock Wilderness, Little Frog Mountain, and Sampson Mountain. These areas are managed in accordance with the Wilderness Act, prohibiting commercial activities and motorized access. The bill also enacted provisions for the acquisition, exchange, and disposal of federal land by the Forest Service and BLM, including leasing isolated parcels for administrative sites and reauthorizing programs for land sales and acquisitions. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized programs for the sale or exchange of BLM and NFS lands for administrative purposes, including the Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act and the Forest Service Facility Realignment and Enhancement program. It also modified existing programs like the Small Tracts Act and contained provisions for specific land exchanges or sales. The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture are authorized to issue rights-of-way for the use of BLM and NFS lands. The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture can issue rights-of-way for the use of BLM and NFS lands, allowing various infrastructure developments. Cost-recovery fees are charged for processing and monitoring. The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture can issue rights-of-way for infrastructure developments on BLM and NFS lands, with cost-recovery fees for processing and monitoring applications. Fees are based on estimated hours for processing and monitoring, with separate schedules for linear ROWs and communication sites. The 115th Congress directed FS to update their process and fee schedule for communication sites. The 115th Congress directed the Forest Service to update their process and fee schedule for communication sites on federal lands. Concerns about wildfire ignitions within electricity transmission and distribution rights-of-way (ROWs) were raised, with some asserting that administrative processes hinder necessary maintenance activities to mitigate fire risks. Some believe weather conditions and administrative processes hinder maintenance activities in ROWs, leading to vegetation contacting power lines and increasing fire risks. The 115th Congress provisions aim to improve approval processes for vegetation management projects on federal lands, but concerns remain about balancing project implementation speed with accountability. Provisions also address wildfire suppression costs and liability for damages within ROWs, sparking concerns about their breadth and implications. Some provisions in the 115th Congress address wildfire suppression costs and liability for damages within Rights-of-Way (ROWs) on federal lands. Concerns are raised about the potential implications of these provisions, with some arguing that limiting damages and liability will prompt agency action on maintenance requests from ROW permit holders. Section 8705 of the 2018 farm bill directed the Secretary of Agriculture to revise regulations for special use authorizations for communications on National Forest System (NFS) lands. The 2018 farm bill directed the Secretary of Agriculture to issue regulations for special use authorizations for communications on National Forest System (NFS) lands. The law specified that the new process must be streamlined, uniform, and standardized, with lease terms of at least 15 years. Regulations must establish a fee structure based on processing costs, with fees deposited into a Treasury account for managing communication sites. The 2018 farm bill directed the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a fee structure for processing special use authorizations for communications on National Forest System lands. The fees would be deposited into a Treasury account for managing communication sites, including vegetation management, facility inspections, and operation and maintenance activities within electric transmission and distribution rights-of-way. The 2018 farm bill directed the Secretaries of Agriculture to propose regulations for vegetation management, facility inspections, and operation and maintenance activities within electric transmission and distribution rights-of-way. Owners can develop and submit plans for approval and conduct activities within their rights-of-way. Certain management activities can be conducted without approval in specific circumstances. FS and BLM are to identify NEPA categorical exclusions, and training programs are encouraged. The 2018 farm bill directed the Secretaries of Agriculture to propose regulations for vegetation management, facility inspections, and operation and maintenance activities within electric transmission and distribution rights-of-way. Owners can develop and submit plans for approval and conduct activities within their rights-of-way. FS and BLM are also directed to identify NEPA categorical exclusions for these activities. The law prohibits the Secretary from imposing strict liability for damages or injury greater than $500,000 resulting from activities conducted by a ROW holder under certain conditions for ten years after enactment. Within four years, FS and BLM must report the impacts of the liability clauses to Congress. The 2018 farm bill established a pilot program for utility right-of-way permit holders on National Forest System land, allowing for vegetation management plans and projects within the right-of-way. Participants must adhere to FS and state regulations for fire prevention and vegetation removal activities. Participants in the pilot program for utility right-of-way permit holders on National Forest System land can create vegetation management plans for NFS lands within their right-of-way. They must follow FS and state regulations for fire prevention and vegetation removal activities. Participants are responsible for project costs, but FS may contribute funds at the discretion of the Secretary of Agriculture. The law requires FS to submit a program status report to Congress every two years. Participants must reimburse FS for wildfire suppression costs and damage to FS resources if a wildfire is caused by their operations. The pilot program for utility right-of-way permit holders on National Forest System land requires participants to reimburse FS for wildfire suppression costs and damage caused by their operations. The program limits reimbursement costs to $500,000 in certain circumstances and differs from the FY2018 omnibus program specific to electricity ROWs. The 2018 farm bill pilot program includes electricity, natural gas, and related infrastructure, with participant responsibilities for wildfire and vegetation management but no liability cap mentioned. Counties with NFS, O&C, and CBWR lands receive payments. The 2018 farm bill pilot program for utility right-of-way permit holders on National Forest System land includes electricity, natural gas, and related infrastructure. Participants are responsible for wildfire and vegetation management, with no liability cap mentioned. Counties with NFS, O&C, and CBWR lands receive payments based on revenue generated from those lands. SRS authorized optional payment system for counties based on historic revenue payments, acreage of land, and per capita income. Payments are allocated among three categories for funding education, roads, projects on jurisdiction lands, and specified county programs. Title II of the SRS authorized payments for projects on jurisdiction lands and established Resource Advisory Committees with specific membership requirements. The payments were set at 95% of the previous year's level and were extended multiple times until FY2015. The Secure Rural Schools (SRS) program authorized payments for projects on jurisdiction lands at 95% of the previous year's level. The program was extended until FY2015, with the last authorized payment disbursed in FY2016. Counties received revenue-sharing payments when SRS payments were not authorized, but the FY2018 omnibus reauthorized SRS payments for FY2017 and FY2018. Counties received a full SRS payment for FY2017 in FY2018. The reauthorization of the Secure Rural Schools (SRS) program for FY2017 set the payment level at 95% of the last authorized payment, with counties receiving a full payment in two installments. Changes were made to payment allocation requirements and expanded uses for Title III funds. The reauthorization expired after FY2018 payments were distributed in FY2019. The 2018 farm bill made changes to the SRS statute, including modifications to RAC membership requirements and a pilot program for regional forester appointments in Montana and Arizona. The 2018 farm bill made changes to the SRS statute, including modifications to RAC membership requirements and a pilot program for regional forester appointments in Montana and Arizona. The Tribal Forest Protection Act authorized agreements with Indian tribes for forest projects on NFS and BLM lands. The Tribal Forest Protection Act allows for agreements with Indian tribes for forest projects on BLM land that require restoration or pose threats to tribal lands. The act also authorizes self-determination contracts for tribes to perform TFPA functions on NFS land, in accordance with the ISDEAA. The Tribal Forest Protection Act allows agreements with tribes for forest projects on BLM land and self-determination contracts for tribes to perform TFPA functions on NFS land. Congress may consider oversight of agencies' implementation of new laws and implications for federal forest management, including addressing concerns with forest restoration. The Forest Service has identified millions of acres of NFS lands at high risk, with a backlog of restoration treatments that could take up to 29 years to eliminate. The Forest Service has identified millions of acres of NFS lands at high risk, with a backlog of restoration treatments that could take up to 29 years to eliminate. To address these concerns, FS has proposed to increase the scale, scope, and implementation of forest management projects generally, and forest restoration treatments specifically. Administrative process barriers are identified as impeding progress towards these restoration goals. The Forest Service faces challenges in implementing forest restoration projects due to administrative barriers, including decision-making processes, funding levels, and training issues. The 115th Congress has enacted provisions to improve agency efficiencies by expediting planning and review processes for projects like hazardous fuel reduction and forest restoration. The 115th Congress aims to improve agency efficiencies by expanding procedures to expedite planning and review processes for projects like hazardous fuel reduction and forest restoration. Some stakeholders argue that these changes may impact federal forest management and citizen participation, potentially exacerbating environmental concerns. These issues have been ongoing for decades, with concerns dating back to wildfires in Yellowstone National Park in 1988. Some stakeholders argue that expanding authorities for projects like hazardous fuel reduction could worsen environmental impacts and forest health concerns. Issues regarding deteriorating forest health conditions and high fuel levels have been ongoing for decades, dating back to wildfires in Yellowstone National Park in 1988. Recommendations have been made over the years to increase hazardous fuel treatments and develop strategies to mitigate wildfire risk. The Forest Service (FS) has faced ongoing challenges with prioritizing, tracking, and reporting hazardous fuels reduction projects. Concerns about project implementation have led to appeals and objections, with a significant percentage of fuel management projects facing challenges. Academic studies have also highlighted issues with FS' National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) implementation. The Forest Service has faced challenges with hazardous fuels reduction projects, with a significant percentage facing appeals and objections. Academic studies suggest that complex projects are more likely to be challenged. Despite provisions in the HFRA to expedite projects, the need for treatment in NFS areas continues to increase. Some believe the HFRA approach has not been successful, while others suggest it needs broader application. The Forest Service has faced challenges with hazardous fuels reduction projects, with a significant percentage facing appeals and objections. Despite efforts to expedite projects, the need for treatment in NFS areas continues to increase. Some believe the current approach has not been successful, while others suggest it needs broader application. The comparison tables briefly describe forest-related provisions enacted by recent legislation."
