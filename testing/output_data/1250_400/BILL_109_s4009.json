    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Environmental Justice Enforcement Act of 2006\". The Act is necessary due to a Supreme Court decision that weakens statutory protections against discrimination established by Congress over almost 4 decades. The decision undermines these protections by denying victims the right to sue in Federal court for discrimination and questioning the validity of regulations. It also challenges the expectations set by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to prevent federal funding of discriminatory programs based on race, color, or national origin. The Sandoval decision undermines protections established by Congress in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to prevent federal funding of discriminatory programs based on race, color, or national origin. Congress and the executive branch emphasized using the regulatory process to ensure broad protections for beneficiaries of the law. Regulations drafted under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibited discrimination and retaliation in litigation or administrative resolution of discrimination charges. The regulations under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibit discrimination and retaliation in litigation or administrative resolution of discrimination charges. These regulations have never been invalidated, implying congressional intent. Title VI was designed to benefit those discriminated against and relied on private attorneys general for enforcement. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 aimed to benefit those discriminated against and relied on private attorneys general for enforcement. The Supreme Court affirmed individuals' right to a private action in Federal courts for effective protection of the law, despite Congress not explicitly stating this in the statute. Congress and the Courts have upheld this right both before and after the Cort v. Ash decision. Congress and the Courts have recognized an implied right of action under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, with Congress providing means for enforcement. The Supreme Court's denial of a right of action under regulations promulgated under title VI was unfounded, as the regulations were congressionally mandated. Regulations promulgated under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 were congressionally mandated to effectuate antidiscrimination provisions, requiring approval by the President. These regulations prohibit discriminatory practices, consistent with disparate treatment prohibitions that do not require intent to show discrimination, as recognized by the Supreme Court in various decisions. The disparate impact standard allows courts to uncover discrimination that may exist under the guise of compliance with the law. Evidence of a disproportionate burden is often the starting point in analyzing unlawful discrimination, and an invidious purpose can be inferred from the totality of relevant facts. The disparate impact method of proof is crucial for identifying stereotypes underlying intentional discrimination. The disparate impact method of proof is essential for uncovering stereotypes underlying intentional discrimination, as reinforced by the interpretation of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Congress reinstated the disparate impact standard in the Civil Rights Act of 1991 to combat discriminatory practices not justified by program goals. Congress reinstated a private right of action under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in the Civil Rights Act of 1991 to ensure individuals have a remedy if denied equal access to various programs and services. This action is necessary to prevent unfair discrimination findings and to avoid leaving the enforcement of equality solely to Federal agencies. Congress reinstated a private right of action under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in the Civil Rights Act of 1991 to ensure individuals have a remedy if denied equal access to various programs and services. This is necessary to prevent unfair discrimination and to allow individuals to challenge discriminatory practices. The Supreme Court's decision in Sandoval has led to the dismissal of many claims under title VI, highlighting the need for a private right of action. Waiving sovereign immunity will allow for the enforcement of this right. SEC. 3. PROHIBITED DISCRIMINATION. Section 601 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is amended to include provisions regarding discrimination based on disparate impact. An aggrieved person must demonstrate that a covered entity's policy or practice causes a disparate impact on the basis of race, color, or national origin, and the entity fails to show that the policy is necessary for nondiscriminatory goals. The aggrieved person must show that a policy or practice causes a disparate impact, and if a less discriminatory alternative exists, the covered entity must adopt it. The decision-making process may be analyzed as one policy if its elements cannot be separated. If a specific policy does not cause a disparate impact, the covered entity must demonstrate this. The decision-making process may be analyzed as one policy if its elements cannot be separated. If a specific policy does not cause a disparate impact, the covered entity must demonstrate this. No person in the United States shall be subjected to discrimination for opposing any prohibited policy or practice. SEC. 4. RIGHTS OF ACTION. Amends Section 602 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to allow any person aggrieved by a covered entity's failure to comply with the Act to bring a civil action in Federal or State court. SEC. 5. RIGHT OF RECOVERY. Adds a new section 602A to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for actions brought by aggrieved persons. SEC. 5. RIGHT OF RECOVERY. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is amended to allow aggrieved persons to recover legal and equitable relief, including compensatory and punitive damages, attorney's fees, and costs for intentional discrimination. For discrimination based on disparate impact, aggrieved persons may recover equitable relief, attorney's fees, and costs. SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\nThis Act and its amendments are retroactive to April 24, 2001, and apply to all actions pending on or after that date, except for actions against a State under the disparate impact standard, which have the effective date of the Act's enactment."
