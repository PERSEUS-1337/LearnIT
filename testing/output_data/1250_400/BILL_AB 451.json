    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following: Section 21107.8 of the Vehicle Code allows cities or counties to declare privately owned offstreet parking facilities open for public use, with regulations on unauthorized parking. If a city or county enacts an ordinance allowing it, the operator of a privately owned offstreet parking facility can regulate unauthorized parking. The facility must provide instructions on contesting parking fees but cannot involve the Department of Motor Vehicles in collecting unpaid fees. An ordinance or resolution can be enacted to regulate unauthorized parking in privately owned offstreet parking facilities. The facility must post notices at entrances warning of public moving vehicle laws and potential parking invoice fees. Enforcement can occur without the need for an ordinance if Section 22507.8 is invoked. Section 22507.8 can be enforced without the need for an ordinance or resolution. The department is not required to patrol or enforce provisions on privately owned offstreet parking facilities, except for those applicable to private property. Cities or counties authorizing private parking regulation must include dispute resolution procedures in their ordinance or resolution, including a written policy with specified time periods and an administrative hearing process. The dispute resolution policy must include specified time periods for notifications, review, and appeal. The administrative hearing process should offer options for in-person or mail hearings, administrative review, and a hearing by a trained third-party examiner. The examiner must provide an independent, fair, and impartial review, with the decision delivered in person or by mail. Payment in installments is allowed for those unable to pay in full. Incentives based on the number of invoices or disputed charges are prohibited, and there is a cap on parking invoice fees. The curr_chunk discusses regulations for private parking regulators, including prohibiting incentives based on the number of invoices or disputed charges, capping parking invoice fees, and preventing them from posing as government agencies."
