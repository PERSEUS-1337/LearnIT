    "content": "The level of pay for congressional staff is determined by Senate committees, with job titles, pay rates, and resources set by the chair and ranking Member. There is interest in congressional pay data for various reasons, but publicly available sources do not provide aggregated data. The data in this report is based on official Senate reports published semiannually and collected by LegiStorm. The report is based on official Senate reports and provides pay data for 13 staff position titles in Senate committees since FY2001. Position titles were identified through a two-step process, with data collected semiannually by LegiStorm. Titles for 13 staff positions in Senate committees were identified through a two-step process, with pay data collected for these positions. The data collected may differ from an employee's stated annual salary. Staff in Senate committees had to hold the same job title for the entire fiscal year and not receive pay from any other congressional authority to be included in the data. Payments recorded in LegiStorm data for staff are tabulated, including overtime and bonuses. Pay data for House committee staff can be found in CRS Report R44322, while data for Senate and House member offices are in CRS Reports R44324 and R44323. The data presented may have challenges that could impact findings or interpretation. The data presented for Senate committee staff pay levels from FY2001-FY2014 and House member offices from 2001-2014 may not fully represent all positions due to the way staff titles are assigned. Two categories of positions emerge: those usually held by one staff member per committee and those that may have two or more staff members. Pay information for the former is likely representative, while data for the latter is a sample. The pay data for Senate committee staff positions may not fully represent all positions due to the way staff titles are assigned. Two categories of positions emerge: those usually held by one staff member per committee and those that may have two or more staff members. Pay data provide no insight into education, work experience, or other factors affecting compensation levels. Differences in job duties among similarly titled staff could impact pay levels due to congressional employing authorities' discretion in setting terms of employment. The Senate Handbook acknowledges that staff with the same job title may have vastly different duties, leading to potential differences in pay levels. Tables in this section provide data on Senate pay practices, maximum payable rates for committee staff, and cumulative percentage changes in median pay for various positions. Constant dollar calculations are based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers. The report is based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) for different years, expressed in constant 2016 dollars. Tables provide cumulative percentage changes in median pay for various positions, including Members of Congress and federal civilian workers. Graphic displays show pay changes over time in nominal and constant 2016 dollars, comparisons at different intervals, and distributions of pay in $10,000 increments. Between FY2011 and FY2015, median pay for various staff positions in Washington, DC saw changes ranging from a 16.93% increase for professional staff members to a -16.48% decrease for staff assistants. Comparatively, Members of Congress experienced a -5.10% pay change and General Schedule workers in DC saw a -3.19% change during the same period. Additionally, between FY2006 and FY2015, median pay changes ranged from a 22.01% increase for senior counsels to a -26.72% decrease for staff assistants, with four positions seeing pay increases and four seeing declines. This contrasts with a -10.41% pay change for Members of Congress and a -0.13% change for General Schedule workers in DC over the same period.
