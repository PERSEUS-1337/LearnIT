Lower-income countries may struggle to implement environmentally protective measures due to financial constraints, leading to the need for international financial assistance. The UNFCCC was the first treaty to address human-driven climate change. International financial assistance is a key method for governments to support global environmental actions in lower-income countries. The UNFCCC, ratified by the United States in 1992, requires higher-income Parties to provide new and additional financial resources to developing countries for meeting their obligations. The United States has provided financial and technical assistance for climate change over the past few decades. The United States has delivered financial and technical assistance for climate change activities in developing countries through bilateral and multilateral programs, including contributions to international environmental funds like the Global Environment Facility and the Green Climate Fund. The United States provides financial and technical assistance for climate change activities through contributions to international environmental funds like the Global Environment Facility and the Green Climate Fund. The GEF, established in 1991, is an official operating entity of the financial mechanism of several international environmental agreements, including the UNFCCC. The relationship between the UNFCCC and the GEF is outlined in a memorandum of understanding. The George H. W. Bush Administration supported the establishment of the GEF in 1991. The United States has made significant financial commitments to the Global Environment Facility (GEF), totaling $2.732 billion since 1991. This represents about 13% of GEF's total funding. Additionally, the GEF is an official operating entity of the financial mechanism of several international environmental agreements, including the UNFCCC. The relationship between the UNFCCC and the GEF is outlined in a memorandum of understanding. In Copenhagen, UNFCCC noted the Copenhagen Accord, leading to the adoption of elements in the Cancun Agreements the following year. This included financial commitments like Fast start financing and a pledge to mobilize $100 billion annually by 2020 for climate finance in developing countries. The Paris Agreement in 2015 further built upon these commitments. The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, builds upon previous commitments to combat climate change. It emphasizes financial support from developed countries to assist developing countries with mitigation and adaptation efforts. The agreement encourages all parties to provide voluntary financial support, regardless of economic standing, and states that resources may come from various sources. Developed countries are urged to take the lead in mobilizing climate finance, representing a progression beyond previous efforts. The Paris Agreement emphasizes financial support from developed countries to assist developing countries with mitigation and adaptation efforts. Developed countries are urged to take the lead in mobilizing climate finance, with a collective pledge of $100 billion annually by 2020. President Donald Trump announced his intention to withdraw from the agreement in 2017, with the process to be completed by November 4, 2020. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) was designated as an operating entity of the financial mechanism of the UNFCCC. President Donald Trump announced his intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, with the process to be completed by November 4, 2020. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) was designated as an operating entity of the financial mechanism of the UNFCCC, with the purpose of assisting developing countries in combating climate change through grants and concessional financing. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) was established to help developing countries combat climate change through grants and concessional financing. It is funded by developed countries and other sources, with approximately $10.3 billion pledged for its initial capitalization. The U.S. pledged $3 billion over four years, with contributions made in 2016 and 2017 from the Economic Support Fund. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget proposes to eliminate U.S. funding for the Green Climate Fund (GCF) in alignment with President Trump's promise to cease payments to the United Nations' climate change programs. Despite this, the U.S. disbursed $1 billion to the GCF under the Obama Administration, ensuring U.S. membership on the GCF board during the initial capitalization phase. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget proposes to eliminate U.S. funding for the Green Climate Fund (GCF). The U.S. disbursed $1 billion to the GCF under the Obama Administration, ensuring U.S. membership on the GCF board during the initial capitalization phase. The future U.S. engagement with the GCF is under review as part of developing a policy on climate change. The GCF is one of many possible public funding sources for climate finance commitments. The goal of mobilizing $100 billion per year by 2020 is not directly tied to the Green Climate Fund (GCF) or public funding. The GCF is just one of many possible sources for climate finance, including public, private, bilateral, and multilateral sources. Development bank instruments, carbon markets, and private capital are seen as critical for reaching the funding goal. The GCF would not interfere with bilateral climate change assistance and would complement existing multilateral mechanisms like the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the World Bank's Climate Investment Funds. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) would not interfere with bilateral climate change assistance and would complement existing multilateral mechanisms. The GCF is another multilateral mechanism for climate change assistance alongside bilateral activities. The GCF board is tasked with determining complementarity with other U.N. multilateral mechanisms. Donor countries will still have choices in allocating funds among multilateral assistance channels. Donor Parties to the GCF, their pledges, and disbursements are listed in Table 1 as of June 2, 2017. Top donor countries are presented in Figure 1 based on pledges per capita. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) channels funding based on congressional guidance and authorized appropriations. Donor Parties, pledges, and disbursements are listed in Table 1 as of June 2, 2017. Withdrawal from the PA may have positive and negative implications for the U.S., including fiscal savings from climate finance. Critics question the effectiveness of international financial assistance in developing countries. Some critics question the effectiveness of international financial assistance in developing countries, citing bureaucratic inefficiencies, lack of transparency, and misuse of funds. Reductions in financial assistance could benefit other priorities, such as sustaining markets for GHG-intensive fuels and technologies. U.S. withdrawal from commitments under the PA could redefine international relations, highlighting issues of sovereignty and national interest. Stakeholders argue that U.S. withdrawal from commitments under the PA could redefine international relations, emphasizing sovereignty, national interest, and control over domestic systems. Potential repercussions include higher costs for future climate-related disasters, economic inefficiencies, and impacts on humanitarian and security interests. The provision of climate finance, particularly adaptation assistance, is seen as crucial for addressing global challenges like poverty, social tensions, and environmental degradation. The provision of climate finance, including adaptation assistance, may support humanitarian and security interests of the United States by addressing global challenges and benefiting U.S. businesses. Reductions in international financial assistance could increase vulnerability in lower-income countries and limit U.S. influence on international policies and standards. The Trump Administration's withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and cessation of U.S. payments to UN climate change programs may impact U.S. global environmental leadership and influence on international economic and environmental policies. Despite being released from specific obligations under the Paris Agreement, the U.S. still has commitments under the UNFCCC to provide financial resources to developing countries. The Administration's intentions regarding these prior obligations remain unclear. The Trump Administration's withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and cessation of U.S. payments to UN climate change programs may impact U.S. global environmental leadership and influence on international economic and environmental policies. The Administration has not made a statement regarding its intentions under prior obligations to provide financial resources to developing countries. The decision could erode international efforts to help developing countries confront climate change, with U.S. contributions determined by Congress. U.S. contributions to developing countries for climate change activities are determined by Congress, which authorizes programs, appropriations, and provides guidance to agencies. Congressional committees overseeing international climate change assistance include House Committees on Foreign Affairs, Financial Services, and Appropriations, and Senate Committees on Foreign Relations and Appropriations."
