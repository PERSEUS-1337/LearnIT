    "content": "In 1976, President Gerald Ford signed the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) into law, authorizing the EPA to regulate toxic chemicals in U.S. commerce to prevent harm to human health or the environment. EPA evaluates risks throughout the chemical life-cycle and has various regulatory options. Congress has added titles and amended TSCA, but the core program remains unchanged. Bills have been introduced since 2005 to revise the chemical evaluation process, but none have been enacted due to legislative debate. Since the enactment of TSCA in 1976, there have been ongoing debates on amending the chemical evaluation process and regulatory criteria. Proponents argue that the current framework is not sufficiently protective, as only a few chemicals have been evaluated and regulated. States have enacted their own statutes to address chemical concerns, leading to potential inconsistencies in regulation. EPA's evaluation of risks is limited by available resources. The EPA's evaluation of risks for chemicals is dependent on available resources. States have enacted statutes to address chemical concerns not covered by TSCA, leading to potential inconsistencies in regulation. Manufacturers argue that compliance with different state regulations for the same chemical is inefficient. Non-governmental programs like voluntary labeling have emerged as alternative regulatory approaches. This report tracks legislative efforts in the 114th Congress to amend TSCA. In the 114th Congress, bills were introduced to amend Title I of TSCA, including the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act (S. 697) and the Alan Reinstein and Trevor Schaefer Toxic Chemical Protection Act (S. 725). Senate EPW held hearings and marked up amendments for S. 697, which was ordered for Senate floor consideration. The Alan Reinstein and Trevor Schaefer Toxic Chemical Protection Act (S. 725) was introduced and referred to Senate EPW. Senate EPW held hearings and marked up an amendment for S. 697, which was ordered for Senate floor consideration. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce introduced the TSCA Modernization Act of 2015 as a more targeted approach to amending Title I of TSCA. H.R. 2576, also known as the TSCA Modernization Act of 2015, was introduced in May 2015. The subcommittee held a hearing on the House discussion draft, which was later ordered for full committee consideration. H.R. 2576, the TSCA Modernization Act of 2015, was introduced and approved by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. The bill passed in the House with amendments under suspension of the rules. Key debated issues include prioritizing chemical substances for risk evaluation and EPA's regulatory authority. The debate surrounding the regulation of chemical substances under Title I of TSCA includes key issues such as prioritizing chemicals for risk evaluation, criteria for restricting substances, regulatory options for EPA, requiring new information development, preemption of state laws, disclosure of information, and EPA resources. A comparison of approaches in S. 697, S. 725, and H.R. 2576 addresses these issues. EPA's discretion in evaluating chemical risks and the need for criteria selection due to limited resources are ongoing concerns under the current TSCA. Under the current TSCA, EPA has discretion in selecting chemicals for risk evaluation. Over 83,000 chemical substances are potentially subject to evaluation, with 1,200 substances identified for prioritization in 2012. 90 substances were further prioritized for risk evaluation based on hazard, exposure, and bioaccumulation potential. In 2012, EPA identified 1,200 substances for evaluation based on prioritization criteria, leading to 90 substances prioritized for risk evaluation. EPA has assessed five of these chemicals, with three found to present risks. The agency has received over 36,000 PMNs and 13,000 PMN exemption applications from July 1979 to September 2010. S. 697 and S. 725 would direct EPA to prioritize existing chemical substances for risk evaluation, while H.R. 2576 would direct the agency to evaluate chemicals based on different criteria. The EPA has received over 36,000 PMNs and 13,000 PMN exemption applications from July 1979 to September 2010. S. 697 and S. 725 aim to prioritize existing chemical substances for risk evaluation, while H.R. 2576 would evaluate chemicals based on specific criteria. The bills differ in factors and criteria used for prioritization, with all three addressing the prioritization of substances for risk-based safety evaluations and regulatory actions. The bills S. 697 and H.R. 2576 aim to prioritize chemical substances for risk evaluation and regulatory action. Manufacturers can request EPA to prioritize substances for evaluation by paying a fee. S. 697 and S. 725 establish varying deadlines for evaluating substances and taking regulatory actions. EPA would have discretion to grant limited requests under S. 697, while H.R. 2576 requires evaluation for substances where manufacturers have paid evaluation costs. The bills S. 697 and S. 725 establish deadlines for evaluating chemical substances and taking regulatory actions. EPA would prioritize substances as high or low priority, with S. 697 requiring at least 25 chemicals to be designated as high priority within five years. Safety assessments must be completed within three years, with a rule promulgated within two years after a negative safety determination. H.R. 2576 has differing conditions for prioritization and assessment. The bills S. 697 and S. 725 establish deadlines for evaluating chemical substances and taking regulatory actions. S. 725 proposes prioritization and safety assessment procedures comparable to S. 697, with tighter deadlines on EPA. H.R. 2576 requires risk evaluations to be published within three years after a manufacturer's request or EPA finding of potential risk, with at least 10 risk evaluations initiated per year. S. 697 and S. 725 would amend TSCA Section 5 for new chemical substances, while H.R. 2576 would not amend this section. The Senate bills S. 697 and S. 725 propose deadlines for EPA to evaluate new chemical substances and determine regulatory actions. EPA would need to review notices and information submitted by manufacturers within 90 days to decide if regulatory action is necessary. Once a new chemical is added to the TSCA Inventory, it would undergo similar safety assessment procedures as existing chemicals. The current TSCA establishes a standard for regulating chemical substances based on the unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the environment. There is debate on amending the regulatory threshold to clarify criteria for determining risks. The existing regulatory threshold for restricting a chemical substance in TSCA, based on unreasonable risk, is difficult for EPA to prove and subject to interpretation. The debate revolves around amending the threshold to clarify criteria for determining regulatory control. The \"unreasonable risk\" standard in TSCA is not defined in statute but interpreted as a multi-factor balancing test by the courts. The Fifth Circuit ruled that EPA's asbestos ban did not consider costs adequately under the \"unreasonable risk\" standard in TSCA. The standard requires a balance of costs and benefits in determining regulatory control for chemical substances. S. 697 aims to establish a clear definition for \"safety standard\" based on the threshold of \"unreasonable risk of injury.\" S. 697 and S. 725 aim to establish a clear definition for \"safety standard\" based on the threshold of \"unreasonable risk of injury.\" S. 697 includes qualifiers such as evaluating risks for potentially exposed populations and prohibits the consideration of costs in risk evaluation. S. 697 and S. 725 define a \"safety standard\" for evaluating chemical risks without considering cost factors. In contrast, H.R. 2576 does not define a safety standard but adds requirements for EPA's risk evaluation process. H.R. 2576 adds requirements for EPA's risk evaluation process to determine risks, including assessing risks to potentially exposed populations and prohibiting the consideration of costs or non-risk factors. This contrasts with S. 697 and S. 725, which define a safety standard for evaluating chemical risks without considering cost factors. The EPA is directed by Section 6 of TSCA to promulgate regulations to protect against unreasonable risks posed by chemical substances, using the least burdensome requirement. This can range from a complete ban to notifying distributors of risks. The \"least burdensome\" requirement has been challenged in court, such as in Corrosion Proof Fittings v. EPA, where the Fifth Circuit found that EPA had not provided enough evidence to support a total ban on asbestos as the least burdensome alternative. In Corrosion Proof Fittings v. EPA, the Fifth Circuit ruled that EPA must show that each less burdensome requirement would not adequately protect against unreasonable risk to reject it in favor of a more burdensome one. S. 697, S. 725, and H.R. 2576 aim to eliminate the least burdensome regulatory option for restricting chemical substances, with S. 697 and S. 725 directing EPA to choose a regulatory option necessary for safety standards, considering costs and alternatives, while H.R. 2576 requires EPA to promulgate a rule that adequately protects against risks. The bills S. 697, S. 725, and H.R. 2576 aim to direct the EPA to choose a regulatory option necessary for safety standards when restricting chemical substances. H.R. 2576 specifically requires rules to adequately protect against risks, with consideration of cost-effectiveness, except in cases where it is not feasible. All three bills include provisions for EPA to exempt certain uses of chemical substances under specific circumstances. EPA may exempt certain chemical substance uses from restrictions if they pose a threat to national security, the economy, or critical infrastructure. H.R. 2576 allows for \"critical use exemptions\" for specific uses if deemed necessary and cost-effective. Exemptions are initially valid for five years and can be renewed if requirements are still met. EPA bases decisions on scientific and technical data. The EPA can grant critical use exemptions under H.R. 2576 for specific chemical uses to reduce risks, valid for up to five years and renewable if requirements are met. The agency relies on scientific data to evaluate risks and may require testing if risks are unknown. EPA can mandate manufacturers to conduct testing if the chemical substance may present unreasonable risks or if substantial quantities are produced. The EPA can require manufacturers to conduct testing if a chemical substance may pose unreasonable risks or if substantial quantities are produced that may enter the environment or lead to significant human exposures. EPA has mandated testing for over 200 chemical substances, but limitations under TSCA have hindered its ability to assess chemical risks. EPA often relies on production volume and exposure likelihood to determine testing requirements. The EPA can require manufacturers to conduct testing if a chemical substance may pose unreasonable risks or if substantial quantities are produced that may enter the environment or lead to significant human exposures. EPA has mandated testing for over 200 chemical substances, but limitations under TSCA have hindered its ability to assess chemical risks. The development of new information to determine risk can be time-consuming and costly for those required to provide it. Senate bills S. 697 and S. 725 would give EPA discretion to require testing if deemed necessary, while H.R. 2576 would still require specific findings for testing under TSCA Section 4. All three bills would authorize EPA to require new information through rulemaking, orders, or testing consent agreements. The EPA can require testing under TSCA Section 4 or for risk evaluation under Section 6. Senate bills aim to minimize animal testing and amend procedures for new information development. TSCA preemption is a long-standing issue, giving EPA a primary role in chemical management while allowing states some authority. Congress's enumerated powers can preempt conflicting state laws and policies. TSCA preemption gives EPA a primary role in managing chemicals but allows states some authority under certain circumstances. States are generally preempted from managing chemical risks if EPA has taken similar action, with exceptions for identical federal requirements and other specific cases. States can regulate disposal, enforce federal requirements, and prohibit chemical use within the state. In the context of TSCA preemption, states can co-enforce federal requirements, regulate disposal, establish chemical requirements, and prohibit chemical use within the state. Advocates of federal preemption argue for a uniform national regulatory framework to avoid conflicting regulations and reduce compliance costs. Opponents believe states should have the flexibility to implement more stringent regulations to protect their citizens. S. 697 proposes changes to TSCA. S. 697 proposes changes to TSCA preemption and the state-federal relationship in chemical management. It would restrict states from imposing new restrictions on chemicals already deemed safe by EPA. S. 697 would limit states from imposing new restrictions on chemicals deemed safe by EPA, with preemption beginning upon EPA's safety assessment. Preemption exceptions would be retained, except for states prohibiting chemical use. S. 697 would lift preemption until the EPA rule restricting the chemical substance takes effect. It would retain preemption exceptions, except for states prohibiting chemical use. New provisions would prohibit states from imposing duplicative or more stringent penalties. Certain state actions before August 1, 2015, and past or future state actions under laws in effect as of August 31, 2003, would not be subject to preemption. Savings clauses would clarify that common law or statutory causes of action would not be affected. States could apply for waivers based on concerns about a chemical. S. 697 would lift preemption until the EPA rule restricting the chemical substance takes effect, with exceptions for states prohibiting chemical use. States could apply for waivers based on concerns about a chemical, and savings clauses would clarify that common law or statutory causes of action would not be affected. S. 725 would eliminate TSCA's preemption provisions, allowing states to impose and enforce different regulations for chemicals. H.R. 2576 would make smaller changes to TSCA preemption, allowing states to impose requirements on chemicals if EPA had taken no action. H.R. 2576 would make smaller changes to TSCA preemption, allowing states to impose requirements on chemicals if EPA had taken no action. It would provide for preemption of state laws if EPA determined a chemical not to present an unreasonable risk, align preemption with the risk evaluation process, and not exempt state prohibitions on chemical use from preemption. H.R. 2576 aligns preemption with the risk evaluation process under amended Section 6, removing exceptions for state prohibitions on chemical use. It also addresses enforcement of state requirements identical to EPA's, exempts certain past actions from preemption, and includes savings clauses for common law causes of action. TSCA requires chemical information submission to EPA, raising concerns about balancing public access with chemical data. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) requires chemical manufacturers to submit detailed information to EPA, including chemical structures and safety data. Balancing public access to this information with protecting trade secrets is a key concern in amending TSCA. Section 14 of TSCA prohibits disclosure of certain information as trade secrets, with exceptions. Wrongful disclosure is a criminal act, and confidential business information (CBI) protection does not cover health and safety studies but does protect manufacturing processes and proprietary compositions. EPA has protected many items of information, including chemical identities, as CBI. EPA protects confidential business information (CBI) under TSCA, including chemical identities. Disclosure of CBI is required if necessary to protect health or the environment. Submitters only need to designate information as CBI for protection, without substantiation or EPA review. The EPA protects confidential business information (CBI) under TSCA by allowing submitters to designate information as CBI for protection without substantiation or EPA review. Since 2010, the EPA has increased its review of confidentiality claims, including chemical identities in health and safety studies. The agency has also initiated a \"CBI Declassification Challenge\" to encourage industry to voluntarily withdraw CBI claims and increase public access to non-confidential information. The three proposed bills would retain the current TSCA framework for protecting information falling within the FOIA trade secrets exemption but would also require or authorize EPA to disclose CBI in additional circumstances. The three proposed bills aim to increase public access to non-confidential information by requiring or authorizing the EPA to disclose confidential business information (CBI) in additional circumstances. The Senate bills would make more extensive revisions to TSCA Section 14 than H.R. 2576, with detailed procedural requirements for information submitters and more review requirements for EPA. Certain categories of information would be presumed protected from disclosure, while information on chemicals subject to a ban or phase-out rule would be presumed not protected. The proposed bills aim to increase public access to non-confidential information by requiring or authorizing the EPA to disclose confidential business information. Specific categories of information would be protected from disclosure, while information on chemicals subject to a ban or phase-out rule would not be protected. The bills also require submitters to substantiate their confidentiality claims and establish dedicated sources of funding for EPA activities under TSCA. The EPA's evaluation of chemical risks under Title I of TSCA depends on available resources. Congress faces a decision on funding EPA's TSCA activities through discretionary appropriations or dedicated funding sources. Funding for Title I was authorized through FY1983, with ongoing funding through annual appropriations. EPA can also assess fees on chemical manufacturers, importers, or processors, with a maximum fee of $2,500 for certain actions under Section 5 of TSCA. EPA's authority to collect fees under TSCA is limited to a maximum of $2,500 for specific actions required by the statute. Small businesses have a fee limit of $100. Fees collected are treated as miscellaneous receipts and deposited into the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury. The availability of these fees for EPA's use is subject to annual appropriations. S. 697 and S. 725 would repeal the expired authorization for these fees. Fees collected under Section 26(b) of TSCA are treated as miscellaneous receipts and deposited into the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury. The availability of these fees for EPA's use is subject to annual appropriations. S. 697, S. 725, and H.R. 2576 address the authority to collect fees under TSCA, with S. 697 proposing to set fees for submissions to EPA and capping the total amount collected at $18 million. S. 697 and H.R. 2576 propose setting fees for submissions to EPA to partially cover costs, with a cap of $18 million. H.R. 2576 also authorizes EPA to collect fees from manufacturers for risk evaluations of chemical substances without a set limit on the amount collected. The bills H.R. 2576, S. 697, and S. 725 propose authorizing the EPA to collect fees from manufacturers for risk evaluations of chemical substances, with no set limit on the amount collected. The fees would be sufficient to cover certain costs in administering the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), with receipts deposited into a dedicated fund or the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury. S. 725 does not establish a dedicated account for fee deposits under the current TSCA. Fees collected would be deposited into the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury. Cost estimates for S. 697 and H.R. 2576 have been published by the Congressional Budget Office."
