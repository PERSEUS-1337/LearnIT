    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 254.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to require claims for welfare and veterans' organization exemptions to be filed by February 15 each year with the assessor. The assessor must review the claims to ensure they meet specific requirements, including assessing any capital investments for expansion. The assessor may audit the operations of the property owner to verify eligibility for welfare exemption. If property is found ineligible, the assessor must notify the claimant and they can seek a refund of property taxes paid. If the assessor determines that the property is ineligible for the exemption, the claimant will be notified in writing. They can then seek a refund of property taxes paid by filing a refund claim with the county, and if denied, they may file a refund action in superior court. If the property is deemed ineligible for the exemption, the claimant can request a refund of property taxes by filing a claim with the county. If the county denies the refund claim, the claimant has the option to file a refund action in superior court. Additionally, an applicant granted a welfare exemption does not need to reapply in subsequent years if there are no changes to the exempted property and it is used exclusively by a governmental entity or nonprofit corporation. The applicant must notify the assessor by February 15 if they become ineligible for the exemption or if the property no longer meets the requirements. The assessor must annually send a notice to applicants exempt from filing an annual application, outlining circumstances that may make the property ineligible for exemption. The notice also informs applicants how to maintain eligibility for the welfare exemption and advises them to inform the assessor if the property is no longer eligible. Failure to reaffirm eligibility may prompt the assessor to verify exempt activity. The assessor must redetermine eligibility for welfare or veterans' organization exemptions if incorrectly granted. If property is no longer eligible, the exemption will be canceled. Incorrectly allowed exemptions will result in an escape assessment with interest and a penalty. The board will review the assessor's administration of exemptions to ensure proper implementation. The board reviews the assessor's administration of welfare and veterans' organization exemptions to ensure proper implementation. Counties can request a review, equalization, or adjustment of property assessments by the board by applying in writing before November 30 or within 60 days of receiving a tax bill for assessments made outside the regular period. Every application for board action must be filed with the assessor, and a timely application entitles the applicant to a hearing. Failure to file on time will result in the applicant being barred from relief under specific sections of the Revenue and Taxation Code. Section 4674 of the Revenue and Taxation Code states that any excess proceeds from a delinquent tax sale trust fund, after satisfying certain distributions, can be claimed by parties of interest in the property. If not claimed within a specified period, the excess proceeds may be transferred to the county general fund, with certain costs deducted by the county."
