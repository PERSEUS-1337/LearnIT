    "content": "The federal K-12 education legislation, starting from the Improving America's Schools Act in 1994 to the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, has focused on granting flexibility to grantees. This flexibility allows for waivers of federal program requirements for state and local recipients meeting certain criteria. The report provides an overview of these authorizations and will be updated as needed to incorporate new developments. The report discusses the flexibility granted to state and local aid recipients under federal K-12 education legislation, allowing waivers of program requirements for meeting eligibility criteria. This flexibility includes consolidating programs, transferring funds, and waiving specific requirements under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is not included in this discussion due to its unique requirements and lack of flexibility authorities. The report focuses on federal aid to K-12 education, specifically the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) programs. It excludes the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) due to its unique requirements and lack of flexibility authorities. The report discusses the general nature of federal K-12 education program requirements, special flexibility authorities, and potential amendments to the ESEA by the 110th Congress. The report discusses the general types of program requirements applicable to ESEA and related federal K-12 programs, including accountability requirements that can be waived under special flexibility authorities. It analyzes issues specific to authorities adopted before and after the NCLB, concluding with cross-cutting issues regarding these special flexibility authorities overall. Federal K-12 education programs have accountability requirements to ensure funds are used appropriately. These programs focus on student populations with special needs, specific instructional services, innovative approaches, and subject areas like math or science. The flexibility in these programs allows for various instructional methods and grade levels to be served. Federal K-12 education programs encompass various instructional services, innovative approaches, and subject areas like math or science. These programs are categorized into different areas such as educational technology, teacher recruitment, charter schools, and comprehensive school reform. Most programs are considered \"categorical\" due to their targeted focus, while the Innovative Programs authority under ESEA Title V-A is seen as a \"block grant\" for its broad support. Federal requirements and non-regulatory policy guidance are provided to state and local recipients of federal aid. At the other end of the intergovernmental assistance spectrum, federal requirements or related guidance are provided to state and local recipients of federal aid. \"Requirements\" must be met by grantees as a matter of law, derived ultimately from the authorizing statute for a program. Program regulations supplement statutory language primarily on complex issues where specific actions are prioritized by the U.S. Department of Education. An example is ESEA Title I-A requirements on curriculum content and pupil performance standards. The U.S. Department of Education prioritizes specific actions for grantees in complex issues where statutory guidance is lacking. Regulations are issued for certain issues, while non-regulatory policy guidance is also provided through questions and answers or \"Dear Colleague\" letters. Grantees are not legally bound to follow this guidance, which aims to address specific questions on fund usage and pupil selection. The U.S. Department of Education provides non-regulatory policy guidance through letters to address specific questions on fund usage and pupil selection. Grantees are not legally required to follow this guidance, but may perceive it as equivalent to regulations, leading to potential challenges in the use of federal aid. Additionally, competitive priorities are established for grant programs to give preferential consideration to certain applications. The U.S. Department of Education sets priorities for grant programs to give preferential consideration to certain applications, although compliance is not mandatory. These priorities are not regulations but are outlined in the grant competition announcements. There has been a trend towards less voluminous regulations for federal education programs, with some programs having no regulations at all. Guidance in the statute is deemed sufficient in these cases. The U.S. Department of Education has been moving towards less voluminous regulations for federal education programs, with some programs having no regulations at all. For programs with regulations, they are generally briefer and address fewer issues than in the past. Guidance in the statute is considered sufficient in these cases. The U.S. Department of Education has been reducing regulations for federal education programs, focusing on providing guidance rather than extensive regulations. This approach includes addressing specific legal and policy issues under Title I programs to inform schools, parents, and other stakeholders about the flexibility available under the statute. Federal K-12 education assistance programs require SEAs, LEAs, and aid grantees to meet various activities, services, and outcomes to demonstrate accountability for federal grant funds. This includes target accountability, outcome accountability, and fiscal accountability to ensure funds are used appropriately for promoting equal educational opportunities, improving student achievement, and maintaining financial integrity. The federal K-12 education assistance programs require accountability in three key areas: target accountability, outcome accountability, and fiscal accountability. This ensures that funds are used effectively to promote equal educational opportunities, improve student achievement, and maintain financial integrity. Specific requirements include targeting resources to high-need pupil groups, limiting fund uses to high priority services, and ensuring federal funds supplement rather than replace state or local resources. The federal K-12 education assistance programs have specific requirements to ensure accountability, including targeting resources to high-need pupil groups, limiting fund uses to high priority services, enhancing parental participation, implementing minimum qualifications for school staff, and evaluating the effectiveness of federally supported instructional services. Grantees that violate these regulations may have to repay funds or face sanctions. Additionally, general requirements apply to all recipients of federal education assistance. Specific sanctions may be imposed on states or LEAs that do not meet program requirements. General requirements, including financial management rules, civil rights, and privacy regulations, apply to all recipients of federal education assistance. LEAs participating in federal child nutrition programs must adhere to specific requirements, such as providing free or reduced-price school lunches. Other federal regulations, not limited to the Department of Education, may also apply to LEAs and schools. Federal regulations from agencies other than ED may apply to LEAs and schools as employers. State and local educational agencies have flexibility in using federal education assistance, with matters like grade levels and instructional techniques left to their discretion. Complaints about specific program requirements often focus on prohibitions against mixing funds from different federal programs. Complaints about ESEA and related program-specific requirements often target prohibitions on fund commingling, restrictions on resource use, targeting aid on specific pupils or schools, eligibility thresholds for flexibility, and outcome accountability under NCLB. These requirements aim to establish fiscal accountability, focus resources on those in need, and ensure aid reaches the most vulnerable. Prohibitions against fund commingling, restrictions on resource use, targeting aid on specific pupils or schools, eligibility thresholds for flexibility, and outcome accountability under NCLB aim to establish fiscal accountability and focus resources on those in need. These requirements may seem inflexible from a state or local perspective, especially for smaller LEAs receiving grants under various federal programs. The traditional federal categorical approach in education has been criticized for potentially leading to fragmented instruction and focusing more on targeting resources rather than improving overall effectiveness. This approach may result in challenges such as inefficient resource use, fragmented services for children, and instruction in separate settings that may not be the most effective. The traditional federal categorical approach in education has been criticized for leading to fragmented instruction and focusing more on targeting resources rather than improving overall effectiveness. Challenges may arise from implementing federal programs in states with varying policies and demographic conditions, as well as misunderstandings of federal statutes and regulations. State and local education officials sometimes complain about constraints on the use of federal aid. State and local education officials often face challenges in complying with federal requirements for K-12 education assistance, as highlighted in a 1998 Government Accountability Office report. They struggle to access accurate information and adequate technical assistance, leading to limitations in flexibility when using federal funds. The 1998 Government Accountability Office report found that state and local education officials struggle to access accurate information and technical assistance for federal K-12 education requirements. This leads to limitations in flexibility when using federal funds, as officials are often unaware of available options. Additionally, concerns were raised about the costs of meeting administrative responsibilities and the challenges associated with meeting required timelines. Various authorities allow waivers for certain federal K-12 program requirements, but these waivers are limited in scope. Prior to the NCLB, authorities allowed waivers for federal K-12 program requirements by SEAs and LEAs, with limitations on types of requirements, affected programs, and eligibility. Waivers could be requested case-by-case or granted as \"blanket\" authority, with varying levels of accountability for pupil outcomes. Different waiver types included Ed-Flex, Secretarial case-by-case waivers, schoolwide program authority under ESEA Title I-A, Innovative Programs block grant, and flexibility for small, rural LEAs. These flexibility options were established before the NCLB of 2001. Before the NCLB, waivers for federal K-12 program requirements were allowed by SEAs and LEAs with limitations. Different waiver types included Ed-Flex, Secretarial case-by-case waivers, schoolwide program authority under ESEA Title I-A, Innovative Programs block grant, and flexibility for small, rural LEAs. Ed-Flex authority allows SEAs to waive requirements under selected ESEA programs for LEAs or schools in participating states. Initially authorized in 1994, Ed-Flex was expanded in 1996 and modified in 1999 to remove the cap on participating states. Ed-Flex authority, initially authorized in 1994, was expanded to 12 states in 1996 and modified in 1999 to remove the cap on participating states. The authority was extended in 2006 until the next reauthorization of ESEA Title I, Part A. Currently, no state has been granted Ed-Flex authority since January 2002, and the authority to grant it to additional states expired in FY2004. Ed-Flex authority is granted for up to five years, and recent congressional action addressed the expiration for the 10 Ed-Flex states by January 2007. Since January 2002, Ed-Flex authority has not been granted to any state. The recent congressional action (P.L. 109-211) addressed the expiration of authority for the 10 Ed-Flex states by January 2007. States with Ed-Flex authority as of September 30, 2004 retain that authority until reauthorization of ESEA Title I, Part A. States must waive state and federal requirements for LEAs and schools, meet curriculum and performance standards under ESEA Title I-A, monitor performance, and submit annual reports to ED. No extension of Ed-Flex authority beyond the 10 states is provided under P.L. 109-211. States with Ed-Flex authority must waive state and federal requirements for LEAs and schools, meet curriculum and performance standards under ESEA Title I-A, monitor performance, and submit annual reports to ED for federal programs such as Education for the Disadvantaged, Teacher and Principal Training Fund, and Safe and Drug-Free Schools. The Ed-Flex authority allows states to waive certain requirements for federal education programs like Title III-A, IV-A-1, V-A, and the Perkins Act. These waivers must still meet fiscal accountability and equitable participation standards set by the Secretary of Education. The Ed-Flex authority allows states to waive certain requirements for federal education programs, such as fiscal accountability, equitable participation, parental involvement, allocation of funds, school selection, and civil rights requirements. LEAs or schools requesting waivers must apply to their SEA, providing necessary information. SEAs cannot waive requirements applicable to themselves, and must ensure that the underlying purposes of the statutory requirements are still met. Local waivers may be terminated if student performance is inadequate. The Ed-Flex authority allows states to waive certain federal education program requirements, with SEAs ensuring statutory purposes are met. Local waivers may be terminated if student performance is inadequate. States must submit annual reports on waivers granted, including effects on student performance. ED is to make state reports available to Congress and the public, summarizing the impacts of Ed-Flex waivers on state reform efforts and pupil performance. The Ed-Flex authority allows states to waive federal education program requirements, with SEAs ensuring statutory purposes are met. States must submit annual reports on waivers granted, including effects on student performance. A report prepared in 2001 lacked information on Ed-Flex authority use and program impacts. Waivers can be granted to SEAs or LEAs on a case-by-case basis by the U.S. Secretary of Education, primarily focusing on Title IX, Part D of the ESEA. The discussion focuses on Title IX, Part D of the ESEA, allowing waivers for education programs. The Secretary of Education can waive requirements for SEAs, LEAs, tribes, or schools, with specific goals and measurement methods needed. Certain requirements cannot be waived, such as those related to state school finance, religious use of funds, and specific prohibitions. The ESEA Title IX-D case-by-case waiver authority has limitations on what requirements can be waived, including prohibitions on certain fund uses and eligibility requirements for charter schools. Waivers granted under this authority are limited to four years and may be extended if they contribute to improved student achievement. However, waivers must be terminated if pupil performance does not justify their continuation. The ESEA Title IX-D waiver authority is limited to four years and can be extended if it improves student achievement. Waivers must be terminated if pupil performance does not justify their continuation. The Secretary of Education must publish a notice of the decision to grant a waiver in the Federal Register. A total of 197 waivers were granted between 2002 and 2006, with most being waivers of administrative cost limitations for Indian education grants. Between 2002 and 2006, a total of 197 waivers were granted under the ESEA Title IX-D authority. Most waivers were related to administrative cost limitations for Indian education grants, with some exceptions granted for various reasons such as natural disasters and pilot programs. Under ESEA Title I-A accountability provisions, LEAs identified as needing improvement can act as SES providers. General programmatic waivers allow exceptions to ESEA Title I-A requirements for fiscal accountability or school selection. The Secretary must submit annual reports on waiver effects starting in FY2002. A separate waiver authority applies to schools in the Public Charter Schools program, with broader waiver capabilities. The PCS waiver authority allows for the waiver of any requirement over which the Secretary of Education has administrative authority, except for requirements related to the definition of a charter school eligible for PCS funds. Schools with 40% or more low-income students in the ESEA Title I-A program can implement schoolwide programs with flexibility in fund usage across federal education programs. In schoolwide programs, federal aid from Title I-A and other K-12 education programs can be used to improve services for all students, not just the most disadvantaged. These programs are exempt from certain regulations as long as they meet the programs' goals and address the needs of intended beneficiaries. Funds must supplement, not replace, other federal and non-federal funds. IDEA requirements must still be met in schoolwide programs. In schoolwide programs, federal funds can be combined with state and local funds without separate accounting, providing flexibility compared to targeted assistance programs. This flexibility primarily applies to Title I-A programs, as other programs typically focus on LEAs or individual schools not eligible for schoolwide programs. The IDEA's programmatic requirements must still be met in schoolwide programs. The ability to use Title I-A funds on a schoolwide basis, without separate accounting, provides significant flexibility compared to targeted assistance programs. Schoolwide programs have grown rapidly, with a majority of Title I-A pupils now served by them. The eligibility threshold for schoolwide programs was reduced to 40% of pupils from low-income families by the NCLB. The rationale for providing schoolwide program authority to high poverty schools is that all pupils are disadvantaged in such schools. The NCLB reduced the eligibility threshold for schoolwide programs to 40% of pupils from low-income families. This change raised questions about the rationale for providing schoolwide program authority to high poverty schools. There is little evidence of the achievement effects of this expansion. The Rural Education Achievement Program (REAP) under ESEA Title VI-B allows small, rural LEAs with low attendance or in sparsely populated areas to transfer funds among selected ESEA programs. This flexibility was initially authorized in 2001 and extended by the NCLB. Small, rural LEAs with low attendance or in sparsely populated areas can combine or transfer funds from various ESEA programs to support activities authorized under different programs. This flexibility is granted due to the small size of grants received by these LEAs, which may not be sufficient to support separate programs effectively. Small, rural LEAs can combine or transfer funds from various ESEA programs to support activities authorized under different programs. This flexibility is granted due to the small size of grants received by these LEAs, which may not be sufficient to support separate programs effectively. The \"REAP Flex\" authority allows eligible small, rural LEAs to transfer 100% of funds under affected programs, including ESEA Titles III and IV-B, providing more flexibility compared to the broader Transferability authority. Additionally, LEAs eligible for this authority can also receive supplementary grants for various purposes. Small, rural LEAs can transfer funds from ESEA programs like Titles III and IV-B under the REAP Flex authority. Approximately 4,781 LEAs were eligible for this flexibility in 2005-2006, with 51% participating. Funds were often moved from Titles II-A and IV-A to Titles I-A and V-A for school improvement activities due to small formula allocations. Small, rural LEAs can transfer funds from ESEA programs like Titles III and IV-B under the REAP Flex authority. Approximately 4,781 LEAs were eligible for this flexibility in 2005-2006, with 51% participating. Funds were often moved from Titles II-A and IV-A to Titles I-A and V-A for school improvement activities due to small formula allocations. Rural LEAs found flexibility in funding useful, especially when allocations were insufficient for significant improvements. There was confusion between REAP Flex and Transferability authority at the LEA level. ESEA Title V-A, Innovative Programs, is considered a block grant providing flexibility to states and LEAs in using federal aid funds. ESEA Title V-A is a block grant program in K-12 education that offers flexibility to states and LEAs in using funds for a wide range of educational activities. Funds are allocated based on population aged 5-17, with most funds distributed to LEAs using state-developed formulas. Title V-A funds are allocated to states based on population aged 5-17, with a minimum grant amount of 0.5% to each state. States must allocate the majority of funds to LEAs using state-developed formulas that consider enrollment, high-cost pupils, and disadvantaged areas. States must suballocate at least 85% of their grant to LEAs, with additional funds above the FY2002 level also being suballocated to LEAs. States must suballocate at least 85% of their Title V-A grants to LEAs, with some states required to suballocate 100% of grants above the FY2002 level. A maximum of 15% of funds can be used for administrative costs, with the rest designated for specific programs and services. LEAs have the flexibility to use their funds for various innovative assistance programs. Title V-A funds can be used by LEAs for public school choice options, school repair, statewide education reform, and various innovative assistance programs. The funds can support specific programs like charter schools, same gender schools, and school nurses, as well as broader initiatives to improve academic achievement for disadvantaged students. This flexibility in fund usage categorizes Title V-A as a block grant. Title V-A funds can be used by LEAs for public school choice options, school repair, statewide education reform, and various innovative assistance programs. The program was first enacted in 1981 as Chapter 2 of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act, consolidating federal K-12 education programs. The block grant reduced the number of federal education programs initially, but new categorical programs were authorized later. The Title V-A program, enacted in 1981, consolidated federal education programs into a block grant. A recent study found that recipient LEAs primarily used funds for instructional materials, educational technology, and targeted academic services. Large LEAs focused on teacher professional development and school-based improvement. However, resources were not often targeted at high-need pupils or schools, and appropriations for the program have declined over time. The Title V-A program, which consolidated federal education programs into a block grant in 1981, has seen a decline in appropriations over the years. Funding has not been frequently targeted at high-need pupils or schools, with decisions influenced by long-term LEA plans and individual school priorities. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2008 provided zero funds for Title V-A, possibly leading to its termination. The program lacks strong advocacy for increased funding, despite being popular among state and local education officials and private school administrators. Despite being popular among state and local education officials and private school administrators, Title V-A has seen a decline in appropriations over the years. Funding has not been targeted at high-need pupils or schools, leading to limited information on the program's effectiveness. The program lacks strong advocacy for increased funding and has received less favorable treatment in funding decisions compared to programs with demonstrated outcomes. Amendments under NCLB require states to report on how Title V-A funding contributes to improving student academic achievement. The NCLB requires states to submit annual summaries on how Title V-A funding contributes to improving student academic achievement. Authorities under the NCLB allow SEAs and LEAs to increase Title V-A funding by transferring funds from other federal programs. Additional provisions provide flexibility to states and LEAs, such as consolidated applications and authority to consolidate funds for program administration. The NCLB provides flexibility for SEAs and LEAs to consolidate applications and funds for program administration. It also allows LEAs to transfer funds among four ESEA programs to improve student academic achievement. Title VI, Part A, Subpart 2 of the ESEA, amended by the NCLB, allows LEAs to transfer up to 50% of their formula grants among four ESEA programs. LEAs failing to meet AYP requirements can only transfer 30% of their grants for AYP-related activities. States can transfer up to 50% of program funds among specified programs, excluding funds for suballocation to LEAs or state administration. The Transferability authority under Title VI, Part A, Subpart 2 of the ESEA allows states to transfer up to 50% of program funds among specified programs, excluding funds for suballocation to LEAs or state administration. The total appropriations for the four programs subject to LEA Transferability authority in FY2008 amount to approximately $3.5 billion. LEAs can make transfers without specific application or approval, but all program requirements still apply to the transferred funds. The Transferability authority allows states to transfer up to 50% of program funds among specified programs. LEAs can make transfers without specific approval, but all program requirements still apply. Participation in Transferability is relatively modest, with approximately 12-16% of LEAs participating in 2005-2006. Estimates of LEA participation in Transferability in 2005-2006 were complicated by confusion between REAP Flex and Transferability authorities. Many LEAs moved funds from Title II-A and Title IV-A to Titles I-A and V-A. Reasons for not participating included a lack of information. The evaluation report highlighted reasons for LEAs not participating in Transferability, such as lack of information, satisfaction with existing flexibility, and insufficient funding. A new State and Local Flexibility Demonstration Act allows up to seven states to consolidate state administration and activity funds under various federal programs. The State-Flex authority allows states to consolidate funds from various federal programs under the ESEA for five years, with the possibility of renewal if requirements are met. States must enter into agreements with 4-10 LEAs, with at least half serving high-poverty populations. The State-Flex authority allows states to consolidate funds from federal programs under the ESEA for five years, with the possibility of renewal if requirements are met. Selected states must enter agreements with 4-10 LEAs, with at least half serving high-poverty populations. Florida was granted State-Flex authority but withdrew before implementation. The State-Flex program allows states to consolidate funds from various ESEA programs for five years, with the option for renewal. Florida was granted this authority but withdrew before implementation. LEAs can also participate in a \"Local-Flex\" program to consolidate funds for specific purposes. The State-Flex program allows states and LEAs to consolidate funds from various ESEA programs for five years, with the option for renewal. LEAs may use up to 4% of the funds for administration. Authority can be lost if AYP requirements are not met for two consecutive years or if flexibility agreement requirements are not followed. Certain requirements, such as civil rights and fiscal accountability, cannot be waived. Annual reports on fund usage must be prepared and disseminated. The Local-Flex program allows LEAs to consolidate funds from ESEA programs, with limited flexibility. Seattle, Washington, is the only LEA to have participated, but its eligibility was suspended for failing to make AYP. There has been little interest from states and LEAs in obtaining State-Flex and Local-Flex authority. There has been minimal interest from states and LEAs in obtaining State-Flex and Local-Flex authorities. Only one LEA has participated in Local-Flex, and no states in State-Flex. Major barriers to participation include additional responsibilities with few benefits, limited organizational capacity, and limited information dissemination. A new round of competition for these authorities began in 2004, offering preference in future grant competitions for participants. The State-Flex and Local-Flex competition offers preference in future grant competitions for states and LEAs participating in the program. These participants have undergone comprehensive planning to improve teacher quality and academic achievement, especially for disadvantaged students. State-Flex and Local-Flex allow for broad use of funds authorized under ESEA programs with few specified requirements. Only a limited number of states and LEAs can participate in State-Flex and Local-Flex. The State-Flex and Local-Flex program allows for broad use of funds under ESEA programs with few specified requirements. Participation is limited to a maximum of seven states and a select number of LEAs. Despite multiple invitations to compete, interest from SEAs and LEAs has been minimal. State-Flex authority is restricted in terms of state administrative responsibilities and the share of funds that can be used for state-level activities. The State-Flex and Local-Flex program allows for broad use of funds under ESEA programs with limited specified requirements. Participation is limited to a maximum of seven states and select LEAs. The share of funds for state administration is relatively small, ranging from 1% to 26.5% for different programs. Participating states have influence over funds consolidated by LEAs with local performance agreements. LEAs in the state demonstration program may have diminished flexibility as their fund use must align with state use. The inclusion of the ESEA Title V-A Innovative Programs block grant in the Local-Flex authority is of limited significance. The State-Flex and Local-Flex program allows for broad use of funds under ESEA programs with limited specified requirements. Participation is limited to a maximum of seven states and select LEAs. The inclusion of the ESEA Title V-A Innovative Programs block grant in the Local-Flex authority is of limited significance. Comparisons with earlier versions of legislation show similarities in flexibility authorities. The Senate version of H.R. 1 proposed a broader state and local flexibility/performance agreement authority, which was not included in the final legislation. This proposal would have provided greater flexibility than the enacted State-Flex and Local-Flex authorities, with increased outcome accountability. The scope of the Senate proposal was similar in terms of participating states and LEAs, but more limited than optional performance agreement/grant consolidation proposals from the 106th Congress. The types of program requirements remained similar, but the range of ESEA programs was broader. The Senate version of H.R. 1 proposed a broader state and local flexibility/performance agreement authority, which was not included in the final legislation. The flexibility authority allowed for reallocating funds among and within LEAs to target concentrations of poor children. The range of ESEA programs subject to the flexibility authority was broad and involved higher levels of funding, including Title I-A grants for Education of the Disadvantaged and Limited English Proficient/Immigrant Education. The Innovative Programs block grant allowed states to reallocate funds among LEAs to target poor children, with outcome accountability requiring states to exceed AYP goals significantly. This report also addresses cross-cutting issues related to this flexibility. The report analyzes special forms of flexibility in education funding, highlighting the ability of states and LEAs to prioritize federal aid funds according to their own needs. These flexibility authorities are limited in terms of participation, program impact, and waivers. The Transferability authority, Innovative Programs block grant, and Title I-A schoolwide programs are exceptions to these limitations. The special flexibility authorities in education funding are limited in terms of participation, program impact, and waivers. States and LEAs can waive federal program requirements in exchange for accountability based on pupil achievement outcomes. These authorities, enacted as part of the NCLB, aim to increase accountability while allowing for flexibility in ESEA and related federal programs. About 12-16% of LEAs have utilized the Transferability authority. The NCLB has introduced flexibility authorities in education funding to increase accountability and allow for flexibility in federal programs. Transferability is the most utilized authority by 12-16% of LEAs, while others like State-Flex and Local-Flex have limited interest. REAP Flex is widely used by small, rural LEAs. Reporting on the impact of flexibility on pupil achievement is required, but specific impacts are not well-documented. The current flexibility authorities have limitations and may not fully address concerns about federal fund use and administrative burdens. The current flexibility authorities in education funding have limitations in addressing concerns about federal fund use and administrative burdens. The ESEA Title I-A schoolwide program authority is limited to schools with low-income pupil rates somewhat above average. The Secretarial case-by-case waiver authorities require individual requests to the U.S. Secretary of Education. LEAs must apply to their SEAs for waivers under the Ed-Flex authority. States and LEAs may transfer up to 50% of funds received under any program. The waiver authorities for education funding have limitations as requests must be made to the U.S. Secretary of Education. LEAs must also apply for waivers under the Ed-Flex authority. While fund Transferability authority allows for funds to be transferred, there are restrictions on the amount that can be transferred. The rural LEA flexibility authority is only available to low-enrollment LEAs. State-Flex authority is limited to seven states. Local-Flex authority is available to a limited number of LEAs. The low rate of participation in these authorities may be due to the limited flexibility they offer. Certain requirements, such as fiscal accountability and participation by private school pupils and staff, cannot be waived under these authorities. The limited flexibility provided by waiver authorities may be a reason for low participation rates. Certain requirements, such as fiscal accountability and participation by private school pupils and staff, cannot be waived. Some flexibility authorities do not cover the largest ESEA program, Title I-A, and do not allow fund reallocation among LEAs. The 1999 GAO report found that existing flexibility authorities do not address main regulatory burdens related to IDEA, ADA, child nutrition programs, and environmental requirements. The 1999 GAO report found that existing flexibility authorities do not address main regulatory burdens related to IDEA, ADA, child nutrition programs, and environmental requirements. Some states view Ed-Flex as of limited value due to the few programs that may be waived, while others see it as encouraging innovation and flexibility. The new authorities enacted in 2001 and 2002 also face similar perceptions. These authorities have been adopted during a period of increased flexibility in federal program requirements, particularly in ESEA Title I-A. The increased flexibility in federal program requirements, especially in ESEA Title I-A, has allowed for more autonomy in fund usage for LEAs and schools. The NCLB consolidated programs related to teachers and technology, giving states and LEAs greater flexibility. The special authorities for waivers under NCLB are seen as marginally impactful. Limited information is available on the use of these flexibilities, with low participation rates noted. Waivers in federal education programs can eliminate regulatory barriers for local educational reform. Limited data exists on the use of new flexibilities under NCLB due to low participation. Pre-NCLB waivers were used for few purposes not always related to innovation. ESEA Title IX-D authority allowed some states to participate in a growth model pilot for AYP determination. REAP Flex and Transferability are commonly used for moving funds out of ESEA Title II-A. Under ESEA Title I-A accountability provisions, flexibility authority is used to move funds between different programs, such as Teacher and Principal Training, Safe and Drug-Free Schools, Education for the Disadvantaged, and Innovative Programs block grant. This helps compensate for reductions in formula grants and target resources on schools failing to meet progress standards. Pre-NCLB waivers were mainly used to waive requirements like the low-income pupil percentage threshold for Title I-A schoolwide program eligibility. In the pre-NCLB era, flexibility authorities like Secretarial waivers and Ed-Flex were used to waive requirements for Title I-A programs, including low-income pupil thresholds and deadlines for standards implementation. Schoolwide programs offer flexibility in fund usage, but concerns arise for schools with low percentages of low-income students. Schoolwide programs provide flexibility in fund usage under Title I-A, but concerns arise for schools with low percentages of low-income students. Questions have been raised about granting authority to schools with low poverty rates to operate schoolwide programs, as the impact may be limited due to the size of the Title I-A grant being based on the number of children from low-income families. There is no systematic evidence that schoolwide programs are more effective than targeted assistance programs in improving education for disadvantaged pupils. Waivers to maintain or expand Title I-A participation could disperse funds among low-poverty schools, reducing the concentration on high-poverty schools. Ed-Flex places restrictions on waivers but does not prohibit them. The use of waivers in Title I-A programs may disperse funds among low-poverty schools, reducing the focus on high-poverty schools. Waivers can also delay meeting deadlines for implementing standard and assessment requirements, potentially undermining accountability. LEAs and states often request waivers for various requirements in programs like CSR and Eisenhower, such as teacher hiring focus, consortia formation, subject-specific training funds, and limits on professional development funds. The NCLB has led to changes in the use of waivers for programs like CSR and Eisenhower, with a shift towards a more flexible ESEA Title II program supporting teacher and principal recruitment and training. Few substantive waivers have been granted under ESEA Title IX-D. The ESEA Title II program consolidated CSR and Eisenhower programs, offering more flexibility for teacher and principal recruitment and training. Limited information is available on the impact of waivers granted under Ed-Flex authority, with anecdotal evidence suggesting some achievement effects in a few LEAs. The Ed-Flex authority enacted in 1999 allows for waivers to achieve high standards in states. Anecdotal information on the achievement effects of these waivers in a limited number of LEAs was included in a 1999 ED report. Supporters argue that Ed-Flex authority has supported standards-based reform by facilitating program coordination, streamlining administration, and encouraging instructional program development without constraints. Ed-Flex encourages LEAs and schools to develop instructional programs without standard federal or state constraints, streamlining administration and focusing on outcomes to improve student achievement. The effectiveness of special flexibility authorities in improving pupil achievement outcomes is debatable, raising questions about the availability of sufficient information to analyze their impact. The effectiveness of special flexibility authorities in improving pupil achievement outcomes is debatable due to a lack of available information for analysis. Efforts by ED to compile and publish relevant information on waivers and special authorities have been limited, making it challenging to evaluate their significance and impact on student achievement. The significance of flexibility authorities in education is difficult to evaluate, especially in terms of their impact on student achievement outcomes. The accountability requirements associated with these authorities vary, with a focus on state-established goals and meeting adequate yearly progress requirements. Some flexibility authorities do not have a direct link to outcome accountability. The Ed-Flex authority allows states to grant waivers for meeting AYP requirements under ESEA Title I-A, with varying levels of outcome accountability. A GAO study found that states differed in setting specific objectives for granting waivers, with limited ED oversight. The GAO study found limited ED oversight of Ed-Flex implementation by states, with varying levels of detail in annual reports. Current flexibility authorities do not require substantial additional outcome accountability beyond meeting AYP requirements. The emphasis on meeting outcome accountability requirements under the NCLB is significant for states and LEAs with special flexibility authority. Failure to meet these requirements can have consequences, including losing eligibility for flexibility authority. This additional accountability aligns with the nature of special flexibility authorities. The NCLB has expanded outcome accountability requirements, and while the flexibility granted is limited, it comes with increased accountability. The special flexibility authorities described in the report are limited in both additional flexibility and increased outcome accountability. These provisions are influenced by recent legislation like the NCLB, which expands outcome accountability requirements and flexibility in federal aid funds for all states, LEAs, and schools. Proponents argue that increased flexibility in fund usage can lead to improved pupil outcomes without the need for additional accountability measures. Critics may argue against granting special flexibility without sufficient justification. Critics and proponents debate the justification for special flexibility authorities in federal funding. Proponents believe increased flexibility can improve pupil outcomes, while critics argue that accountability provisions are necessary and worry about the effectiveness of these authorities."
