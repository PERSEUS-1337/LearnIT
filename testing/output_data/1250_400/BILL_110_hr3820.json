    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Commercial Motor Vehicle Advanced Safety Technology Tax Act of 2007\". Congress finds that commercial motor vehicle crashes are a major concern in the United States, especially with the increasing number of trucks and their role in transporting hazardous materials. A 2004 report showed that large truck crashes are more likely to result in fatalities compared to passenger cars. In 2005, there were 5,212 deaths and 114,000 injuries from large truck-related crashes, totaling 25,533 fatalities from 2001 to 2005. These crashes not only result in human loss but also impose a significant economic cost on society. From 2001 to 2005, there were 25,533 large truck-related fatalities in the United States, costing society $230.6 billion annually. Each crash involving a truck over 10,000 pounds has an estimated cost of $91,112, with fatal crashes averaging $3,604,518. Investments in advanced safety systems by vehicle suppliers and manufacturers aim to mitigate commercial motor vehicle crash scenarios. The Department of Transportation has set goals to address these issues. Motorcoach manufacturers have developed advanced safety systems and technologies to address commercial motor vehicle crash scenarios. The Department of Transportation aims to reduce the traffic fatality rate by deploying these technologies. Congress supports increasing the deployment of advanced vehicle safety technologies through tax incentives to make them more affordable for businesses. SEC. 45O.
