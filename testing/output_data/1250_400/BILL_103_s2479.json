The Act of June 19, 1886 (24 Stat. 81, chapter 421; 46 App. U.S.C. 289) abolishes certain fees for official services to American vessels and amends laws related to shipping commissioners, seamen, and vessel owners. SEC. 5 amends the Shipping Act, 1916 regarding citizenship for vessel operation in passenger transport. SEC. 6 amends the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 by including passenger and cargo. SEC. 7 addresses permits for vessels entering national park units. The Secretary of the Interior has established a priority system for operating vessels in the National Park System. Priority is given to vessels documented in the U.S. or Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, followed by foreign-documented vessels already permitted. Permits for foreign-documented vessels may be revoked or refused renewal. The Secretary of the Interior may revoke or refuse to renew permission for foreign-documented vessels to operate in National Park units if a person requests permission for a U.S.-documented vessel and there is a limit on permits. However, this restriction does not apply to persons holding rights under the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. The Secretary of the Interior cannot revoke or refuse to renew permission for individuals with rights under the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act to provide visitor services in National Park units. Those whose permits are revoked have the right of first refusal for available permits in that unit."
