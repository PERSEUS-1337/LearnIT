    "content": "The Children's Bicycle Helmet Safety Act of 1993 highlights the importance of bicycle helmet use, citing statistics on head injuries and deaths among cyclists, particularly children. The Act emphasizes the need for a program to promote universal helmet use to prevent injuries and save lives. The Children's Bicycle Helmet Safety Act of 1993 emphasizes the importance of promoting bicycle helmet use among individuals under 16 through grants for programs that enforce helmet laws, provide helmets, and educate on safety. The Children's Bicycle Helmet Safety Act of 1993 promotes helmet use for individuals under 16 by enforcing standards for helmet manufacturing, including interim standards like ANSI Z90.4-1984 and Snell B-90, until a final standard is established by the Consumer Product Safety Commission within 60 days of the Act's enactment. The Consumer Product Safety Commission will establish a final standard for bicycle helmet safety, including provisions to prevent helmets from coming off, address injury risks to children, and add any necessary provisions. The final standard will take effect one year after issuance. Until then, non-conforming helmets will not meet the interim standard requirements. The final standard for bicycle helmet safety will take effect one year after issuance. Non-conforming helmets will be considered in violation of consumer product safety standards until the final standard is in place. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is authorized to receive appropriations of $2,000,000 for fiscal year 1994, $3,000,000 for fiscal year 1995, and $4,000,000 for fiscal year 1996 for a grant program. An approved bicycle helmet is defined as one that meets interim and final safety standards outlined in the Act."
