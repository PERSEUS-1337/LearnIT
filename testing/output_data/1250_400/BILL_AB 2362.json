    "title": "AB 2362",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature declares the intent of a bill to require written notification to owners and tenants in common interest developments when pesticides are applied by the homeowner association or its agents, similar to existing law for licensed pest control operators. Section 4777 is added to the Civil Code for this purpose. Section 4777 of the Civil Code defines terms related to pesticide application in common interest developments, including definitions for \"adjacent separate interest,\" \"authorized agent,\" \"broadcast application,\" \"electronic delivery,\" \"licensed pest control operator,\" \"pest,\" and \"pesticide.\" (7) \u201cPesticide\u201d is any substance used to control pests. Associations must provide written notice to owners and tenants before applying pesticides without a licensed operator. The notice must include the pests to be controlled and the name of the pesticide product. CAUTION \u2013 Pesticides are toxic chemicals. Unlicensed use is allowed based on scientific evidence of minimal risks if used properly. Minimize exposure to reduce risk. If experiencing symptoms after pesticide application, contact a physician or California Poison Control. For more information, contact County Health Department for health questions or Department of Pesticide Regulation for regulatory information at 916-324-4100. The association must provide notice of pesticide application, including date, time, and frequency, at least 48 hours in advance to owners and tenants of separate interests and adjacent units. For common areas, notice must be posted or provided to adjacent owners and tenants. If the pest poses an immediate threat to health and safety, the association must post written notice within one hour after pesticide application. Notice to tenants can be provided through mail, personal delivery, or electronic delivery. Owners or tenants can agree in writing to immediate pesticide application upon receipt of notification. Prior oral agreement for immediate application can be made if requested before the 48-hour notice period. Prior to receiving written notification, the association or authorized agent can orally agree to immediate pesticide application if requested by the owner or tenant. A written notice must be left at the separate interest before or at the time of pesticide application. If other owners or tenants need to be notified, the notice should be provided as soon as possible after the oral agreement is made, but no later than the start of the pesticide application. A written notice must be attached to the minutes of the board meeting following the pesticide application."
