    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Child Handgun Injury Prevention Act\". The Congress finds that in the 10 years from 1987 through 1996, nearly 2,200 children in the United States aged 14 or younger died from unintentional shootings. The United States leads in rates of children lost to unintentional firearms-related death compared to other industrialized countries. Additionally, the number of nonfatal unintentional firearm injuries treated in U.S. hospital emergency rooms annually is nearly 8 times the number of deaths. In 25 other industrialized countries, the number of unintentional deaths from firearms is 9 times greater than in the United States.

Children as young as 3 years old have the finger strength to fire most commercially available handguns. Currently, firearms are not subject to minimum safety standards in the United States, despite public support for regulation. Trigger locks and safety devices are often inadequate in preventing accidental firearm discharges. Firearms and safety locks move in interstate commerce. Many trigger locks are inadequate in preventing accidental firearm discharges or children from accessing firearms. Regulation of handgun discharge protection products. The Secretary of the Treasury is required to regulate handgun discharge protection products to reduce the risk of injury to children. The regulations must establish a minimum safety standard for these products, ensuring they are of high quality and cannot be easily removed from a handgun. The Secretary of the Treasury must create a standard for handgun discharge protection products to prevent children from operating a handgun. The standard should ensure quality and restrict removal without specific access methods. Test protocols for poison prevention packaging may be considered. The standard must be issued within 12 months and take effect 6 months after issuance. SEC. 4. ORDERS; INSPECTIONS. The Secretary has the authority to issue orders prohibiting the manufacture, sale, transfer, or delivery of handgun discharge protection products that violate the Act. They can also require manufacturers and dealers to provide notice of associated risks and how to mitigate them. The Secretary can take various actions to ensure compliance with the Act, including bringing products into conformity, repairing or replacing them, issuing refunds, recalling products, or submitting a plan for implementation.

A licensed manufacturer, importer, or dealer must include a warning label on handgun packaging and materials, stating the dangers of children accessing and operating handguns. The label must emphasize the importance of keeping handguns locked and unloaded to prevent accidents.

Compliance with the Act does not excuse liability under common law or state statutes. (e) Effect on Private Remedies: Compliance with this Act or any order issued under it does not exempt anyone from liability under common law or State statutory law. The Secretary's failure to take action authorized under this Act is not admissible in litigation. Criminal penalties may apply to those who knowingly violate provisions of this Act regarding handgun discharge protection products. SEC. 9. NO EFFECT ON STATE LAW.
