    "content": "The work presents a two-stage neural architecture for learning and refining structural correspondences between graphs. It utilizes localized node embeddings from a graph neural network to rank soft correspondences initially, then employs synchronous message passing networks to iteratively re-rank the correspondences for matching consensus in local neighborhoods. The method scales well to large inputs and improves upon the current state-of-the-art in tasks like computer vision and entity alignment between knowledge graphs. Graph matching involves establishing structural correspondences between nodes in graphs by considering node and edge similarities. It is crucial for various real-world applications like cheminformatics, bioinformatics, social network analysis, and computer vision tasks. The problem has been extensively studied in theory and practice, often using domain-agnostic distances like graph edit distance and maximum common subgraph problem. Neural architectures have been proposed to tackle graph matching and similarity tasks in a data-dependent fashion, considering continuous node embeddings for crucial information. These approaches are more efficient than purely combinatorial methods and can adapt to the given data distribution. Graph matching and similarity tasks have been addressed using neural architectures in a data-dependent manner. These approaches aim to compute similarity scores between graphs but may struggle with generalizing to unseen graphs and efficient global matching procedures. The formulation of graph matching involves an edge-preserving quadratic assignment problem, emphasizing neighborhood consensus to prevent adjacent nodes from being mapped to different regions in the target graph. The formulation of graph matching involves finding correspondences based on neighborhood consensus to prevent adjacent nodes from being mapped to different regions in the target graph. The proposed deep graph matching architecture consists of two stages: local feature matching followed by an end-to-end procedure.

The method is scalable to large, real-world inputs and utilizes a two-stage neighborhood consensus architecture. The proposed deep graph matching architecture involves computing initial correspondence scores based on node embeddings similarity and achieving neighborhood consensus for correspondences. This is done through a shared neural network that generates soft correspondences using sinkhorn normalization. The network is trained in a supervised fashion against ground truth correspondences, implemented as a Graph Neural Network (GNN) for localized node representations. The GNN follows a neural message passing scheme to update node features by aggregating localized information. Various operators are available for precise feature control. The feature matching procedure may lead to false correspondences due to the local nature of node embeddings. Violations of neighborhood consensus criteria are detected and resolved iteratively using graph neural networks. The proposed algorithm aims to detect violations of neighborhood consensus criteria using graph neural networks in an iterative fashion. The soft correspondence matrix is utilized to pass node functions between domains, and a consensus method is employed to map node indicator functions and perform synchronous message passing on both graphs. The consensus method involves mapping node indicator functions and performing synchronous message passing on graphs using a shared graph neural network. This process iteratively improves neighborhood consensus by updating correspondence scores based on errors. The objective is fully differentiable and can be optimized using stochastic gradient descent, resolving ambiguities and false matchings.

The two-stage approach emphasizes the importance of an initial matching for testing neighborhood consensus. Theorems 1 and 2 demonstrate the effectiveness of a permutation equivariant and T-layered GNN in providing equal node embeddings. Theorem 1 and 2 show that a GNN satisfying permutation equivariance and injectivity provides equal node embeddings. Common GNN architectures are equivariant due to permutation invariant neighborhood aggregators. Injectivity can be achieved by using powerful GNNs like the Weisfeiler & Lehman heuristic.

The refinement strategy resolves ambiguities by re-sampling in each iteration, and row-wise normalization suffices for convergence to the correct solution. Our supervised refinement procedure resolves violations and converges to the correct solution through normalization and re-ranking false correspondences. Varying the number of refinement iterations speeds up training and testing runtime without affecting convergence abilities. The method is validated on synthetic graphs and real-world tasks like keypoint matching and knowledge graph alignment. Our method is implemented in PYTORCH and uses the PYTORCH GEOMETRIC and KEOPS libraries for efficient processing of sparse mini-batches with parallel GPU acceleration. Optimization is done via ADAM with a fixed learning rate. Hits@k is used to evaluate the model's performance in experiments on synthetic graphs and real-world tasks. In experiments on synthetic graphs, a graph neural network is used to learn matching for pairs of graphs in a supervised fashion. The GIN operator is implemented with three layers for its expressiveness in distinguishing raw graph structures.

It can recover all correspondences, even with varying noise levels, and shows improved performance with enhancements for scalability. Additionally, the refinement strategy converges to the perfect solution of Hits@1, even when operating on sparsified correspondences. The refinement strategy improves matching accuracy by increasing the number of iterations during testing. It can recover correct correspondences with sparsified top k correspondences, scaling well to large graphs.
