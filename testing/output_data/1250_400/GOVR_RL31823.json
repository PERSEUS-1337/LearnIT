    "content": "In January 2004, federal white-collar employees received a 1.5% annual pay adjustment and a 0.5% locality-based comparability payment under Executive Order 13322. A larger pay adjustment of 4.1% for 2004 was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004. President Bush signed the law on January 23, 2004, providing an additional 2.1% pay adjustment to federal civilian employees. President Bush signed H.R. 2673 into law on January 23, 2004, providing an additional 2.1% pay adjustment to federal civilian employees. Executive Order 13332 issued on March 3, 2004, allocated the pay adjustment as an average 1.2% annual and 0.9% locality. OPM published revised salary tables for 2004 on March 4, 2004, showing recommended locality payments and net pay increases. Federal white-collar employees receive annual pay adjustments and locality-based comparability payments under FEPCA. The adjustments are not based on cost-of-living measures. The Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act (FEPCA) of 1990 has not been fully implemented as originally enacted. Federal white-collar employees received a combined annual and locality pay adjustment of 4.1% in January 2003 and 2004. The nationwide average net pay increase in January 2003 would have been 18.56% if specified by FEPCA, and 15.15% in January 2004. This report discusses the January 2004 annual adjustment and locality payments. In 2004, federal white-collar employees received a 4.1% combined annual and locality pay adjustment. The report discusses the January 2004 annual adjustment and locality payments for federal employees under various schedules. The annual pay adjustment is based on the Employment Cost Index (ECI) measuring changes in private sector wages and salaries. Adjustments for contract appeals board members are based on the Employment Cost Index (ECI) and Executive Schedule pay adjustments. The ECI determines the annual pay adjustment, with rates increasing by 0.5 percentage points less than the ECI change. The pay adjustment is effective at the start of the first pay period after January 1 each year. The President can issue an alternative plan in case of national emergency or economic conditions affecting the general welfare, which must be submitted to Congress before September 1. FEPCA allows the President to issue an alternative plan for pay adjustments in case of national emergency or serious economic conditions. President Bush issued a plan for a 1.5% pay adjustment in 2004. The Pay Agent extends locality-based payments to certain employees, including those in the Foreign Service and senior-level positions. OPM clarified pay cap levels for non-General Schedule employees in 2001. Blue-collar workers under the Federal Wage System receive prevailing rate adjustments. In 2004, certain employees will receive a locality pay adjustment. The Pay Agent determines pay cap levels for non-General Schedule employees. Blue-collar workers under the Federal Wage System have a prevailing rate adjustment capped at the average pay increase for white-collar employees. Special rate employees receive the higher of the special rate or locality payment. Law enforcement officers get both special rates and locality pay. Federal employees in Alaska, Hawaii, and outside the US receive a cost-of-living allowance instead of locality pay. The locality-based comparability payments procedure under FEPCA ensures that GS employees' pay rates are equal to non-federal workers in the same locality. The President has the authority to adjust these payments in case of a national emergency or economic conditions. Employees in Alaska, Hawaii, and outside the US receive a cost-of-living allowance instead of locality pay. President Bush issued an alternative plan on August 27, 2003, to provide a 0.5% locality pay adjustment in January 2004, implemented by Executive Order 13322 on December 30, 2003. The Bureau of Labor Statistics conducts surveys to document non-federal pay rates in 32 pay areas nationwide. The Bureau of Labor Statistics conducts surveys to document non-federal pay rates in 32 pay areas nationwide under the National Compensation Survey program. The survey results are submitted to OPM, which compares non-federal and GS salaries to determine an overall average percentage pay gap for each area, adjusted to a target gap of 5% annually. The overall average percentage pay gap between non-federal and federal salaries in each pay area is adjusted to a target gap of 5% annually by OPM. FEPCA mandates closing a certain percentage of the gap each year, with varying percentages closed in different years. The gap reduction has been slower than initially planned, with percentages ranging from 23.5% to 44% closed in various years. By January 2002, FEPCA mandated closing the pay gap between non-federal and federal salaries to 5% annually. The gap reduction has been slow, with percentages ranging from 23.5% to 44% closed in different years. The locality pay adjustments are based on gaps that are 22 months old, with NCS surveys being phased in for determining future payments. The gaps for locality payments were determined using OCSP and NCS survey data from December 2000 to October 2001. The data for some pay areas was at least seven years old, with the largest pay areas having data from the mid-1990s. The Federal Salary Council explained the process in their report on the 2004 locality payments. The Federal Salary Council reported on the 2004 locality payments, explaining the methodology used to determine pay gaps. As of March 2002, the gap between GS average salaries and non-federal average salaries was 32.02%. To reduce this disparity to 5%, an average raise of 25.73% was recommended. Locality pay raises ranging from 19.45% to 47.64% were suggested for different pay areas, with the highest increase for the San Francisco area. The Federal Salary Council recommended locality pay raises in 2004 to reduce the pay gap. The recommended increases ranged from 19.45% to 47.64% for different pay areas, with an average net pay increase of 15.15% nationwide. The Federal Salary Council recommended locality pay raises in 2004 to reduce the pay gap. The council recommended that areas with pay gaps below the pay gap in RUS receive the same adjustment as RUS. Areas with low publishability and pay gaps two-tenths of a percentage point or more below RUS for three surveys were recommended to be included with RUS in 2004. The council also recommended not dropping locations like Indianapolis, Kansas City, Orlando, and St. Louis as separate pay areas at that time. The Federal Salary Council recommended not dropping locations like Indianapolis, Kansas City, Orlando, and St. Louis as separate pay areas at that time. The council established basic criteria in 1993 for determining pay areas, with unchanged criteria including contiguity to a pay area, at least 2,000 GS employees, and economic linkage. Exceptions were recommended for specific cases, such as Barnstable County, MA. The Federal Salary Council recommended including Barnstable County, MA in the Boston locality pay area in 2004, despite not meeting the criteria of having 2,000 GS employees. This exception was made due to the county being the only one on the eastern seaboard without a separate locality pay area and being isolated by the Boston pay area. The Federal Salary Council recommended including Barnstable County, MA in the Boston locality pay area in 2004 to address the lack of a separate locality pay area on the eastern seaboard. Additionally, the council recommended including St. Mary's County, MD in the Washington, DC-Baltimore, MD pay area, and maintaining New London, CT and Santa Barbara County, CA in their respective pay areas despite falling below the employee threshold. The Federal Salary Council recommended maintaining New London, CT and Santa Barbara County, CA in their respective pay areas for 2004. Monterey County, CA is also recommended to be included in the San Francisco pay area. Rhode Island was designated as an area of application to the Boston pay area in 2001. Monterey County, CA and Rhode Island meet the criteria for inclusion in the San Francisco and Boston pay areas, respectively. Rhode Island is treated as a single county due to its small size, and both areas are recommended for continued inclusion in 2004. The state of Rhode Island meets the criteria for inclusion in the Boston pay area in 2004. Edwards Air Force Base, although no longer meeting employment criteria, is recommended to continue being included in the Los Angeles pay area. The council recommended improvements to the BLS National Compensation Survey program in their report to the Pay Agent. The council recommended five improvements to the BLS National Compensation Survey program in their report to the Pay Agent. These include using three factors to assign federal grade levels, developing a model to estimate missing data, improving job matching, and providing subcategories for certain occupations. OPM and BLS have made progress in implementing these recommendations. OPM and BLS have made progress in implementing recommendations to improve the BLS National Compensation Survey program. This includes developing an econometric model to estimate salaries for non-federal survey jobs, improving job matching, and providing subcategories for certain occupations. OPM formed an interagency working group to develop a crosswalk between Federal job classifications and the new Standard Occupational Classification System. BLS is working on a new approach for grading supervisory occupations based on the level of work supervised. Tests of the new approach are planned for fall, with implementation expected in December 2003. Criteria are being developed to exclude jobs classified above GS-15. BLS has designed a new approach for grading supervisory occupations based on the level of work supervised. Final tests are scheduled for fall, with implementation expected in December 2003. Criteria are being developed to exclude jobs classified above GS-15. The council has concerns about the reliability of NCS data and recommends additional resources be committed to increase survey sample sizes in localities with pay gaps exceeding 5. The Council recommends that any further implementation of NCS data must be conditioned on BLS implementing improvements. Additional resources should be allocated to increase survey sample sizes in localities with pay gaps exceeding 5 percentage points. OPM published regulations in 2003 regarding changes in definitions of metropolitan areas, which would not immediately impact the GS locality pay program. OPM modified GS locality pay regulations to align with former OMB statistical area definitions, allowing for review before decisions in 2003. Major changes considered included differences in new statistical area definitions and the elimination of 'Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Areas' used in defining locality pay areas. In autumn 2003, the Federal Salary Council and Pay Agent considered major changes to the locality pay program, including new statistical area definitions and the introduction of 'Micropolitan Statistical Areas' and 'Combined Statistical Areas [CSAs]'. Population density is no longer a criterion for evaluating outlying counties, and commuting threshold levels have been adjusted. The Federal Salary Council working group recommended using the new MSA definitions for the locality pay program after reviewing OMB definitions and commuting patterns. Additional study was requested before any decisions were made. The Federal Salary Council working group recommended using the new MSA definitions for the locality pay program, with additional study needed before any decisions were made. At a second council meeting, they suggested adopting the new MSA definitions as the basic definitions for locality pay areas. The Federal Salary Council working group recommended adopting new MSA definitions for locality pay areas, including using Combined Statistical Areas (CSAs) for pay adjustments in January 2005. The council's recommendations were tentatively approved for the January 2005 pay adjustments, with proposed changes to be published in the Federal Register for public comment. In 2004, OPM will publish proposed changes on locality pay in the Federal Register and solicit public comments. An amendment to H.R. 2989 was agreed to by the House of Representatives, stating that funds in the Transportation/Treasury bill cannot be used to disestablish any pay locality. Representative Farr testified about potential pay reductions for federal employees in Monterey County, California. Representative Sam Farr's amendment regarding federal employee pay reductions in Monterey County, California was withdrawn after Chairman Ernest Istook agreed to collaborate. Senator Jack Reed proposed a similar amendment, which was approved by the Senate, preventing the removal of any area from a locality pay area. This amendment was incorporated into the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004 included an amendment preventing the removal of any area from a locality pay area. This provision was enacted as Section 644 of P.L. 108-199 on January 23, 2004. The Pay Agent submitted its annual report to the President on the 2004 locality payments on December 5, 2002, recommending adjustments for January 2004. The Pay Agent recommended adjustments for the 2004 locality payments in a report to the President on December 5, 2002. Due to the national emergency and economic slowdown, they advised against implementing the proposed pay increases in January 2004. The report highlighted concerns about the current compensation process for Federal employees, emphasizing the need for alternative approaches. The cost of the proposed locality-based comparability payments for January 2004 would be $8.830 billion. The Pay Agent's report recommended adjustments for 2004 locality payments, with a cost of $8.830 billion. They did not adopt the council's recommendation for including Barnstable County, Massachusetts in the Boston locality pay area. The Pay Agent also addressed improvements in the BLS National Compensation Survey Program. The Pay Agent recommended improvements in the BLS National Compensation Survey Program for 2003, focusing on random job selection and GS grade assignments. They look forward to reviewing the data in 2004 and implementing further improvements in 2005. Once pay percentages are determined, pay rates are calculated by adjusting the basic General Schedule. PayAgent urged expedited completion of remaining improvements in the BLS National Compensation Survey Program for 2003. Pay rates are calculated by adjusting the basic General Schedule with annual and locality pay percentages. President George W. Bush proposed a 2.0% federal civilian pay adjustment in the FY2004 budget, with a required 2.7% annual pay adjustment in January 2004. Alternative plans for adjustments must be submitted to Congress by specified dates. The President proposed a 2.0% federal civilian pay adjustment in the FY2004 budget, with a required 2.7% annual pay adjustment in January 2004. An alternative plan was submitted to Congress on August 27, 2003, calling for a 2.0% pay adjustment allocated as 1.5% annual and 0.5% locality pay. The cost of the adjustment was estimated at $2 billion. Executive Order 13322 implemented the alternative plan, which also included a $500 million Human Capital Performance Fund. The President's alternative plan for federal civilian pay adjustments in FY2004 included a $500 million Human Capital Performance Fund, authorized by P.L. 108-136. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $2.5 million for the fund in H.R. 2989, contingent on legislation authorizing its creation within OPM. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $2.5 million for the Human Capital Performance Fund in H.R. 2989, contingent on legislation authorizing its creation within OPM. The Senate Committee on Appropriations did not recommend an appropriation for the fund, believing it should be budgeted and administered within each individual agency. The Senate Committee on Appropriations did not recommend funding for the Human Capital Performance Fund in the Transportation and Treasury appropriations bill. The House of Representatives and the Senate agreed to provide $1 million for the fund in the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004, with funding contingent on the establishment of the fund within OPM and approval from relevant subcommittees. The legislation established a fund within OPM, requiring approval from relevant subcommittees before funds can be transferred to federal agencies. The President's alternative plan suggested a 2% pay raise, leading to concerns from federal employee union representatives. The National Commission on the Public Service recommended abolishing the General Schedule classification system due to the resources needed to maintain it. The National Commission on the Public Service recommended abolishing the General Schedule classification system due to the resources needed to maintain it. They proposed a broad-band system with fewer pay grades and wider salary ranges, allowing managers to determine pay based on competence and performance. Pay banding systems are already being implemented in various agencies. Several agencies, including the Federal Aviation Administration, Transportation Security Administration, and Internal Revenue Service, are implementing pay banding systems. Pay parity provisions in P.L. 107-123 allow the SEC to raise salaries for certain employees. New HRM systems for civilian employees of the Departments of Homeland Security and Defense are authorized in P.L. 107-296 and P.L. 108-136. Changes to pay setting systems at these agencies are expected to include broad pay bands. Congress annually considers the federal white-collar pay adjustment, which may differ from the President's recommendation. The federal white-collar pay adjustment amounts are set by Congress annually, with resolutions expressing the need for parity between military and civilian pay increases. These resolutions are nonbinding and do not require the President's signature. The FY2004 budget proposes a 4.1% pay increase for the military and 2.0% for civilian employees. Members of Congress urged support for equal pay raises for federal civilian employees and the military. The House Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for FY2004 was passed by a narrow margin. The House of Representatives passed a resolution in 2003 for equal pay raises for civilian employees and the military. The Senate version included the same language as a Sense of the Senate provision. The resolution serves as a framework for spending legislation consideration by Congress. The House of Representatives passed a resolution in 2003 for equal pay raises for civilian employees and the military, which serves as a framework for spending legislation consideration by Congress. The Departments of Transportation and Treasury and Independent Agencies Appropriations Bill, 2004, recommended a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees, including those in the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security. The bill did not specify how the increase should be divided between annual and locality pay adjustments. The House Committee on Appropriations approved H.R. 2989 with a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees. The bill was reported to the House and passed on September 9, 2003, despite opposition from the Bush Administration. The Bush Administration opposes a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees, proposing a 2.0% raise instead and expressing concerns about unfunded additional pay increases. The Statement of Administration Policy expresses disappointment that the bill does not fund the President's request for a $500 million Human Capital Performance Fund. It criticizes the 4.1% pay adjustment for civilian employees, stating it exceeds inflation and private-sector pay increases. However, Federal employee turnover is low, with a satisfaction rate on pay and a low quit rate. The 'quit rate' among Federal employees is at an all-time low of 1.7 percent per year, with a majority satisfied with their pay rate. The Senate version of the Transportation/Treasury appropriations bill includes a 4.1% pay adjustment for civilian employees in the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security. This pay increase would be absorbed within the levels appropriated in previous acts. The Senate version of the Transportation/Treasury appropriations bill includes a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees, with the pay increase to be absorbed within previous appropriations acts. Senator Richard Shelby and Senator Patty Murray offered an amendment to the bill, which was passed by voice vote. The amendment allocates the pay adjustment as a 2.7% annual pay increase and a 1.4% locality pay adjustment. The Senate passed H.R. 2989, amended, on a 91 to 3 vote on October 23, 2003. The Federal Salary Council recommended a 4.1% pay adjustment, with 2.7% as an annual pay increase and 1.4% as a locality pay adjustment. This adjustment was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004, providing a 4.1% pay increase for federal civilian employees, effective from January 1, 2004. The Senate agreed to a conference report on January 22, 2004, providing a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees. President Bush signed the bill into law on January 23, 2004. An additional 2.1% pay adjustment was allocated through Executive Order 13332 on March 3, 2004. The total cost of the pay adjustments was approximately $4.1 billion. The Appropriations Act provided a 2.1% pay adjustment to federal civilian employees, with 1.2% annual and 0.9% locality. The total cost of the 4.1% pay adjustment was about $4.1 billion. OPM issued revised salary tables for 2004 the next day. The Federal Salary Council and Pay Agent recommendations for the January 2005 pay adjustments are discussed in CRS Report RL32355. FEPCA aims to reduce the disparity between non-federal and federal salaries to 5%. Congress could consider amending FEPCA to address the disparity between non-federal and federal salaries, which was intended to be reduced to 5%. However, as of 2004, the average pay gap was 25.73%, far from the target. The methodology for setting federal pay adjustments has been questioned since FEPCA's enactment due to data completeness issues. The methodology for setting federal pay adjustments under FEPCA has been criticized for data completeness issues. Despite concerns raised in a draft memorandum, no changes were made to FEPCA. Survey data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics was not approved for use in determining locality payments for several years, leading to the use of aged data. Congress directed the President's Pay Agent to prepare a report on this issue in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2001. The President's Pay Agent was directed by Congress in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2001 to address methodological concerns with aged survey data for locality payments. Improvements to the survey methodology are in progress, and a white paper on compensation was issued in April 2002. The Congressional Budget Office compared federal General Schedule employee salaries with nonfederal employees in similar roles in November 2002. The Congressional Budget Office compared federal General Schedule employee salaries with nonfederal employees in similar roles in November 2002. The comparison showed that federal employees in professional and administrative occupations tended to earn less than their private sector counterparts, while those in technical and clerical occupations had salaries closer to private sector levels. About 85 percent of federal employees in professional and administrative roles earned more than 20 percent less than private sector salaries, while 30 percent of those in technical and clerical roles earned more than their private sector counterparts. The Congressional Budget Office found that three-quarters of federal employees held jobs with salaries within 10 percent of private levels. The federal pay system's lack of variation in pay raises by occupation could result in some workers receiving below-market salaries while others receive above-market salaries. This system fails to provide federal pay comparable to nonfederal jobs, especially for professional and administrative occupations. The Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act (FEPCA) aims to provide federal pay comparable to nonfederal jobs, but the lack of variation in pay raises by occupation results in disparities. Implementing FEPCA fully would cost billions, and unions advocate for pay parity with the military. The President's proposal on federal pay is criticized as inadequate and disregarding FEPCA. The AFGE and NTEU endorse pay parity between federal civilian employees and the military, criticizing the President's proposal as inadequate and disregarding FEPCA. Issues with the Department of Labor's methodology in determining federal pay comparability are highlighted, with concerns about changes in methodology not being addressed. The Pay Agent recommended adjustments for January 2004, but due to economic concerns, President Bush issued an Executive Order to prevent locality pay increases from taking effect. President Bush issued Executive Order 13322 in January 2004 to prevent locality pay increases from taking effect due to the national emergency situation and economic slowdown. The order provided a 1.5% annual pay adjustment and a 0.5% locality-based comparability payment. Additionally, Executive Order 13332 in March 2004 included an additional 2.1% pay adjustment, with an average 1.2% annual adjustment and 0.9% locality-based comparability payment. The pay rates for 2004 were calculated by increasing the basic General Schedule (GS) by the annual adjustment percentage and then adding the locality payment. Salary tables for 2004 can be found on the Internet at http://www.opm.gov. The new GS schedule for 2004 is determined by increasing basic GS rates with the annual adjustment percentage and then adding the locality payment. The resulting pay rates are compared with 2003 pay rates to calculate the net increase in pay. Salary tables for 2004 can be found online at http://www.opm.gov. MSA stands for Metropolitan Statistical Area and CMSA stands for Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area. Parts of each pay area are described at 5 CFR 531.603(b)."
