    "content": "Residential energy efficiency can benefit consumers by reducing utility bills and supporting national environmental policy objectives. Various policies have been adopted since the 1970s to increase conservation and energy efficiency, including tax incentives. The federal government is still deciding on the best policy tools to meet energy-efficiency objectives. In 2016, one-fifth of total energy consumed in the US was by the residential sector. Residential energy consumption has slightly decreased in recent years on a per capita and aggregate basis. Residential energy consumption has fallen slightly in recent years, both as a percentage of all energy consumption and on a per capita and aggregate basis. Per capita energy use has remained relatively constant since the 1970s but started trending downward in the mid- to late-2000s. Despite energy-efficiency gains, experts believe there is still potential for increased energy efficiency in the residential sector. Concerns exist that consumers may not invest in optimal energy efficiency levels, leading to debates on the optimal level of investment in energy efficiency. Increasing energy efficiency could potentially reduce residential energy use per capita. Energy efficiency in the residential sector remains a concern as consumers may not invest optimally. Tax credits are explored as a policy option to promote energy efficiency by addressing market failures and barriers. Tax incentives address market failures and barriers in residential energy efficiency. Taxpayers can claim credits for energy-efficient improvements and appliances for their primary residence. The Section 25C credit allows taxpayers to claim a tax credit for energy-efficient improvements on their primary residence, capped at $500. The credit expired at the end of 2017. Another credit, the residential energy efficient property tax credit (IRC \u00a725D), allows for a tax credit on properties generating renewable energy. The Section 25C credit expired in 2017, and taxpayers cannot claim it anymore. The Section 25D credit allows for a tax credit on properties that generate renewable energy, with a 30% credit rate in 2017, decreasing to 26% in 2020 and 22% in 2021 before expiring. The maximum value of the Section 25D credit is not capped. For more details, refer to Appendices A and B. The Section 25D credit for renewable energy technologies is uncapped. A rational consumer would invest in energy-efficient technology if the savings outweigh the cost. However, some consumers do not make these investments, known as the \"energy-efficiency paradox.\" Various economic theories and market failures may explain why consumers do not invest in residential energy efficiency. Consumers may not make optimal investments in residential energy efficiency due to market failures and barriers, such as externalities and informational issues. The Section 25C and Section 25D credits do not directly address these issues, limiting their impact on increasing energy efficiency. Consumers may not make optimal investments in residential energy efficiency due to market failures, including externalities and informational issues. Energy consumption externalities, such as pollution costs, may lead to underallocation of resources for energy-efficient investments. Lower electricity prices due to lack of reflection of environmental consequences result in consumers consuming more electricity than optimal and underinvesting in energy efficiency. Adoption of energy-efficient technologies can lead to positive externalities through knowledge spillover effects. Consumers do not pay the full cost of electricity consumption, leading to overconsumption and underinvestment in energy efficiency. Knowledge spillover effects from adopting energy-efficient technologies benefit society as a whole. Market failures, such as the principal-agent problem, can hinder optimal energy-efficient property decisions. Capital market imperfections can lead to underinvestment in energy-efficient property, as purchasers may opt for less efficient alternatives due to high initial costs. Landlords and builders may also underinvest in energy efficiency, especially in non-owner-occupied housing, where the disconnect between decision-makers and end users can result in suboptimal energy-efficient investments. Consumers may underinvest in energy-efficient property due to high initial costs and lack of information. Low-income households, in particular, may settle for less efficient alternatives when unable to borrow funds upfront. Uncertainty about future energy prices can also deter consumers from making energy-efficient investments. Government policies, such as tax incentives, can help address market failures and barriers to energy efficiency. Various government policies, including tax incentives, regulations, mandates, and informational programs like Energy Star, can enhance energy efficiency and address market failures. Tax credits such as Section 25C and Section 25D can lower the cost of energy-efficient investments and encourage additional investment in these technologies. Tax credits like Section 25C and Section 25D can lower the cost of energy-efficient investments, encouraging additional investment in these technologies. Other tax incentives, such as the now-expired energy-efficient appliance manufacturer credit, reduce the cost of producing energy-efficient products. These incentives can address negative externalities associated with residential energy consumption and increase awareness about energy-efficiency technologies. Governments can increase awareness about energy-efficiency technologies through programs like Energy Star labeling. Tax credits may not be the most efficient policy option for promoting energy efficiency if markets underinvest due to low electricity prices. Allowing electricity prices to reflect true costs or taxing electricity production with external costs could encourage investment in energy-efficient technologies. Current tax incentives for residential energy efficiency do not directly address the principal-agent problem. Increasing electricity prices to reflect true costs could encourage investment in energy-efficient technologies. Current tax incentives for residential energy efficiency do not directly address the principal-agent problem, especially for renters and landlords. Other tax incentives, like the tax credit for energy-efficient new homes, may be more effective in overcoming market imperfections for homeowners. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency may not effectively address capital market imperfections for homeowners who struggle to secure credit for upfront costs. While tax incentives reduce investment costs, they may not provide immediate savings for credit-constrained consumers. Subsidizing efficiency through tax credits can benefit consumers lacking information on energy-efficient technologies, but may not be necessary for well-informed individuals. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency may not effectively address capital market imperfections for homeowners who struggle to secure credit for upfront costs. Recent research suggests that tax credits might decrease total welfare if adopted by well-informed consumers, as they may not need incentives to invest in energy-efficient technologies. Tax credits are most beneficial when targeting consumers with the largest energy inefficiencies. The Section 25C and Section 25D tax credits aim to increase investment in energy-efficient property but may not rectify existing market failures. The effectiveness of tax incentives lies in their ability to influence taxpayer behavior towards desired outcomes. The economic analysis of Section 25C and Section 25D tax credits evaluates their impact on increasing investment, fairness, and administrative issues. It is unclear how effective these tax credits are at stimulating additional investment in residential energy efficiency. These credits tend to benefit higher-income taxpayers and face administrative challenges according to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. The goal of these tax credits is to encourage individuals to invest in residential energy efficiency. The report summarizes administrative issues with current tax benefits for residential energy efficiency and questions the effectiveness of tax credits in stimulating additional investments. Concerns were raised about these tax credits in the 1970s, as they may not lead to additional energy efficiency investments but rather reward consumers for existing investments. In the late 1970s, concerns were raised about the effectiveness of residential energy tax credits in stimulating additional investments in energy efficiency. Representative Bill Frenzel expressed doubts about the tax credits, stating that they did not provide a significant incentive in the marketplace and were more of a reward for actions already taken. The residential energy tax credit tends to be a passive reward at the end of the year, not a motivating factor for investment. Empirical evidence on its effectiveness in stimulating energy-efficiency property investment is mixed. Some researchers suggest it leads to additional investment, while others believe it mainly results in windfall gains for recipients. Policymakers need to consider whether tax credits truly encourage energy-efficiency investment. Consumers may not be significantly influenced by these credits due to other market incentives. Residential energy tax credits may not significantly impact purchasing decisions for consumers due to various reasons. Consumers may already be motivated by market incentives like high energy prices. The delay in realizing savings from tax credits and the requirement of income tax liability to benefit from the credits further reduce their incentive power. In 2017, 44% of U.S. households had no federal income tax liability, making tax credits ineffective for them. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency only benefit taxpayers with income tax liability, excluding 44% of U.S. households in 2017. Higher-income taxpayers are more likely to be motivated by these incentives to invest in energy-efficient property, such as heating and cooling equipment. Tax credits may also encourage consumers to choose high-efficiency units even when their existing units are still operational. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency target homeowners, mainly benefiting middle- and upper-income taxpayers. These incentives aim to increase investment in energy-efficient and renewable energy properties. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency primarily benefit middle- and upper-income taxpayers, with over three-quarters of claims made by those with incomes above $50,000. Lower-income taxpayers make up the majority of tax units but claim a smaller portion of the total value of residential energy tax credits. Income level correlates with the average amount of credit received, with the highest income tax units receiving approximately seven times more than the lowest income tax units. The nonrefundability feature of the tax credits may limit who can claim these benefits. Tax units with higher incomes receive approximately seven times more residential energy tax credits than those with lower incomes. The nonrefundability feature of these tax credits limits who can claim them, as the value cannot exceed a taxpayer's tax liability. Taxpayers without sufficient tax liability in the current year may not fully benefit from certain energy-efficiency incentives. This limitation primarily affects lower-income taxpayers, undermining the policy rationale behind using tax credits to promote energy efficiency investments. Residential energy-efficiency tax incentives are limited to higher-income taxpayers, which may undermine the policy rationale behind using tax credits to promote energy efficiency investments. If tax credits are only available to higher-income households, it may not effectively address the market barrier of high upfront costs for energy-efficiency property investments. A simple and easy-to-comply tax code is essential for taxpayers to claim benefits with low compliance costs. If filing for tax benefits becomes burdensome, eligible taxpayers may choose not to claim certain incentives delivered through the tax code. The Treasury Department's Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) found opportunities for fraud in the processing of residential energy tax credits due to lack of verification. Taxpayers may choose not to claim tax benefits if compliance costs are high, impacting overall taxpayer compliance. The IRS lacked verification for Section 25C and Section 25D residential energy credits, leading to potential fraud opportunities. Taxpayers were not required to provide proof of eligibility, resulting in uncertainty about claimants' homeownership status. Updates to IRS Form 5695 in 2011 now request information about the taxpayer's home for energy efficiency improvements. The TIGTA report highlighted issues with the IRS's verification of residential energy tax credits, leading to potential fraud opportunities. Updates to Form 5695 in 2011 required additional information about the taxpayer's home. Errors in applying credit limits resulted in eligible taxpayers being denied credits. Congress has the option to let the temporary tax credits expire as scheduled. The Section 25C and Section 25D tax credits are temporary provisions that may expire as scheduled. Congress has the option to allow these credits to expire or consider other policy options for residential energy efficiency incentives. Policymakers may choose to extend, expand, or modify these tax incentives. The residential energy-efficiency tax incentives, including Section 25C and Section 25D credits, may expire, leading to the elimination of windfall tax benefits. Policymakers have the option to extend, expand, or modify these incentives to encourage additional investments in energy-efficient technologies. The current tax credits have evolved since 2005, and potential expansions could include increasing the credit amount, expanding eligible technologies, and removing caps to provide more incentives for taxpayers. The residential energy-efficiency tax incentives, including Section 25C and Section 25D credits, have evolved since 2005. Expansions may provide additional incentives for taxpayers, potentially encouraging more purchases. Policymakers could scale back these provisions in various ways, which may increase confusion among taxpayers. Extension of current policy is also an option. Extension of current policy, whether in current form, expanded, or scaled back, will have a greater budgetary cost than expiration of these benefits. Policymakers may consider phasing out these credits for upper-income taxpayers and replacing them with a rebate program or alternative mechanism for providing incentives to consumers for energy-efficient purchases. This could benefit those with little or no tax liability who cannot benefit from nonrefundable tax credits. In 2010, legislation was introduced to create a rebate program for energy-efficient technologies, benefiting consumers without sufficient funds for eligible expenditures. The Home Star Energy Retrofit Act proposed a two-tiered rebate program but was not passed by the Senate. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency were first introduced in the late 1970s and allowed to expire in the mid-1980s. The appendix provides technical standards for property to qualify for residential energy-efficiency tax credits in IRC Section 25C and Section 25D. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency were first introduced in the late 1970s and expired in the mid-1980s. The present-day residential energy tax incentives, introduced in 2005, are similar to the earlier incentives. The Energy Tax Act of 1978 introduced the first tax credit for conservation and renewable-energy generation, with a maximum credit value of $2,500. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT05; P.L. 109-58) created new temporary tax credits for residential energy efficiency and renewable-energy property. These credits were in effect for 2006 and 2007, offering incentives for homeowners who made energy-efficiency improvements to their homes. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT05; P.L. 109-58) introduced temporary tax credits for residential energy efficiency improvements in 2006 and 2007. The nonbusiness energy property credit (IRC \u00a725C) allowed taxpayers to claim a 10% credit on qualified expenditures for specific property types, with credit limits ranging from $50 to $300. The maximum credit for windows was $200, with a lifetime cap of $500. These credits were only applicable to improvements made to the taxpayer's primary residence. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT05) introduced temporary tax credits for residential energy efficiency improvements in 2006 and 2007. The nonbusiness energy property credit (IRC \u00a725C) allowed a 10% credit on qualified expenditures for specific property types, with credit limits ranging from $50 to $300. The maximum credit for windows was $200, with a lifetime cap of $500. Another credit established was the residential energy-efficient property credit (IRC \u00a725D) for expenditures on qualified photovoltaic properties, solar water-heating properties, and fuel-cell generators, subject to annual limits. Section 25C expired at the end of 2007. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 introduced temporary tax credits for residential energy efficiency improvements in 2006 and 2007. The nonbusiness energy property credit allowed a 10% credit on qualified expenditures for specific property types, with credit limits ranging from $50 to $300. The maximum credit for windows was $200, with a lifetime cap of $500. Section 25C expired at the end of 2007, but Section 25D was extended for the 2008 tax year. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 reinstated and modified the Section 25C credit for the 2009 tax year, expanding the list of qualified energy property to include biomass fuel stoves and geothermal heat pumps. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 extended the tax credit for qualified energy property to include biomass fuel stoves and geothermal heat pumps for the 2009 tax year. Geothermal heat pumps were moved from Section 25C to Section 25D, with the tax credit extended through 2016. The maximum annual credit limit for solar-electric property expenditures was eliminated, and credits were expanded to include small wind-energy property and geothermal heat pump property. The credit for small wind energy was 30% of expenditures up to a cap, while the credit for geothermal heat pumps was 30% of expenditures up to a $2,000 annual cap. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extended and modified tax credits for small wind-energy and geothermal properties. The Section 25C credit was extended for two years with a 30% credit for energy-efficiency improvements. The credit cap was increased to $1,500 for 2009 and 2010, with specific technology credit amounts eliminated. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extended tax credits for energy-efficiency improvements and energy property, increasing the credit cap to $1,500 for 2009 and 2010. The aggregate cap for windows was also eliminated for those years. The efficiency standards were reduced, expanding the availability of the credit to more products. The Section 25D tax credit was modified, removing maximum credit caps for most technologies. These changes were effective from 2009 through 2016, leading to an increase in the number and total dollar amount of credits being claimed. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extended tax credits for energy-efficiency improvements and energy property, increasing the credit cap to $1,500 for 2009 and 2010. The Section 25D tax credit was modified, removing maximum credit caps for most technologies. These changes were effective from 2009 through 2016. Following the changes made under ARRA, the number and total dollar amount of credits being claimed increased. The 2010 Tax Act extended the Section 25C credit for one year, but the credit structure returned to pre-ARRA levels with reinstated lifetime limits. The credit structure returned to pre-ARRA levels with reinstated lifetime limits. The American Taxpayer Relief Act extended the Section 25C credit for two additional years, and the Tax Increase Prevention Act extended it for one more year. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act also extended the credit. The Tax Increase Prevention Act (TIPA) extended the Section 25C credit for 2012 and 2013, while the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act (PATH Act) extended it for 2014, 2015, and 2016. The PATH Act also introduced more stringent Energy Star 6.0 standards for windows and doors starting in 2016. Additionally, Division P of P.L. 114-113 extended the 25D credit for solar technologies through 2021. The 25D credit for solar technologies was extended through 2021 with modified formulas. The credit will be 30% of expenditures from 2017-2019, 26% in 2020, and 22% in 2021. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 extended the 25C credit for 2017 and the 25D credit for nonsolar technologies through 2021. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 extended the 25C credit for 2017 and the 25D credit for nonsolar technologies through 2021, harmonizing the credit formula for nonsolar technologies with solar technologies. The credit rates for nonsolar technologies are now 30% for property placed in service before the end of 2019, decreasing to 26% in 2020 and 22% in 2021."
