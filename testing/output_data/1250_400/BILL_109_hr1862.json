    "content": "The \"Drug Free Sports Act\" defines the Secretary as the Secretary of Commerce and professional sports associations as specific leagues. Mandatory drug testing for athletes is required under this Act. The Secretary of Commerce must issue regulations within 270 days for professional sports associations to implement random drug testing for athletes using prohibited substances determined by the World Anti-Doping Agency. Athletes must be tested at least once a year without prior notification. The Secretary will issue a list of prohibited substances for athlete testing, determined by the World Anti-Doping Agency. Testing will be done by an independent party, and a positive result will lead to a minimum 2-year suspension from the professional sports association. Penalties for athletes testing positive include a minimum 2-year suspension, permanent suspension for repeat offenders, loss of pay during suspension, and public disclosure of the athlete's name. Athletes have the right to appeal within 5 days of a positive test result. An athlete who tests positive has the right to appeal within 5 days. The professional sports association must hold a hearing and reach a final decision within 30 days. Penalties are stayed pending the appeal process. SEC. 4.
