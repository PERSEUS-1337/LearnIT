    "content": "The \"Caribbean Coral Reef Protection Act\" aims to deny financial resources to Cuba and deter foreign investments that threaten US national security, Florida's marine environment, and the Cuban people. It also excludes certain aliens. The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996 is amended to exclude aliens who contribute to Cuba's development of petroleum resources off its coast. The Secretary of State must deny visas and exclude from the US any alien who invests $1,000,000 or more in enhancing Cuba's ability to develop petroleum resources off its coast. Spouses, minor children, or agents of such individuals are also included. The Secretary may waive this if certified on a case-by-case basis to congressional committees. The Secretary of State can waive the visa denial for individuals investing in Cuba's petroleum resources if it's necessary for medical reasons, litigation, or if specific requirements are met. Definitions for terms like 'agent' and 'investment' are provided in this section. The term 'develop' in relation to petroleum resources involves exploration, extraction, refining, or transportation. 'Investment' refers to activities undertaken through agreements with the Government of Cuba or nongovernmental entities after January 10, 2005, including entering contracts for development or purchasing ownership shares in petroleum projects. The amendment made by this section applies to aliens seeking admission to the United States on or after the enactment date of this Act. It includes various activities related to petroleum resources, such as exploration, extraction, refining, transportation, and investment in development projects. The section imposes sanctions and prohibits the facilitation of the development of Cuba's petroleum resources. If the President determines that a person has made an investment of $1,000,000 or more contributing to Cuba's petroleum development or trafficked in confiscated US property, sanctions will be imposed, including prohibiting loans and guarantees and export licenses by US government. Sanctions may include prohibiting loans, guarantees, export licenses, and financial services to sanctioned persons, including financial institutions. Prohibitions on financial institutions may include preventing designation as a primary dealer in US Government debt instruments and serving as an agent or repository for US Government funds. Sanctions may include prohibiting the US Government from procuring goods or services from a sanctioned person. Sanctions will terminate if the President certifies that certain requirements have been met. It is illegal for US persons to provide assistance that enhances Cuba's ability to develop petroleum resources. The Democratic Solidarity (LIBERTAD) Act of 1996 prohibits US persons from aiding Cuba in developing petroleum resources. The Secretary of State must report investments over $1,000,000 that enhance Cuba's petroleum development capabilities every 180 days. The report to the Senate includes details on investments over $1,000,000 that enhance Cuba's ability to develop petroleum resources, as well as investments linked to trafficking in confiscated US property. It also covers sanctions imposed as a result of these investments. The Secretary of State, in consultation with other agencies, must submit an annual report assessing the environmental impacts of Cuba's petroleum development. This includes information on investments enhancing Cuba's petroleum resources and sanctions imposed due to these investments. The Secretary of State must submit an annual report assessing the environmental impacts of Cuba's petroleum development, using environmental impact statements as a model. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. This section defines key terms used in the Act, including terms related to congressional committees, confiscated property, trafficking, investment, petroleum resources, and the inclusion of foreign subsidiaries under the term \"person\". Additionally, it expands the definition of \"agent\" and \"instrumentality\" to include the Cuban Communist Party."
