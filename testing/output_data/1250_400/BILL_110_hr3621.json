    "content": "The Act titled \"Safety, Accountability, and Funding Efficiency for Transportation Act of 2007\" emphasizes the importance of conducting cost-benefit analysis before procuring transportation services from private contractors to ensure quality and cost-effectiveness. The Act defines key terms such as architectural, engineering, and related services, private contract, government agency, Secretary, and surface transportation project. A governmental entity receiving Federal funds for surface transportation projects is defined as a surface transportation project eligible for assistance under title 23, United States Code. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Transportation. SEC. 4. COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS. For fiscal year 2009 and beyond, Federal funds for surface transportation projects can be used by government agencies for private contracts over $100,000 for architectural, engineering, and related services if a cost-benefit analysis is conducted. The analysis must include a description of services, cost estimates for the contract, and comparison to in-house performance costs. The cost analysis for private contracts over $100,000 for architectural, engineering, and related services includes estimating negotiation, inspection, and supervision costs, as well as comparing performance costs between private contracts and in-house services. It also considers whether the government agency will provide equipment and materials under the private contract. The cost analysis for private contracts over $100,000 for architectural, engineering, and related services includes estimating negotiation, inspection, and supervision costs, as well as estimating the cost of unemployment compensation or other benefits for displaced employees and the cost of resuming performance of the service under the private contract. SEC. 5. DISCLOSURE OF RESULTS OF COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS.\n\nGovernment agencies must disclose cost-benefit analysis results for private contracts deemed in the public interest. Results must be submitted to the Secretary for review, shared with registered individuals or entities, and made publicly available, including online publication.\n\nSEC. 6. COMMENTS. SEC. 6. COMMENTS.\n\nInterested parties can submit written comments refuting the accuracy of cost-benefit analysis results for private contracts. Government agency employees can also submit competitive bids to provide the services under the contract. SEC. 8. SPECIALTY, EMERGENCY, TEMPORARY WORK. The Secretary may waive the application of this Act for private contracts if a government agency cannot perform the work due to emergency, specialty, or intermittent nature, causing underutilization of government employees."
