    "content": "Airline passenger screening in the United States has evolved significantly since the 9/11 attacks, with new technologies like advanced X-ray systems and whole-body scanners, as well as policy changes such as requiring the removal of laptops and liquids from carry-on luggage. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) oversees these changes, mandated by the Aviation Transportation and Security Act (ATSA), which also allows for trusted traveler programs to expedite screening for certain passengers. The TSA has authority to implement trusted traveler programs and use technologies to expedite passenger screening. Congress directed TSA to check all airline passengers against terrorist watchlists. TSA's uniform approach to screening has led to challenges, with a focus on technology for improving capabilities. The TSA's uniform approach to airport screening, primarily focused on technology, has proven problematic due to limitations in technology, budget constraints, and other factors. This has led to challenges in improving screening capabilities and streamlining the process, resulting in sometimes cumbersome procedures for airline passengers. The TSA's uniform approach to airport screening has faced criticism for its limitations in technology and budget constraints. This has led to cumbersome procedures for passengers, causing unpredictable wait times and deterring travelers. The agency has attempted to shift towards a risk-based screening approach, but this has also been met with controversy and skepticism. The TSA has faced criticism for its uniform approach to airport screening, leading to unpredictable wait times and deterring travelers. Shifting towards a risk-based screening approach has been controversial, with differing views on how to assess and mitigate risks. Former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff emphasized the impossibility of perfect security in a free society. In a free society, perfect security is impossible. Security risks can be managed by understanding their nature and characteristics, identifying strategies to mitigate them, and using categorical techniques to quantify threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences in aviation security. Risk in aviation security is managed through categorical techniques and scoring methods to quantify threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences. Passenger screening focuses on detecting threats, while vulnerabilities are addressed through security measures like reinforced cockpit doors and air marshals. Consequences are assessed for their potential severity to determine risk. Consequences in aviation security are primarily mitigated by emergency management and response activities, which are the responsibility of airports, airlines, and emergency management agencies. Establishing an effective risk-based strategy for aviation security involves defining the risk environment and specifying acceptable levels of risk. TSA utilizes risk scoring for air cargo security but has not extensively implemented it for commercial passenger aviation due to its complexity and controversy. The TSA faces challenges in establishing a risk-based strategy for aviation security, particularly in commercial passenger aviation. Risk scoring is extensively used for air cargo security, but not as much for passengers due to complexity and controversy. Passenger risk assessment is mainly done categorically, using biographical data and behavioral indicators. The validity of behavioral-based risk scores is questioned, and there is disagreement on specific risks to mitigate. The TSA faced challenges in establishing a risk-based strategy for aviation security, especially in commercial passenger aviation. There was disagreement on specific risks to mitigate, as seen in the example of TSA's proposal to allow small knives and sports equipment onboard aircraft. Critics argued that risks unrelated to hijacking and terrorism were not adequately considered. Legislation was introduced to prevent TSA from lifting the ban on small knives, leading TSA to abandon its proposal. The TSA faced challenges in establishing a risk-based strategy for aviation security, especially in commercial passenger aviation. Critics argued that risks unrelated to hijacking and terrorism, such as those posed by unruly passengers wielding knives and golf clubs aboard planes, were not adequately considered. Legislation was introduced to prevent TSA from lifting its ban on small knives, leading TSA to abandon its proposal. This shift in approach contrasts with TSA's historical focus on prohibiting certain items and enforcing those prohibitions, as highlighted by former TSA administrator Hawley and Israeli security expert Ron. Former TSA administrator Hawley and Israeli security expert Ron criticize the reliance on prohibited items lists and detection technology in aviation security. They argue that this approach limits the system's ability to respond to evolving threats, as demonstrated by the 9/11 hijackers using box cutters that were not prohibited at the time. Ron emphasizes that detection technology gives terrorists a sense of what to expect, and there has never been a case where a planned terrorist attack was thwarted solely by detecting threat items. They advocate for integrating detection capabilities with other measures to assess threats and minimize vulnerabilities, suggesting a departure from TSA's rigid screening practices towards a more proactive approach. The approach to aviation security is shifting towards integrating detection technologies with other measures to assess threats and minimize vulnerabilities. Advocates of risk-based security point to Israel's successful use of demographic profiling and extensive security interviews to identify high-risk passengers. Despite legal and practical challenges, adopting an Israeli-style approach in the United States is considered problematic. Israel has successfully avoided major terrorist attacks against its airlines and airports for over 40 years. The effectiveness of its methods in deterring such attacks is uncertain. Implementing an Israeli-style approach in the United States is seen as legally and pragmatically challenging. Research suggests that a risk-based approach to passenger screening tailored to the U.S. aviation security framework would be more effective, politically feasible, socially acceptable, and legally defensible. Risk-based screening is part of a multi-layered aviation security strategy, allowing resources to focus on unknown and elevated risks. Risk-based aviation security framework involves a comprehensive, multi-layered approach to screening passengers, focusing resources on unknown and elevated risk individuals. This approach informs security protocols and may impact the deployment of behavioral detection officers and air marshals. Risk-based screening has been utilized since the 1970s to determine which passengers to screen and search. Since the 1970s, risk-based approaches to airline passenger screening have been used, with rudimentary passenger profiles initially used by the FAA. In the late 1980s, basic security questions were required for all passengers to target elevated-risk checked baggage. The security questions used for years as rudimentary screening measures were criticized for being obvious and posed by airline ticket agents with little security training. They aimed to raise passenger awareness of security threats and prevent unwitting individuals from carrying bombs on flights. The questions were eliminated by TSA in 2006, following the implementation of the Computer-Assisted Passenger Pre-Screening (CAPPS) system after the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988. After the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, the Computer-Assisted Passenger Pre-Screening (CAPPS) system was developed to identify potential security threats based on flight reservation data. CAPPS, now overseen by TSA, uses algorithms to flag suspicious behaviors like purchasing one-way tickets or paying with cash. Additionally, a \"no-fly\" list was created by FAA and FBI to deny boarding to known terrorists. However, on 9/11, only 12 names were on the list, none of them the hijackers. Post-9/11, TSA was directed to establish trusted traveler programs and use technology to expedite screening for participants. After the 9/11 attacks, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) directed TSA to establish trusted traveler programs and use technology to expedite screening for participants. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 further directed TSA to ensure that all passengers are evaluated before boarding, with an emphasis on risk-based screening. This approach was recommended by the Department of Transportation Airport Security Rapid Response Team in response to the 9/11 attacks. The Department of Transportation Airport Security Rapid Response Team recommended risk-based screening after 9/11, leading to the development of CAPPS II for passenger vetting and security. This system aimed to integrate identity authentication, watch list checks, and passenger risk assessments. The CAPPS II system aimed to integrate passenger name record checks against watchlists for security screening, but controversy led to its abandonment in 2004. The 9/11 Commission recommended improving watchlists and having TSA, not airlines, conduct screenings. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 mandated TSA to assume responsibility for passenger watchlists. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 mandated TSA to take over passenger watchlist screening from airlines, implementing the Secure Flight program in 2009 for domestic flights and 2010 for international flights. The program screens passenger information against terrorist watchlists, with TSA prohibited from using algorithms to assign risk scores or commercial data for assessing passenger risk. The Secure Flight program, implemented in 2009 for domestic flights and 2010 for international flights, screens passenger biographic information against terrorist watchlists. The TSDB contains fewer than 400,000 names, with about 50,000 identities on the \"no fly\" or \"selectee\" lists. The TIDE repository, with about 875,000 names, serves as a principal source of foreign identities in the TSDB, expanded after the failed bombing attempt on Northwest Flight 253 in 2009. The TSDB has grown to include about 875,000 names, with an expansion attributed to increased reliance after the failed bombing attempt on Northwest Flight 253 in 2009. The TSDB now reportedly contains more than 500,000 identities as of September 2012, with a focus on improving watchlist practices. Secure Flight compares passenger data against watchlists to determine access at airport checkpoints. Secure Flight compares passenger names against watchlists, including the TSDB, CDC lists, and known traveler lists, to determine access at airport checkpoints. Records are destroyed within seven days if no match is found, but potential matches are retained for 7 years. Watchlist matches may be kept for up to 99 years. The Secure Flight program utilizes operational experience from the Advance Passenger Information System (APIS) to collect passenger data for international flights to the United States. CBP cross-checks this data against various databases and terrorist watchlists using the Automated Targeting System-Passenger (ATS-P) for risk assessments on travelers. ATS-P helps CBP determine if an individual should be admitted to the United States based on passenger name record data comparison. The Automated Targeting System (ATS) assists CBP in assessing individuals for admission to the United States by comparing passenger data against terrorist and law enforcement databases. Passenger name record data may be retained for up to 15 years, with depersonalization within six months for EU agreements. Data from Visa Waiver Program countries must be electronically submitted for screening. Passenger name record data is depersonalized within six months and may be retained in an active database for up to five years before being transferred to a dormant database for up to 10 years. Travelers from Visa Waiver Program countries must submit biographical information electronically through the Electronic System for Travel Authorization. This information is checked against various databases for potential threats. Secure Flight uses risk-based analysis from government agencies and airlines data, while the TSA's SPOT program observes passenger behavior at airports to identify potential threats. The TSA's Screening Passengers by Observational Techniques (SPOT) program aims to identify potential threats by observing passenger behavior at airports. Despite costing about $200 million annually and deploying almost 3,000 Behavior Detection Officers at 176 airports by FY2012, the program faces controversy over its scientific validity and operational utility. TSA claims SPOT is based on validated behaviors to detect individuals who may pose a threat to transportation security, drawing on law enforcement techniques and behavioral assessment strategies. The TSA's SPOT program utilizes behavior detection techniques to identify potential threats at airports. While similar to law enforcement methods, SPOT focuses on non-verbal cues and uses a formal scoring system to rate suspicion based on behavioral indicators. This sets SPOT apart from traditional law enforcement practices, which typically focus on specific crimes and extensive interviewing methods. The TSA's SPOT program uses non-verbal cues and a formal scoring system to rate suspicion based on behavioral indicators. Despite TSA's claims of effectiveness, the Government Accountability Office reported instances where known terrorists passed through checkpoints where Behavior Detection Officers were stationed. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported concerns about the TSA's SPOT program, stating that known terrorists had passed through checkpoints where Behavior Detection Officers were stationed. TSA responded by conducting validation studies to show the effectiveness of their behavior detection techniques, but the results have not been publicly released for independent analysis. The TSA's behavior detection techniques were found to be nine times more effective at detecting high-risk travelers than random selection. Despite positive validation study results, doubts have been raised by the GAO and DHS Office of Inspector General about the program's effectiveness. TSA has taken steps to address recommendations for improvement and has partnered with international counterparts to refine the SPOT program. The effectiveness of TSA's behavior detection techniques is questioned due to the lack of evidence supporting their validity and utility. Metrics used to evaluate the program do not directly relate to TSA's mission of deterring terrorism. Individual differences among Behavior Detection Officers in referrals to law enforcement raise concerns about training and operational use of behavioral indicators. Metrics used to support the program's effectiveness are not directly related to aviation security objectives, with significant lapses in records-keeping noted. The DHS Office of Inspector General found significant lapses in records-keeping and incomplete data about the SPOT program presented to TSA's senior leadership. TSA did not consistently offer formal refresher training for behavior detection officers, raising questions about the quality and consistency of training. Despite concerns over the program's efficacy, Congress has not moved to shut down the SPOT program. Questions remain about the quality and consistency of BDO training in the SPOT program, despite concerns over its efficacy. Congress has not taken specific action to eliminate or revamp the program, but has shown more favorable responses to TSA's Pre-Check trusted traveler program, which began in 2011 and has been expanding since then. The Pre-Check program, which started in 2011 and became fully operational in 2012, is available to select frequent flyers and members of trusted traveler programs. It is similar to the former Registered Traveler program, which was discontinued in 2009. Registered Traveler involved background checks and biometric data collection for expedited screening at airports. The Registered Traveler program, launched in 2007, conducted extensive background checks on applicants but was dismantled in 2008. In contrast, the Pre-Check program, started in 2011, resurrected biographic-based background checks and issues a known traveler number for expedited screening at airports. Pre-Check, unlike Registered Traveler, does not issue a biometric credential but provides a known traveler number for expedited screening. However, there are concerns about the reliance on boarding passes for authentication and TSA's ability to verify them, leading to potential security risks in Pre-Check screening lanes. TSA's deployment of authentication technologies has faced delays and challenges. The deployment of authentication technologies for Pre-Check screening has been delayed and faces technical challenges. TSA collects biographic and biometric data from applicants for security threat assessments, including fingerprint-based criminal history checks. Applicants must submit identity verification documentation such as a passport or driver's license. TSA accepts applications from U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals, and legal permanent residents. TSA collects biographic and biometric data from Pre-Check applicants for security threat assessments, including fingerprint-based criminal history checks. Applicants must meet eligibility criteria and pay a processing fee. Approved travelers receive a Known Traveler Number valid for five years. TSA may reject applicants with criminal convictions or based on terrorist watchlist information. Applicants for TSA Pre-Check undergo security threat assessments using biographic and biometric data, including fingerprint-based criminal history checks. A non-refundable $85 processing fee is required. Approved travelers receive a Known Traveler Number valid for five years. Those who are rejected can appeal within 30 days by providing supporting records. TSA has opened enrollment centers nationwide for the application process. TSA Pre-Check enrollment centers are expanding nationwide, with an online application process available. Frequent travelers have shown high satisfaction with the program. However, rapid expansion may limit its benefits. TSA aims to provide expedited screening to half of all airline passengers by FY2015. The TSA Pre-Check program has rapidly expanded to over 100 airports, with a goal of providing expedited screening to half of all airline passengers by FY2015. As the program grows, wait times in Pre-Check lanes may increase, but non-participating travelers could also benefit from shorter lines. Managed inclusion allows for random selection of low-risk individuals for Pre-Check screening. New passenger screening canine teams are being used to detect explosives. The TSA Pre-Check program has expanded to over 100 airports, aiming to provide expedited screening to half of all airline passengers by FY2015. New passenger screening canine teams and behavioral detection officers are used for initial screening. Low-risk individuals may be randomly selected for Pre-Check screening, including military servicemembers. Upon stepping on a mat, passengers are directed to regular or Pre-Check lanes based on random selection. Military servicemembers, including active duty members, reservists, and National Guard members, are allowed to use Pre-Check screening lanes for official and personal travel. Family members under 12 can also use Pre-Check lanes when traveling with cleared military personnel. Civilian employees of the Department of Defense and the Coast Guard will soon be eligible for expedited screening without enrolling in Pre-Check. Pre-Check lanes are also used for uniformed airline crewmembers participating in TSA's Known Crew Member initiative. Military personnel, civilian employees of the Department of Defense, and Coast Guard members will be eligible for expedited screening without enrolling in Pre-Check. Airline crewmembers participating in TSA's Known Crew Member initiative undergo background screening equivalent to Pre-Check applicants. The Known Crew Member database verifies airline crew credentials for expedited screening eligibility. Individuals in specific sub-populations like military personnel, civilian employees with defense clearances, and airline crews undergo extensive background screening for expedited screening eligibility. TSA views them as lower risk compared to the general population and similar to trusted travelers vetted by TSA or CBP. Despite this, random selection for standard screening is still used. This adds an element of unpredictability in line with a risk-based approach. TSA uses random selection for certain sub-populations for standard screening, adding unpredictability in line with a risk-based approach. Various forms of data are collected and retained for risk-based screening programs, including biographic, biometric, and intelligence data. Data retention rules vary, with records matching terrorist or criminal databases kept for longer periods. TSA retains data for risk-based screening programs, deleting unnecessary data. Records of individuals matching terrorist or criminal databases are kept longer, while others are destroyed after travel completion. Data from Pre-Check applications is retained unless updated. Information from commercial databases is used for validation, but not shared with consumer reporting agencies. Personal data may be shared among DHS agencies for counterterrorism efforts and with law enforcement for criminal investigations. Personal data collected under risk-based programs may be shared among DHS agencies for counterterrorism efforts and with law enforcement for criminal investigations. Data may also be shared with intelligence, law enforcement, and judicial agencies at various levels. Data protection is ensured in accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974. Appeals procedures are established for individuals identified as security threats based on records in the TSDB. The DHS established appeals procedures for individuals identified as security threats based on records in the TSDB. The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 required DHS to establish an Office of Appeals and Redress for individuals wrongly identified as threats. The DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (DHS TRIP) allows individuals to file complaints online or by mail to correct erroneous information. The DHS TRIP program allows passengers to file complaints online or by mail for redress. Filers receive a control number to track their inquiry status. If a traveler was delayed due to misidentification, DHS provides steps to resolve the issue. Passengers can appeal DHS decisions, but TSA decisions under the Secure Flight program are exempt from judicial review. TSA sought information in 2013 to expand expedited screening beyond Pre-Check through third-party prescreening of passengers. TSA decisions under the Secure Flight program are largely exempt from judicial review. In 2013, TSA sought to expand expedited screening by using third-party prescreening of passengers, potentially utilizing commercial databases for information. Privacy and data accuracy concerns have been raised regarding this approach. The announcement raises concerns about the future use of large commercial databases for passenger risk assessments, citing issues of data accuracy and privacy. There are worries that non-federal government and private databases may already be used for passenger prescreening, including systems like CBP's ATS and TSA's Transportation Security Enforcement Records System. The article highlights concerns about the use of commercial data in passenger risk assessments by programs like CBP's ATS and TSA's Transportation Security Enforcement Records System. Congress previously restricted the use of commercial data in airline passenger prescreening, but oversight and legislative action may be needed as TSA's risk-based approaches evolve. Congressional oversight and possible legislative action may be necessary as TSA's risk-based approaches to passenger prescreening evolve, especially concerning the use of commercial data. Experts question the effectiveness of risk-based screening as a standalone technique, highlighting the need for a comprehensive security strategy. Congressional review is crucial to ensure the efficiency and data security of TSA's programs. Experts question the effectiveness of TSA's risk-based screening programs and emphasize the need for a comprehensive security strategy that can adapt to evolving threats. Congressional oversight may be necessary to ensure the efficiency and data security of these programs. The effectiveness and evolution of TSA's risk-based screening programs, including the adaptation to shifting threats and incorporation of new methods, are questioned. Details on the adaptability of passenger screening approaches, terrorist watchlists, and behavioral profiling techniques are not publicly disclosed. Congressional oversight may be needed to assess how TSA's risk-based strategy and intelligence practices have adapted to changing threat landscapes and new technologies. The effectiveness of TSA's risk-based screening programs and the selection of appropriate metrics for assessing their effectiveness have raised concerns. The limited number of encounters with individuals tied to terrorism makes defining suitable metrics challenging, especially for behavioral detection programs. TSA's emphasis on efficiency metrics for programs like Pre-Check has been questioned, with a need for metrics that specifically address security effectiveness. The TSA's choice of metrics for behavioral detection programs has been questioned, with concerns over false alarms singling out individuals as potential threats. Efforts to reduce false positives could leave gaps in threat detection capabilities, while high false alarm rates may misdirect screening resources and complicate the lives of individuals mistakenly targeted. Initiatives to reduce false alarms have focused on thorough, accurate, and up-to-date terrorist databases, along with a congressionally mandated redress process. The effectiveness of initiatives to reduce false alarms in aviation passenger pre-screening has not been publicly disclosed. TSA anticipates risk-based security efficiencies will save $120 million and reduce staffing by 1,500 positions in FY2015. Congressional oversight may examine if these gains compromise security. Privacy and data protections are key concerns for Congress. The TSA anticipates security efficiencies saving $120 million and reducing staffing by 1,500 positions in FY2015. Congressional oversight may question if these gains compromise security effectiveness. Privacy and data protections are significant concerns for Congress as DHS implements a risk-based approach to passenger screening. The TSA is implementing security efficiencies to save money and reduce staffing, which may raise concerns about compromising security effectiveness. Congress is also concerned about privacy and data protections as DHS implements a risk-based approach to passenger screening, aiming to strike a balance between privacy and security in the face of ongoing threats to aviation security. The ongoing debate over balancing privacy and security in aviation security policy is crucial, despite extensive security measures post-9/11. The challenge lies in maintaining privacy while effectively combating terrorism through risk-based strategies. This issue is likely to continue being a central concern for aviation security policy and potential congressional oversight."
