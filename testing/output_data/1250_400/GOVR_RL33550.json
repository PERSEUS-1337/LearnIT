    "content": "Countervailing duty laws aim to help domestic industries affected by subsidized imports, imposing additional import duties equal to the estimated subsidy amount. Relief requires proof of material injury to the domestic industry and subsidy of the imports. In a 2007 investigation on Chinese paper imports, the ITA found ways to identify subsidies despite previous reluctance to apply CVD laws to nonmarket economy countries like China. The ITA decided not to apply CVD laws to nonmarket economy countries like China due to difficulties in measuring market distortions caused by subsidies. However, in a 2007 investigation on Chinese paper imports, the ITA found ways to identify subsidies in China as many industries operate based on market principles. China was previously designated as an NME country, but the 2007 subsidy decision was specific to China and not applicable to other NME countries. The ITA is responsible for designating countries as nonmarket economies based on factors like currency convertibility and wage rates. The ITA determines NME countries based on factors like currency convertibility, wage rates, and government control of resources. NME countries do not operate on market principles, affecting the fair value of merchandise sales. ITA-designated NME countries include China, Belarus, and Vietnam. The ITA first decided not to apply CVD laws to NME countries in 1983-1984. The ITA designated NME countries in 1983-1984, including China, due to factors like currency convertibility and government control of resources. This decision impacted countervailing investigations involving carbon steel wire rod from Czechoslovakia and Poland, and potassium chloride from East Germany and the Soviet Union. The U.S. trade deficit with China and concerns about Chinese subsidies led to calls for increased use of trade remedy laws. The 1984 ITA ruling limited recourse for addressing alleged subsidies from China. China's alleged use of \"illegal\" subsidy programs to boost industries and exports has been a concern for U.S. domestic producers. The 1984 ITA ruling limited recourse for addressing these subsidies. China is the main target of U.S. antidumping actions, with over 80 AD duty orders in place. Concerns also exist about China's undervalued currency, which is believed to contribute to the U.S. trade deficit and harm U.S. production and employment in various sectors. The undervalued Chinese currency is believed to contribute to the U.S. trade deficit and harm U.S. production in sectors like apparel and furniture. Congressional interest in countervailing actions against Chinese imports has been renewed due to alleged currency manipulation. The issue of NME classification with China was determined in a 1983 ITA ruling. The ITA ruling in 1983 determined the NME classification for China, which remains in effect unless revoked. Subsidies were not found in NME countries, leading to no countervailing action against China until the CFS paper investigation in 2007. China's NME designation is limited due to WTO provisions allowing alternative methodologies for antidumping and countervailing actions for 15 years after accession. In 2007, China's NME designation may only be used for a limited time, as specified in its WTO accession package. The US and other WTO members can no longer use nonmarket economy methodology for price comparability in CVD or AD investigations after December 11, 2016. The US had two countervailing duty laws in force during the 1983-1984 investigations, both requiring determination of subsidization amount, with one law also requiring a finding of injury to a US industry caused by subsidized imports. The earlier countervailing duty law, Section 303 of the Tariff Act of 1930, required determination of subsidization amount and injury to US industry by subsidized imports. It applied to products of countries not \"under the Agreement\" as defined by GATT Subsidies and Countervailing Code. Repealed in 1995 by the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, it allowed for levying a countervailing duty equal to the net amount of public subsidies. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 implemented countervailing legislation with broader country applicability, adding comprehensive provisions to the Tariff Act of 1930. This law implemented international Subsidies and Countervailing Code provisions agreed upon in GATT meetings. The U.S. law implemented in 1979 incorporated provisions from the international Subsidies and Countervailing Code agreed upon in GATT meetings. It required a determination of subsidy and injury to U.S. industries for countervailing duties. The URAA later amended this law, removing subsidies from private sources as countervailable and adding provisions for countervailing investigations of imports from \"Subsidies Agreement countries.\" The countervailing duty law of the 1979 Act was amended to include provisions similar to section 303, which do not require injury determination in countervailing investigations of subsidized imports from countries other than \"Subsidies Agreement countries.\" Parallel investigations of carbon steel wire rod imports from Czechoslovakia and Poland were initiated based on petitions alleging public benefits in the form of bounties or grants provided in both countries. The petitions for countervailing action alleged that both Czechoslovakia and Poland provided public benefits in the form of bounties or grants to exporters of the product in question. The investigations found similarities in the benefits provided by both countries, with minor differences. The ITA initiated the countervailing procedure for both countries under Section 303 of the 1979 Act. The ITA initiated countervailing procedures for Czechoslovakia and Poland under Section 303 of the 1979 Act, considering them nonmarket economy countries. The ITA found that nonmarket economy countries are not exempted from the countervailing duty law. The ITA found that nonmarket economy countries are not exempted from the countervailing duty law, as seen in the preliminary determinations in the carbon steel wire rod cases. Despite initial hesitation, the ITA decided to include nonmarket economies in its application, focusing on the effects of government intervention and determining if practices confer countervailable benefits. The ITA had its first opportunity to determine if practices by nonmarket economy countries confer countervailable benefits. Prices in nonmarket economies are set by central planners without regard to economic value, leading to different implications for subsidization compared to market economies. The ITA analyzed alleged subsidization programs to determine their impact in both market and nonmarket economy scenarios. The ITA analyzed alleged subsidization programs to determine their impact in both market and nonmarket economy scenarios. The ITA concluded that multiple exchange rates, currency retention schemes, trade conversion coefficients, and price equalization payments do not confer a subsidy in either market or nonmarket economies. The Polish adjustment coefficient program was also found not to constitute a bounty or grant within the meaning of the law. The agency did not have enough information on the Czechoslovak tax exemption program to make a determination. Despite not exempting NME countries from the CVD law, the ITA preliminarily determined that the Czechoslovak and Polish practices did not provide bounties or grants within the meaning of the law. The investigations continued into their final phase, focusing on the application of the CVD law. The ITA continued investigations into alleged practices of Czechoslovak and Polish subsidization programs, determining they did not provide bounties or grants under the CVD law. The ITA focused on the unresolved issue of applying the CVD law to nonmarket economy countries, noting Congress never directly addressed this question. In 1974 and 1979, Congress enacted legislation addressing imports from State-controlled-economy or Communist countries, specifically dealing with antidumping and market disruption. The ITA highlighted the need for special remedial legislation for these countries due to the lack of traditional fair-trade remedies being effective in nonmarket economy countries. Congress recognized the need for special remedial legislation for State-controlled-economy countries due to the ineffectiveness of traditional fair-trade remedies. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 did not address the application of countervailing duty laws to NME countries, but GATT signatories were permitted to regulate imports from NME countries under antidumping or countervailing duty legislation. The difficulty in identifying and quantifying subsidies in NMEs was also noted by various U.S. government and academic sources. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 allowed GATT signatories to regulate imports from NME countries under antidumping or countervailing duty legislation. The difficulty in identifying and quantifying subsidies in NMEs was acknowledged by U.S. government and academic sources. The ITA concluded that a \"bounty or grant\" cannot be found in an NME, and determined that Czechoslovakia and Poland were NMEs. The ITA concluded that Czechoslovakia and Poland were non-market economy countries and did not receive bounties or grants, leading to final negative countervailing duty determinations. Additionally, petitions were filed alleging subsidization of potassium chloride imported from the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union, resulting in investigations being initiated. On March 30, 1984, two U.S. chemical manufacturers filed petitions alleging subsidization of potassium chloride imported from the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union. Investigations were initiated on April 26, 1984, but were later rescinded on June 6, 1984, due to the determination that bounties or grants could not be found in non-market economy countries. The ITA did not initiate any countervailing investigations from NME countries until a petition in 1991 led to an investigation of Ceiling and Oscillating Fans Imported from China. Based on a petition filed on October 1, 1991, the ITA initiated a countervailing duty investigation of Ceiling and Oscillating Fans Imported from China. The petitioner claimed that the Chinese fan industry was market-oriented and could provide reliable data for the investigation. The ITA concluded in its preliminary investigation that several input prices were not fair. The ITA concluded in its final investigation that the Chinese fan industry is not an MOI due to non-market-determined input prices, leading to a final negative determination in the case. The petitioners challenged the ITA's actions in the U.S. Court of International Trade, which consolidated both suits and held a decision on July 30, 1985. The U.S. Court of International Trade challenged the ITA's negative determinations in various cases involving nonmarket economies, stating that countervailing duty law applies to countries with nonmarket economies where governmental subsidies can be found. The court reversed decisions in carbon steel wire rod cases and ordered investigations to resume in potassium chloride cases. The ITA's grounds for nonapplicability of countervailing procedures to NME countries were addressed and overturned by the CIT. The U.S. Court of International Trade challenged the ITA's determination that countervailing duty law does not apply to nonmarket economies. The court disagreed with the ITA's reasons, stating that subsidies can exist in nonmarket economies and that the CVD law applies to any country without exemptions. The U.S. Court of International Trade disagreed with the ITA's interpretation of the countervailing duty law, stating that subsidies can exist in nonmarket economies and that the law applies to any country without exemptions. The court criticized the ITA for attempting to create exemptions for countries with nonmarket economies, which contradicted the plain language of the CVD statute. The U.S. Court of International Trade disagreed with the ITA's interpretation of the countervailing duty law, stating that subsidies can exist in nonmarket economies and that the law applies to any country without exemptions. The court criticized the ITA for attempting to create exemptions for countries with nonmarket economies, which contradicted the plain language of the CVD statute. The difficulties of the CVD law, said the CIT, are not those of its meaning, but rather problems of measurement, which are within the agency's expertise. The court also dismissed the ITA's argument regarding Congress' silence on the applicability of the CVD law to NME countries, pointing out that antidumping law is for specific trade problems other than subsidization. The U.S. Court of International Trade disagreed with the ITA's interpretation of countervailing duty law, stating that subsidies can exist in nonmarket economies. The court criticized the ITA for attempting to create exemptions for countries with nonmarket economies, which contradicted the plain language of the CVD statute. The U.S. government appealed the CIT decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which reviewed the legislative history and development of relevant trade remedy laws. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reviewed the legislative history of trade remedy laws and found that the countervailing duty statute had remained unchanged since 1897. The court could not determine if the statute applied to nonmarket economies due to undefined terms in the law. Congress had not addressed nonmarket economies when the statute was originally enacted. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reviewed the countervailing duty statute, which had remained unchanged since 1897. The court could not determine if the statute applied to nonmarket economies due to undefined terms in the law. Congress had not addressed nonmarket economies when the statute was originally enacted. The court concluded that the economic incentives provided by the Soviet Union and East Germany did not constitute bounties or grants under the applicable CVD law. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reviewed the countervailing duty statute, which had remained unchanged since 1897. The court concluded that the economic incentives provided by the Soviet Union and East Germany did not constitute bounties or grants under the applicable CVD law. The court vacated the CIT order in the wire rod and potash cases and triggered immediate reaction in Congress. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the CIT order in the potash cases and triggered a reaction in Congress. H.R. 3 of the 100th Congress proposed applying countervailing duty law to nonmarket economy countries. Companion bills S. 770 and H.R. 1687 were also introduced during this time. In response to the U.S. Court of Appeals decision, H.R. 3 of the 100th Congress proposed applying countervailing duty law to nonmarket economy countries. Companion bills S. 770 and H.R. 1687 were introduced but not further considered. This issue was revisited in subsequent Congresses. The Agreements Act (P.L. 103-465) extended countervailing duty law to non-market economy (NME) countries, using a surrogate market-economy country method. Identical bills were introduced in multiple Congresses to apply CVD duties to subsidized imports from NME countries. In the 108th and 109th Congress, bills were introduced to apply countervailing duties to subsidized imports from non-market economy (NME) countries. Various bills were proposed with provisions focusing on NME countries, including China, and the application of countervailing action to address trade issues. In the 110th Congress, bills were introduced to address alleged foreign exchange-rate manipulation by China through countervailable subsidies. Several bills sought to apply countervailing duty law to NME countries, including China, with specific provisions to address trade issues. In the 110th Congress, bills were introduced to address foreign exchange-rate manipulation by China through countervailable subsidies. Bills in the 111th Congress aimed to apply countervailing duties to nonmarket economies without considering ownership or economic reforms. The bills introduced in the 111th Congress aim to apply countervailing duties to nonmarket economies without considering ownership or economic reforms. The administering authority is not required to consider the effect of the subsidy in determining its existence. The bills also prevent the ITA from considering market economy treatment for individual businesses in AD proceedings and provide a China-specific alternate methodology for determining subsidy amounts. The bills introduced in the 111th Congress aim to apply countervailing duties to nonmarket economies without considering ownership or economic reforms. They provide a China-specific alternate methodology for determining subsidy amounts, taking into account the possibility that terms and conditions in China may not be applicable as appropriate benchmarks. If China is designated as a nonmarket economy country, authorities are directed to use terms and conditions prevailing outside of China to calculate the amount of subsidy. The bills introduced in the 111th Congress propose applying countervailing duties to nonmarket economies like China. If China is designated as an NME country, terms and conditions prevailing outside of China should be used to calculate subsidies. The bills also outline a process for revoking a country's NME status with approval from Congress. The Bush Administration took steps in 2006 to address China's alleged subsidies, including initiating a CVD investigation and consultations in the WTO. The ITA initiated a CVD investigation on China's alleged subsidies of exports, specifically on coated paper. The investigation found that countervailable subsidies were being provided to producers and exporters of coated paper from China, with preliminary subsidy rates ranging from 10.9% to 20.35%. The ITA announced an affirmative preliminary determination of subsidy in the CVD investigation on coated free sheet (CFS) paper from China. Final subsidy rates ranged from 7.40% to 44.25%. The ITA noted China's significant state role in the economy despite economic reforms. The ITA found that China's economy is significantly different from Soviet-style economies, with market forces determining prices for over 90% of products. The government still plays a role in some areas but has reduced its control over the economy. The ITA found that China's economy is different from Soviet-style economies, with market forces determining prices for over 90% of products. The government still plays a role in some areas but has reduced its control over the economy. The current state of China's economy allows the agency to determine if the Chinese government has provided a benefit to Chinese producers. The ITC announced a negative determination of injury in investigations on CFS paper, citing reasons such as modest production capacity increase in China and Indonesia, lack of potential for product shifting, absence of significant price effects from imports, moderate inventories, and no negative effects on the domestic industry. Based on the evidence of price effects from imports, moderate inventories, and lack of negative impact on the domestic industry, it was concluded that the domestic CFSP industry is not at risk of material injury from imports from China and Indonesia. The investigation was terminated with refunds issued, and although subsidies were measured in China, no countervailing duties were imposed. The ITA determined it could measure subsidies in China, leading to the first CVD order on products from an NME country since 1983. Countervailing duties have been placed on 13 products from China, with 8 investigations pending. China filed suit to prevent the CVD investigation, but the Court ruled it lacked jurisdiction as no final determination had been made. The legality of applying CVD law to NMEs remains unclear. On March 29, 2007, the Court ruled it lacked jurisdiction to hear the case due to no final determination. The legality of applying CVD law to NMEs remains unclear. China requested WTO dispute settlement consultations with the United States on CFS paper duties. China has been active in AD investigations against the US and initiated its first CVD case in 2009. As of March 2010, China had 3 ongoing CVD investigations on US products. In 2009, China initiated its first CVD case against the United States, with 3 ongoing investigations on US products. The United States requested WTO dispute settlement consultations with China over alleged illegal subsidies, leading to the termination of one challenged subsidy program. The US pointed to tax laws and measures used by China to provide tax refunds or exemptions to Chinese businesses, potentially distorting trade conditions for US manufacturers. The USTR accused China of using illegal subsidies, including tax refunds and exemptions, to distort trade conditions for US manufacturers. China agreed to terminate these subsidies by January 1, 2008, as per WTO rules. In the 2010 National Trade Estimate Report, it was confirmed that China had eliminated the subsidies. China signed MOUs with the US and Mexico to eliminate WTO-prohibited subsidies. The USTR confirmed in 2010 that China had removed the subsidies. Despite this, the US requested consultations with China in 2008 regarding certain measures providing incentives to Chinese companies. A settlement was reached in 2009, with China confirming the elimination of challenged export benefits. The ITA identified subsidies in China, prompting Congress to consider legislation to combat unfair trade practices. Congress may want to consider legislation to combat unfair trade practices, ensuring that CVD laws apply to other nonmarket economy countries like Vietnam. There are no significant trade disputes with other NME countries at present. The trade with other nonmarket economy countries is not significant currently, with no outstanding trade disputes. There are no specific methodologies for identifying subsidies in these countries. Countervailing duties may be lower than antidumping duties, which are typically higher for imports from nonmarket economy countries. The use of antidumping duties on imports from nonmarket economy countries tends to be higher, especially with the third-country data methodology. If China's NME status is retained and subsidies are found on targeted merchandise, some antidumping duties may need to be revised to avoid double counting. This could result in a reduction in overall protection for Chinese products, as noted by the Government Accountability Office. A determination by ITA targeting subsidies in China could lead to lower combined rates than expected, potentially reducing overall protection. However, different remedies for price manipulation may allow some U.S. industries to obtain relief through CVD procedures."
