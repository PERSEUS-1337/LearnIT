    "content": "The \"After School Education and Safety Act of 1997\" aims to improve academic and social outcomes for students by providing productive activities during after school hours. Congress recognizes the increased social risks faced by today's youth and the importance of supervised activities during the hours of 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. to prevent violent acts and academic failure. The goals of the Act include increasing academic success, improving students' skills, promoting safe environments, preparing for workforce participation, and providing alternatives to negative activities. The Act defines terms like \"school\" and \"Secretary\" and authorizes a program for grants to schools for specified activities. Each school receiving a grant under this Act must conduct mentoring programs, academic assistance, recreational activities, and technology training after regular school hours. Schools may also offer drug, alcohol, and gang prevention activities, health and nutrition counseling, and job skills preparation. Activities must reflect the specific needs of the population served and take place in designated school or public facilities. Each school receiving a grant under this Act must conduct activities that reflect the specific needs of the population served in designated school or public facilities. Schools are encouraged to collaborate with volunteers, request computer equipment donations, and coordinate with state and local park and recreation agencies to avoid duplication of activities. Each school seeking a grant under this Act must submit an application to the Secretary, outlining how they will meet the goals of the Act, demonstrate collaborative efforts, describe the administration of activities, avoid duplication of services, detail funding sources, and plan for non-Federal funding. Authorization of appropriations is set at $50,000,000 for each fiscal year from 1998 to 2002 to carry out the Act."
