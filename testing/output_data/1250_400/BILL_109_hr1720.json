Congress finds that there are millions of cases of waterborne diseases in the United States each year, caused by inadequately treated sewage filled with harmful bacteria, viruses, and parasites. This leads to various gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses, with millions of Americans getting sick annually from swimming in contaminated waters. The economic impact of swimming-related illnesses is significant, with annual losses estimated at billions of dollars. Many sewer systems lack routine monitoring to detect contamination. The economic impact of swimming-related illnesses is significant, with annual losses estimated at billions of dollars. Better monitoring, reporting, and public notification of sewer overflows could prevent millions of Americans from getting sick every year. Public health authorities are not routinely informed of sewer overflows that pose a threat to public health. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to define \"sanitary sewer overflow\" as an overflow of wastewater from a sanitary sewer system. This definition excludes combined sewer overflows and wastewater backups caused by blockages in privately owned building laterals. Monitoring, reporting, and public notification of sewer overflows are addressed in the act. Section 402 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to require publicly owned treatment works to implement a system for timely detection and notification of sanitary sewer overflows that may impact human health. Public notification must occur within 24 hours of becoming aware of the overflow, and relevant authorities must be notified immediately. Publicly owned treatment works must notify the public and relevant authorities within 24 hours of becoming aware of a sanitary sewer overflow that may endanger human health. Additionally, they must provide reports to the Administrator or State within 5 days of the overflow. Publicly owned treatment works must report sanitary sewer overflows within 5 days, detailing the cause, actions taken, and mitigation measures. They must also include all overflows in monthly discharge reports and report the total number of overflows annually. Publicly owned treatment works must report sanitary sewer overflows within 5 days, detailing the cause, actions taken, and mitigation measures.
