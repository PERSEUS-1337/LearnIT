Congress finds that there is a need for 2,000,000 new teachers in the next decade, especially in rural and high-poverty schools. Rural education is crucial in 25 states, and high poverty schools struggle to retain certified teachers. The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards was established in 1987. High poverty schools face challenges in retaining certified teachers, with twice the likelihood of not having teachers certified in their fields compared to other schools. The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, established in 1987, aims to set high standards for accomplished teachers through a rigorous certification process. Over 16,000 teachers nationwide have completed this certification, which has been shown to benefit teachers in the Accomplished Teaching Validation Study. Recent data from the Accomplished Teaching Validation Study shows that teachers certified by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards outperform their peers on key teaching measures. Teacher salaries have stagnated over the past decade, with many states falling below the national average. The Act aims to incentivize teachers to work in high-poverty schools and provide tax credits for those who achieve National Board certification.
