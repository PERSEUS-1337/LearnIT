    "content": "Human history began in Africa, with human ancestors evolving into homosapiens around 200,000 years ago. Small bands of modern humans migrated out of Africa 50,000 to 100,000 years ago, becoming ancestors of all human populations. The Bantu people of West Africa expanded their settlement around 2,500-5,000 years ago, becoming the predominant group in sub-Saharan Africa. Nilo-Saharan languages are found in the Sahel grasslands and eastern Africa, with origins possibly in the Nile valley. The Nilo-Saharan languages may have originated in the Nile valley, but the term \"Nilotic\" is no longer favored due to intermingling with Bantu speakers. Bantu agriculture was not suitable for extreme southern Africa, which continued to be inhabited by the Khoisan people. By 500 BC, the Bantu had mastered iron smelting, leading to successful agriculture and expansion. African farmers were growing a variety of crops, including bananas from contacts with the Indian Ocean region. After 1450 AD, African farmers grew a variety of crops, including grains and bananas from contacts with the Indian Ocean region. They also had cattle, but the tsetse fly limited cattle farming in the central part of the continent. With the discovery of America, they adopted New World crops like maize and peanuts. By 1500, an estimated 47 million Africans lived in farming communities across the continent. In drier regions like Kenya's Rift Valley, some lived pastoral lives, exchanging livestock for grains. Large towns and cities did not develop due to disease-causing organisms unique to Africa. Outside Africa, populations were less affected by these diseases, allowing for easier city development. Loyalties to large ethnic groups were common among Africans. Large settlements in Africa were not developed due to diseases unique to the region, allowing for easier city development outside Africa. Loyalties to large ethnic groups were largely absent in pre-colonial Africa, with loyalties embedded in extended families and clans instead. Powerful individuals or chiefs, known as \"big men,\" exerted influence through marriage ties and control over trade routes. African loyalties were embedded in extended families, clans, and patron-client relationships. Powerful chiefs consolidated authority through conquest and alliance, leading to the development of African kingdoms. Great artistic achievements characterized these kingdoms, such as naturalistic bronze castings in Benin and Congolese masks that inspired modern artists. The Atlantic slave trade began in 1441, lasting 400 years and resulting in the capture of 10-13 million people from Africa. The Atlantic slave trade started in 1441 in Africa, lasting 400 years and capturing 10-13 million people. Most were taken to Brazil and the Caribbean, with some sent to the United States. The peak occurred in the 18th century, with annual totals reaching 100,000. The British parliament ended the trade in 1807, intercepting over 1,600 ships and freeing 160,000 captives. The British parliament voted to end the Indian Ocean slave trade in 1807. Over the next 60 years, the Royal Navy intercepted more than 1,600 ships and freed over 160,000 captives. Despite efforts to stop the trade, many ships evaded patrols, and slavery continued until its abolition in the Americas in the 1850s and 1860s. European traders conducted the Atlantic slave trade by purchasing slaves from African owners using various goods. Slavery had been a longstanding practice in Africa, where people were enslaved during wars or as punishment. The Atlantic slave trade involved the exchange of goods for slaves in Africa. Slavery was a common practice in Africa, where captives were often absorbed into families or local armies. The trade led to turmoil and warfare in West Africa, fueled by the exchange of guns for slaves. The impact of the slave trade on African societies is debated by scholars. The slave trade in Africa fueled turmoil and war in West Africa, weakening the continent and making it vulnerable to European colonization. Indigenous political entities were expected to consolidate and develop into nation-states, like the kingdom of Ashanti in West Africa and Buganda in East Africa. In West Africa, the kingdom of Ashanti had a strong central government, advanced roads, defined boundaries, and a national language, profiting from gold and the slave trade. Buganda in East Africa was a naval power on Lake Victoria with a powerful king, a strong army, and growing trade. Secondary empires, relying on European military technology, were emerging in Muslim societies, promoting Islam's spread in sub-Saharan Africa through jihads in the nineteenth century. In the nineteenth century, West Africa saw the rise of a vast Islamic empire centered on Sokoto, Nigeria, through holy wars or jihads. In East Africa, the sultans of Zanzibar extended their power on the mainland, while Egypt expanded its control in northeastern Africa. The Boers, practicing a conservative form of Christianity, established a secondary empire in southern Africa by trekking deep into the African interior to escape British cultural influences. The Boers, descended from Dutch, Huguenot, and German settlers, trekked into the African interior to escape British influence. They defeated the Zulu with modern tactics and established farms in depopulated areas. The European scramble for Africa halted indigenous political development, with all of sub-Saharan Africa under European control by 1920, except for Ethiopia and Liberia. Ethiopia resisted Italian colonization, defeating them at Adowa in 1896. The European scramble for Africa concluded in 1920, with British forces using combat airplanes to end resistance in Somalia. Sub-Saharan Africa, except for Ethiopia and Liberia, was under European control. Ethiopia defeated Italian troops at Adowa in 1896 but was unable to oust them from Eritrea. Advances in medicine and military technology gave Europeans advantages, such as machine guns and modern artillery. In 1935, Italy invaded Ethiopia again, but was driven out by British troops in 1941-1942. Europe's military advantages, including machine guns and modern artillery, gave them a significant edge over African forces. Despite some resistance from African groups like the Ashanti and Zulu, many Africans chose not to resist colonial invasion. European leaders faced initial reluctance to seize African territory due to doubts about financial gains balancing the costs, but imperialists and nationalists pushed for expansion. Anti-slavery activists and missionaries also saw benefits in direct rule for ending slavery and advancing their efforts. Business interests sought to exploit Africa's resources. Business interests, anti-slavery activists, nationalists, and imperialists pushed for African expansion. Diamonds and gold discoveries in southern Africa fueled colonial interests. European powers valued Africa's resources for agriculture and raw materials. King Leopold II of Belgium hid his profit motives behind humanitarian concerns while building a vast empire with the help of explorer Henry M. Stanley. King Leopold II of Belgium successfully hid his profit motives behind humanitarian concerns while building a vast empire in the Congo through funding exploration and persuading local chiefs to sign treaties. He gained recognition for his International Association of the Congo at the Berlin West Africa Conference in 1884-1885, with support from Britain, Germany, and even the U.S. President Chester Arthur. The conference set rules for future African colonization, requiring effective control before claiming territory. The Berlin Conference established rules for acquiring colonies in Africa, limiting colonization to major powers like Britain, France, and Germany. Portugal also gained territories in Angola and Mozambique. By the First World War, Britain emerged as the dominant power in Africa, with colonies stretching from southern Africa to Egypt. France held territories in West and Central Africa, while the United States assisted in settling former slaves on the West African coast in 1820. The United States assisted the American Colonization Society in settling former slaves on the West African coast in 1820. The settlers declared independence in 1847 and used firearms to conquer indigenous peoples, leading to societal disintegration in the late twentieth century. In 1980, indigenous soldiers killed the Americo-Liberian president, sparking a decade of political violence and a 6-year civil war. The effects of colonial rule in Africa, particularly in Congo under Leopold's control, were marked by widespread human rights abuses such as forced labor, beatings, mutilations, and starvation as a policy tool. The situation in Congo became an international scandal, leading to reforms and the removal of the colony from Leopold's personal control in 1908. In contrast, British and French-controlled territories saw infrastructure development during the colonial era. European colonial rule in Africa, particularly in Congo under Leopold's control, led to widespread human rights abuses. The situation in Congo became an international scandal, prompting reforms and the removal of the colony from Leopold's control in 1908. In British and French-controlled territories, infrastructure development occurred during the colonial era. Christian missions played a significant role in promoting education and literacy, leading to the empowerment of some Africans who later became leaders in independent Africa. European investment in Africa also had a significant impact. European colonial rule in Africa led to human rights abuses, particularly in Congo under Leopold's control. Infrastructure development occurred in British and French territories. Christian missions promoted education, empowering future African leaders like Kenya's Jomo Kenyatta and Ghana's Kwame Nkrumah. Colonial economic policies created dependency on primary product exports, hindering market economies post-independence. Colonial economic policies in Africa created dependency on primary product exports, hindering market economies post-independence. Colonial governments did not promote democracy, leading to authoritarian control and limited political participation for Africans. Pressure for political rights and independence after World War II resulted in imprisonment of critics by colonial regimes. Cooperation with traditional authorities was essential for colonial rulers. During the colonial period, Africans had limited political participation, with elections only held towards the end. Colonial authorities worked closely with local chiefs and big men to obtain labor and tax revenues. This cooperation with traditional authorities contributed to corruption, nepotism, and authoritarianism in independent Africa. Colonial practices also intensified ethnic divisions by emphasizing language and cultural differences among African peoples. Europeans viewed the world in terms of \"tribes\" and \"nations,\" shaping Africa's present-day ethnic divisions. The colonial era intensified ethnic divisions among African peoples by grouping them into tribes and nations, ruling indirectly through tribal chiefs. This led to the strengthening of tribal loyalties, which continues to fuel violent politics in Africa today. The artificial boundary divisions imposed during colonial partition separated linked cultures and hindered economic development. The colonial partition of Africa imposed artificial boundaries, weakened political institutions, and hindered economic development. The end of colonialism after World War II further destabilized the region, leading to the unknown consequences of denying pre-colonial political entities the opportunity to develop. After World War II, the end of colonialism in Africa was hastened as Britain and France were weakened. The war aims emphasized democracy and resistance to aggression, resonating with Africa's nationalists. The United Nations Charter committed colonial powers to developing self-government in their territories. Educated Africans returned and organized opposition to colonial regimes, influenced by European intellectual currents and many becoming socialists. After World War II, African nationalists organized opposition to colonial regimes, influenced by European intellectual currents and many becoming socialists. British policymakers recognized that African colonies would eventually be independent, while France pursued a policy of assimilation for its colonies. Individual Africans could become French citizens after achieving a certain standard of French education. In the 1950s, African nationalist sentiments were mounting, leading to independence movements in British and French colonies. Ghana, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Kenya gained independence in the early 1960s. Guinea shocked France by voting for independence in 1958 instead of close association. In 1960, 14 independent countries emerged from French-held Africa, followed by the Belgian Congo gaining independence in the same year. In southern Africa, independence was delayed due to substantial white populations opposing majority rule, leading to armed struggles for freedom. Rhodesia's white minority declared independence from Britain in 1965, resulting in UN sanctions. In southern Africa, armed struggles for freedom against white minority rule led to independence movements in Rhodesia, Angola, Mozambique, and Namibia. Zimbabwe gained independence in 1980 after a civil war, while Angola and Mozambique achieved independence in 1975 following Portuguese colonial rule. Namibia gained independence in 1990 after a U.N.-supervised election. Opposition to white minority rule in South Africa had existed for decades, with the National Party (NP) representing the white population since 1948. In South Africa, white minority rule under apartheid was imposed by the National Party in 1948. Protests escalated in the late 1960s, leading to violent resistance in the 1970s. The government responded with harsh repression. By the 1980s, international pressure and internal dissent forced the regime to engage in secret talks with the African National Congress (ANC) to end apartheid. In the late 1980s, South Africa's white-controlled government faced international isolation and engaged in secret discussions with the ANC to end apartheid. Nelson Mandela was freed in 1990, leading to constitutional negotiations and universal-suffrage elections in 1994. In the early 1960s, Africa saw a promising future with new leadership and economic growth expectations. In the early 1960s, a new African elite with global experience came to power, leading to expectations of economic growth through infrastructure projects. The Organization of African Unity was established in 1963 to promote solidarity among African states. However, challenges such as civil wars, secession attempts, and political instability emerged in countries like the former Belgian Congo, Togo, Ghana, and Nigeria. In the 1960s, African countries faced political instability and civil wars. The secession attempt in Katanga province, the assassination of Togo's president, and coups in Ghana and Nigeria led to ethnic tensions and a civil war in Nigeria. Economic growth declined in Sub-Saharan Africa, with authoritarian regimes in power and violent conflicts in countries like Uganda, Ethiopia, Sudan, Somalia, and Chad. Drought in the 1980s worsened the situation, particularly in war-torn countries like Ethiopia and Sudan. In the post-independence era, civil wars erupted in various African countries, exacerbated by drought in the 1980s. The impact of colonialism, population growth, and the Cold War are also cited as contributing factors to Africa's challenges. Independent Africa faced challenges with a rapidly growing population, reaching 600 million by 1990 from 200 million in 1950. The Cold War escalated conflicts in Africa, with arms from the Soviet Union fueling Marxist regimes in countries like Ethiopia, Angola, and Mozambique. The United States also provided weapons to anti-Soviet authoritarian regimes, leading to criticism of strengthening undemocratic governments with corrupt practices. France's involvement in Africa is debated for its impact on the continent's problems. France's active engagement in Africa aimed to maintain great power status by cultivating special relationships with former colonies, providing military and economic assistance, and intervening to protect friendly regimes. Critics argued that French policy perpetuated corrupt and authoritarian regimes in Africa. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, scholars focused on African state and society characteristics to explain the continent's challenges. Some concluded that weak African states hindered societal change and economic development due to corruption. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, scholars analyzed African states and societies to understand the continent's difficulties. Weak states, corruption, and economic challenges were highlighted, leading to discussions on the concept of the \"failed state\" in Africa. Despite some positive developments in the early 1990s, such as the end of the Cold War, economic growth remained below the population growth rate. In the mid-1990s, despite slow overall GDP growth in Africa, some countries were experiencing GDP growth rates exceeding population growth rates, with some achieving annual increases of 5% or better. Positive developments in South Africa and economic reforms in several African countries were seen as hopeful signs for the region's future. Political reforms were also beginning in authoritarian states due to demands for democratization. In the mid-1990s, some African countries were experiencing GDP growth rates exceeding population growth rates, with annual increases of 5% or better. Political reforms were beginning in authoritarian states due to demands for democratization, leading to the representation of diverse interests in civil society. Analysts noted positive developments, but hopes from the early 1990s have since faded. In the 1990s, hopes for African democratization have faded as authoritarian leaders manipulate the electoral process to create \"pseudo-democracies.\" Richard Joseph noted that Africa's democratic opening resulted in \"virtual democracies\" with surface characteristics of liberal democracy but stifled opposition behind a mask of legitimacy. Events in Zimbabwe and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire in the late 1990s and early 2000s were discouraging for advocates of democratization in Africa. In C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, a military coup and exclusion of a qualified candidate led to ethnic and religious divisions. In Zimbabwe, political violence marred elections and government tactics against white-owned farms raised concerns about the rule of law. Additionally, the AIDS epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa continued to worsen. In June 2000, opposition gains in parliamentary elections in Zimbabwe were overshadowed by political violence and deaths of opposition members. The government's controversial tactics to take over white-owned farms raised concerns about the rule of law. Sub-Saharan Africa's AIDS epidemic is intensifying, with over 25.3 million infected individuals in the region. Uganda and Senegal have seen success in prevention campaigns, but overall infection rates in Africa remain high, with some countries having over 20% of the adult population HIV-positive. The epidemic has already claimed an estimated 17 million lives in Africa. The overall infection rate in Africa is about 8.8%, with some countries having over 20% of the adult population HIV-positive. An estimated 17 million people have died in the African epidemic, and armed conflicts in countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo are creating serious refugee problems. Africa's economic performance has been disappointing, with GDP growth lower than population growth. Africa's economic performance continues to disappoint observers, with GDP growth lower than population growth. South Africa's economy grew slowly, hindering its ability to spark economic expansion in the region. Academic authors describe sub-Saharan Africa as marginalized in the global economy. \"Afro-pessimists\" predict dim political and economic prospects for the continent. The U.S. National Intelligence Council predicts that poor governance and demographics will lead to Africa's increasing international marginalization by 2015. The U.S. National Intelligence Council predicts that poor governance and demographics will lead to Africa's increasing international marginalization by 2015. Some observers reject this Afro-pessimism, attributing it to stereotyped views and media sensationalism. Many observers reject Afro-pessimism, arguing that it stems from stereotyped views and media sensationalism. Experts highlight progress in Africa, with governments becoming more accountable, economic policies empowering the private sector, and efforts to address challenging issues. The International Monetary Fund acknowledges past economic stagnation but sees potential for an economic renaissance in sub-Saharan Africa. President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa and former U.S. Ambassador James Joseph have endorsed the concept of an African Renaissance. The seeds of an economic renaissance in sub-Saharan Africa have been sown as a result of economic policy reforms. President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa and former U.S. Ambassador James Joseph have endorsed the concept of an African Renaissance, highlighting democratic transitions in countries like South Africa and Nigeria. Nigeria's transition to civilian rule in 1999 marked a significant milestone in the region's democratization process. In the optimistic school, national elections were held in many African countries in the late 1990s, leading to the establishment of democratic precedents. Despite economic disappointments, some countries like Botswana, Mozambique, Rwanda, and Uganda showed promising GDP growth rates. Optimists believe that with economic reforms and international support, more African nations can improve their economies and living standards. GDP growth rates in Africa were above 5% in 2000, following similar performances in 1999. Optimists believe that with economic reforms, improved governance, and international support, many countries could increase per capita incomes and enhance quality of life. Debt relief and support for poverty reduction programs are seen as crucial. Africa's natural resources, including oil deposits and minerals, are seen as promising for a brighter future. The Clinton Administration had an optimistic view towards Africa, with President Clinton emphasizing democracy, peace, and prosperity during his visit in 1998. During his visits to Africa in 1998 and 2000, President Clinton emphasized democracy, peace, and prosperity in the region. He praised Nigeria for its progress in democratization and cooperation with the United States. The Clinton Administration also highlighted the importance of combating the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa. During his visits to Africa in 1998 and 2000, President Clinton praised Nigeria for its progress in democratization and cooperation with the United States. The Clinton Administration emphasized combating the African HIV/AIDS epidemic and highlighted Africa's potential as a U.S. trading partner, especially in oil imports. They also endorsed the African Growth and Opportunity Act to further U.S. interests in Africa. The Clinton Administration passed the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act in 1998 and 2000. They focused on combating HIV/AIDS, promoting trade with Africa, and launching initiatives to address various issues in the region. The Administration's efforts involved multiple U.S. agencies and boosted their capabilities in Africa. The Clinton Administration's initiatives in Africa involved various U.S. agencies, including the Department of State, U.S. Agency for International Development, Departments of Transportation, Labor, and Commerce, and the Centers for Disease Control. Despite facing challenges, such as the Somalia and Rwanda incidents, the Administration aimed to strengthen Africa's peacekeeping capabilities through the Africa Crisis Response Initiative (ACRI) and a \"train and equip\" program for Nigerian forces. The Clinton Administration sought to enhance Africa's peacekeeping abilities through the Africa Crisis Response Initiative (ACRI) and a \"train and equip\" program for Nigerian forces. Despite some successes, ongoing conflicts in Africa frustrated policymakers and hindered efforts for economic growth and political reform. Trade results during the Clinton years showed mixed outcomes, with slower growth in U.S. imports from Africa compared to overall imports. During the Clinton years, U.S. trade with Africa had mixed results. Imports from Africa grew at a slower rate compared to overall imports, with most trade focused on a few countries, particularly oil producers and South Africa. African imports and exports accounted for about 1% of U.S. totals in 1999, with U.S. investment in the sub-Saharan region heavily concentrated in the petroleum sector. Despite this, U.S. firms made significant investments in Africa, such as Southwestern Bell's acquisition in the South African telecommunications industry and Caterpillar Inc. dealerships in 15 countries. Sub-Saharan Africa became a priority in foreign policy in 1958 under President Eisenhower. Officials highlighted major U.S. investments in Africa, including Southwestern Bell's share in the South African telecommunications industry and Caterpillar Inc. dealerships in 15 countries. Sub-Saharan Africa was prioritized in foreign policy in 1958 by President Eisenhower. Controversies over Africa policy have revolved around issues like apartheid, African development, and Soviet/Cuban involvement. Eisenhower's Administration faced the Congo rebellion in 1960, supported a U.N. peacekeeping force, and dealt with Soviet opposition. The Kennedy Administration (1961-1963) had a more favorable stance towards Africa. During the Kennedy Administration, the United States supported African nationalists and approved funding for a controversial dam in Ghana. President Kennedy also began pressing for reforms in white regimes in southern Africa. The Johnson Administration focused on Congo (Zaire), providing covert aid to suppress rebellions believed to be communist-inspired. Mobutu Sese-Seko solidified his position as Zaire's president with U.S. backing during this time. During the Johnson Administration, the US provided covert aid to suppress communist-inspired rebellions in Congo (Zaire), backing Mobutu Sese-Seko as president. The focus then shifted to southern Africa during the Nixon and Ford Administrations, with political controversy arising over US support for white minority regimes. Henry Kissinger believed the Soviet Union was pursuing aggressive policies in Africa, shaping US Africa policy during this period. During the Carter Administration (1977-1981), US foreign policy in Africa shifted towards a focus on human rights, advocating for majority rule in Zimbabwe, independence for Namibia, and criticizing apartheid in South Africa. Despite pressure for reforms in Zaire, Cold War considerations continued to constrain Africa policy. The Administration did not intervene in the Liberia coup of 1980, facing challenges from apparent Soviet and Cuban gains in sub-Saharan Africa and domestic political pressure. During the Carter Administration, US foreign policy in Africa was influenced by Cold War concerns. The Administration did not react to the Liberian coup in 1980 due to reports of human rights violations and corruption discrediting the regime. The US forged ties with Somalia in response to an oppressive, pro-Soviet regime in Ethiopia, which led to the 1977-1978 \"Ogaden War\" when Somalia invaded a disputed province. Cold War tensions also influenced the Administration's opposition to mandatory sanctions against South Africa and the presence of Cuban troops in Angola supporting the Marxist regime. During the Reagan Administration, there was a major concern about Cuban troops in Angola assisting the Marxist regime. The Administration supported covert aid to UNITA and negotiated a regional peace agreement in 1988 to secure Cuban withdrawal from Angola in exchange for Namibia's independence. Critics believed the US was not pushing hard enough for political change in South Africa. During the George H.W. Bush Administration, policymakers focused on the Horn of Africa. In Ethiopia, rebel forces were on the brink of overthrowing the regime in 1991, leading to a peaceful transition with the help of Bush Administration diplomats. However, Somalia faced clan violence, drought, and famine, resulting in a humanitarian disaster by 1992. As a response, Bush sent US troops for a massive humanitarian intervention, credited with saving thousands from starvation. During the George H.W. Bush Administration, a humanitarian intervention was launched in Somalia to address clan violence, drought, and famine, saving thousands from starvation despite the loss of American lives in 1993. Additionally, the administration promoted democracy and economic liberalization in Africa, leading to the passing of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) in 2000 to boost U.S. trade and investment with Africa. Congress also authorized $300 million for HIV/AIDS efforts worldwide in FY2001 and FY2002 under the Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act of 2000. In 1990, Congress created the Development Fund for Africa (DFA) to protect Africa aid levels. In 1993, the South African Democratic Transition Support Act committed the U.S. to supporting democracy in South Africa. In 1994, the African Conflict Resolution Act was enacted to promote peaceful resolution of African conflicts. In 1998, the Africa: Seeds of Hope Act aimed to enhance African food security. In 2000, the Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act authorized $300 million for HIV/AIDS efforts worldwide. The African Democratic Transition Support Act of 1993 (P.L. 103-149) committed the United States to supporting democracy in South Africa. In 1992, the Horn of Africa Recovery and Food Security Act (P.L. 103-274) set policy objectives for U.S. assistance in the Horn region. In 1986, the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act (P.L. 99-440) imposed sanctions on South Africa. In 1985, Congress passed an emergency appropriation for African famine relief (P.L. 99-10) following media coverage of famine in Ethiopia and Sudan. In 1985, Congress passed an emergency appropriation for African famine relief (P.L. 99-10) following media coverage of famine in Ethiopia and Sudan. The International Security and Development Cooperation Act of 1985 repealed the Clark Amendment, which prohibited aid for military operations in Angola. The Clark Amendment prohibited aid for military operations in Angola, but it was repealed in 1985 by the International Security and Development Cooperation Act. The Byrd Amendment partially exempted the US from participating in UN sanctions against Rhodesia. The curr_chunk provides a list of books and resources related to Africa and U.S. foreign policy towards the continent. The curr_chunk lists various CRS Issue Briefs on Africa, including topics such as U.S. foreign assistance, AIDS, Congo, Nigeria's political transition, and Sudan's humanitarian crisis and U.S. policy."
