    "content": "The \"Keep Student Loans Affordable Act of 2013\" extends the interest rate deadline to July 1, 2014. It also includes modifications to required distribution rules for pension plans. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to require distribution of an employee's interest within 5 years of their death, with exceptions for eligible designated beneficiaries. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 requires distribution of an employee's interest within 5 years of their death, with exceptions for eligible designated beneficiaries who can receive distributions over their life expectancy starting within 1 year of the employee's death. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 mandates distribution of an employee's interest within 5 years of their death, except for eligible designated beneficiaries who can start receiving distributions within 1 year as per regulations. If the beneficiary is the surviving spouse, distributions must begin no earlier than the date specified. The surviving spouse of the employee must begin distributions no earlier than the date the employee would have turned 70 1/2. If the surviving spouse dies before receiving distributions, the rules apply as if the spouse were the employee. If an eligible designated beneficiary dies before the employee's interest is fully distributed, specific rules apply to the remaining beneficiaries. The rules for distributing an employee's interest to beneficiaries are outlined, including the definition of an eligible designated beneficiary as an individual designated by the employee. If the designated beneficiary dies before distribution is complete, specific rules apply to the remaining portion. The term 'designated beneficiary' refers to an individual chosen by the employee, while an 'eligible designated beneficiary' includes the surviving spouse, minor child, disabled individual, or chronically ill person of the employee. The eligible designated beneficiary can be the surviving spouse, minor child, disabled individual, chronically ill person, or an individual not more than 10 years younger than the employee. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 specifies rules for eligible designated beneficiaries, including surviving spouses, minor children, disabled individuals, chronically ill persons, and individuals not more than 10 years younger than the employee. There is a special rule for children who cease to be eligible designated beneficiaries upon reaching majority age. Additionally, employees becoming 5-percent owners have a required beginning date for distributions. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 specifies rules for eligible designated beneficiaries, including surviving spouses, minor children, disabled individuals, and chronically ill persons. Employees becoming 5-percent owners have a required beginning date for distributions after age 70 1/2.

Employees who become 5-percent owners have a required beginning date for distributions after age 70 1/2. Amendments made by this section apply to employees who die after December 31, 2013. Employees who become 5-percent owners before January 1, 2013, and have not retired before 2014, are treated as such for plan year ending in 2013. Exceptions apply for beneficiaries and existing annuity contracts. The amendments made by this section do not apply to existing qualified annuity contracts that were in effect before the enactment of this Act and continue thereafter. A qualified annuity refers to a commercial annuity or one payable by a defined benefit plan, with substantially equal periodic payments over the annuitants' lives. The section 401(a)(9) of the Code outlines requirements for qualified annuity contracts, including payments over the annuitants' lives and meeting specific regulations.
