    "content": "Ammonium perchlorate is a key ingredient in solid fuel for rockets and missiles, with uncertainty surrounding its health effects slowing efforts to establish cleanup standards. Perchlorate has been detected in water in at least 33 states, leading to states setting their own standards ranging from 1 ppb to 51 ppb. Concern has escalated due to perchlorate's persistence in water and its impact on thyroid function, especially near military facilities and disposal sites. Perchlorate contamination has been found in water in at least 33 states, with levels ranging from 1 ppb to 51 ppb. It is heavily used by the Department of Defense (DOD) and its contractors, with contamination near weapons and rocket fuel manufacturing facilities, military bases, and other sources. Perchlorate can also occur naturally, in organic fertilizer, and as a breakdown product of other substances. It has been detected primarily in the Southwest and in scattered locations across the country, with groundwater being the most affected. EPA required monitoring for perchlorate in public water systems in 1999 to determine its presence nationwide. Perchlorate contamination has been found in ground water, including large aquifers in California. In 1999, EPA mandated monitoring for perchlorate in public water systems to determine its presence nationwide. Of 3,865 systems tested, 4.1% had perchlorate levels greater than 4 \u00b5g/L, with 14 systems exceeding EPA's remediation goal. California has detected perchlorate in 241 drinking water sources since 2002. EPA reported contamination at 65 DOD sites in 2005. Perchlorate contamination has been detected in various sources of drinking water and food. In California, 241 drinking water sources have tested positive for perchlorate since 2002. EPA reported contamination at 65 DOD sites in 2005. The FDA found perchlorate in 90% of lettuce samples and 101 of 104 bottled milk samples in 2004. The FDA found perchlorate in vegetables, milk, and bottled water samples. Perchlorate was detected in 50% of samples in the Total Diet Study, with higher levels in some foods like shrimp, tomatoes, spinach, and bacon. Children aged 2 years old had the highest perchlorate intake. Perchlorate is not known to cause cancer but can disrupt iodine uptake in the thyroid, which is relevant to EPA's standard-setting efforts. Perchlorate, found in food, can disrupt iodine uptake in the thyroid, affecting thyroid function in pregnant women and leading to delayed development in infants. Studies show effects on thyroid hormone levels in women with iodine deficiency. EPA considers non-water exposures when setting standards for contaminants. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that environmental exposures to perchlorate affect thyroid hormone levels in women with iodine deficiency. EPA has evaluated perchlorate for a federal drinking water standard under the Safe Drinking Water Act. In 1997, scientific information on perchlorate was limited. In 1997, EPA began evaluating perchlorate for regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act due to public health concerns and the availability of a sensitive detection method. By 2007, EPA had collected enough data to make a regulatory determination on perchlorate. EPA had previously listed perchlorate as a priority for further research on health effects and treatment technologies. In 2007, EPA reported sufficient data on perchlorate levels in public water supplies, determining no further monitoring was needed for regulatory decisions. EPA had previously issued draft reference doses for perchlorate exposure in 1992 and 1995, with a range of 4-18 ppb in drinking water equivalent levels. EPA considers various factors, including sensitive populations and exposure sources, when setting drinking water standards. In 2002, EPA prepared a draft risk assessment for perchlorate exposure, highlighting potential health risks such as effects on the nervous system and thyroid tumors. The assessment included a draft reference dose of 0.00003 mg/kg per day, translating to a drinking water equivalent level of 4-18 ppb. EPA had previously issued draft reference doses in 1992 and 1995, with a similar range for drinking water equivalent levels. In 2002, EPA prepared a controversial draft risk assessment for perchlorate exposure, citing potential health risks like effects on the nervous system and thyroid tumors based on rat studies. The draft included a reference dose of 0.00003 mg/kg per day, equivalent to 1 ppb in drinking water. Concerns were raised by DOD, water suppliers, and others over the stringent cleanup costs it could entail. In 2002, an interagency working group including DOD, EPA, and other agencies convened to discuss perchlorate risk assessment and regulatory issues. The group asked the National Research Council to review the science on perchlorate and EPA's draft assessment. The NRC committee concluded that rat studies were of limited use for assessing human health risks from perchlorate exposure. The National Research Council (NRC) reviewed EPA's draft risk assessment on perchlorate in January 2005. They found key differences between rats and humans, making rat studies limited in assessing human health risks. The NRC concluded that perchlorate exposure is unlikely to cause thyroid tumors in humans due to multiple compensatory mechanisms. They also criticized the design and methods of rat studies used by EPA and disagreed with EPA's risk assessment model, stating it did not accurately represent outcomes after changes in thyroid hormone production. The NRC disagreed with EPA's risk assessment model for perchlorate toxicity, stating it did not accurately represent outcomes after changes in thyroid hormone production. They recommended using inhibition of iodide uptake as a basis for risk assessment due to research gaps in understanding potential effects following changes in thyroid hormone levels. The NRC recommended using inhibition of iodide uptake as a basis for risk assessment of perchlorate toxicity, leading to an RfD of 0.0007 mg/kg per day to protect fetuses of pregnant women. EPA adopted this reference dose in 2005, translating to a drinking water equivalent level of 24.5 ppb. The EPA adopted the NRC recommended reference dose of 0.0007 mg/kg per day for perchlorate in 2005, setting a drinking water equivalent level of 24.5 ppb. The DWEL includes a margin of safety to protect pregnant women and fetuses with thyroid conditions. EPA may lower the DWEL if considering exposure from sources other than drinking water. In 2006, EPA's Superfund office adopted the DWEL as the preliminary remediation goal for perchlorate cleanup at Superfund sites. In 2006, EPA's Superfund office adopted the NRC reference dose and DWEL of 24.5 ppb as the PRG for perchlorate cleanup. In response to concerns about infant exposure, the CHPAC recommended lowering the PRG and issuing a drinking water health advisory. EPA announced in 2008 not to regulate perchlorate due to low levels in water systems. The Office of Water is developing a standard for perchlorate and issued a drinking water health advisory considering early life exposures. EPA announced in 2008 a preliminary determination not to regulate perchlorate due to low occurrence in water systems. EPA's Science Advisory Board argued that EPA must have a compelling basis to support this decision. EPA sought further advice from the NRC before making a final determination on setting a drinking water standard for perchlorate. The SAB requested more time to review the new model EPA relied on and to comment on the preliminary determination. EPA announced it would seek further advice from the NRC before setting a drinking water standard for perchlorate, replacing the preliminary remediation goal with an interim health advisory of 15 ppb based on the NRC's recommendation to protect fetuses. EPA's approach did not address concerns about nursing infants' exposure. The EPA sought advice from the NRC on evaluating perchlorate's health effects on infants and young children. The agency decided against further NRC review to avoid delays in regulatory decision-making, opting instead to solicit public comments on alternative data analysis methods. The EPA decided not to ask the NRC for further review on perchlorate issues to avoid delays in regulatory decisions. Instead, they published a notice seeking public comments on different ways to analyze data for perchlorate regulation. The EPA is reevaluating perchlorate exposure for sensitive life stages, including infants and developing children, and considering a broader range of alternatives for interpreting health concern levels and occurrence frequency in drinking water. The final decision may lead to regulation, with the DOD taking responsibility for significant perchlorate releases and allocating resources to address the problem. The EPA is considering regulating perchlorate exposure, with a focus on sensitive populations like fetuses. DOD has allocated resources for research and cleanup efforts related to perchlorate contamination. Cleanup efforts have been driven by drinking water standards, with ambiguity in goals and responsibilities in the absence of a federal standard. DOD has set a policy of 24 ppb as a level of concern for managing perchlorate releases. In 2006, EPA established a DWEL for perchlorate and issued cleanup guidance. DOD adopted a policy setting 24 ppb as the level of concern for managing perchlorate releases. If levels exceed 24 ppb, a site-specific risk assessment must be conducted. EPA has withdrawn the 2006 perchlorate remediation guidance and recommends using the interim health advisory level of 15 ppb for cleanup. Legislation has been introduced in Congress concerning the regulation of perchlorate. EPA has withdrawn the 2006 perchlorate remediation guidance and recommends using the interim health advisory level of 15 ppb for cleanup. Legislation has been introduced in Congress concerning the regulation of perchlorate under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Funding has been provided for the remediation of perchlorate contamination in ground water and public drinking water supplies. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2010 allocates funds for perchlorate contaminated drinking water wells cleanup and Inland Empire perchlorate remediation. Two bills, H.R. 2316 and H.R. 4252, focus on studying water resources in California, including the Rialto-Colton Basin. H.R. 4252 was passed by the House and ordered reported by the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Additionally, H.R. 102 authorizes appropriations for the San Gabriel Basin Restoration Fund. During the 110th Congress, several perchlorate bills were considered, but none were enacted. S. 24 was introduced to require community water systems to test for perchlorate and disclose its presence in annual consumer reports. S. 150 and H.R. 1747 would have required EPA to set a standard for perchlorate. H.Con.Res. 347 expressed the sense of Congress that the CDC and FDA should take action to educate the public on the importance of adequate iodine intake.
