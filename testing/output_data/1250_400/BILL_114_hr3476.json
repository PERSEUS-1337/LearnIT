The \"Prevent a Government Shutdown Act of 2015\" was created in response to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which set spending caps and required deficit reduction through negotiations or sequestration. Despite unsuccessful negotiations, a two-year agreement was reached to increase spending levels for fiscal years 2014 and 2015. A similar agreement is now needed to avoid deep cuts. Lawmakers reached a two-year agreement to increase defense and non-defense discretionary spending for fiscal years 2014 and 2015, avoiding deep budget cuts. Senator John McCain and Representative Mac Thornberry criticized the impact of sequestration on defense spending, stating it undermines military capabilities. The cuts are also affecting non-defense discretionary spending, as highlighted by NDD United. The impact of sequestration on defense and non-defense discretionary spending is significant. NDD United highlighted the negative effects of self-imposed cuts on economic recovery, business growth, public health, education, oversight, scientific discovery, infrastructure, and emergency response. The House Committee on Appropriations' bills for fiscal year 2016 propose cuts to the Department of Education, housing vouchers, and other areas. The impact of sequestration includes cuts to the Department of Education, housing vouchers, and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Eliminating the sequester would boost GDP and employment, aiding economic recovery. Relief from the sequester would also allow Congress to pass appropriations legislation and prevent a government shutdown. The potential impact of eliminating the sequester includes boosting GDP and employment, with projections of 500,000 jobs in the next year and 300,000 in 2017. Relief from the sequester would enable Congress to pass appropriations legislation, preventing a government shutdown like the one in 2013 that resulted in significant economic losses and disruptions. Immediate negotiations on a budget agreement are crucial to avoid another shutdown and ensure funding for vital services at necessary levels. To prevent another government shutdown and fund vital services at necessary levels for fiscal year 2016, immediate negotiations on a budget agreement are needed. This should include raising discretionary spending caps for defense and non-defense, eliminating the non-defense sequester, and reducing the defense sequester. It is preferable to offset the cost of sequester relief with deficit reduction from closing special interest tax loopholes, but sequester relief should occur regardless of this agreement. Bipartisan, bicameral agreement reached on sequester relief. A bipartisan measure will be negotiated to increase discretionary spending limits for fiscal years 2016 and 2017, with provisions to reduce the deficit. Members appointed by House and Senate leaders will be responsible for negotiating the measure. The measure described in subsection (a) requires approval from individuals appointed by House and Senate leaders. If approved, it will be considered under specific procedures outlined in the Budget Control Act of 2011. SEC. 3. ALTERNATIVE ADJUSTMENT TO DISCRETIONARY SPENDING LIMITS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2016 AND 2017. If the measure described under section 2(a) is not enacted into law before October 1, 2015, the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 will be amended to adjust discretionary spending limits for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 will be amended to adjust discretionary spending limits for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 by adding 2016 and 2017 to the existing limits. Adjustments made before the enactment of this Act by the Office of Management and Budget for fiscal year 2016 will be nullified if the measure described under section 2(a) is not enacted into law before October 1, 2015."
