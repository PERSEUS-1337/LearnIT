The cruise industry, a small fraction of the shipping industry, has drawn attention for its environmental impacts. The cruise industry, representing a small fraction of the global shipping industry, has grown significantly, contributing $40 billion to the U.S. economy in 2009. With over 230 ships worldwide, the majority are foreign-flagged, and six companies own nearly 95% of passenger ships in U.S. waters. The industry has seen a 7.4% annual growth in cruise passengers since 1990, hosting 14.3 million passengers in 2010. New ships are continuously added to the fleet, becoming larger, more luxurious, and accommodating more passengers and crew. The cruise industry, dominated by six companies with foreign-flag vessels, continues to grow with larger and more luxurious ships accommodating increasing numbers of passengers and crew. The industry faces challenges in managing waste disposal and ensuring safety for passengers and visited communities. A large cruise ship can generate significant amounts of sewage, graywater, hazardous wastes, and other waste during a typical one-week voyage. The volume of wastes produced by large cruise ships is greater than that of many small cities on land. During a one-week voyage, a ship can generate 210,000 gallons of sewage, 1 million gallons of graywater, 130 gallons of hazardous wastes, 8 tons of solid waste, and 25,000 gallons of oily bilge water. Improper disposal of these wastes poses risks to human health and the environment. Concerns have been raised about the adequacy of laws for managing cruise ship waste, with weak enforcement noted. Foreign-flag cruise ships have been involved in numerous illegal discharge cases in U.S. waters, with 83% of cases involving discharges of various waste streams. Between 1993 and 1998, foreign-flag cruise ships were involved in 87 confirmed illegal discharge cases in U.S. waters, with 83% of cases involving oil or oil-based products. Most discharges were accidental, some intentional, and a few undetermined. These cases represented 4% of all illegal discharge cases by foreign-flag ships during that period, leading to criminal prosecutions and fines. Several pollution cases involving cruise ships were confirmed by the GAO over a six-year period. In response to environmental advocacy groups' petition, the EPA studied cruise ship discharges and released a report in 2008 summarizing waste streams and findings, especially in Alaskan waters. The report also presented options to address ship discharges. In December 2008, the EPA released a report on cruise ship waste streams and pollution in response to a petition. The report highlighted various waste types, international and domestic laws addressing pollution, legislative activities in Alaskan waters, and efforts by cruise ship companies to prevent illegal discharges. The report discusses federal and state legislative activity regarding cruise ship waste in Alaskan waters and other states. Cruise ship companies have implemented waste management plans to improve environmental operations. Environmental groups support legislation for stricter standards on wastewater and other discharges from cruise ships. Cruise ships generate various waste streams that can harm the marine environment if not properly treated and disposed of. Cruise ships generate various waste streams, including sewage, graywater, hazardous wastes, oily bilge water, ballast water, and solid waste, which can harm the marine environment. While they represent a small portion of the international shipping industry, the large volumes of waste produced by cruise ships, especially sewage, graywater, and solid waste, are of concern due to the high number of passengers and crew onboard. Their cumulative impact is significant, especially in specific coastal areas and ports they frequent. Cruise ships, due to their large passenger and crew capacity, produce significant amounts of sewage, known as blackwater, containing harmful bacteria and nutrients. Discharges of untreated sewage can contaminate fisheries and shellfish beds, posing risks to public health. Nutrients in sewage can lead to excessive algal growth, depleting oxygen in the water and causing harm to aquatic life. On average, a large cruise ship can generate 15,000 to 30,000 gallons of sewage per day. Cruise ships generate significant amounts of sewage, including blackwater and graywater, which can contain harmful bacteria and pollutants. Untreated graywater from cruise ships can have high levels of fecal coliform bacteria, detergents, oil, and other pollutants. Sampling by EPA and Alaska found that graywater from cruise ships can contain pollutants at variable strengths, with fecal coliform bacteria levels higher than in untreated domestic wastewater. Cruise ships generate significant amounts of graywater, which can contain high levels of fecal coliform bacteria and other pollutants. Graywater is the largest source of liquid waste on cruise ships, with potential environmental effects due to nutrient concentrations. Solid waste on ships includes glass, paper, cardboard, aluminum, steel cans, and plastics, which can become marine debris if not managed properly. Cruise ships typically incinerate 75% of solid waste on board, with the ash often discharged at sea. Cruise ships manage solid waste through source reduction, waste minimization, and recycling, but up to 75% is incinerated on board. The ash is discharged at sea, posing a threat to marine life. Each passenger generates two pounds of solid waste per day, leading to massive amounts of waste on large cruise ships. Around 8 tons of solid waste are produced during a one-week cruise, with 24% of global vessel waste coming from cruise ships. Most cruise ship garbage is treated on board before being discharged overboard. Cruise ships generate large amounts of solid waste, with about 8 tons produced during a one-week cruise. 24% of global vessel waste comes from cruise ships, which can strain port reception facilities. Hazardous wastes from onboard activities include chemicals, medical waste, batteries, and paints, containing substances like hydrocarbons and heavy metals. Hazardous waste on cruise ships includes a variety of substances like hydrocarbons, chlorinated hydrocarbons, heavy metals, and paint waste. These materials, such as paints, thinners, fluorescent light bulbs, and pharmaceuticals, can be toxic to marine organisms. Oil leaks from engine spaces mix with water in the bilge, posing threats to fish, wildlife, and human health. Bilge water also contains pollutants like oxygen-demanding material, chemicals, soaps, detergents, and degreasers, which can be highly toxic. Oil in even minute concentrations can kill fish or have various sub-lethal chronic effects. Bilge water may contain solid wastes, pollutants, and chemicals that are highly toxic to marine organisms if discharged. Large vessels generate oily bilge water that needs to be extracted and properly managed to prevent environmental harm. To prevent environmental harm, oily bilge water from large vessels must be extracted and managed properly. If a separator is faulty or bypassed, untreated oily bilge water could be discharged into the ocean, damaging marine life. Bilge water is a common source of oil pollution from cruise ships, leading to environmental violations for some cruise lines. Ballast water is crucial for stabilizing ships, especially cargo ships, as it is taken on in coastal waters and discharged at the next port of call to reduce the need for compensating ballast. Ballast water is essential for stabilizing ships, especially cargo ships, by compensating for changes in weight as cargo is loaded or unloaded. However, ballast water discharge can introduce invasive species, posing risks to public health, the environment, and industries such as water utilities, fisheries, agriculture, and tourism. This can result in significant economic costs and ecological damage. Invasive species in U.S. marine waters pose public health, environmental, and economic risks, costing industries billions annually. Cruise ships contribute to the problem, but specific data is lacking. Diesel engines on cruise ships emit pollutants classified as human carcinogens, contributing to air pollution and water contamination. EPA estimates the impact of marine diesel engine emissions on air quality and environmental degradation. Marine diesel engines emit pollutants classified as human carcinogens, contributing to air pollution, water contamination, and environmental degradation. EPA estimates that ocean-going vessels account for a significant portion of nitrogen oxide, particulate, and sulfur dioxide emissions in the United States. International shipping also contributes to global carbon dioxide emissions and climate change through the release of black carbon and nitrogen oxides. States and localities are increasingly pressuring maritime vessels to reduce their environmental impact. The International Maritime Organization estimates that international shipping contributed 2.7% of global carbon dioxide emissions in 2007, along with significant amounts of black carbon and nitrogen oxides. Environmental pressures on maritime vessels are increasing as states and localities assess their contribution to regional air quality problems. Cruise ship emissions may have significant impacts on a local scale in specific coastal areas. Shipboard incinerators burn large volumes of waste, producing ash that must be disposed of and may release toxic emissions. Various waste streams on cruise ships are governed by international protocols and U.S. domestic laws. Cruise ships burn large volumes of garbage, plastics, and waste in shipboard incinerators, producing ash that must be disposed of. The waste streams on cruise ships are regulated by international protocols and U.S. domestic laws. The International Maritime Organization sets international maritime vessel safety and pollution standards under MARPOL 73/78. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) implements the MARPOL 73/78 Convention, which sets regulations for preventing pollution from ships. Cruise ships flagged under MARPOL signatory countries must comply with its requirements. The Convention has six Annexes covering various pollution sources, such as oil, noxious liquid substances, harmful substances, sewage, and garbage. Member nations are responsible for enforcing these regulations on vessels registered under their flag. The MARPOL 73/78 Convention has six Annexes covering regulations for preventing pollution from ships, including oil, noxious liquid substances, harmful substances, sewage, and garbage. Compliance with the Annexes is voluntary, and amendments can be proposed by ratified parties. The United States has ratified several Annexes, with the most recent being Annex VI in May 2005. The MARPOL 73/78 Convention has six Annexes covering regulations for preventing pollution from ships. The United States has ratified Annexes I, II, III, V, and VI, with the most recent being Annex VI in May 2005. The country where a ship is registered is responsible for certifying compliance with pollution prevention standards. IMO has established other conventions addressing issues such as ballast water management and passenger safety. Each signatory nation must enact domestic laws to implement the convention and comply with related laws. In the United States, the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) implements MARPOL provisions. The United States implements the MARPOL Convention through the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS), which applies to all U.S.-flagged and foreign-flagged vessels in U.S. waters. Recent U.S. actions include ratification of Annex VI in 2006 and legislation in 2008 to implement its standards through EPA regulations in consultation with the U.S. Coast Guard. The United States implements MARPOL Annex VI through the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS), which applies to all U.S.-flagged and foreign-flagged vessels in U.S. waters. The Coast Guard enforces regulations to implement APPS, separate from other environmental laws. International maritime shipping poses challenges in enforcing MARPOL, with countries able to verify compliance and detain non-compliant ships. The U.S. can take enforcement action against foreign-flagged ships for pollution incidents within U.S. jurisdiction. The United States enforces MARPOL Annex VI through the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) for all vessels in U.S. waters. The Coast Guard enforces APPS regulations separately. The U.S. can take direct enforcement action against foreign-flagged ships for pollution incidents within its jurisdiction, coordinating with flag states when incidents occur outside U.S. jurisdiction. Multiple federal agencies have jurisdiction over cruise ships in U.S. waters, with the Coast Guard and EPA having regulatory responsibilities, and the Department of Justice prosecuting violations. The Department of State represents the U.S. at international meetings and treaty negotiations. The U.S. enforces MARPOL Annex VI through the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) for vessels in U.S. waters. The Coast Guard and EPA regulate cruise ships, while the Department of Justice prosecutes violations. The Department of State represents the U.S. internationally. Other federal agencies like NOAA and APHIS have limited roles. The Clean Water Act is the main U.S. law for limiting pollution in water bodies. States and localities also have responsibilities in some cases. The Clean Water Act (CWA) is the principal U.S. law for limiting polluting activity in water bodies. The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program controls pollutant discharges, including those from vessels like cruise ships. While sewage is considered a pollutant, cruise ships are exempt from NPDES permits for sewage discharges. However, Section 312 of the CWA prohibits untreated or inadequately treated sewage dumping from vessels within 3 miles of shore, including cruise ships. This prohibition is enforced jointly by the EPA and other federal agencies. Section 312 of the Clean Water Act prohibits untreated sewage discharge from vessels within 3 miles of shore, including cruise ships. EPA and the Coast Guard enforce this regulation, requiring marine sanitation devices on commercial and recreational vessels with installed toilets. MSDs are designed to hold or treat sewage before discharge, with Type II and Type III MSDs commonly used on large vessels like cruise ships. The Coast Guard regulations cover three types of Marine Sanitation Devices (MSDs) for vessels, including cruise ships. Type II MSDs treat waste before discharge, meeting specific limits. Type III MSDs store waste for later treatment or discharge outside U.S. waters. Type I MSDs disinfect sewage before discharge, with specific performance standards. Critics highlight deficiencies in the regulations, especially for cruise ships and large vessels. The regulations for Type I Marine Sanitation Devices (MSDs) on vessels under 65 feet do not require sampling, monitoring, or reporting of effluent discharges. Critics point out deficiencies in the regulatory structure, as it only covers bacterial contaminants and suspended solids, unlike the NPDES permit program which regulates a wider range of pollutants. The Coast Guard, responsible for enforcing MSD rules, has been criticized for poor compliance inspections. The Coast Guard has been criticized for poor enforcement of MSD rules, with inspectors lacking time to properly inspect sewage treatment equipment on cruise ships. Various factors limit their ability to detect violations, including a focus on safety, limited time and staff, and a lack of surprise in inspections. The Coast Guard's responsibilities include homeland security and non-homeland security tasks, with a shift towards more homeland security activities since the September 11 attacks. The Coast Guard has shifted focus to homeland security activities since 9/11, leading to less time for vessel inspections for MSD compliance. Annex IV of MARPOL regulates sewage discharges from ships, but the US has not ratified it, making compliance in US waters optional. In U.S. waters, Annex IV of MARPOL requires ships to have sewage treatment systems or holding tanks, with specific discharge regulations based on distance from shore. Compliance with U.S. regulations under the Clean Water Act is mandatory for cruise ships, with some using Advanced Wastewater Treatment systems for improved sewage treatment. In U.S. waters, cruise ships must comply with regulations implementing Section 312 of the Clean Water Act. Some ships use Advanced Wastewater Treatment systems for sewage treatment, which are effective in removing pathogens and pollutants. States can establish no-discharge zones to prohibit sewage discharges from vessels with installed toilets. To protect waters from sewage discharges, states can establish no-discharge zones for vessels with installed toilets. These zones can be based on environmental protection needs, special environmental importance, or to prohibit sewage discharge into drinking water intake zones. The EPA has identified options to address sewage from cruise ships, including revising discharge standards, restricting discharge within a certain distance from shore, and requiring testing of wastewater treatment equipment. Graywater is not considered a pollutant under current federal law, and there are no specific federal standards for its discharge. Under current federal law, graywater is not defined as a pollutant and there are no specific federal effluent standards for its discharge. The Clean Water Act includes graywater in its definition of sewage for regulating commercial vessels in the Great Lakes, with limits on bacterial contaminant content and total suspended solids. Alaska requires graywater treatment before discharge, and EPA issued a general permit for large commercial vessels, including cruise ships, with similar restrictions on graywater discharges. NOAA can designate National Marine Sanctuaries under the National Marine Sanctuaries Act. In 2008, EPA issued a CWA general permit for large commercial vessels, including cruise ships, with restrictions on graywater discharges similar to those in Alaskan waters. NOAA can designate National Marine Sanctuaries where graywater discharges may be restricted to protect sensitive ecosystems. EPA identified options for addressing graywater discharges in the 2008 Discharge Assessment Report, including establishing standards, geographic restrictions, monitoring, and penalties for non-compliance. Cruise ship solid waste discharges are governed by the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act. The Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA) and the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) regulate cruise ship discharges of solid waste. MPRSA prohibits dumping garbage into ocean waters without a permit and regulates disposal at sea. APPS addresses pollution from ships. EPA issues permits for waste disposal at sea, while the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers handles dredged material. Routine effluent discharge from vessels is exempt from MPRSA regulations. The Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA) and the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) regulate cruise ship discharges of solid waste. MPRSA requires a permit for dumping garbage into ocean waters, while APPS prohibits garbage discharge within certain distances from shore and plastic discharge anywhere. The Coast Guard enforces these regulations for all vessels in U.S. navigable waters and the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). EPA has identified discharges of solid waste and plastic from cruise ships, prompting potential amendments to MARPOL Annex V. The Coast Guard conducts inspection programs to ensure port facilities can handle solid waste from cruise ships. EPA has reported discharges of solid waste and plastic from cruise ships, leading to potential amendments to MARPOL Annex V. EPA has suggested various options to address solid waste from cruise ships, including improving on-board garbage handling technologies and expanding port reception facilities. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act governs hazardous waste management. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) governs hazardous waste management, imposing requirements on generators, transporters, and facilities. Hazardous waste is defined by its characteristics or appearance on specific lists. Cruise ship operators must comply with RCRA rules, ensuring proper waste identification and management. The cruise ship industry must comply with RCRA rules for managing hazardous waste generated onboard, including proper identification, storage, and offloading for recycling or disposal. Activities like cleaning, painting, and passenger services can result in the generation of hazardous wastes subject to RCRA requirements. Regulations for managing and disposing of these wastes are not entirely clear. Cruise ships may be subject to RCRA requirements for managing hazardous waste generated onboard, but it is unclear how these regulations apply. There is ambiguity in classifying cruise ships as large or small generators of hazardous waste, with some arguing for a third category with less stringent requirements. Additionally, a release of hazardous substances could potentially trigger the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). Cruise ships may be subject to RCRA requirements for managing hazardous waste generated onboard. There is ambiguity in classifying cruise ships as large or small generators of hazardous waste, with some arguing for a third category with less stringent requirements. A release of hazardous substances by a cruise ship could potentially trigger the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), which requires immediate notification of any release of hazardous substances above regulatory thresholds into waters of the United States. EPA has identified 500 wastes as hazardous substances under these provisions, with rules on reportable quantities as small as 1 pound for some substances. The EPA has identified 500 hazardous wastes and issued rules on reportable quantities as small as 1 pound. CERCLA authorizes the President to take remedial action for releases, including hazardous waste discharges from cruise ships. Hazardous waste discharges from cruise ships are also subject to the Clean Water Act. The EPA has proposed various options for addressing hazardous wastes from cruise ships. Several options are proposed to address hazardous waste from cruise ships, including establishing standards or BMPs to reduce contaminants, prohibiting discharge of hazardous materials into U.S. waters up to the 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone, increasing inspections on cruise ships, and inspecting facilities that receive cruise ship hazardous wastes. The Clean Water Act prohibits discharge of oil or hazardous substances into U.S. navigable waters, with Coast Guard regulations specifying discharge limits based on distance from shore and oil content. Regulations (33 CFR \u00a7151.10) prohibit oil discharge within 12 miles from shore unless passed through a 15-ppm oil water separator and without causing a visible sheen. Beyond 12 miles, oil can be discharged if the vessel is en route and oil content is less than 100 ppm. Vessels must maintain an Oil Record Book for disposal of oily residues and bilge water. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) implements MARPOL Annex I for oil pollution, applying to U.S. and foreign flagged vessels in U.S. waters. Coast Guard regulations prohibit oil discharge within 12 nautical miles of land, with limited exceptions. However, APPS regulations have limited applicability to cruise ship operations. The Coast Guard prohibits oil discharge within 12 nautical miles of land, with limited exceptions. Most cruise lines have policies restricting discharges within three miles from shore. EPA suggested options for addressing oily bilge water from cruise ships in 2008. Clean Water Act regulations exempt ballast water and other discharges from NPDES permit requirements. In 1999, conservation organizations petitioned EPA to regulate ballast water discharge under the Clean Water Act, citing the introduction of invasive species into U.S. waters. EPA rejected the petition in 2003, stating that the exemption for ballast water discharge is long-standing policy. In 2003, EPA stated that the exclusion of ballast water discharge from the Clean Water Act is a long-standing policy, which Congress has not altered despite considering the issue twice. Efforts to limit ballast water discharges became mandatory in 2004, and environmental groups filed a lawsuit to rescind the regulation exempting ballast water from CWA permitting. In 2005, a federal court ruled in favor of the groups, and in 2006, the court ordered EPA to set aside the challenged regulation by September 30, 2008. The ruling was upheld on appeal in July 2008. In response to a court order, EPA issued the Vessel General Permit (VGP) in December 2008, applying to various large recreational and commercial vessels, including cruise ships, tankers, and freighters. The VGP covers pollutant discharges incidental to the normal operation of non-recreational vessels that are 79 feet or more in length. The Vessel General Permit (VGP) applies to large recreational and commercial vessels, including cruise ships, tankers, and freighters. It covers pollutant discharges from non-recreational vessels that are 79 feet or more in length, including ballast water discharges from smaller commercial vessels and commercial fishing vessels. The permit applies to discharges into U.S. waters in all states and territories up to the 3-mile territorial limit. EPA identified 26 types of waste streams from covered vessels, including aquatic nuisance species, nutrients, pathogens, oil and grease, metals, and toxic pollutants. Best management practices (BMPs) are described in the permit to control these pollutant discharges. The VGP regulates pollutant discharges from large recreational and commercial vessels, including cruise ships. It covers various waste streams such as aquatic nuisance species, nutrients, pathogens, oil and grease, metals, and toxic pollutants. Best management practices (BMPs) are used to control these discharges, with specific measures for ballast water and bilge water. Sewage discharges and certain toxic wastes from passenger services on cruise ships are not authorized under the permit. Monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements are also included. The VGP regulates pollutant discharges from large recreational and commercial vessels, including cruise ships. It includes detailed requirements for certain discharges like graywater and pool water, with BMPs and numeric effluent limits for fecal coliform and residual chlorine. Operational limits are set for cruise ship graywater discharges in nutrient-impaired waters. Legislation was considered by the 110th Congress for a uniform national approach to address aquatic nuisance species from ballast water. The 110th Congress considered legislation regarding ballast water discharge issues, which aimed to provide a uniform national approach for addressing aquatic nuisance species. Some groups opposed the legislation as it would preempt states from enacting stricter ballast water management programs. The Clean Air Act is the principal federal law addressing air quality concerns, setting health-based standards for ambient air quality and national emission standards for air pollution sources. The Clean Air Act is the main federal law addressing air quality concerns, setting health-based standards for ambient air quality and national emission standards for air pollution sources. In 2003, EPA established emission standards for new marine diesel engines on large vessels, including cruise ships, following litigation by the environmental group Bluewater Network. The standards are equivalent to internationally negotiated standards for nitrogen oxides. EPA established emission standards for large vessels and cruise ships in 2003, equivalent to internationally negotiated standards for nitrogen oxides. The rule is part of several EPA regulations under the Clean Air Act, with a focus on nonroad engines and vehicles. The agency plans to review and implement more stringent emission standards for very large marine engines and vessels in the future to align with international efforts through the IMO. In 2003, EPA established emission standards for large vessels and cruise ships, aligning with international nitrogen oxides standards. The agency plans to implement more stringent standards for very large marine engines and vessels in the future to support international efforts through the IMO. Environmental groups criticized EPA for excluding foreign-flagged vessels from the rules, but the rules were upheld in 2004. The 110th Congress enacted legislation to implement MARPOL Annex VI, and in 2008, the IMO adopted amendments to establish new global nitrogen oxide and fuel sulfur standards. The United States supported these amendments. In October 2008, the IMO adopted amendments to Annex VI to establish new global nitrogen oxide and fuel sulfur standards. The United States supported these amendments, and in December 2009, EPA made changes to the 2003 CAA rules for Category 3 marine engines to align with the IMO requirements. The EPA rule also sets emissions standards for hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide, applying to newly built U.S.-flagged or registered vessels. In October 2010, the IMO approved the designation of waters in the U.S. Caribbean as an Emission Control Area (ECA). In October 2010, the IMO approved a U.S. request to designate waters in the U.S. Caribbean as an ECA. A treaty amendment to Annex VI will be circulated among IMO members for approval by July 2011, with ships in the area subject to stricter emission limits for sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter from 2014. The Clean Water Act defines navigable waters, the contiguous zone, and the ocean as separate entities, with navigable waters encompassing U.S. waters and territorial seas extending 3 miles seaward from the baseline. The Clean Water Act defines navigable waters, territorial seas extending 3 miles from the baseline, and the contiguous zone extending up to 12 miles from the baseline. President Reagan's proclamation extended the territorial sea to 12 nautical miles, but it did not affect the Clean Water Act's jurisdiction. President Clinton's proclamation in 1999 allowed U.S. authorities to enforce laws up to 24 nautical miles from the baseline. President Clinton's 1999 proclamation extended U.S. authorities' enforcement rights to 24 nautical miles from the baseline, doubling the traditional 12-mile contiguous zone. This did not change the Clean Water Act's definitions, which still set the territorial sea at 3 miles and the contiguous zone from 3 to 12 miles. The CWA incorporates these definitions for \"navigable waters,\" while the MPRSA distinguishes \"ocean waters\" as beyond the baseline. The Clean Water Act and the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act define different areas of jurisdiction in U.S. waters. The CWA applies to sewage and point source discharges in navigable waters, while the MPRSA addresses ocean waters beyond the baseline. Limits of jurisdiction are crucial for enforcing specific laws and regulations, such as those concerning oil and hazardous substance discharges. The Clean Water Act and the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act have different jurisdictional boundaries in U.S. waters. The CWA applies to sewage and point source discharges in navigable waters, while the MPRSA addresses ocean waters beyond the baseline. Provisions of the Oil Pollution Act and the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships also regulate discharges of oil and hazardous substances in navigable waters. The MPRSA regulates ocean dumping within 12 nautical miles from the baseline. Jurisdictional considerations are complicated by differences in how distances are measured, with the CWA using miles and the MPRSA using nautical miles. In Alaska, cruise ship pollution has raised concerns due to the increase in cruise ship visits during the 1990s. Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines faced penalties for knowingly discharging oil and hazardous substances in Alaska waters. In July 1999, Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines faced penalties of $6.5 million for environmental violations in Alaska, including oil and hazardous substances discharge. The company admitted to a fleet-wide practice of discharging oil-contaminated bilge water. These violations were part of a larger $18 million federal plea agreement involving multiple locations. Public concern led to a program in December 1999 to identify cruise ship waste streams, revealing that waste treatment systems on most ships did not meet U.S. Coast Guard standards. Fecal coliform levels in discharges exceeded the Coast Guard standard by a significant margin. In response to environmental violations in Alaska, federal legislation was passed in December 2000 to establish standards for cruise ships with 500 or more passengers, prohibiting untreated sewage and graywater discharge in Alaskan waters. The law authorized the EPA to regulate sewage and graywater discharges from cruise ships, allowing treated sewage discharge only at a certain speed and distance from shore until EPA regulations are issued. The legislation in Alaska authorizes the EPA to set standards for sewage and graywater discharges from cruise ships. Cruise ships can discharge treated sewage wastes in Alaska waters under specific conditions, including speed and distance from shore. Vessels with advanced treatment systems must meet stricter effluent standards for discharges closer to shore or at lower speeds. Coast Guard oversight and enforcement are required, with regulations in place to implement the federal law. The legislation in Alaska authorizes the EPA to set standards for sewage and graywater discharges from cruise ships, with specific effluent standards and sampling requirements enforced by the Coast Guard. Regulations were issued in 2001, stipulating sampling procedures and penalties for violations. EPA conducted a project to evaluate treatment systems on cruise ships in Alaska, with findings summarized in 2008. The EPA conducted sampling of wastewater from cruise ships in Alaska to assess graywater and sewage treatment systems. Results showed that advanced treatment systems are effective in treating various contaminants. Alaska enacted its own law in 2001 to regulate sewage and graywater discharges from cruise ships. The state of Alaska enacted its own law in 2001 to regulate sewage and graywater discharges from cruise ships, setting standards and sampling requirements identical to federal law. Effluent standards for blackwater discharges by large cruise ships took effect in 2001, while standards for graywater discharges by large vessels took effect in 2003. Small ships were given three years to comply with all effluent standards. The state of Alaska enacted a law in 2001 to regulate sewage and graywater discharges from cruise ships. Effluent standards for graywater discharges by large vessels took effect in 2003. Large ships have installed advanced wastewater treatment systems or hold wastewater for discharge outside Alaskan waters. Small ships have not installed new wastewater treatment systems, and effluent quality has remained constant. As of 2006, large cruise ships in Alaskan waters have improved wastewater quality with advanced treatment systems. Small ships, however, still discharge pollutants exceeding state standards, posing risks to aquatic life and human health. In 2006, Alaska voters approved a law requiring cruise lines to pay taxes for environmental regulations and fines for violations, with revenues benefiting local communities and public services. Alaska voters approved a law in 2006 requiring cruise lines to pay taxes for environmental regulations and fines for violations. The initiative includes a $50 head tax per passenger, corporate income tax, and stricter regulations for cruise ships. Revenues from the taxes will benefit local communities and public services. Some cruise lines have stopped operating in Alaskan waters due to the initiative, while opponents argue it could harm the state's tourism competitiveness. In 2009, Alaska enacted legislation to give more time for implementing stringent wastewater treatment standards. Other states have also taken steps to regulate cruise ship discharges. In 2009, Alaska enacted legislation (HB 134) to implement stringent wastewater treatment standards for cruise ships. Other states have also regulated cruise ship discharges, such as Maine enacting legislation in 2004 governing discharges into coastal waters. The law applies to large cruise ships and requires advanced wastewater treatment systems for compliance. In 2009, Alaska implemented strict wastewater treatment standards for cruise ships under the federal Alaska cruise ship law. Maine also enacted legislation in 2004 for discharges into coastal waters, requiring advanced wastewater treatment systems for compliance. California passed several bills in 2004 and 2003 to regulate cruise ship discharges, including bans on releasing treated wastewater, graywater, waste incinerators, sewage sludge, oil bilge water, and hazardous wastes into state waters. EPA approved Maine's request for No Discharge Zones, allowing the state to prohibit blackwater discharges. California has enacted laws banning cruise ships from discharging various types of waste into state waters, including sewage sludge, oil bilge water, and hazardous wastes from photo-processing and dry cleaning operations. California S.B. 497 requires the adoption of ballast water performance standards by January 2008, with specific deadlines for the removal of invasive species by 2020. Several states have agreements with the cruise industry to adhere to waste minimization, recycling, and management practices. For example, a 2001 agreement with Florida requires cruise lines to eliminate wastewater discharges within 4 nautical miles off the coast. Several states have agreements with the cruise industry to adhere to waste minimization, recycling, and management practices. For example, a 2001 agreement with Florida requires cruise lines to eliminate wastewater discharges within 4 nautical miles off the coast. Environmental advocates criticize these voluntary agreements for lacking enforcement and penalty provisions. States argue that while the Clean Water Act limits their control over cruise ship discharges, federal law does not prevent them from entering into such agreements. The MOU has been amended multiple times to cover other ports, with environmental advocates criticizing the lack of enforcement and penalty provisions in voluntary agreements with the cruise industry. Despite difficulties in enforcement, states argue that having these agreements in place helps protect water quality and gather data on vessels and waste treatment equipment. Pressure from environmental advocates and the industry's desire for a positive image have led to initiatives from the cruise ship industry. The state argues that having measures in place to protect water quality benefits by gathering data on vessels and waste treatment equipment. The cruise ship industry, under pressure from environmental advocates, has adopted waste management practices and procedures, including guidelines for discharging graywater and blackwater at least 4 miles from shore. They have also implemented Safety Management System plans for enhanced wastewater systems and increased auditing oversight. The cruise ship industry has implemented Safety Management System plans for enhanced wastewater systems and increased auditing oversight, certified in accordance with the IMO's International Safety Management Code. They are also working on developing technologies for lower emission turbine engines and ballast water management. Environmental groups commend the industry for adopting improved management practices but prefer enforceable standards. The industry has partnered with Conservation International to form the Ocean Conservation and Tourism Alliance to work on conservation efforts in coastal areas. In December 2003, the cruise ship industry announced conservation efforts to protect biodiversity in coastal areas, including improving wastewater management technology, working with local governments to protect natural assets, raising awareness among passengers and crew, and educating vendors on environmental impacts. CLIA and CI collaborated on a joint initiative in 2006 to integrate sensitive marine areas into cruise line navigational charts. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. committed to retrofitting its fleet with advanced wastewater treatment technology in 2004, setting a model for environmental protection in the industry. Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCCL) plans to retrofit its entire fleet with advanced wastewater treatment technology, making it the first cruise line to do so. The company's commitment follows past environmental violations and efforts by Oceana to push for better ocean protection measures in the cruise industry. Concerns about cruise ship pollution raise issues for Congress regarding laws, regulations, research needs, and oversight. More assessment is needed to determine if current measures are sufficient, and obtaining resources to address the problems is a challenge. Key issues include existing U.S. laws, international standards, state activities, and industry practices. The need for further assessment of existing laws and regulations regarding cruise ship pollution, particularly in the management of graywater, is highlighted. Concerns about gaps in coverage and contamination levels in graywater from cruise ships have been raised, prompting discussions on potential legislative changes to address these issues. Investigations have found substantial contamination of cruise ship graywater from fecal coliform, bacteria, heavy metals, and dissolved plastics. State officials were surprised by the high levels of fecal coliform in graywater compared to sewage lines. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy recommended clear, uniform requirements for controlling wastewater discharge from large passenger vessels, including recordkeeping, sampling, testing, and monitoring protocols. The Clean Cruise Ship Act proposed similar concepts to address pollution concerns. The Clean Cruise Ship Act proposed regulations to prohibit cruise vessels from discharging sewage, graywater, or bilge water into U.S. waters without meeting effluent limits. It would require wastewater treatment on cruise ships and enhance federal enforcement authority for inspection and testing. The Clean Cruise Ship Act proposes strict effluent limits for sewage, graywater, and bilge water discharges from cruise vessels, requiring wastewater treatment and enhancing federal enforcement authority. Passenger fees would fund EPA and Coast Guard implementation. Industry argues current standards meet or exceed regulations, while states may pass legislation regulating cruise ship discharges, potentially prompting federal legislation to harmonize approaches. EPA's efforts to manage cruise ship wastes are also a concern for Congress. Several states have passed legislation to regulate cruise ship discharges, potentially prompting the need for federal legislation to harmonize approaches. Congress is also concerned about EPA's efforts to manage cruise ship wastes, with the agency collecting information and assessing the need for additional standards. EPA released a Cruise Ship Discharge Assessment Report in December 2008, examining various waste streams and discussing current federal actions to address them. The report identifies possible options and alternatives to address cruise ship discharges. The final report examines five cruise ship waste streams (sewage, graywater, oily bilge water, solid waste, and hazardous waste) and discusses current federal actions to address them. Possible options and alternatives are identified, but EPA has not determined their necessity, feasibility, or legal authority. Other issues include harmonizing U.S. laws, defining \"cruise ship,\" and updating regulations for improved technology. Research is needed to understand waste quantities generated by cruise ships. Research is needed to understand the quantities of waste generated by cruise ships and the impacts of discharges and emissions. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy highlighted the importance of research in identifying the harm caused by vessel pollution and prioritizing resources to address significant threats. Areas of research include the transport of pollutants in the marine environment, impacts of stationary discharges from small passenger vessels, disposal options for concentrated sludge from advanced sewage treatment on large passenger vessels, and cumulative impacts of vessel pollution on the environment. Processes governing transport of pollutants in marine environment, impacts of vessel pollution on sensitive ecosystems, and options for disposal of sludge from sewage treatment on large vessels. EPA's 2008 Cruise Ship Assessment Report highlighted research options to address impacts of cruise ship discharges on human health and the environment, including nationwide sampling and monitoring programs. Increasing studies on human health and environmental effects of cruise ship discharges, focusing on geographic areas impacted by discharges and potential cumulative impacts. Existing laws and regulations may not be adequately enforced, leading to the need for monitoring discharges to evaluate current standards. Increased federal oversight by the Coast Guard and other agencies is necessary for maintenance of pollution prevention equipment and proper off-loading of waste. Coast Guard has primary enforcement responsibility for federal programs on cruise ship pollution. The Coast Guard is responsible for enforcing federal programs on cruise ship pollution, including monitoring equipment and off-loading waste. There are concerns about the adequacy of Coast Guard resources for inspections, especially with expanded homeland security responsibilities. Possible enforcement options include improving monitoring, involving passengers in detecting illegal activities, and charging a fee for onboard marine engineers to observe waste treatment practices. EPA has also suggested allowing state personnel to inspect pollution control equipment on cruise ships. The Coast Guard is responsible for enforcing federal programs on cruise ship pollution, including monitoring equipment and off-loading waste. Possible enforcement options include improving monitoring, involving passengers in detecting illegal activities, and charging a fee for onboard marine engineers to observe waste treatment practices. GAO found that the process for referring cruise ship violations to other countries is not working, and recommended greater efforts to follow up on alleged pollution cases occurring outside U.S. jurisdiction."
