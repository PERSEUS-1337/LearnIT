    "content": "The \"Biofuels Market Expansion Act of 2011\" requires manufacturers to ensure a certain percentage of dual-fueled automobiles and light duty trucks for sale in the United States. The \"Biofuels Market Expansion Act of 2011\" mandates manufacturers to produce dual-fueled vehicles with specific percentages for different model years. An exception is made for vehicles running solely on electricity. Additionally, a new section is added to the code, and regulations must be established within a year of the Act's enactment. The \"Blender Pump Grant Program\" defines terms like blender pump, E-85 fuel, ethanol fuel blend, and major fuel distributor for dispensing different gasoline-ethanol blends. The \"Blender Pump Grant Program\" defines terms like major fuel distributor as a person owning a refinery or directly marketing its output, and Secretary as the Secretary of Energy. Grants are provided for installing blender pump fuel infrastructure and supporting direct retailers of ethanol fuel blends. The Blender Pump Grant Program allows for grants to install blender pump fuel infrastructure and support direct retailers of ethanol fuel blends, with a federal share of up to 50% of the project cost. Major fuel distributors are not eligible for these grants, and recipients must offer ethanol fuel blends for sale for at least 2 years. The Federal share of project costs under this subsection can be up to 50%. If a facility receiving a grant does not offer ethanol fuel blends for sale for at least 2 years, they must repay the grant amount. Appropriations authorized for this program are $50 million for 2012, $100 million for 2013, $200 million for 2014, and $300 million for 2015. The Secretary is authorized to use appropriated funds for fiscal years 2012 to 2016 for the installation of blender pumps by major fuel distributors at owned and branded stations. This includes E-85 fuel and ethanol fuel blends. The term 'ethanol fuel blend' refers to a gasoline blend containing 0-85% denatured ethanol. A 'major fuel distributor' is defined as a person owning or directly marketing refinery output, excluding those with less than 50 retail fueling stations. The 'Secretary' refers to the Secretary of Energy. The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with other agencies, will require major fuel distributors to install blender pumps dispensing E-85 fuel for at least 5 years. The Secretary of Energy will require major fuel distributors to install blender pumps dispensing E-85 fuel and ethanol blends for a minimum of 5 years at specified stations. The applicable percentage will be determined based on a table for majority-owned and branded stations. The Secretary of Energy will mandate major fuel distributors to install blender pumps dispensing E-85 fuel and ethanol blends at specified stations. The required percentage will increase over the years, starting at 10% in 2014 and reaching 50% in 2020 and beyond. The Secretary of Energy mandates major fuel distributors to install blender pumps dispensing E-85 fuel and ethanol blends at specified stations, ensuring financial responsibility. The Secretary mandates major fuel distributors to assume financial responsibility for installing blender pumps and necessary equipment to ensure proper function. Production credits are given for exceeding blender pump installation requirements at owned and branded stations. The major fuel distributor earns credits for exceeding blender pump installation requirements at owned and branded stations, which can be used in the following three consecutive calendar years. Credits can also be traded to other major fuel distributors to help them meet the installation requirements. Major fuel distributors can sell credits to other distributors to help them meet installation requirements, but these credits cannot be used to fulfill geographic distribution requirements. Loan guarantees are provided for projects constructing renewable fuel pipelines. Loan guarantees are provided for projects constructing renewable fuel pipelines, with the definition of renewable fuel and renewable fuel pipelines clarified and the guarantee amount set at 80 percent of the project cost. Loan guarantees are available for projects building renewable fuel pipelines, with the guarantee amount set at 80 percent of the project cost. Additionally, there are amendments to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to facilitate the rapid deployment of renewable fuel pipelines. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 has been amended to include the installation of infrastructure for clean energy technologies, such as renewable fuel pipelines, with loan guarantees covering 80 percent of the cost. The Secretary of Energy is required to promulgate regulations within 90 days of the Act's enactment to implement these changes."
