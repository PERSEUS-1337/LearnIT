    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 399.16 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to allow various electricity products from eligible renewable energy resources within the WECC transmission network service area to comply with renewables portfolio standard procurement requirements. These products may be differentiated based on their grid operation impacts and must meet project viability principles for a balanced portfolio procurement. Eligible renewable energy resource electricity products meeting specific criteria, including first point of interconnection with a California balancing authority or agreement to transfer electricity dynamically. Unbundled renewable energy credits earned by entities excluded from the definition of an electrical corporation also qualify. Unbundled renewable energy credits can be earned by entities excluded from being classified as an electrical corporation. The credits must be generated by a facility meeting specific criteria and used at a wastewater treatment facility owned by a public entity. The renewable energy credit requirements include the generating facility meeting specific criteria, the electricity being used at a public entity-owned wastewater treatment facility, and the facility's generating capability being put into service after January 1, 2016. The wastewater treatment facility must not participate in a specific bioenergy program, and eligible renewable energy resources must be scheduled into a California balancing authority. Retail sellers must meet specific requirements for procurement credited towards each compliance period, including a percentage of eligible renewable energy resource electricity products meeting product content requirements. The wastewater treatment facility should not participate in a bioenergy program, and eligible renewable energy resources must be scheduled into a California balancing authority. The compliance requirements for eligible renewable energy resource electricity products associated with contracts executed after June 1, 2010, include specific percentage targets for different compliance periods. Retail sellers must ensure that a certain percentage of these products meet product content requirements, with varying limits for different compliance periods. Renewable energy resource contracts executed after June 1, 2010, must also meet specific product content requirements. Electric service providers have restrictions on crediting eligible renewable energy resource electricity products towards each compliance period for contracts executed after January 13, 2011. For electric service providers, restrictions on crediting eligible renewable energy resource electricity products to each compliance period apply to contracts executed after January 13, 2011. Contracts executed before June 1, 2010, count towards procurement requirements if certain conditions are met, including approval by the commission and no increase in capacity or generation quantities through contract amendments. Any contract changes post June 1, 2010, must not increase capacity or generation quantities. The contract duration can be extended if it originally had a 15-year procurement commitment. Retail sellers can request a reduction in procurement content requirements, but the commission cannot reduce the obligation below 65% after December 31, 2016. A public entity selling renewable energy credits cannot make marketing claims about the renewable attributes of the electricity that earned the credit. The renewable attributes are transferred to the purchaser. The electricity generated and sold by the public entity must be included in the total retail sales for calculating renewables portfolio standard procurement obligations."
