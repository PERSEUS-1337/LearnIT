    "content": "FIFRA requires EPA to review and register pesticide products, establish maximum limits for pesticide residues in food, and assess fees on pesticide manufacturers for regulatory activities. Congress has authorized fee collection since 1954, with additional appropriations funding most costs. PRIA 1, enacted in 2004, established the current pesticide fee framework. The Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2003 (PRIA 1) established a fee framework for pesticide regulation activities, modifying provisions from 1988. It authorized the collection of maintenance and registration service fees to cover costs associated with EPA review of pesticide registrations. PRIA 1 set fee amounts for different review activities and required EPA to complete reviews within specific timeframes. In 2007, PRIA 2 reauthorized and amended these provisions. The Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2003 (PRIA 1) established a fee framework for pesticide regulation activities, authorizing the collection of maintenance and registration service fees. PRIA 2 in 2007 reauthorized and amended the fee framework, adding new application categories and adjusting fee amounts. PRIA 3 in 2012 further amended the fee framework, with the current framework summarized in the following sections. The authority to collect pesticide maintenance fees expires on September 30, 2018, as per the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018. The authority to collect pesticide maintenance fees, as amended by PRIA 3 and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, expires on September 30, 2018. FIFRA Section 4 sets annual maximum maintenance fees per registrant based on the number of registrations held, with a cap on the aggregate amount collected annually. Registrants failing to pay required fees may have their pesticide registration canceled. Small businesses receive fee reductions, and certain public health pesticides are exempt from maintenance fees. Collected fees are deposited in the \"Reregistration and Expedited Processing Fund\" for EPA's use in offsetting costs. The EPA collects maintenance fees from pesticide registrants, which are deposited into the \"Reregistration and Expedited Processing Fund\" for offsetting costs. These fees are used for evaluating inert ingredients, expedited processing of applications, reevaluating registered pesticides, and enhancing information systems capabilities. The authority to collect registration service fees is set to phase out starting at the end of FY2018, with a potential 70% reduction in fees for FY2019 if not extended. The authority to collect registration service fees under FIFRA Section 33, as amended by PRIA 3, may be reduced by 70% for FY2019 and could expire at the end of the fiscal year. This section establishes fee amounts for various actions requested by applicants, with specified timeframes for completion. Fee reductions are available for small businesses and applications for minor pesticide uses, while certain entities are exempt from paying fees. The EPA may waive registration service fees for \"minor uses\" of pesticides and applications in the \"public interest\" or by governmental entities. The authority to collect these fees must be provided by annual appropriations, with exceptions for certain years. Collected fees are deposited in the \"Pesticide Registration Fund\" in the U.S. Treasury. The EPA is authorized to assess registration service fees for the fiscal year, with collected fees deposited in the \"Pesticide Registration Fund.\" Fee receipts can be used for various purposes without fiscal year limitation, including covering application review costs, worker protection activities, partnership grants, and pesticide safety education programs. The Inspector General of EPA is required to annually audit the fund. The EPA conducts scientific and regulatory activities for worker protection, awards worker protection partnership grants, and carries out a pesticide safety education program. FIFRA mandates annual audits of the Reregistration and Expedited Processing Fund and Pesticide Registration Fund by the Inspector General. Congress appropriated $8.89 billion for EPA in FY2018, with specific funding for the EPA Office of Pesticide Programs not specified. EPA is authorized to assess registration service fees for various purposes. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 authorizes EPA to assess registration service fees for pesticide program activities. Collected fees range from $21.4 million to $28.7 million for maintenance and $10.6 million to $18.6 million for registration services annually. Congress extended fee collection authority through FY2018 appropriations, with reauthorization legislation pending resolution. Congress initiated legislative efforts to reauthorize the collection of maintenance and registration service fees in 2017. The House and Senate have passed separate versions of reauthorization legislation, summarized below, that await the resolution of differences. Both versions of H.R. 1029 would reauthorize the collection of maintenance fees and registration service fees through FY2023 and FY2025, respectively; increase the cap on annual maintenance fees per registrant by 12% and the aggregate for all maintenance fees from $27.8 million per fiscal year to an average amount of $31.0 million per fiscal year. The Senate amendment to H.R. 1029 would revise registration service fee amounts, add new actions for fee assessment, and adjust time frames for EPA review. It also requires EPA to implement two final rules by October 1, 2021, with one exception. EPA had previously issued these rules during the prior administration. The Senate amendment to H.R. 1029 would require EPA to implement two final rules by October 1, 2021, with one exception. One rule addresses agricultural worker protection standards, while the other focuses on certified pesticide applicators. Additionally, the amendment directs the U.S. Government Accountability Office to publish a report on designated use by October 1, 2021. The Senate amendment to H.R. 1029 aims to enhance protection for pesticide applicators, the public, and the environment from risks associated with restricted use pesticides. It also requires a report on designated representatives' impact on pesticide application information and worker safety by October 1, 2021. The House has requested a conference with the Senate to reconcile differences in the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018. The House requested a conference with the Senate on H.R. 2, the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018, to resolve differences in PRIA reauthorization. Disagreements between the House and Senate on EPA administration and enforcement of FIFRA regulations have delayed final enactment."
