    "content": "The \"Teachers in the Classroom Act\" may be cited as the short title. The findings section is included in the Act. Congress finds that there is a record high enrollment in elementary and secondary schools, with an expected increase of over a million students in 1998. This trend is projected to continue for the next decade, requiring the hiring of 150,000 additional teachers. The increase in student enrollment will particularly impact high poverty urban and rural areas, as well as states with rapid population growth. The rapid population growth is leading to a high enrollment in elementary and secondary schools, requiring the hiring of 150,000 additional teachers in the next decade. Research shows that students benefit from smaller class sizes, and it is crucial to adequately educate children for the competitive global economy. Improving the learning environment for every student is a key goal. Congress needs to fund positions for teachers without adding to the Federal bureaucracy, deficit, or debt, in order to adequately educate and prepare America's children for the competitive global economy. Providing resources to keep pace with growing enrollment and reducing classroom sizes are important objectives. The grant program is established to fund teacher positions without increasing the Federal bureaucracy, deficit, or debt, to ensure the education of America's children for the global economy. The Secretary of Education can award grants to Governors for hiring teachers to reduce overcrowded classes. Governors must apply to the Secretary to be eligible for the grant, and local educational agencies must establish a trust fund for the received funds and use them to hire new teachers within 2 years. The Act requires funds to be deposited in a trust fund account and used to hire new teachers within 2 years. The agency must follow accounting practices, achieve a net gain in teachers, review personnel performance annually, and repay any unspent funds to the State. Personnel hired must be obligated for a maximum of one year. The agency must hire qualified personnel for a maximum of one year, repay any unspent funds to the State within 27 months, use funds to supplement non-Federal sources for student education, and apply for funding annually from the Governor.
