Penalties collected are deposited in the Air Pollution Control Fund. Section 43151 of the Health and Safety Code prohibits the sale, import, or use of uncertified motor vehicles or engines in California. The article does not apply to a vehicle acquired to replace a damaged or stolen vehicle, a vehicle transferred by inheritance or court decree, or a vehicle sold after a specific legislative amendment date if it was registered before that date.

Manufacturers or distributors may also be required to pay the penalty and ensure compliance with the laws to continue selling vehicles in the state. A dealer violating emission control laws may face a civil penalty of up to $10,000 per violation, with adjustments for inflation. The penalty recovery action can be initiated by the Attorney General on behalf of the state board in the superior court. Penalties collected will be deposited in the Air Pollution Control Fund.

The maximum penalty amounts will be adjusted for inflation based on the California Consumer Price Index, with penalties collected going into the General Fund. Any penalty recovered pursuant to this section shall be deposited into the General Fund.
