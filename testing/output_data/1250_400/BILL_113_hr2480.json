The \"Nurse and Health Care Worker Protection Act of 2013\" highlights the high number of musculoskeletal disorders among nurses and nursing assistants due to patient lifting, transferring, and repositioning injuries. These injuries lead to chronic back pain and significant health impairments for healthcare workers, causing many to leave the profession. Patient safety is also compromised as a result. Many nurses suffer from chronic back pain, with 38 percent requiring leave from work. Patient safety is compromised during manual lifting, transferring, and repositioning. Implementing patient handling technology reduces injuries among nursing staff and improves patient care in healthcare facilities. Implementing safe patient handling technology and practices in healthcare facilities has led to a significant decrease in injuries among nursing staff and healthcare workers. This has resulted in reduced lost work days, staff turnover, and workers' compensation costs for musculoskeletal disorders. Several States have also implemented standards for safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention, showing the feasibility and success of such programs. Establishing these standards for direct-care registered nurses and other healthcare workers is crucial. Establishing safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standards for healthcare workers is crucial for protecting their health and safety, addressing the nursing shortage, and improving patient safety. The success of these programs at the facility and State level demonstrates the feasibility of such standards. The Safe Patient Handling, Mobility, and Injury Prevention Standard is established to protect healthcare workers' health and safety, address the nursing shortage, and improve patient safety in facilities receiving Medicare and Medicaid funds. The Secretary of Labor must promulgate an interim final standard on safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention within 1 year of the Act's enactment. The standard aims to prevent musculoskeletal disorders for healthcare workers, including registered nurses, by using engineering controls and mechanical technology to minimize manual patient handling injuries. The interim final standard on safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention requires health care employers to develop and implement a program within 6 months. This program includes hazard identification, risk assessments, and control measures to minimize manual handling injuries for healthcare workers. The final standard mandates healthcare employers to establish a safe patient handling program within 6 months, including hazard identification and risk assessments. Additionally, employers must purchase and provide appropriate equipment within 2 years and involve healthcare workers in program development. Each health care employer must involve health care workers in developing and implementing a safe patient handling program, including purchasing technology and equipment. Employers are required to establish a data tracking and review program to analyze the implementation of the program and address instances where safe patient handling measures were not followed. Each health care employer must involve health care workers in developing and implementing a safe patient handling program, including purchasing technology and equipment. Employers are required to establish a data tracking and review program to analyze the implementation of the program and address instances where safe patient handling measures were not followed. Health care employers should also consider incorporating safe patient handling technology into new facility design or remodeling. Additionally, employers must provide education and training to health care workers on safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention policies, technology, equipment, and devices on an ongoing basis. Health care employers must provide training on safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention policies, technology, and equipment annually. Training should be interactive and hands-on, conducted by knowledgeable individuals. Employers must also post a notice explaining safe patient handling rights and policies. Annual evaluation required for health care employers to assess safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention program implementation, including procedures, technology, equipment, and injury assessment. Evaluation involves nurses, healthcare workers, representatives, and collective bargaining agents. The evaluation of safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention technology involves nurses, healthcare workers, and their representatives. Health care employers must take corrective action based on the evaluation. Employees have the right to refuse unsafe assignments if they believe it violates safety standards and could result in harm. The Secretary of Labor will conduct unscheduled inspections to ensure compliance with safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standards as outlined in the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. The Safe Patient Handling, Mobility, and Injury Prevention Standard will apply to facilities receiving Medicare and Medicaid funds. The Safe Patient Handling, Mobility, and Injury Prevention Standard is being amended to include health care facilities receiving Medicare and Medicaid funds. The amendments specify the inclusion of safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standards in existing regulations. SEC. 4. NONPREEMPTION. This Act does not preempt state laws unless they conflict with this Act. It also does not diminish the authority of states to provide greater protections for employees. Rights of health care workers under federal and state laws are retained. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. For purposes of this Act, a direct-care registered nurse is defined as an individual licensed to provide bedside care or outpatient services. An employee includes health care workers and independent contractors. Employment covers services provided under a contract. Handling involves physical actions like lifting or moving patients. A health care employer is defined as an entity employing health care workers. A health care worker is defined as an individual assigned by a health care employer to engage in patient handling, including direct-care registered nurses and other health care workers. A lift team consists of health care workers with specialized training in safe patient handling. The term \"lift team\" refers to health care workers with specialized training in safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention practices and technology."
