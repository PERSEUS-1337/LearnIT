    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Equity in Government Compensation Act of 2010\". Congressional findings are also included in the Act. The Congress found that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government-sponsored enterprises, were central to the 2008 financial crisis, leading to a severe economic decline and job losses. In response, the Treasury Department placed the GSEs in conservatorship and established a $200 billion facility to support them. The Obama Administration took significant steps to support Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac during the financial crisis, including purchasing senior preferred stock and removing limits on federal funds to cover losses. This resulted in taxpayers owning at least 80% of the GSEs, with the government using them for federal housing policy. The Obama Administration's support for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac during the financial crisis led to taxpayers owning 80% of the GSEs. The government now uses them for federal housing policy, making it unlikely they will return to private ownership. The Congressional Budget Office considers them government entities, expected to be a long-term burden on taxpayers. Despite this, in 2009, the Treasury Department approved $6 million compensation packages for the CEOs of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The Treasury Department and the FHFA approved $6 million compensation packages for the CEOs of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2010, including $2 million in incentive pay each. This is significantly higher than the annual compensation of the President and Cabinet Secretary. Additionally, multi-million dollar compensation packages were approved for other top executives, paid in cash instead of stock options. FHFA's Strategic Plan includes a commitment for the GSEs to operate safely and soundly. FHFA determined no executive officer of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac entitled to cash bonus or long-term incentive awards for 2008. FHFA's Strategic Plan commits GSEs to safe operation. Section 1318(c) permits Director to withhold executive officer compensation for review. SEC. 3. REASONABLE COMPENSATION. The Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency will suspend 2010 compensation packages for executive officers of the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. Instead, a new compensation system will be established based on government pay rates. Additionally, there is a call for executive officers to return 2009 compensation to the Secretary of the Treasury. The executive officers of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are required to return any excess compensation earned in 2009 to the Secretary of the Treasury, in line with the Executive Schedule pay rates. The Secretary will transfer these amounts to a special account to reduce the national debt."
