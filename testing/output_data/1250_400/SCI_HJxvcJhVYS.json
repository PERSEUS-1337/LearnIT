A proposed method uses Bayesian optimization to approximate inference by applying Stein variational gradient descent on estimates from a Gaussian process model. This approach shows promise in likelihood-free inference for reinforcement learning environments. The method demonstrates likelihood-free inference for estimating parameters of a physical system using computational models. Efficiency challenges in simulations are addressed by constructing conditional density estimators or learning approximations to the likelihood function. The use of simulations involves constructing conditional density estimators or learning approximations to the likelihood function, followed by running Markov chain Monte Carlo. An active learning approach using Bayesian optimization reduces the number of simulator runs. A Thompson sampling strategy is used to refine variational approximations to a black-box posterior, proposing parameters for new simulations through Stein variational gradient descent over Gaussian process samples. The approach presented involves using a Thompson sampling strategy to refine variational approximations to a black-box posterior. Parameters for new simulations are proposed using Stein variational gradient descent over Gaussian process samples. The goal is to estimate a distribution that approximates a posterior distribution over simulator parameters given observations from a target system, using a Bayesian optimization approach to minimize the discrepancy between the distributions. The approach involves using Bayesian optimization to minimize the discrepancy between distributions of simulator outputs and observations. A black-box approach is used with a GP model, Thompson sampling acquisition function, and kernel herding procedure to optimize simulator parameters. Stein variational gradient descent is applied directly to learn the distribution q. The approach involves using Bayesian optimization with a GP model and Thompson sampling to minimize the discrepancy between simulator outputs and observations. Stein variational gradient descent is used to learn the distribution q directly. The GP approximates the expensive and non-differentiable discrepancy, allowing for the application of SVGD in the optimization loop. Thompson sampling is used to select candidate distributions qn based on GP posterior sampling. The proposed approach involves using Thompson sampling with a GP model to select candidate distributions qn. This allows for the application of SVGD in the optimization loop, where the variational distribution q is represented by a set of particles forming an empirical distribution. The acquisition function for a SSGP with mean function \u00b5 0 and feature map \u03c6 is defined based on an approximation to the target posterior. SVGD represents the variational distribution q as particles that are optimized through perturbations using a SSGP kernel. Gradients of logp n are used to guide particles to local maxima and encourage diversification. Sample functions are defined for SSGP models with differentiable mean functions, and updates to the GP model are made using samples from the distribution q n. The gradients of logp n guide particles to local maxima and encourage diversification in SSGP models. Using a large number of particles improves exploration of the posterior surface, but optimal subsampling is needed to select query parameters for simulations. Kernel herding constructs a set of samples that minimizes error in empirical estimates under a given distribution q. Optimal subsampling of query parameters for simulations is achieved using kernel herding, which minimizes error in empirical estimates under a given distribution q. The procedure involves selecting informative samples based on the GP posterior kernel, enhancing exploration of the posterior surface in SSGP models. The distributional Bayesian optimisation (DBO) algorithm uses the GP posterior kernel to encode information for the model. It provides an embedding for q based on previously observed locations in the GP data. The method is evaluated against mixture density networks (MDNs) in synthetic data scenarios, specifically in the OpenAI Gym's 3 cart-pole environment. The experimental setup includes generating a dataset of 10 trajectories with fixed physics parameters and evaluating the discrepancy between simulated and real data. Further details are provided in Appendix B. The study presents a Bayesian optimization approach for inverse problems on simulator parameters, demonstrating its potential for reinforcement learning applications. Results show that distributional Bayesian optimization outperforms MDN in terms of posterior approximation and sample efficiency. Future work includes scalability improvements. The study introduces a Bayesian optimization method for reinforcement learning applications, showing its superiority in sample efficiency compared to other inference methods. Future work involves scalability improvements and theoretical analysis. The method allows for fast incremental updates in the GP posterior. The study presents a Bayesian optimization method for reinforcement learning, demonstrating its efficiency in sample utilization. Gijsberts and Metta (2013) suggest using Cholesky factors to update the GP posterior with O(M^2) time complexity, independent of the data points N."
