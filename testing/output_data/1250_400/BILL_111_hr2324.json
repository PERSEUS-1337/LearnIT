The Congress finds that approximately 5,200 traditional gun shows are held annually in the US, attracting thousands of attendees, including Federal firearms licensees and unlicensed sellers. Gun shows provide easy access for criminals and prohibited persons to obtain firearms without background checks or traceable records. The term \"gun show\" is defined as an event with 50 or more firearms offered for sale, exchange, or transfer, affecting interstate or foreign commerce. The term \"gun show\" is defined as an event where firearms are offered for sale, exchange, or transfer, affecting interstate or foreign commerce. This definition excludes offers or exhibits of firearms from an individual's personal collection at their private residence, as well as events with less than 100 firearms offered for sale by private, not-for-profit organizations for hunting activities attended only by members and their immediate families. Gun show vendors are individuals not licensed under section 923 who exhibit, sell, or exchange firearms at gun shows. Chapter 44 of the title is amended to include regulations for gun show operators, requiring them to be at least 21 years old. Gun show operators must meet certain requirements, including being at least 21 years old, not prohibited from handling firearms, not violating any laws, and registering with the Attorney General. Gun show operators must register with the Attorney General, provide fingerprints and a photograph, certify that they meet requirements, disclose all necessary information truthfully, and pay a registration fee determined by the Attorney General. Operating a gun show without meeting these requirements is unlawful. Gun show operators must notify the Attorney General of the details of the gun show and the vendors, verify vendors' identities with valid identification documents, and require vendors to sign certain documents before the show begins. Gun show operators must verify vendors' identities with valid identification documents, require vendors to sign certain documents, and notify attendees of the requirements of this chapter. Recordkeeping of compliance with these requirements is also mandatory. Gun show operators must maintain records to demonstrate compliance with regulations set by the Attorney General. It is unlawful for unlicensed individuals to transfer firearms at a gun show without a licensed dealer documenting the firearm details. Gun show operators must keep records of firearm transactions, including make, model, and serial number, as required by the Attorney General. Unlicensed individuals cannot transfer firearms at a gun show without a licensed dealer recording the transaction details and notifying both parties about the background check system. Licensees must submit a report to the Attorney General within 10 days of a firearm transfer, including make, model, and serial number. They must also retain a record of the transfer in their permanent business records. The Attorney General requires licensees to submit a report within 10 days of a firearm transfer, including specific details. Violations of the transfer regulations can result in fines and imprisonment. Gun show vendors are not subject to additional recordkeeping requirements under this section. The Attorney General may impose fines and imprisonment for violations of firearm transfer regulations, with potential registration suspension or revocation for repeat offenders. Additionally, a civil fine of up to $10,000 can be imposed. The Attorney General has the authority to inspect gun show operators' records without a warrant to ensure compliance with firearm transfer regulations. Additionally, reports of multiple sales at gun shows must be provided to the authorities. The Attorney General can inspect gun show operators' records without a warrant to enforce firearm transfer regulations. Increased penalties are imposed for serious recordkeeping violations by licensees, including fines and imprisonment for false statements or violations of firearm laws. Violations of criminal background check requirements can result in fines and imprisonment under Title 18. Penalties are increased for serious offenses related to firearm laws, with potential imprisonment up to 10 years for certain violations. The Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives may hire additional personnel to inspect gun shows. Biennial reports on firearm sales at gun shows and background check compliance must be submitted to Congress. The section discusses the sale of firearms at gun shows, including background check requirements and resources needed for enforcement. It also includes recommendations for improving the process to prevent firearms from being sold without background checks. The effective date for this section is 180 days after the enactment of the Act."
