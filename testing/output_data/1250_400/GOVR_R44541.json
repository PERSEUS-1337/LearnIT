    "content": "Trade-based money laundering (TBML) involves disguising proceeds of crime through trade transactions to legitimize their illicit origin. Financial institutions can be involved in TBML schemes when used to settle international trade transactions. The U.S. Department of the Treasury issued reports on money laundering in June 2015, highlighting TBML as a challenging form of money laundering. TBML schemes can launder billions of dollars annually, with over 17,000 Suspicious Activity Reports describing potential TBML activity totaling more than $276 billion between 2004 and 2009. Criminal organizations and terrorist financiers utilize the international financial system and physical cash movement for illicit activities. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) reported over 17,000 Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) detailing potential trade-based money laundering (TBML) activities totaling $276 billion between 2004 and 2009. Criminal organizations and terrorist financiers exploit the international financial system and cash couriers to conceal their illicit activities. They utilize complex foreign exchange transactions, trade financing arrangements, and the mingling of legitimate and illicit funds to obscure transactions. Money launderers also exploit vulnerabilities in letters of credit and other financial mechanisms for cross-border trade to launder funds. TBML techniques vary in complexity and are often combined with other money laundering methods. Money launderers exploit vulnerabilities in trade transactions, including letters of credit, to launder funds. TBML techniques involve misrepresenting goods' prices, quality, or quantity during cross-border trade. Over- and under-invoicing goods and services is a common method used to shift funds between exporters and importers. Over- and under-invoicing goods and services in cross-border trade can shift funds between exporters and importers. Collusion between parties is required for these transactions, which can have significant tax implications. Complex products and those in supply chains are more likely to be used in these activities to complicate determining true market value. Multiple invoicing for the same transaction can be used by money launderers or terrorist financiers to justify multiple payments through various financial institutions. Money launderers can manipulate goods and services transactions by providing multiple invoices, over- or under-shipping goods, and falsely describing goods to justify multiple payments and complicate detection efforts. Collusion between parties can lead to phantom transactions that banks may be unaware of. Exporters and importers collude to create phantom transactions by processing shipping and customs documents without actually shipping goods. Money launderers manipulate the quality or type of goods to create discrepancies in value. The Black Market Peso Exchange (BMPE) is a classic scheme used to launder drug proceeds. Trade-based money laundering (TBML) is a common method used by terrorist organizations, but is less understood by academics and policymakers. Trade-based money laundering (TBML) is a widely recognized method used by terrorist organizations to launder illicit proceeds through manipulating trade transactions. TBML can have significant consequences for international commerce and government revenue, with the National Money Laundering Risk Assessment highlighting its destructive impact. Transnational criminal organizations may dump imported goods purchased with illicit funds at below-market prices to expedite the money laundering process, putting legitimate businesses at a competitive disadvantage. Transnational criminal organizations may dump imported goods purchased with illicit funds at below-market prices to expedite money laundering, creating barriers to entrepreneurship and reducing tax revenue for governments. Global trends in trade have been exploited by drug smugglers and criminal organizations to hide illegal gains, taking advantage of advances in communication, transportation, and digital technology. Global markets offer criminal organizations new opportunities to diversify into profitable activities with low detection risks, as reported by the OECD. Illicit trade adapts to global market trends, creating economies of scale and efficiencies for criminal groups. This poses challenges for law enforcement in tracking illegal financial flows. The OECD reported that global markets provide criminal organizations with opportunities to diversify into illicit activities, creating economies of scale and efficiencies. This poses challenges for law enforcement in tracking illegal financial flows, with potential wide-ranging economic and development consequences. Criminal organizations and terrorist groups can exploit the international trade system with low risk of detection, as identified by FATF. The vulnerabilities of the international trade system include the enormous volume of trade flows and the complexity of foreign exchange transactions. According to FATF and FinCEN, vulnerabilities in the international trade system include the enormous volume of trade flows, complexity of foreign exchange transactions, and limited resources for detecting illegal trade transactions. TBML activity is growing in volume and global reach, with Mexico, China, Panama, the Dominican Republic, and Venezuela being identified as key countries involved in potential TBML activity. TBML activity was most frequently identified in transactions involving Mexico, China, and Panama, potentially linked to the Panama Colon Free Trade Zone. The Dominican Republic and Venezuela showed rapid growth in potential TBML activity. According to the U.S. Department of State, TBML concerns have been reported in various countries including Afghanistan, Australia, Belize, Brazil, Cambodia, Canada, China, Colombia, Greece, Guatemala, Hong Kong, India, Iran, Iraq, Japan, Kenya, Lebanon, Mexico, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, the Philippines, Singapore, Saint Maarten, Switzerland, Taiwan, UAE, Uruguay, Venezuela, and the West Bank and Gaza. TBML is associated with significant losses in customs and tax revenue, circumvention of capital restrictions, and corruption of customs authorities. The State Department's Country Reports on Terrorism 2015 highlighted Trinidad and Tobago as a location where trade-based money laundering (TBML) occurs. TBML is linked to various illicit activities such as customs and tax revenue losses, corruption, and exploitation of free trade zones. While some known terrorist groups have used TBML, the Treasury Department's National Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment stated that it is not a dominant method for terrorist financing. Assessment concluded that TBML is not a dominant method for terrorist financing. U.S. law enforcement investigations show that physical movement of cash and movement through the banking system are the primary methods used for financing terrorists. TBML accounted for only 15 percent of cases, with concerns raised in Tunisia and Syria regarding its use by hawala brokers in conjunction with corrupt officials. The State Department's latest Country Reports on Terrorism highlighted concerns about trade-based money laundering (TBML) in Tunisia and Syria, particularly its use by hawala brokers with corrupt officials. Hawala is an informal fund transfer method common in the Middle East and South Asia. It involves a network of trusted money brokers who facilitate transfers without using formal banking systems. While TBML is not the primary method for terrorist financing, it is still a concern due to its lack of transparency and vulnerability to abuse by terrorist groups. Unregulated hawala systems are preferred for their quickness, reliability, and lower cost, but are seen as lacking transparency by government authorities and vulnerable to abuse by terrorist groups. The State Department's 2016 report identified specific countries vulnerable to TBML/FT schemes, such as Afghanistan and Lebanon. In Lebanon, individuals are involved in a TBML scheme involving trade in vehicles to launder drug proceeds linked to Hezbollah. U.S. law enforcement identified money wires from Jordanian and Lebanese entities to domestic vehicle dealerships for vehicle purchases exported to Lebanon. In the United States, money wires from Jordanian and Lebanese entities are used to purchase vehicles from domestic dealerships, which are then exported to Lebanon and Jordan, sometimes with weapons hidden inside. The ultimate destination of these vehicles is unknown, and the proceeds may be directed back to Hezbollah in Lebanon. TBML schemes are also prevalent in Paraguay's Tri-Border Area, where the cross-border cigarette smuggling market is used for money laundering, benefiting criminal organizations and potentially terrorist groups. In the United Arab Emirates, TBML schemes may support sanctions-evasion networks and terrorist groups in various countries. The United States sees money wires from Jordanian and Lebanese entities used to buy vehicles from domestic dealerships, which are then exported to Lebanon and Jordan, possibly with weapons hidden inside. The ultimate destination of these vehicles is unknown, with proceeds potentially going back to Hezbollah in Lebanon. TBML schemes are also prevalent in Paraguay's Tri-Border Area, where cross-border cigarette smuggling is used for money laundering, benefiting criminal organizations and potentially terrorist groups. In the United Arab Emirates, TBML schemes may support sanctions-evasion networks and terrorist groups in various countries. The Lebanese Canadian Bank (LCB) facilitated money laundering schemes involving wire transfers to purchase used cars in the United States, which were then shipped to West Africa and proceeds repatriated to Lebanon. Another scheme involved laundering proceeds from Asian-supplied consumer goods through a BMPE-styled scheme. LCB's banking license was revoked in 2011, and its assets were sold to Lebanese Societ\u00e9 Generale de Banque au Liban. In the late 2000s, owners of the Los Angeles-based toy wholesaler Woody Toys, Inc. received cash payments from Colombian and Mexican narcotics trafficking, which were laundered through a BMPE scheme. The cash deposits were placed into the company's bank account in small amounts to avoid reporting requirements. The toy company used the funds to purchase toys from China, which were then exported to Colombia, with the proceeds used to reimburse the drug traffickers. The toy company received cash payments from Colombian and Mexican narcotics trafficking, which were laundered through a BMPE scheme. Employees had connections to a similar scheme at Angel Toy Company. Law enforcement benefited from information sharing between the United States and Colombia through Trade Transparency Units. Another money laundering scheme in the early 2000s involved cash couriers, money transfer services, hawala, and trade finance mechanisms. In the early 2000s, a money laundering scheme involved cash couriers, money transfer services, hawala, and trade finance mechanisms managed by an Indian national in Dubai. The individual used his businesses to open letters of credit with inflated values for affiliated exporters in India, along with arranging bogus trade documents to satisfy banks. The scheme also involved drug trafficking funds. The Indian national in Dubai used his businesses' connections with banks to transmit inflated value LCs to exporters in India, along with arranging bogus trade documents. Drug trafficking funds were also involved in remitting money through the financial system disguised as trade financing. The scheme included moving funds offshore through hawala operators and falsifying trade documents to export banned goods from India. U.S. government policy responses to address TBML are also discussed. The Indian national in Dubai used his network of businesses in India to export banned goods by falsely describing and undervaluing them in trade documents. Hawala operators were used to settle the price difference. U.S. government policy responses to tackle trade-based money laundering include participation in the Financial Action Task Force and regulatory measures by the Treasury Department. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) conducts annual self-assessments and mutual evaluations on member compliance with guidelines, with the power to suspend non-compliant countries. Established in 1989 to combat money laundering, FATF issued 40 recommendations in 1990. The U.S. leads efforts at FATF through the Treasury Department's Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes, with support from various government agencies. The United States strongly supports the FATF, with Treasury staff members leading the U.S. delegation. The FATF adopted revised recommendations in 2012 and 2015, integrating CFT guidelines and addressing new threats. The new mandate aims to enhance global surveillance of criminal and terrorist threats, strengthen partnerships with the private sector, and raise standards in low capacity countries. The FATF adopted revised recommendations in 2012 and 2015 to enhance global surveillance of criminal and terrorist threats, strengthen partnerships with the private sector, and raise standards in low capacity countries. The new mandate deepens global surveillance, builds stronger partnerships with the private sector, and supports efforts to raise standards, especially in low capacity countries. The revised recommendations address new and emerging threats, strengthen requirements for higher-risk situations, and enhance transparency related to beneficial ownership and control of legal entities. Recommendations to counter TBML are not included in the current set of FATF 40 Recommendations. The FATF has not included recommendations to counter trade-based money laundering (TBML) in its current set of 40 Recommendations. Despite recognizing the increased opportunities for abuse in the international trade and financing system, the FATF has issued stand-alone reports addressing TBML and best practices. Surveys show a lack of comprehensive data on the extent of TBML, attributed to jurisdictions not identifying it separately from money laundering and lacking specific training programs to detect TBML activities. The FATF recommends developing training programs to detect TBML. The FATF recommends developing specific training programs to detect trade-based money laundering (TBML) activities, as most jurisdictions lack training in this area. FinCEN issues advisories to financial institutions to red flag suspicious activities related to TBML, based on law enforcement experience. FinCEN issues advisories to financial institutions on detecting trade-based money laundering (TBML) activities, highlighting basic schemes and red flags. They emphasize the need for consistent reporting and mention delays in reporting suspected TBML. An updated advisory in May 2014 focused on increased TBML activity involving funnel accounts after restrictions on U.S. currency in Mexico. The advisory warns about increased TBML activity involving funnel accounts following restrictions on U.S. currency in Mexico. It outlines red flags associated with this activity by Mexican criminal organizations and mentions the use of Geographic Targeting Orders (GTOs) to combat TBML. GTOs impose recordkeeping and reporting requirements on financial institutions for a limited time to identify criminal activity. Violators may face civil or criminal penalties. In April 2015, FinCEN issued a GTO targeting Miami-based electronics exporters, requiring them to report cash transactions over $3,000 to combat TBML schemes by criminal organizations like Sinaloa and Los Zetas. The GTO was renewed in October 2015 with stricter reporting requirements. In October 2015, FinCEN issued a GTO targeting businesses in the Los Angeles Fashion District to combat BMPE schemes by Mexican and Colombian drug traffickers. This GTO lowered cash reporting to $3,000 and triggered additional recordkeeping requirements. FinCEN may require financial institutions to take special measures against money laundering concerns, ranging from enhanced due diligence to prohibiting certain accounts. In April 2013, FinCEN designated two Lebanese exchange houses, Halawi Exchange and Rmeiti Exchange, as primary money laundering concerns for their involvement in a TBML scheme. They facilitated transactions of used cars from the US to West Africa and provided money laundering services. The U.S. government designated Halawi Exchange and Rmeiti Exchange as primary money laundering concerns for their involvement in a TBML scheme related to the purchase of used cars in the U.S. for export to West Africa. They were also linked to money laundering services for an international narcotics trafficking network associated with Hezbollah. Homeland Security Investigations established the Trade Transparency Unit in 2004 to identify instances of TBML and other financial irregularities in trade data. The U.S. government, with support from the Department of State, established Trade Transparency Units (TTUs) to combat trade-based money laundering (TBML) and other financial crimes. These TTUs work to analyze trade data for instances of TBML, customs fraud, contraband smuggling, and tax evasion, leading to growing investigations and over $1 billion seized since their inception. The 2007 National Money Laundering Strategy prioritized attacking TBML domestically and internationally, with ICE-led TTUs facilitating data exchange among trading partners. The State Department aims to expand this network of TTUs globally, similar to the Egmont Group of FIUs. The 114th Congress has addressed TBML in hearings focusing on links with terrorist groups like Hezbollah and regional security in Latin America. Witnesses have questioned the effectiveness of U.S. and international efforts to combat TBML, including the role and resources of TTUs. There is interest in linking U.S. trade policy, free trade agreements, and mutual commitments to combat TBML. The 114th Congress has shown interest in the links between TBML and terrorist financing, particularly focusing on Hezbollah. In December 2015, the Congress enacted the Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015 to impose additional financial restrictions on Hezbollah-linked foreign financial institutions. This act also required reporting on Hezbollah's financing operations, including its use of TBML for raising and transferring funds. The Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015 directed the President to impose financial restrictions on Hezbollah-linked foreign financial institutions. President Obama committed to taking strong action against Hezbollah operatives. The Treasury Department plans to implement the Act robustly while preserving the Lebanese financial system. Congress may continue monitoring its implementation. The Treasury Department intends to implement the Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015 robustly while preserving the Lebanese financial system. Congress may monitor the Act's implementation and other financial tools to address trade-based money laundering (TBML). Hearings have discussed TBML, including the topic of Trading with the Enemy: Trade-Based Money Laundering is the Growth Industry in Terror Finance. Several committees, including the House Financial Services Committee and House Homeland Security Committee, have held hearings on various aspects of terrorist financing, such as examining funding streams from South America, current trends in terrorist financing, and efforts to prevent cultural genocide through the sale of cultural antiquities. The Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence, along with the House Financial Services Committee and Senate Armed Services Committee, have conducted hearings on terrorist financing trends, prevention of cultural genocide by ISIS, and defense budget reviews for fiscal year 2017. The House Financial Services Committee and Senate Judiciary Committee have conducted hearings on terrorist financing, trade-based money laundering, and immigration enforcement policies. The House Financial Services Committee and Senate Judiciary Committee have conducted hearings on terrorist financing, trade-based money laundering, and immigration enforcement policies. The hearings covered topics such as kidnapping, antiquities trafficking, private donations, border security, and global terrorism financing. The House Financial Services Committee, Senate Judiciary Committee, House Judiciary Committee, Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and House Foreign Affairs Committee have conducted hearings on terrorism financing, immigration enforcement, and transnational crime. The House Foreign Affairs Committee and House Financial Services Committee held hearings on Iran, Hezbollah, and the international financial system in March 2015."
