    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Dollar Bill Act of 2011\". Congress finds that it delegated the power to regulate the value of money to the Federal Reserve System, but the value of the US dollar has fallen dramatically and become unstable. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has not produced a stable and reliable value for the dollar, which hinders economic growth. The unstable US dollar hinders economic growth by increasing costs, reducing earnings, and damaging the country's standing in the world community. It also creates anxiety and uncertainty in financial markets and among the public. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is directed to make the value of the U.S. dollar equal to the price of gold on the COMEX exchange and maintain it at that level. They are also instructed to promote stable financial markets during and after the transition. Additionally, tax depreciation is addressed. \"Effective January 1, 2011, entities can expense 100 percent of capital investment for tax purposes in the year of investment. The Congressional Budget Office will calculate the impact on Federal revenues in a present value basis. A conflict of laws provision is also included.\" The Act supersedes conflicting provisions of the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978. It removes the Federal Reserve Bank's authority to pay earnings on reserves."
