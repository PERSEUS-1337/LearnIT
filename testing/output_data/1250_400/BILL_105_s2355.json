    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Truancy Prevention and Juvenile Crime Reduction Act of 1998\". Congress finds that truancy is a significant issue, with many negative consequences such as increased likelihood of dropping out of school, higher rates of criminal behavior, and a correlation with daytime burglary and vandalism. Additionally, a high percentage of violent juvenile crimes occur during school hours, and a large number of children arrested for crimes are truants. Some cities report as much as 70% of student absences are unexcused, with up to 4,000 absences per day in a single city. Truancy among children aged 13-16 is a significant issue, with up to 75% of those arrested for crimes being truants. Cities report high rates of unexcused student absences, reaching 4,000 per day. The social and economic costs of truancy are substantial, with truants and high school dropouts costing the nation $240 billion in lost earnings and foregone taxes. Effective prevention and intervention programs can improve school attendance and reduce daytime crime rates. The cost of truancy is significant, with truants and dropouts costing $240 billion in lost earnings and foregone taxes. Effective prevention programs are lacking targeted funding in current law.
