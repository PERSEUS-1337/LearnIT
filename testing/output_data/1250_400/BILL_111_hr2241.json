The Congress finds that during the Gulf War in 1991, Americans serving in the Armed Forces were captured, tortured, and subjected to horrendous acts by Saddam Hussein's regime. CBS News reporter Bob Simon and cameraman Roberto Alvarez were also kidnapped and tortured. Many US citizens were detained, beaten, and used as \"human shields\" by Iraq. Iraq was classified as a state sponsor of terrorism at the time. During the Gulf War in 1991, American POWs and civilian hostages suffered long-term physical, emotional, and mental damage due to brutal state-sponsored torture by Iraq. The Congress passed resolutions condemning Iraq's treatment of captured US service members and demanding adherence to the Geneva Convention for POWs. In 1996, Congress passed an amendment allowing torture victims like American POWs to seek compensation from terrorist countries, including Iraq. In 2002, Gulf War POWs filed claims in court seeking compensation for damages related to their torture by the Government of Iraq. In 2003, American POWs filed claims in the District of Columbia seeking compensation for damages related to their torture and abuse by the Government of Iraq. The POWs included various military personnel from different branches. In 2003, American POWs filed claims seeking compensation for torture by Iraq. Despite a judgment in their favor, they have not received payment due to a waiver granted by the President. In December 2001, the United States district court held Iraq liable for taking US citizens hostage after the invasion of Kuwait, awarding damages to 180 former hostages. On March 20, 2003, the President directed payment of judgments from blocked Iraqi accounts and confiscated remaining assets for Iraq reconstruction. Over 200 US citizens with similar claims are awaiting judgment in Vine v. Republic of Iraq. The Vine v. Republic of Iraq case involves over 200 US citizens seeking compensation for being held hostage in Iraq. They have not been compensated due to a waiver granted by the President under the National Defense Authorization Act. The US is bound by the Third Geneva Convention to hold Iraq accountable for any torture of prisoners of war. The United States is prohibited from absolving Iraq of liability for torturing prisoners of war, including American POWs. There is a moral obligation to protect Armed Forces members and citizens from torture and hostage-taking, with a commitment to hold state sponsors of terrorism accountable. If certain cases are not settled within 30 days, the President's waiver authority will expire. Upon the expiration of a 30-day period, the President's waiver authority granted in a specific Act will terminate. The cases involved are listed, and an adequate settlement involves payment by the Government of Iraq or a US depository institution to certain persons. Payment by a US depository institution under an unconditional guarantee to individuals with claims related to hostage situations, including $150,000 plus $6,000 per day held hostage, not exceeding $900,000. Additional compensation for torture victims. To any person whose claim in the applicable case arose from hostage taking or being held hostage, subjected to torture while a hostage, and has not obtained a judgment before the enactment of this Act, $2,500,000 plus $6,000 for each day held hostage. Spouses, children of qualifying individuals receive one-third of the amount. Those who obtained a judgment before the enactment receive compensation. The section defines compensation for individuals affected by hostage situations, including payment for compensatory damages and definitions of terms like \"hostage.\" The section outlines compensation for individuals impacted by hostage situations, including definitions for terms like \"hostage,\" \"hostage status,\" \"hostage taking,\" \"person,\" and \"torture.\" The curr_chunk provides definitions for terms like \"person,\" \"torture,\" and \"United States depository institution.\" It also includes additional provisions related to appropriations acts. The curr_chunk clarifies that certain provisions in appropriations acts and the National Defense Authorization Act were not intended to remove jurisdiction over cases brought under section 1605(a)(7) of title 28, United States Code. The National Defense Authorization Act did not intend to remove jurisdiction over cases under section 1605(a)(7) of title 28, United States Code. Section 1083(c) of the Act applies to cases specified in subsection (b)(2) regardless of any waiver for Iraq."
