    "content": "The \"H-2A Improvement Act\" allows nonimmigrant status for dairy workers, sheepherders, and goat herders coming temporarily to the United States to perform agricultural labor. Special rules are established for aliens employed in these roles. Section 218 of the Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to include special rules for aliens employed as dairy workers, sheepherders, or goat herders. This allows for an initial 3-year admission period, extendable for an additional 3 years, without the requirement to show seasonal or temporary nature of the positions when filing a petition for H-2A workers. The amendment to Section 218 of the Immigration and Nationality Act exempts employers filing petitions for H-2A workers as dairy workers, sheepherders, or goat herders from proving the seasonal or temporary nature of the positions. Eligible aliens in these roles can apply for lawful permanent resident status after maintaining H-2A worker status in the US for at least 33 of the previous 36 months. Eligible aliens in certain agricultural roles can apply for lawful permanent resident status after working in the US for at least 33 of the previous 36 months. A petition for classification can be filed by the alien's employer or the alien themselves, and no labor certification is required for this immigrant visa category. Eligible aliens in certain agricultural roles can apply for lawful permanent resident status after working in the US for at least 33 of the previous 36 months. The filing of a petition or application for adjustment of status shall not be a basis for denying various requests related to H-2A workers. The Secretary of Homeland Security can extend the stay of eligible aliens with pending petitions for adjustment of status. This does not prevent eligible aliens from seeking adjustment of status through other means."
