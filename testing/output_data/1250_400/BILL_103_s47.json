Special habeas corpus procedures in capital cases are outlined in a new chapter inserted into Title 28 of the United States Code. This chapter applies to cases under section 2254 brought by prisoners in State custody subject to a capital sentence, with specific requirements for appointment of counsel. This chapter applies to cases under section 2254 brought by prisoners in State custody subject to a capital sentence. It requires States to establish mechanisms for appointing competent counsel for indigent prisoners in post-conviction proceedings. The appointed counsel must meet competency standards and offer representation to all State prisoners under a capital sentence. The chapter applies to cases under section 2254 for State prisoners under a capital sentence. It mandates the appointment of competent counsel for indigent prisoners in post-conviction proceedings, ensuring representation for all prisoners. Counsel appointed must not have previously represented the prisoner unless requested. Sec. 2257 mandates a stay of execution for State prisoners under a capital sentence upon the entry of an order pursuant to section 2256(c). The appointment of competent counsel is required for indigent prisoners in post-conviction proceedings, with restrictions on counsel who previously represented the prisoner. Ineffectiveness of counsel during post-conviction proceedings is not grounds for relief, allowing for the appointment of different counsel if needed. A stay of execution for State prisoners under a capital sentence is mandated upon the entry of an order pursuant to section 2256(c). The stay expires if the prisoner fails to file a habeas corpus petition within the required time or if the petition for relief is denied after district court and court of appeals review. A stay of execution in capital cases is only allowed if certain conditions are met, such as the denial of a petition for certiorari by the Supreme Court or a waiver of habeas corpus review by the prisoner. If these conditions are met, no Federal court can grant relief unless the claim has not been previously presented in State or Federal courts. If conditions for a stay of execution in capital cases are met, no Federal court can grant relief unless the claim has not been previously presented in State or Federal courts. The court's confidence in the jury's determination of guilt can be undermined by new facts discovered post-conviction. Sec. 2258 outlines the time requirements for filing a habeas corpus petition under section 2254, stating it must be filed within 180 days after an order is issued in compliance with section 2256(c). The time requirements can be tolled in certain circumstances, such as when a petition for certiorari is filed in the Supreme Court by a State prisoner seeking review of a capital sentence. The time requirements for filing a habeas corpus petition under section 2254 can be extended in specific situations, such as when a State prisoner seeks review of a capital sentence in the Supreme Court or has a pending request for post-conviction review in a State court. Additionally, an extra 60-day period may be granted if there is good cause for the delay in filing the petition. The time requirements for filing a habeas corpus petition under section 2254 can be extended in specific situations, such as when a State prisoner seeks review of a capital sentence in the Supreme Court or has a pending request for post-conviction review in a State court. The district court has jurisdiction over the case upon filing a habeas corpus petition under section 2254, and the time requirement is continuously tolled during post-conviction review until final disposition by the highest state court. Tolling does not occur during a petition for certiorari before the Supreme Court. When a State prisoner files a petition for habeas corpus relief, the district court determines the sufficiency of the evidentiary record. When a State prisoner under a capital sentence files a petition for habeas corpus relief, the district court determines the sufficiency of the evidentiary record based on claims presented in State courts, unless certain exceptions apply. The Supreme Court can retroactively apply a new Federal right, conduct evidentiary hearings for habeas corpus review, and rule on the merits of claims. The requirement of a certificate of probable cause does not apply to habeas corpus cases under this chapter."
