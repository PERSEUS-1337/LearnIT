    "content": "The Bush Administration released The Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2008 on February 5, 2007, containing detailed budget information, policy proposals, and economic forecasts for FY2007 through FY2012. The budget documents also address long-term fiscal issues and historical budget data. The FY2008 budget resolution was adopted by Congress in May 2007, leading to the consideration of appropriation bills by the House and Senate committees. By August 5, all twelve regular appropriation bills for FY2008 had been passed by the House, with the Senate passing some bills in July and mid-September. In late July, all twelve regular appropriation bills for FY2008 cleared the House Appropriations Committee. By August 5, the House had passed all twelve bills, while the Senate passed some bills in July and mid-September. The Senate failed to pass the remaining eight bills by September 30. A continuing resolution was passed to fund the government until November 16, which the President signed. Congress approved the Defense bill that provided $459 billion in non-emergency budget authority, which the President signed after vetoing other bills due to funding levels or policy disagreements. The President vetoed the bill (H.R. 3043, S. 1710) but signed the Defense bill (H.R. 3222, P.L. 110-116) providing $459 billion in non-emergency budget authority. Veto threats complicated the appropriations process as Congress passed multiple funding continuations and an omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 2764) incorporating 10 regular appropriations bills. The President signed a fourth continuing resolution (H.J.Res. 72) and the Consolidated Appropriations Act of FY2008 (P.L. 110-161) to fund government operations through the end of the calendar year. The President signed a fourth continuing resolution (H.J.Res. 72) and the Consolidated Appropriations Act of FY2008 (P.L. 110-161) to fund government operations through the end of the calendar year, providing $555 billion in discretionary budget authority. Budget estimates for FY2008 from CBO, OMB, and Congress can vary due to different assumptions and techniques, with projections expected to change as new data arrives or economic conditions shift. CBO's first budget report for FY2008 included baseline and economic projections for FY2007 through FY2017. The CBO's first budget report for FY2008 projected a baseline deficit of $98 billion for FY2008, down from $172 billion in FY2007. The report also showed a projected surplus of $170 billion in FY2012 and $249 billion in FY2017. Key assumptions in CBO baseline projections include constant discretionary spending, expiration of tax cuts after 2010, and lapsing of the AMT \"patch\" after 2006. The CBO baseline projections assume constant discretionary spending, expiration of tax cuts after 2010, and lapsing of the AMT \"patch\" after 2006. The expiration of tax cuts and zero growth in discretionary spending explain the declining deficit and emerging surpluses. Future deficits are expected due to the retirement of the baby boom generation and rising healthcare costs. The report includes estimated budgetary effects of policies like making the tax cuts permanent and indexing the AMT for inflation. The CBO's report includes estimated budgetary effects of policies like making the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent, indexing the AMT for inflation, and increasing discretionary appropriations. The analysis of the President's budget proposals showed slightly higher revenues and smaller outlays, leading to a projected deficit of $226 billion for FY2008. By FY2012, the deficit was projected to be $31 billion, reflecting uncertainty in medium-term projections. The CBO projected a FY2008 deficit of $226 billion, smaller than the President's budget. By FY2012, a deficit of $31 billion was expected, instead of a $61 billion surplus. The difference in forecasts is due to medium-term projection uncertainty. President Bush's budget aimed to extend and make permanent tax cuts, reducing estimated receipts by almost $600 billion between FY2008 and FY2012. The President's budget proposed extending tax cuts and other provisions, reducing estimated receipts by almost $600 billion between FY2008 and FY2012. The proposals would also reduce mandatory spending by $96 billion over five years and include a cost estimate of $637 billion over 10 years for personal Social Security accounts. The budget estimates savings of $59 billion over five years and increases of $359 billion over 10 years, largely due to the introduction of personal Social Security accounts. Limited information was provided for years beyond FY2012. The Administration's budget proposes tax cuts and changes that would result in $59 billion in savings over five years and $359 billion in increases over 10 years, mainly from introducing personal Social Security accounts. The budget also includes plans to eliminate, reduce, or reform 141 programs, cutting $22 billion in budget authority for FY2008 compared to FY2007. The Mid-Session Review in July showed a deterioration in the FY2008 budget outlook since February. The Administration's proposed policy changes would cut $22 billion in budget authority for FY2008 compared to FY2007. The Mid-Session Review in July showed a $19 billion higher deficit estimate for FY2008 than the February estimate, with the increase attributed to fast growth in Medicare and Medicaid spending due to rising health care prices and hospital patient volumes. CBO analyzes FY2008 appropriations based on budget legislation specifications. The CBO analyzed FY2008 appropriations, estimating $932.8 billion in nonemergency discretionary budget authority, matching the President's request. Non-defense discretionary budget authority was slightly higher than defense discretionary budget authority. The McConnell Amendment included an additional $70 billion in emergency funding for wars in Iraq. The Senate Budget Committee reported the Senate budget resolution for FY2008, projecting a deficit of $249 billion, $10 billion more than the President's proposal. The resolution aimed for a $132 billion surplus in FY2012, proposing higher levels of discretionary spending than the President while extending expiring tax cuts with revenue offsets. The Senate proposed higher discretionary spending levels than the President in their FY2008 budget resolution. Both the Senate and House resolutions required offsets to extend expiring tax cuts. All proposals aimed for a balanced budget in FY2012, with skepticism from independent analysts due to assumptions about minimal military funding post-FY2008. The President, House, and Senate propose balanced budgets in FY2012, assuming minimal military funding post-FY2008 and more middle-income taxpayers subject to AMT. They also assume the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts will expire unless offset by other revenue gains or spending reductions. The House and Senate budget resolutions assume no growth in discretionary spending over five years, with the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts expiring unless offset by other revenue gains or spending reductions. Budget projections are uncertain, with measures of statistical unbiasedness and accuracy important. Actual budget outcomes may differ from baseline estimates due to policy changes, technical factors, and economic conditions. Budget projections are influenced by policy changes, technical factors, and economic conditions. The accuracy of forecasts is assessed by OMB and CBO. Models reflect assumptions about the economy, tax and program changes, and other factors. Changes in economic conditions impact budget estimates, along with evolving technical components of budget models. Stable trends like population demographics and unpredictable factors like future events also affect budget estimates. Budget estimates are influenced by stable trends like population demographics and unpredictable factors such as future productivity growth and business cycles. Factors like GDP growth and new government policies also impact budget projections. For example, a 0.1% decrease in real GDP growth rate could increase the deficit by $61 billion over five years. The President's FY2008 budget includes an analysis of why previous budget estimates differed from actual results. OMB found that the accuracy of forecasts declines as the forecast window extends to later years. The standard deviation for deficit estimates increases significantly for five-year projections. The gap between upper and lower bounds for deficit projections at the end of a five-year period was over $1.1 trillion. The OMB estimated a $289 billion deviation for the five-years-ahead forecast, with upper and lower bounds for deficit projections showing a gap of over $1.1 trillion. CBO analyzes forecast accuracy and provides explanations for differences with OMB projections. The Senate and House passed their versions of the FY2008 budget resolution. The Senate and House passed their versions of the FY2008 budget resolution, with both resolutions focusing on additional domestic spending and accommodating the Administration's war funding request. Rules were put in place to require offsets to new tax cuts or mandatory spending increases to maintain deficit neutrality. Conferees were appointed to resolve differences between the House and Senate versions, leading to an agreement on FY2008 discretionary spending at $954 billion, exceeding the President's non-emergency discretionary spending request by over $20 billion. The conference agreement on the FY2008 budget resolution set discretionary spending at $954 billion, surpassing the President's request by over $20 billion. The House and Senate adopted the agreement, leading to the drafting of appropriations bills. By mid-July, most of the 12 regular appropriations bills were approved. The Senate passed additional bills in October, with Congress approving the Labor-HHS-Education and Defense bills in November. In FY2007, the House passed all 12 appropriations bills, while the Senate passed four and three more in October. Congress approved the Labor-HHS-Education bill (H.R. 3043, S. 1710) and the Defense bill (H.R. 3222) in November. The President vetoed the Labor-HHS-Education bill but signed the Defense bill. A continuing resolution (H.J. Res 52) was passed to fund government operations until November 16. The Defense Appropriations Act of 2008 extended funding until December 14, followed by another continuing resolution (H.J.Res. 69) for an additional week. Congress then passed an omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 2764) on December 19. The Defense Appropriations Act of 2008 extended funding until December 14, followed by a continuing resolution (H.J.Res. 69) for an additional week. Congress passed an omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 2764) on December 19, and a fourth continuing resolution (H.J.Res. 72) funded government operations through the end of the calendar year. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of FY2008 (P.L. 110-161) provided $555 billion in discretionary budget authority. The Administration's budget proposed FY2008 outlays of $2,902 billion, $84 billion above the CBO baseline. Projections of future federal outlays have been issued by both the Administration and CBO. The budget resolutions passed by House and Senate Budget Committees specify future paths for spending and revenues. The Administration's proposals include boosting funding for defense and homeland security, holding non-defense discretionary spending to a 1% annual increase, and slowing the growth in some mandatory programs. Total mandatory spending would increase, with a plan to raise spending for personal accounts for Social Security in FY2012. If adopted, the proposals would increase outlays by $118 billion above the Administration's revised FY2007 estimate. Total mandatory spending would increase under the Administration's proposals, with a $30 billion increase in FY2012 for personal accounts for Social Security. The proposed outlays would rise by $118 billion above the FY2007 estimate, totaling $2,902 billion for FY2008. Additional funding is allocated for security activities, including defense, homeland security, and foreign affairs, with a significant portion going towards the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Non-security discretionary spending would see an $8 billion increase, while mandatory spending would be reduced by $10 billion compared to baseline levels. Net interest payments are projected to increase by $7 billion in FY2008 due to increased federal borrowing. The Administration's budget proposes an increase in security funding for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. There is also an $8 billion increase in non-security discretionary spending and a $10 billion reduction in mandatory spending compared to baseline levels. The budget shows a $7 billion increase in net interest payments in FY2008 due to increased federal borrowing. Overall, there is a $118 billion increase in outlays from FY2007 to FY2008, attributed to various factors such as cost-of-living adjustments, population growth, policy changes, and inflation. The Administration aims to reduce outlays as a percentage of GDP from 20.2% in FY2007 to 20.0% in FY2008, with projections showing a further decrease to 18.3% by FY2012. Defense and non-defense discretionary spending are projected to decrease, while mandatory programs will increase their share of GDP. The Administration's budget projects a decrease in outlays as a percentage of GDP from 20.6% to 18.3% by FY2012. Non-defense discretionary spending is expected to decrease by 0.7% of GDP, while defense spending will fall by 1.1% of GDP over the same period. Mandatory programs will increase their share of GDP by 0.3%, and net interest will decrease by 0.2% of GDP. The President's budget includes a 6.0% increase in defense spending from FY2007 to FY2008, with a projected drop to $546 billion by FY2012. Non-defense discretionary spending for FY2008 exceeds the current services baseline estimate by $19 billion. The Administration's budget projects a decrease in outlays as a percentage of GDP from 20.6% to 18.3% by FY2012. Non-defense discretionary spending is expected to decrease by 0.7% of GDP, while defense spending will fall by 1.1% of GDP over the same period. Mandatory programs will increase their share of GDP by 0.3%, and net interest will decrease by 0.2% of GDP. The President's budget includes a 6.0% increase in defense spending from FY2007 to FY2008, with a projected drop to $546 billion by FY2012. Non-defense discretionary spending for FY2008 exceeds the current services baseline estimate by $19 billion. The Administration's budget aims to reduce mandatory spending by $10 billion in FY2008, focusing on slowing the growth of activities like Medicare and Medicaid. Total mandatory spending is projected to decrease by almost $60 billion over five years. Mandatory spending remains the largest category, growing from $1,465 billion in FY2007 to $1,923 billion in FY2012. Net interest outlays are expected to rise by $22.1 billion from FY2007 to FY2008, contributing to the rapid growth of federal debt. The federal debt has grown rapidly in recent years, with net interest outlays projected to rise by $22.1 billion from FY2007 to FY2008. The Administration's policy proposals would further increase net interest outlays by almost $30 billion above its current services estimate in FY2012. Net interest payments as a percentage of GDP are expected to range between 1.6% and 1.8% throughout the five years. CBO's baseline projections show outlays rising from 19.9% of GDP in FY2007 to 20.8% in FY2008, before easing back to 20.0% in FY2012. In FY2007-FY2017, federal outlays are projected to rise from 19.9% to 20.8% of GDP before easing back to 20.0% in FY2012. CBO baseline estimates suggest that if discretionary spending grows with the economy, outlays would increase by $1.55 trillion, but if fixed at FY2007 levels, outlays would decrease by $1.65 trillion. Defense spending is expected to increase from $547 billion in FY2007 to $599 billion in FY2008, reaching $773 billion in FY2017 according to CBO projections. Defense spending is projected to increase from $547 billion in FY2007 to $599 billion in FY2008, with baseline projections showing it rising to $684 billion in FY2012 and $773 billion in FY2017. The percentage of GDP allocated to defense spending is expected to gradually decrease over the 10-year period. Alternative scenarios, such as withdrawing troops from Iraq and Afghanistan, could result in lower spending trajectories, with potential savings of $1.25 trillion by 2017. The CBO projects that withdrawing troops from Iraq and Afghanistan by 2010 or 2013 would result in significant savings in discretionary spending and interest costs. Non-defense discretionary spending is expected to increase over the years, while mandatory spending is projected to also rise. The CBO projects that discretionary spending will not grow in real terms, while the economy continues to grow. Mandatory spending is projected to increase from $1,457 billion in FY2007 to $2,598 billion by FY2017. Net interest payments are expected to peak at $292 billion in FY2012 and decrease to $278 billion by FY2017. The CBO baseline projections show smaller deficits in later years, slowing federal debt growth. Projected surpluses in FY2012 and beyond would reduce federal debt, lowering net interest payments. Net interest payments peak at $292 billion in FY2012, then decrease to $278 billion in FY2017. The Senate Budget Committee's FY2008 budget resolution proposed outlays of $2,927 billion for FY2008, rising to $3,229 billion in FY2012. The House Budget Committee's version of the FY2008 budget resolution would provide $2,933 billion in outlays in FY2008. The Senate and House passed the FY2008 budget resolution with amendments. Outlays for FY2008 were $2,933 billion, increasing to $3,252 billion by FY2012. The conference agreement included $2,937 billion for FY2008, rising to $3,255 billion by FY2012. Defense and non-defense spending as a share of GDP are projected to decline, while mandatory spending is expected to increase. The figure displays actual outlays for defense, non-defense, mandatory, and net interest spending from FY2000 through FY2006 and the Administration's proposals from FY2007 through FY2012. Defense and non-defense spending as a share of GDP are projected to decrease over the five-year period, while mandatory spending is expected to rise. The President's proposed reductions in mandatory spending would keep it stable as a share of GDP, but the introduction of private Social Security accounts in FY2012 would increase mandatory spending relative to GDP. Figure 2 shows alternative paths for outlays as a percentage of GDP through FY2017. The President's FY2012 proposal for private Social Security accounts would increase mandatory spending relative to GDP. Figure 2 displays four alternative paths for outlays as a percentage of GDP through FY2017, including the President's FY2008 budget proposal and a CBO outlook. The Administration's outlook shows a decrease in spending after FY2007 due to proposed reductions in discretionary spending and moderate growth in mandatory programs, with spending just below FY2000 levels by FY2012. The Administration's proposals aim to reduce discretionary spending, both defense and non-defense, and moderate the growth in some mandatory programs. By FY2012, spending would be slightly below its level as a percentage of GDP in FY2000. The alternative estimate includes assumptions that increase outlays above baseline projections, leading to higher deficits, federal debt, and net interest payments. The alternative estimate projects higher outlays and deficits, increasing federal debt and net interest payments. Outlays as a percentage of GDP are expected to rise to 21.1% in FY2017. Forecasts for federal receipts are uncertain due to economic conditions, with recent years showing unexpected growth. Forecasts of federal receipts beyond the short term are imprecise due to economic conditions. Receipts have shown unexpected growth in recent years, with increases in GDP percentage and current dollars. OMB and CBO projections differ on receipts as a share of GDP, with varying estimates on the impact of expiring tax cuts. The President's proposals aim to extend and make permanent most of the tax cuts scheduled to expire by FY2012. Receipts as a percentage of GDP rise to 19.8% in FY2012, with a $767 billion increase over five years. The President's proposals aim to make most tax cuts permanent, reducing cumulative receipts by $1,854 billion over 10 years. The budget includes relief from the Alternative Minimum Tax through FY2008. The Administration's proposals aim to reduce receipts by $599 billion in the first five years and $1,854 billion over 10 years. The budget includes relief from the Alternative Minimum Tax through FY2008, with receipts as a percentage of GDP shown for various years. Corporate income taxes stabilize near 2% of GDP, while individual income taxes remain below their FY2000 level. Social Insurance receipts remained stable from FY2006 through FY2012. Individual income taxes, which had fallen from over 10% of GDP in FY2000 to 7% in FY2004, regained some lost share under the Administration's proposals but remained about 1% below their FY2000 level. The Administration proposed extending relief from the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) for FY2007 and FY2008. Middle-class taxpayers are increasingly subject to the AMT unless temporary fixes or a permanent change is enacted. The budget estimated temporary AMT fixes would cost $9.1 billion in FY2007 and $47.9 billion in FY2008. CBO estimated indexing AMT thresholds for inflation would cost about $55 billion annually over the next 10 years. The President's budget aimed to limit the AMT's reach but omitted estimates of the five-year cost, effectively increasing federal receipts by $50 billion to $60 billion annually post-FY2008. Total receipts in the President's budget are expected to remain stable as a percentage of GDP. The President's budget aims to limit the reach of the AMT but omits estimates of the five-year cost, increasing federal receipts by $50 billion to $60 billion annually post-FY2008. Total receipts are expected to remain stable as a percentage of GDP. CBO's baseline revenue estimates show a rise to over 19.8% of GDP in FY2012 and 20.1% in FY2017, excluding the extension of tax cuts. Extending all expiring tax cuts would reduce revenues by $870 billion in the first five years and $3,178 billion over 10 years. The President's budget aims to limit the reach of the AMT, increasing federal receipts by $50 billion to $60 billion annually post-FY2008. CBO estimated that limiting the expanding coverage of the AMT alone would reduce revenues by $280 billion over five years and by $570 billion over 10 years. The President's budget aims to limit the reach of the AMT, increasing federal receipts by $50 billion to $60 billion annually post-FY2008. CBO estimated that limiting the expanding coverage of the AMT alone would reduce revenues by $280 billion over five years and by $570 billion over 10 years. CBO's estimates of the President's revenue policy proposals were $479 billion smaller than CBO's cumulative revenue baseline estimates over five years. The alternative estimate assumes the extensions of all expiring tax cuts, an annual adjustment to the AMT to halt its expanding coverage, and the interaction effect of the extensions and the AMT, resulting in slower growth in receipts. The alternative revenue assumptions would result in lower revenues compared to the baseline, with a shortfall of $70 billion in FY2008, $389 billion in FY2012, and $560 billion in FY2017. The House and Senate budget resolutions require offsets for extending expiring tax provisions to prevent the deficit from growing. The House and Senate budget resolutions require offsets for extending expiring tax provisions to prevent the deficit from growing. The conference agreement allows for the extension of some expiring tax cuts under certain conditions and requires offsetting revenue losses. Historical and projected federal receipts as a percentage of GDP are shown in Figure 4, with estimates remaining fairly close through FY2010. Federal receipts as a percentage of GDP have remained fairly consistent over the years, with estimates showing slight variations. The CBO's revenue reestimate and the President's revenue estimates align closely through FY2012. OMB's projections show slightly higher receipts than the February budget, assuming tax cuts are extended. Deficits occur when federal spending exceeds receipts, with projections showing a decrease in receipts as a share of GDP after FY2008. The CBO projection, based on January budget data, shows receipts falling as a share of GDP after FY2008. Deficits occur when spending exceeds receipts, increasing government debt. Surpluses reduce debt and interest payments. Running surpluses during strong economic growth is beneficial. The last surplus was in FY2001 at $128 billion. The FY2007 deficit was $163 billion, below CBO's estimate. The FY2007 total deficit was $163 billion, slightly below CBO's estimate. The on-budget deficit was $344 billion, excluding Social Security and Postal Service surpluses. The President's FY2008 budget proposed a $239 billion deficit and a $61 billion surplus in FY2012. The Administration's baseline estimates show surpluses in FY2010. The FY2007 deficit decreased slightly, while the FY2008 deficit increased compared to the budget estimates. The Administration's Mid-Session Review projects a small surplus in FY2012. The FY2007 deficit fell slightly while the FY2008 deficit grew compared to the estimates in the President's FY2008 budget. The MSR deficit estimates in subsequent years remain slightly larger than those in the original budget, with projections of a small surplus in FY2012. The Administration aims to reach deficit reduction goals by limiting discretionary spending growth and slowing entitlement spending. CBO projects a decrease in the federal deficit through FY2011, with surpluses expected from FY2012 to FY2017. According to CBO's January 2007 baseline estimates, the federal deficit is projected to fall through FY2011, with surpluses expected from FY2012 to FY2017. Alternative scenarios show a less optimistic fiscal outlook, with growing deficits projected from FY2007 to FY2017. Some alternative scenarios project a less optimistic fiscal outlook than the CBO baseline, with deficits increasing from FY2007 to FY2017. These scenarios include limiting the AMT coverage, extending tax cuts, and increasing discretionary spending. CBO projected deficits larger than the Administration's estimates for subsequent years, with a deficit of 0.3% of GDP in FY2012 compared to the Administration's projected surplus. The House- and Senate-passed budget resolutions had deficits similar to the President's budget for FY2008. In FY2008, the deficit was at 1.6% of GDP, matching the Administration's projection. CBO projected larger deficits for subsequent years, with a deficit of 0.3% of GDP in FY2012 compared to the Administration's projected surplus. The House- and Senate-passed budget resolutions also included deficits similar to the President's budget. The conference agreement on the budget resolution had a deficit of $252 billion in FY2008, becoming a surplus of $41 billion in FY2012. The data from FY2007 to FY2017 shows deficit or surplus estimates as shares of GDP, with projections by CBO and OMB. The President's policy proposals include additional defense spending, tight controls on domestic discretionary spending, and a slight slowing in Medicare and Medicaid growth. Administration projections indicate a rapid decline in the deficit, with a potential surplus in FY2012. CBO and OMB deficit projections extend to FY2017, showing an improving federal fiscal situation. The administration projects a rapid decline in the deficit, with a potential surplus in FY2012. CBO and OMB deficit projections show an improving federal fiscal situation, but alternative assumptions suggest a steady deterioration in fiscal conditions. The current mix of federal fiscal policies is deemed unsustainable in the long term due to the aging population and rising healthcare costs. The nation's aging population and rising healthcare costs are driving federal spending on programs for the elderly to unsustainable levels, leading to constantly rising deficits and a spiraling federal debt burden. Keeping future federal outlays at 20% of GDP would require drastic reductions in all spending except for Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid, which are projected to reach roughly 15% of GDP by 2030. The CBO projects that maintaining current policies would necessitate significant cuts in all spending except for Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid, which are projected to reach 15% of GDP by 2030. Fiscal stability in the future may require reducing spending growth and increasing taxes. The growing demand for resources to finance federal spending on mandatory programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security will require substantial reductions in spending growth and possibly higher taxes for fiscal stability in the coming decades. By 2050, spending on these programs is projected to exceed 15% of GDP, presenting long-term fiscal challenges for the government. The Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid programs pose different challenges to the federal government's long-term fiscal position. Estimates show a smaller fiscal gap for Social Security compared to Medicare, with projections sensitive to changes in assumptions about productivity growth and interest rates. Spending projections for Medicare and Medicaid are influenced by medical inflation, and unexpected events can impact the budget outlook. Policy, demographics, and healthcare costs will largely determine the long-term budget outlook. The retirement of the baby boom generation and increasing healthcare costs will put pressure on the federal budget, potentially overwhelming it without policy changes. This could limit the government's flexibility and strain the economy's ability to provide resources for expanded programs."
