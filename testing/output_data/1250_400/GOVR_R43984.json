However, copyright holders like Taylor Swift do not have complete control over their music. For example, even though Swift withdrew her music from Spotify, a cover version of her album by Ryan Adams could still be heard on the service. Copyright law allows artists to perform, reproduce, and distribute musical works under certain conditions, as long as royalties are paid. Swift can withdraw her own recordings from Spotify, but she cannot control how the service uses other versions of her music. As a singer and songwriter, Taylor Swift can withdraw her own recorded music from Spotify but cannot control how the service uses other versions of her music. The amount she gets paid for her works depends on market forces, contracts, and copyright laws. Congress updated copyright laws in the 1990s to address digital music distribution and combat unauthorized use of copyrighted content. Congress updated copyright laws in the 1990s to address digital music distribution and combat unauthorized use of copyrighted content. It applied different provisions to digital services resembling radio broadcasts and physical media. Music consumption has evolved with streaming services, blurring traditional lines of exploitation. Recording industry revenues peaked in 1999 at $21.3 billion, coinciding with the introduction of Napster. Apple's iTunes Music Store launched in 2003 after negotiating licensing agreements with major record labels. The evolution of music consumption over the last 40 years saw a peak in recording industry revenues in 1999 at $21.3 billion, coinciding with the introduction of Napster. Apple launched the iTunes Music Store in 2003, marking a shift towards digital downloads over physical media. By 2012, digital downloads surpassed physical sales, with Apple dominating the market. However, the rise of streaming services like Spotify led to a decline in digital downloads. In response, Apple launched Apple Music in 2015, reflecting the changing patterns in music consumption. The popularity of subscription music services has significantly altered music consumption patterns. According to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), the proportion of total U.S. recording industry retail spending coming from webcasting, satellite digital audio radio services, and streaming music services increased from about 9% in 2011 to about 67% in 2017. Consumer spending on music grew between 2014 and 2017, but is still below its 1999 peak. These changing consumption patterns impact how performers, songwriters, and music companies are compensated for their work under copyright law. Consumer spending on music by U.S. consumers, adjusted for inflation, is still nearly two-thirds below its 1999 peak. This affects how performers, songwriters, record companies, and music publishers get paid for their rights. Creators typically license their rights to third parties who may exercise them on their behalf. Owners of musical works and sound recordings have exclusive rights under the Copyright Act, including reproduction and distribution rights known as a \"mechanical right.\" The combination of reproduction and distribution rights in music publishing is known as a \"mechanical right,\" dating back to the 1909 Copyright Act. Federal copyright protection for sound recordings applies only to recordings fixed after February 15, 1972, with works fixed before protected under state laws until February 15, 2067. Some music services have agreements to pay royalties for pre-1972 recordings. The Copyright Act grants reproduction and distribution rights to recordings fixed after February 15, 1972. Sound recording public performance rights apply only to digital audio transmissions. Music services have agreements to pay royalties for pre-1972 recordings. Rights for sound recording public performance under federal copyright laws are granted to recordings fixed after February 15, 1972. Consumers purchase rights to listen to music on CDs privately, while record labels pay music publishers for distribution rights. Retail outlets pay distribution subsidiaries of major record labels for sound recordings. Broadcast radio stations do not pay public performance royalties to record labels and artists but do pay royalties to music publishers and songwriters for notes and lyrics. The Copyright Act exempts broadcast radio stations from paying public performance royalties to record labels and artists, but they must pay royalties to music publishers and songwriters. Digital services must pay record labels and music publishers for public performance rights. Both traditional radio stations and music streaming services make temporary copies of songs for transmission. Ephemeral recordings fall under 17 U.S.C. Section 112. Interactive music streaming services allow users to choose songs on demand. Next, noninteractive services create temporary copies of songs to transmit music to listeners, known as \"ephemeral recordings\" under 17 U.S.C. Section 112. On-demand music streaming services allow users to select songs, downloading digital files as \"conditional downloads.\" Royalties are paid to music publishers/songwriters and record labels/artists for reproducing and distributing musical works and sound recordings. The music industry involves songwriters, music publishers, recording artists, record labels, and music licensees. The music industry involves songwriters, music publishers, recording artists, record labels, and music licensees. Songwriters work with music publishers to promote songs to record labels and others. Publishers license the intellectual property of their clients and collect royalties. Publishers may pay advances to songwriters against future royalties in exchange for a portion of the copyright in the compositions. Their role is to monitor, promote, and generate revenue from the use of music. Agreements between songwriters and publishers involve the publisher paying an advance against future royalties in exchange for a portion of the copyright. Publishers monitor, promote, and generate revenue from music use, including mechanical licensing rights. They may contract with performing rights organizations for public performance payments. Royalty income is shared with subpublishers and coauthors, with a standard 50-50 income division between publisher and songwriter for new songwriters. Multiple songwriters and publishers can complicate income division. Music publishers fall into four general categories. Music publishers can be categorized into four groups: Major Publishers like Sony/ATV Music Publishing, Universal Music Publishing Group, and Warner Music Group; Major Affiliates who work with independent publishing companies; Independent Publishers who manage their own music catalogs; and Writer-Publishers who control their own publishing rights. Independent publishers administer their own music catalogs and are not affiliated with major publishers. Writer-publishers, such as established songwriters who do not need help marketing their songs, may control their own publishing rights and hire individuals to handle royalties. Record labels are responsible for finding talent, recording music, and promoting artists. Major labels distribute physical and electronic copies of sound recordings through large networks, although the distribution role is evolving due to the decline in physical recordings consumption. Record labels play a crucial role in distributing digital copies of songs, managing royalties, negotiating with streaming services, and monitoring sales. They also finance music recordings, provide advances to artists, and guide their careers through recording contracts. Artists can choose to contract with a label or retain their copyrights for self-distribution. Record labels typically require artists to transfer copyrights for defined periods and regions in exchange for royalties. Major labels like Sony, Universal, and Warner dominate the industry, often sharing a parent company with major music publishers. Smaller labels, while specializing in genres, rely on major labels for distribution. Record labels often require artists to transfer copyrights in exchange for royalties. Major labels like Sony, Universal, and Warner dominate the industry, with smaller labels relying on them for distribution. Chance the Rapper is an example of an artist who retains his copyrights and distributes his own music without signing a record label contract. He earns money from touring and merchandise sales, and Apple Music paid him $500,000 for exclusive rights to his streaming-only album, Coloring Book, which became popular in 2016. Streaming service Apple Music paid Chance the Rapper $500,000 for exclusive rights to his streaming-only album, Coloring Book, making it the first of its kind to rank among the top 10 U.S. albums. Record producers are responsible for bringing creative products into tangible form, handling tasks like song selection and studio bookings. Artists now often work with multiple producers, controlling their compensation terms and potentially offering royalties. Sound engineers and mixers play crucial roles in recording sessions, with mixers typically receiving one-time payments per track. The 1909 Copyright Act recognized the exclusive right of copyright owners to make mechanical reproductions of music. A mechanical license allows for audio-only reproduction of music on devices like player pianos, phonograph records, and CDs, with distribution to the public for private use. Congress had concerns about player-piano manufacturer Aeolian Company during the 1909 Copyright Act discussions. The 1909 Copyright Act established the first compulsory license in U.S. copyright law to prevent a potential monopoly by player-piano manufacturer Aeolian Company. This allowed for the distribution of sound recordings to the public for private use, with royalties paid to the music publisher/songwriter. The 1909 Copyright Act established the first compulsory license in U.S. copyright law to prevent a potential monopoly by player-piano manufacturer Aeolian Company. This allowed for the distribution of sound recordings to the public for private use, with royalties paid to the music publisher/songwriter. In 2015, Ryan Adams recorded a cover version of Taylor Swift's album 1989 without seeking permission, instead paying a compulsory mechanical license fee set by the government. Congress revisited the mechanical license in the Copyright Act of 1976, specifying that royalties would be payable for each record made and distributed. The Copyright Act of 1976 codified the compulsory mechanical license as 17 U.S.C. Section 115, specifying that royalties would be payable for each record made and distributed. The act also defined \"phonorecord\" as audio-only recordings and set procedures for obtaining mechanical licenses, including serving a notice of intention to license the music on the copyright owner. Licensees must file the notice within 30 days of making a new recording or before distributing it, and if the copyright owner cannot be located, a pool of money is set aside until they can be paid. The 1976 Copyright Act simplified the process for copyright owners to sue by removing limitations on liability and requiring licensees to file a notice of intention (NOI) within 30 days of making a new recording. Failure to provide the NOI makes the licensee ineligible for a compulsory license, leading to potential infringement under copyright law. Additionally, copyright holders no longer need to file a \"notice of use\" to recover against unauthorized record manufacturers, but failure to identify themselves to the Copyright Office may result in not receiving royalties under a compulsory license. The 1976 Copyright Act simplified the process for copyright owners to sue by removing limitations on liability and requiring licensees to file a notice of intention (NOI) within 30 days of making a new recording. Failure to provide the NOI makes the licensee ineligible for a compulsory license, potentially leading to infringement under copyright law. Unlike performance rights licenses, reproduction and distribution licenses are not issued on a blanket basis, leading to controversy between rights holders and licensees regarding NOIs and the Copyright Office's database of musical works. Adjusting the statutory mechanical royalty rate periodically was suggested in 1967 to reflect accepted standards of statutory ratemaking. In 1975, Register of Copyrights Barbara Ringer proposed creating a separate royalty tribunal to simplify administering compulsory licenses and mechanical licenses. This tribunal, established by Congress in the 1976 Copyright Act, aims to set royalty rates based on four policy objectives, including maximizing public access to works, ensuring fair returns for copyright owners and users, and reflecting their contributions. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) was established in 2004 to set mechanical and other licensing rates every five years, with the rates acting as a ceiling for what owners may charge. Congress passed the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act (DPRA) in 1995. The CRB sets licensing rates every five years, acting as a ceiling for charges. The DPRA amended 17 U.S.C. Section 115 in 1995 to cover digital transmission of musical works. Rates for digital phonorecord deliveries distinguish between incidental and general transmissions, sparking debate. The Copyright Office proposed new rules in 2008 after years of deferral. In 2008, the Copyright Office proposed new rules regarding digital phonorecord deliveries, emphasizing the importance of resolving issues for the music industry's survival in the 21st Century. After years of debate, an agreement was reached between music industry groups on the applicability of mechanical licenses to streaming, ensuring music publishers receive royalties from streaming services. As consumers shifted to streaming music, revenues from mechanical royalties declined. Music streaming services agreed to pay publishers a percentage of their revenues for interactive streams and limited downloads. Noninteractive streaming services like Pandora did not need mechanical licenses. The CRB adopted agreements in 2009 and 2012, setting royalty rates for different music streaming services. In 2018, the CRB issued new mechanical royalty rates and terms for 2018-2022, including flat rates for physical and digital music deliveries. The CRB adopted agreements for mechanical royalty rates from 2013-2017 and issued new rates for 2018-2022. Licensees pay flat rates for physical and digital music deliveries, while interactive streaming rates are based on formulas. Minimum per-subscriber payments are set for different music services, with zero rates during free trials. The mechanical royalty rates for songs are determined by formulas, with minimum payments set for different music services. Public performance royalties are overseen by the U.S. District Court or negotiated between publishers and licensees. Songwriters were granted the exclusive right to publicly perform their works in 1897, requiring establishments to obtain permission. Copyright owners faced challenges in individually negotiating with users for every use or detecting infringement due to the high number of public performances. In 1914, the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) was formed to address the logistical issue of licensing and collecting payment for public performances. ASCAP and SESAC are performance rights organizations that issue public performance licenses on behalf of songwriters and publishers. Licensees typically obtain a blanket license to publicly perform musical works for a flat fee or percentage of revenues, with royalties collected and distributed among publishers and songwriters. In 1930, SESAC was founded as a competing PRO to help European publishers and writers collect royalties from U.S. licensees. As radio grew in popularity, SESAC expanded to represent U.S. composers. ASCAP negotiated a public performance license with radio broadcasters in 1932, establishing rates based on advertising revenues. To strengthen their bargaining power, broadcasters founded BMI in 1939 to attract new composers and secure copyrights. In 1939, broadcasters established BMI to compete with ASCAP and attract new composers. The dispute over royalty rates led to radio stations boycotting ASCAP-affiliated composers in 1940, prompting a DOJ investigation into the PROs. In 1940, radio stations boycotted ASCAP-affiliated composers due to royalty rate disagreements. This led to a DOJ investigation into the PROs, resulting in BMI and ASCAP entering consent decrees in 1941 with similar features regarding licensing rights and non-discrimination policies. ASCAP and BMI must offer alternative licenses to the blanket license and accept any songwriter or music publisher that meets certain standards. Rates charged by ASCAP and BMI are overseen by federal district court judges, while SESAC and GMR rates are based on marketplace negotiations. The federal district court must approve rates charged by ASCAP and BMI as \"reasonable.\" The rates charged by SESAC and GMR are based on marketplace negotiations, while ASCAP and BMI rates must be approved by federal district court judges as \"reasonable.\" The judges must also consider the disproportionate power ASCAP and BMI have over the music rights market. Current law prohibits judges from considering rates paid by digital services to record labels when setting public performance rates for music publishers and songwriters. This provision was included in the 1995 DPRA to prevent adverse effects on music performance royalties. The 1995 DPRA aimed to prevent adverse effects on music performance royalties by setting public performance rates for music publishers and songwriters. The ASCAP and BMI consent decrees, last amended in 2001 and 1994 respectively, have been periodically reviewed for effectiveness. DOJ completed a review in 2016, and in 2017, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld BMI's challenge to DOJ's interpretation of the decrees. Congress first created copyright laws for sound recordings in 1971 with the Sound Recording Act. In 1971, Congress created copyright laws for sound recordings with the Sound Recording Act. The Act applied to recordings fixed on or after February 15, 1972. The U.S. Supreme Court later ruled that federal copyright law did not preempt California's record piracy law for pre-1972 recordings. In 1975, the U.S. Department of Justice recommended excluding pre-1972 recordings from federal copyright laws to preserve existing antipiracy laws. In 1975, the U.S. Department of Justice recommended excluding pre-1972 sound recordings from federal copyright laws to preserve existing antipiracy laws. The 1976 Copyright Revision Act preempted state laws for pre-1972 works, allowing states to protect them until 2067. Noninteractive digital services may make ephemeral reproductions under Section 112 of the law. In 1998, Congress established a license under Section 112 of the Copyright Act for noninteractive digital services to create temporary reproductions of sound recordings. The rates and terms of this license are set by the CRB, and copyright owners receive Section 112 fees through SoundExchange. Before the 1990s, record labels and artists did not have public performance rights for their sound recordings and primarily earned income from retail sales. In the 1990s, record labels and artists lacked public performance rights for their sound recordings, earning income mainly from retail sales. The Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act (DPRA) in 1995 and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) in 1998 granted record labels and artists an exclusive public performance right for their sound recordings, addressing concerns about music piracy with the rise of the internet. The DPRA limited this right to certain digital audio services and created a compulsory license for certain subscription services. The DPRA granted record labels and artists an exclusive public performance right for their sound recordings, limited to certain digital audio services. It also created a compulsory license for subscription services. Music publishers and writers were concerned about record companies withholding licenses, which led to a compromise between trade groups. The DMCA was adopted after debates between the RIAA and digital music service providers. The DMCA expanded statutory licensing provisions to cover noninteractive online music services, setting up a bifurcated system for rate-setting standards. Services existing before July 31, 1998, are subject to one standard, while those entering the market after that date follow a different standard based on marketplace negotiations. Noninteractive music streaming services that entered the market after July 31, 1998, are subject to rates and terms based on marketplace negotiations. The Section 801(b)(1) standard aims to minimize disruption in the industry, leading to lower copyright royalty rates in some cases. The DPRA allows owners of sound recording rights to negotiate directly with interactive music streaming services for public performance rights at market rates. The DPRA enabled owners of sound recording rights to negotiate directly with interactive music streaming services for public performance rights at marketplace-determined rates. Interactive services, which allow individuals to arrange for specific recording transmissions, were seen as potentially impacting traditional record sales and copyright owners' revenue. Congress does not mandate public performance licenses for broadcast radio stations. The Senate Judiciary Committee in 1995 aimed to balance interests regarding broadcast radio stations not needing public performance licenses for sound recordings. They emphasized the benefits of airplay for sound recordings and performers, stating that legislation should not harm the relationship between radio and music industries. The committee also highlighted the unique role of broadcast radio in providing entertainment, non-entertainment programming, and public interest activities to local communities. The CRB sets statutory rates through rate determination proceedings involving copyright users, holders, and trade groups. Parties can negotiate voluntarily for three months, submit written statements, conduct discovery, and attempt to reach a settlement. Proposed rates are submitted to the CRB for review and potential adoption, with the option to decline agreements as a basis for setting rates. In rate-setting proceedings, participants may reach agreements on statutory rates and submit them to the CRB for review. If no agreement is reached, live testimony is heard, and a determination is issued. Disagreements can be reheard or appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals. SoundExchange, established by RIAA, distributes royalties after deducting costs. SoundExchange, established by RIAA, distributes royalties after deducting costs. The CRB sets rates for public performances of sound recordings, using different standards for online music services and subscription services. Congress passed legislation allowing SoundExchange to negotiate alternative royalty schemes in response to complaints about excessive rates. Congress passed legislation allowing SoundExchange to negotiate alternative royalty schemes in response to complaints about excessive rates set by the CRB. The agreements enabled music streaming services to pay royalties based on a percentage of their revenue instead of a \"per-performance\" rate. The most recent agreements expired in 2015, leading to a CRB proceeding to set royalty rates for 2016-2020. Questions arose about the interpretation of a provision barring consideration of agreements negotiated under the Webcaster Settlement Acts. Pandora Media, Inc., Clear Channel (now iHeartMedia, Inc.), and SoundExchange disagreed on the admissibility of direct agreements as evidence. During the CRB rate proceeding, questions arose about the interpretation of a provision barring consideration of agreements negotiated under the Webcaster Settlement Acts. SoundExchange, Pandora Media, and Clear Channel disagreed on the admissibility of direct agreements as evidence. The CRB referred these novel material questions of substantive law to the Register of Copyrights for resolution. In September 2015, the Register ruled that the CRB may consider directly negotiated licenses that incorporate provisions from the agreements. The CRB issued its decision on rates for the 2016-2020 period, setting streaming services' fees at $0.17 per 100 streams on nonsubscription services for 2016. Annual rate increases from 2017 to 2020 are tied to the Consumer Price Index. Ephemeral royalties fees are set at 5% of total Section 114 royalties. The CRB includes ephemeral recording fees with Section 114 royalties, setting them at 5% for 2016-2020. Public performance rates vary based on music service type and start date. Royalties under Section 114 are distributed with 50% to copyright owners, 45% to featured artists, and 2.5% each to agents for nonfeatured musicians and vocalists. Record producers are not included in the statutory split for noninteractive digital service royalties. The CRB sets royalties for public performances of sound recordings by noninteractive digital services. 50% goes to copyright owners, 45% to featured artists, 2.5% to nonfeatured musicians, and 2.5% to agents for vocalists. Record producers are not included in the statutory split for these royalties. Producers can be compensated through SoundExchange if the artist provides a letter of direction. The distinction between interactive and noninteractive services is defined by 17 U.S.C. Section 114. Performance rights under 17 U.S.C. Section 114 define interactive services as those that allow users to receive personalized music selections. The distinction between interactive and noninteractive services is important for obtaining mechanical rights from music publishers. In a 2009 court ruling, a music streaming service using user feedback to play personalized songs was not considered interactive, aiming to protect sound recording copyright holders from sales cannibalization. The court's decision on interactive services and predictability was based on the concern of cannibalization of record sales. LAUNCHcast online radio service by Launch Media, Inc. did not provide enough predictability despite unique playlists for users. The court determined that LAUNCHcast online radio service was noninteractive because uniquely created playlists did not ensure predictability. Noninteractive services must limit features like announcing specific songs in advance to be eligible for compulsory licensing under the Copyright Act. The decision affirmed that personalized music streaming services like Pandora and iHeartRadio could obtain statutory licenses for public performances of sound recordings. The Launch Media decision affirmed that personalized music streaming services like Pandora and iHeartRadio could obtain statutory licenses for public performances of sound recordings. Spotify offers on-demand access to specific albums, songs, and artists for free with ads or for a monthly fee. Congress provided antitrust exemptions in 1995 for statutory licensees and copyright owners to negotiate collectively with services like SiriusXM. For a fee of about $10, Spotify users can enjoy ad-free music streaming on mobile and desktop, as well as offline listening. In 1995, Congress granted antitrust exemptions for copyright owners to collectively negotiate with services like SiriusXM. The exemptions require nonexclusive common agents to prevent unfair rate demands. The DPRA does not provide antitrust exemptions for interactive service licensing, allowing common agents for clearinghouse functions only. The DPRA does not create an antitrust exemption for negotiating rates for interactive services. However, the DMCA added Section 112 in 1998 to address ephemeral server reproductions and provided an antitrust exemption for copyright owners and licensees to designate common agents for negotiating royalty payments. The CRB, created in 2004, included provisions regarding the obligation of licensees to make payments. The House Judiciary Committee report explains the provisions regarding licensees' obligation to make payments to designated entities for royalties. This provision allows parties to continue making payments while appealing CRB decisions on royalty rates. The provision ensures that parties subject to statutory licensing must continue making payments while appealing CRB decisions on royalty rates. In 2006, SoundExchange was designated as the sole \"collective\" by the CRB, with Royalty Logic later requesting recognition as a collective to compete with SoundExchange for the benefit of sound recording copyright owners. The CRB argued that copyright owners and performers are the designated agents according to the Copyright Act. In 2006, SoundExchange was designated as the sole \"collective\" by the CRB. Royalty Logic sought recognition as a designated agent to compete with SoundExchange, arguing it would benefit sound recording copyright owners. The CRB maintained that copyright owners and performers are the designated agents according to the Copyright Act. The CRB found that selecting a single collective was the most efficient system for collecting royalties under statutory licenses, a decision upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in 2009. In 2006, SoundExchange was chosen as the sole \"collective\" by the CRB, which was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in 2009. The court ruled that the CRB's decision to designate a single entity for collecting royalties under statutory licenses was economically and administratively efficient, despite arguments from Royalty Logic. The CRB designated SoundExchange as the sole entity to receive royalty payments for statutory licenses, fulfilling Congress's expectation. SoundExchange reached agreements with radio stations in 2015, covering rates for webcast sound recordings, which were approved by the CRB. In 2015, SoundExchange reached agreements with public and college radio stations for webcast sound recording rates, approved by the CRB. SoundExchange was designated as the sole collective for collecting and distributing sound recording royalties from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2020. Congress granted an antitrust exemption for common agents to negotiate and distribute mechanical licenses for DPDs and traditional mechanical licenses. SoundExchange developed an administrative and technical knowledge base. Congress granted an antitrust exemption for owners and licensees of musical works to designate common agents for negotiating and distributing mechanical licenses. Music publishers collect mechanical royalties through third-party administrators like the Harry Fox Agency, who distribute royalties to publishers and songwriters. SESAC acquired the Harry Fox Agency in 2015. In 2015, SESAC acquired the Harry Fox Agency from the National Music Publishers Association. The CRB has not specified an agent for administering mechanical licenses. Royalty Logic raised concerns about competition among agents for licensing musical works. Noncash considerations may influence the price interactive services pay for music access. Major labels acquired an 18% equity stake in Spotify. The issue of competition among collectives in rate proceedings was raised, with noncash considerations affecting the price interactive services pay for music access. Major labels acquired an 18% equity stake in Spotify, leading to shared proceeds with artists and independent labels. Rates paid by interactive services to music publishers are linked to those paid to record labels for performance rights, including equity stakes or advertising revenues. The rates paid by interactive music services to record labels for performance rights are negotiated in the free market. Music publishers can participate in deals for mechanical royalties if they include equity stakes or advertising revenues. Concerns have been raised about fair payment sharing between music publishers and record labels from digital music services. ASCAP and BMI represent about 90% of songs available for licensing in the US, while SESAC and Global Music Rights also handle performance rights licensing. ASCAP and BMI, representing about 90% of songs available for licensing in the US, may result in lower payments for music publishers. SESAC and Global Music Rights also handle performance rights licensing. Publishers have pushed for fair share of performance royalty revenues from streaming services, seeking to negotiate market rates directly. In response, ASCAP and BMI amended rules in 2011 and 2013 to allow music publishers to license public performance rights for new media uses. In response to publishers seeking fair share of performance royalty revenues from streaming services, ASCAP and BMI amended rules in 2011 and 2013 to allow music publishers to license public performance rights for new media uses. However, courts ruled that publishers cannot selectively withdraw rights, leading major music publishers and PROs to propose modifications to consent decrees to permit partial grants of rights. After courts ruled that publishers cannot selectively withdraw rights, major music publishers and PROs proposed modifications to consent decrees to allow partial grants of rights. ASCAP and BMI sought changes to permit bundled licenses and expedited arbitration. DOJ evaluated the consent decrees in 2014 and solicited comments on \"100% licensing\" versus \"fractional licensing.\" DOJ announced in 2016 that consent decrees would require 100% licensing, allowing any rights holder to issue a performance license without consent from others. The Department of Justice (DOJ) announced in 2016 that the consent decrees would require 100% licensing, allowing any rights holder to issue a performance license without consent from others. In response, BMI filed a lawsuit challenging this interpretation, leading to a ruling by Judge Louis Stanton in September 2017 that BMI's consent decree permits fractional licensing. In response to the DOJ's interpretation, BMI filed a lawsuit challenging the requirement for 100% licensing. Judge Louis Stanton ruled in September 2017 that BMI's consent decree allows fractional licensing. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld this decision in December 2017. The Copyright Office introduced new procedures in April 2016 for filing Notices of Intention (NOIs) electronically, reducing filing costs significantly. The Copyright Office introduced new procedures for filing Notices of Intention (NOIs) electronically, allowing licensees to file up to 100 songs at once at a reduced cost of $0.10 per song. Following this change, licensees like Spotify, Amazon, and Google began filing NOIs in bulk. Digital music service companies advocated for digitizing the compulsory licensing process to ensure proper compensation for songwriters and publishers. According to Billboard, digital music service companies contacted the U.S. Copyright Office in late 2015 to argue for digitizing the compulsory licensing process to ensure proper compensation for songwriters and publishers. The Music Modernization Act, passed by the House of Representatives in April 2018, includes provisions for creating a new nonprofit \"mechanical licensing collective\" funded by online music services to offer broad blanket mechanical licenses. The Music Modernization Act proposes changes to the process of obtaining mechanical licenses for online music services, including setting royalty rates and assigning judges for infringement cases. It also extends federal copyright protection to sound recordings made before February 15, 1972, and establishes procedures for royalty payments to producers and engineers. Online music services could pay for a broad blanket mechanical license through a new nonprofit entity called the Mechanical Licensing Collective. The Music Modernization Act proposes changes to obtaining mechanical licenses for online music services. It includes setting royalty rates, assigning judges for infringement cases, and extending federal copyright protection to sound recordings made before February 15, 1972. A new nonprofit entity, the Mechanical Licensing Collective, would administer blanket licenses funded by online music services. The Collective would maintain a musical works database, collect usage reports, and identify copyright owners. The Mechanical Licensing Collective (MLC) would be responsible for maintaining a musical works database, administering blanket licenses, identifying copyright owners, and collecting/distributing royalties from online music services. Songwriters would receive at least 50% of royalties for unmatched works. The MLC is prohibited from negotiating royalty rates, granting licenses for public performances, or engaging in government lobbying activities. The Digital Licensing Collective, responsible for enforcing payment obligations and establishing administrative assessment rates, must maintain records of its activities. Online music services must provide monthly reports and royalties to avoid defaulting on the blanket license. Any disputes can be reviewed in federal district court. The digital licensing collective enforces payment obligations and sets administrative assessment rates, maintaining records of its activities. Online music services must provide monthly reports and royalties to avoid defaulting on the blanket license. Disputes can be reviewed in federal district court, with copyright owners prohibited from suing compliant online music services for infringement. After January 1, 2018, copyright owners could only recover royalties under the new system for unauthorized reproduction or distribution of musical works by online music services. The CRB would use the \"willing buyer/willing seller\" standard to set royalty rates for preexisting subscription services and satellite digital audio services. Judges in the Southern District of New York would set rates for public performances of musical works by online services. The proposed changes would allow judges in the Southern District of New York to consider sound recording public performance rates when setting royalty rates for music services like Music Choice, Muzak, and SiriusXM. The system of assigning judges for ASCAP and BMI cases would also change to a random process for rate-setting cases. The proposed changes in the ASCAP and BMI consent decrees would involve a random process for assigning judges to oversee rate-setting cases. Judges not involved in the original consent decrees would be selected to hear rate proceedings. Additionally, creators of sound recordings made before February 15, 1972, but after January 1, 1923, would be entitled to receive payments from digital music services, along with other legal remedies. Creators of sound recordings made before February 15, 1972, would be entitled to receive payments from digital music services for public performances, along with legal remedies such as damages and attorney's fees under federal law. To qualify for statutory damages or attorney's fees, rights owners must provide specific information to the Copyright Office. Regulations would be issued for filing sound recording identification and contact information.
