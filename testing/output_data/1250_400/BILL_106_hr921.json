During October 1, 1998, through December 31, 1998:\n- 10% increase in swine available for slaughter\n- 8% decrease in packer slaughter capacity\n- 37% increase in Canadian swine imports\n- Lowest live swine prices in the fourth quarter of 1998\n- $2.6 billion reduction in equity capital investment for swine producers in 1998\n- Swine producers' share of the consumer pork dollar was $0.22 in 1998 In 1998, swine producers experienced a $2.6 billion reduction in equity capital investment, with their share of the consumer pork dollar dropping to $0.22. Despite stable retail prices, pork consumption increased by seven percent, making it the only meat protein with a per capita consumption rise.
