    "content": "In this paper, a new approach called knowledge flow is developed to transfer knowledge from multiple deep nets (teachers) to a new deep net model (student). The teachers and student can have different structures and be trained on different tasks. The student becomes independent of the teachers after training, outperforming fine-tuning and other knowledge exchange methods in various learning tasks. Research communities have developed various deep net architectures for different tasks, with some architectures trained from scratch and others fine-tuned using structurally similar deep nets. In reinforcement learning, different approaches like progressive neural nets, PathNet, 'Growing a Brain', Actor-mimic, and Knowledge distillation have been explored to transfer knowledge from multiple teachers to a new student model. The knowledge flow technique addresses limitations in existing methods by transferring knowledge from multiple teachers to a student model during training, ensuring independence of the student model regardless of the number of teachers used. Our knowledge flow technique transfers knowledge from multiple teachers to a student model during training, ensuring independence of the student model regardless of the number of teachers used. This approach is flexible in choosing teacher models and applicable to various tasks from reinforcement learning to fully-supervised training. The goal of reinforcement learning is to find a policy that maximizes the expected future reward from each state x t. In this paper, the asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) formulation is followed, where the policy mapping and value function are approximated by deep nets with parameters \u03b8 \u03c0 and \u03b8 v. The policy parameters are optimized using a loss function based on negative log-likelihood and a negative entropy regularizer. The policy parameters \u03b8 \u03c0 and \u03b8 v are optimized using a loss function based on negative log-likelihood and a negative entropy regularizer. The goal is to maximize the expected future reward from each state x t by learning a policy and a value function that maximize expected return. Warm-start techniques can be used to optimize the value function V \u03b8v, and a framework called knowledge flow is proposed to transfer knowledge from 'teachers' to a deep net under training. The knowledge flow framework transfers knowledge from multiple pre-trained deep nets (teachers) to a student deep net during training. The student initially relies heavily on one teacher's knowledge, which gradually decreases as training progresses. This process is illustrated with example deep nets in a figure. The knowledge flow framework transfers knowledge from multiple pre-trained deep nets (teachers) to a student deep net during training by modifying the student net with transformed and scaled intermediate representations from the teachers. The student model should eventually perform well on the target task without relying on teachers. The student model is trained to eventually perform well on the target task without relying on teachers. As training progresses, the student is encouraged to become more independent and master the desired task on its own. This is achieved by introducing additional loss functions to capture the student's reliance on teachers and ensure successful knowledge transfer. The student model is trained to master the task independently by introducing additional loss functions to capture reliance on teachers and ensure successful knowledge transfer. This includes dependency loss and behavior stability loss to decrease teacher influence. Parameters control the strength of this influence reduction in both supervised and reinforcement learning scenarios. The tilde ('\u00b7') denotes the dependence on parameters w, Q, f, and \u03c0. Parameters \u03b8 and \u03b8 old are used from current and previous iterations. \u03bb 1 and \u03bb 2 control the strength to decrease teacher influence in supervised and reinforcement learning. Initially, a low \u03bb 1 allows student reliance on teachers, gradually increasing independence. The method reduces negative transfer by decreasing teacher layer weight. Despite differing objectives, students benefit from teacher knowledge transfer. Modifications to deep nets and loss functions dep and KL are used to decrease teacher influence. In experiments, modifications are made to deep nets and loss functions to decrease teacher influence. Candidate sets are defined for each layer in the student model, combining layers from teachers. Normalized weights are introduced to decide which representation to trust at each layer. Combined intermediate representations are obtained for the student model using introduced matrices. The method aims to reduce negative transfer by decreasing teacher layer weight. In the student deep net, normalized weights are introduced for each layer to obtain combined intermediate representations using matrices. It is recommended to link one teacher layer to one or two student layers to avoid negative transfer. Additional trainable parameters are introduced but not part of the resulting student network. In the final stage of training, the student becomes independent and no longer relies on additional parameters like Q and w introduced in the framework. The influence of teachers is gradually decreased by encouraging the student to rely more on its own layers. This is achieved by minimizing the dependence cost, which encourages the student to become more independent. During the final stage of training, the student becomes independent by increasing weights for its own layers. Minimizing the dependence cost encourages independence, but a fast decrease in teacher influence can degrade performance. To prevent this, a Kullback-Leibler regularizer is used to slow down changes in the student's output distribution. To prevent rapid changes in a student's output distribution, a Kullback-Leibler regularizer is used. Knowledge flow is evaluated in reinforcement and supervised learning tasks, with results reported using only the student model to avoid teacher net influence. In reinforcement learning, Atari games are used as input for the agent, which predicts actions based on rewards and input images. The agent's architecture includes three hidden layers, with the first being a convolutional layer with 16 filters of size 8x8 and stride 4. The agent selects actions based on rewards and input images from the environment. It uses a fully forward architecture with three hidden layers, including convolutional layers and a fully connected layer. The model outputs a probability distribution over actions and an estimated value function. Hyper-parameter settings are similar to BID17, except for using Adam with shared statistics instead of RMSProp. The learning rate is gradually decreased to zero. \u03bb 1 and \u03bb 2 are selected randomly from predefined values. The learning rate is set to 10 \u22124 and gradually decreased to zero for all experiments. To select \u03bb 1 and \u03bb 2, we randomly sample from predefined values. Each experiment is repeated 25 times with different random seeds. Evaluation metrics involve playing each game for 30 episodes and following the 'no-op' procedure. Results compare our framework with PathNet and progressive neural net using their experimental settings. Our transfer framework outperforms PathNet and progressive neural net in 11 out of 14 experiments. With two teachers, our student model achieves higher scores with fewer parameters. Increasing the number of teachers improves student performance across all experiments. Training curves are shown in FIG1, demonstrating effective knowledge transfer.

Various image classification benchmarks are used for supervised learning, with evaluation metrics reported on the test set. The study evaluates student models trained with multiple teachers on datasets like CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Parameters \u03bb 1 and \u03bb 2 are determined using validation sets. Evaluation is based on top-1 error rate on test sets. Experiments are conducted with standard data augmentation and Densenet as baseline. Teachers are trained on various datasets before training the student model. Results are compared to fine-tuning and baseline models.

Results show that fine-tuning from a CIFAR-100 expert improves performance, while fine-tuning from an SVHN expert performs worse. Knowledge flow from both good and inadequate teachers improves results by 13% over the baseline. Additional results are in the appendix, and related work on knowledge transfer is briefly discussed. The study discusses knowledge transfer from multiple pre-trained teacher nets to a student model. Different techniques like PathNet and Progressive Net are compared to the proposed method, which ensures independence of the student during training. Distral, a combination of 'distill & transfer learning', involves joint training of multiple tasks with a shared policy. Our method ensures student independence during training, addressing a limitation in previous work. Distral combines distill and transfer learning by jointly training multiple tasks with a shared policy. Knowledge flow focuses on a single task, leveraging information from multiple teachers to help a student learn a new task. Other related work includes actor-mimic, learning without forgetting, growing a brain, policy distillation, domain adaptation, and lifelong learning. The text discusses a general knowledge flow approach that leverages information from multiple teachers to help a student learn a new task. Results show improvements in reinforcement learning and supervised learning compared to training from scratch or fine-tuning. Future plans include learning when to use different teachers and actively swapping them during training. Experiments were conducted on various datasets using knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge from larger to smaller models. The text discusses knowledge distillation (KD) from larger teacher models to smaller student models on various datasets like MNIST, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. The student models have fewer parameters than the teacher models. Results show that the student models benefit from both the output layer and intermediate layer representations of the teacher models, leading to consistently better performance than traditional KD methods. Our framework outperforms KD by leveraging not only the teacher's output layer but also intermediate layer representations. The 'EMNIST Letters' dataset includes 26 balanced classes of handwritten letters in 28x28 pixel images. The 'EMNIST Digits' dataset consists of 10 balanced classes of handwritten digits in the same image size. Training and test sets for each dataset are specified. The study uses the MNIST model as a baseline, teacher, and student model, training teachers on different EMNIST datasets. Results are compared to fine-tuning and state-of-the-art EMNIST results, showing superior student learning in our framework with expert teacher guidance. In our study, we compare the performance of student learning in our framework with expert, semi-expert, and non-expert teachers on the EMNIST Letters dataset. Results show better performance compared to baseline and fine-tuning methods. Additionally, we use the STL-10 dataset with 10 balanced classes and compare our results to CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 teachers.

Ablation study confirms learning with untrained teachers leads to worse performance. The ablation study confirms that learning with untrained teachers leads to worse performance compared to knowledgeable teachers. Results show that knowledge flow achieves higher rewards in different environments and teacher-student settings. The KL term prevents drastic changes in the student's output distribution when the teachers' influence decreases. The ablation study investigates the importance of the KL term in maintaining performance when teachers' influence decreases. Without the KL term, rewards drop drastically, but with it, performance remains stable. Training with the KL term achieves higher rewards compared to training without it. Additionally, experiments using different teacher architectures, such as BID16, show the effectiveness of the KL term in knowledge transfer. In additional experiments, different architectures for the teacher and student models are used. The teacher model from BID16 has 3 convolutional layers with 32, 64, and 64 filters, followed by a fully connected layer with 512 ReLUs. The student model from BID17 has 2 convolutional layers with 16 and 32 filters, followed by a fully connected layer with 256 ReLUs. Both models have output layers for actions and values. The target task is KungFu Master, with teachers being experts in Seaquest and Riverraid. Results show that learning with teachers of different architectures can achieve similar performance. In the experiment, teachers with different architectures achieved similar performance to teachers with the same architecture when training the student model for the KungFu Master task. Using an average network for parameter initialization also showed positive results in performance. Using an average network for parameter initialization resulted in similar performance compared to using a single model. The experiment showed that an exponential running average of model weights can achieve comparable rewards. Various techniques for knowledge transfer have been explored, such as fine-tuning, progressive neural nets, PathNet, and actor-mimic learning. The discussed method involves using multiple teacher nets for training, introducing lateral connections with scaling using normalized weights to ensure independence of the student. This approach contrasts with techniques like PathNet and Progressive Net that also focus on transfer learning and avoiding catastrophic forgetting. The discussed method introduces lateral connections with scaling using normalized weights to ensure student independence, contrasting with techniques like PathNet and Progressive Net. Distral combines distillation and transfer learning for joint training of multiple tasks, sharing a distilled policy to encourage consistency between policies. Knowledge flow focuses on single-task transfer of information, unlike multi-task learning which addresses multiple tasks simultaneously. In contrast to multi-task learning, knowledge flow leverages information from multiple teachers to help a student learn a new task. Knowledge distillation distills information from a larger net into a smaller one, while actor-mimic enables an agent to address multiple tasks simultaneously and generalize knowledge to new domains. The proposed technique allows knowledge transfer between different domains. The proposed technique allows knowledge transfer between different domains by leveraging information from multiple expert teachers. It combines feature regression and cross entropy loss to encourage the student to produce similar actions and representations. This technique enables adding a new task to a deep net without forgetting the original capabilities, by using only data from the new task while retaining the old capabilities."
