Generating classification weights has been applied in many meta-learning approaches for few shot image classification. In this work, Attentive Weights Generation for few shot learning via Information Maximization (AWGIM) is introduced to address issues by generating different classification weights for diverse query samples. This approach maximizes the lower bound of mutual information between generated weights and query as well as support data. AWGIM achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets. This work introduces Attentive Weights Generation for few shot learning via Information Maximization (AWGIM) to unify information maximization into few shot learning. AWGIM proves effective in experiments, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets. Few shot learning enables deep models to learn from very few samples, with meta learning being a popular approach for this problem. Meta learning is a popular approach for few shot learning, where models extract high-level knowledge across tasks to quickly adapt to new tasks. Different methods like gradient-based and metric-based are used, with weights generation showing effectiveness. Attentive Weights Generation for few shot learning via Information Maximization (AWGIM) is introduced in this work to address challenges in generating classification weights for limited labeled data. In this work, Attentive Weights Generation for few shot learning via Information Maximization (AWGIM) is introduced to address limitations in generating classification weights for limited labeled data. AWGIM generates classification weights specifically for each query sample by maximizing the lower bound of mutual information between the generated weights and query, support data. This approach ensures that the weights are fitted to diverse query data, making it the first work to introduce Variational Information Maximization in few shot learning. The computational overhead is minimal due to the nature of few shot problems. AWGIM introduces Variational Information Maximization in few shot learning to maximize mutual information between generated weights and query data. It eliminates inner updates without sacrificing performance and achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets. Previous methods in few shot learning include gradient-based approaches and metric-based methods. In gradient-based approaches, optimal initialization for tasks is learned, while in metric-based methods, a similarity metric between query and support samples is learned. Some works also consider spatial information or local image descriptors for richer similarities. Generating classification weights directly has been explored, with methods like linear combinations of weights and generating weights from activations of a feature extractor. Graph neural network denoising autoencoders and generating \"fast weights\" from loss gradients for each task have also been proposed. Some methods for few-shot classification include generating classification weights from activations of a feature extractor, using graph neural network denoising autoencoders, and generating \"fast weights\" from loss gradients. Other approaches involve generative models to generate more data, closed-form solutions for few-shot classification, and integrating label propagation on a transductive graph. Attention mechanisms have shown success in modeling interactions between queries and key-value pairs in various contexts. In this work, attention mechanisms are used for few-shot image classification by maximizing mutual information. The approach contrasts with regression methods that focus on stochastic processes and variational objectives. Mutual information measures the decrease in uncertainty of one variable when another is known, with attention employed to encode task and query-task information. The mutual information measures uncertainty decrease in one variable when another is known. It is optimized using attention mechanisms for few-shot image classification. The approach contrasts with regression methods and focuses on task and query-task information encoding. The proposed model utilizes attention mechanisms to generate classification weights for predicting class labels in a N-way K-shot task under episodic training paradigm. The objective is to maximize mutual information between variables, enhancing sensitivity to different query samples. The approach contrasts with regression methods and focuses on task and query-task information encoding. The proposed model utilizes attention mechanisms to generate classification weights for N-way K-shot tasks under episodic training paradigm. Support set contains labeled samples, query set requires label prediction based on support set. Meta-training optimizes model with meta-loss on query set, while meta-testing evaluates performance on query set with labeled support set. Disjoint classes in meta-training and meta-testing require quick adaptation to novel tasks. Feature extractor outputs image embeddings, meta-learner generates classification weights for tasks using Latent Embedding Optimization (LEO). The proposed model utilizes attention mechanisms to generate classification weights for N-way K-shot tasks. Latent Embedding Optimization (LEO) is used to generate classification weights for different tasks by learning a lower-dimensional latent space. This approach avoids updating high-dimensional weights in the inner loop, improving efficiency. The proposed model, Latent Embedding Optimization (LEO), generates classification weights for N-way K-shot tasks by learning a lower-dimensional latent space. This approach avoids updating high-dimensional weights in the inner loop, improving efficiency. LEO differs from AWGIM in that it does not require inner updates to adapt the model. Instead, LEO generates fixed weights conditioned on the support set within one task. The proposed method, LEO, is a special case of AWGIM for N-way K-shot tasks. It involves a feature extractor processing images into d-dimensional vectors. Two paths, contextual and attentive, encode task context and query samples. Generated classification weights predict labels and maximize mutual information. The contextual path uses a self-attention network to learn task representations. The encoding process in section 3.4 involves two paths: contextual and attentive. The contextual path learns task representations with a self-attention network, while the attentive path generates adaptive classification weights based on individual query examples attending to the task context. This approach ensures that the classification weights are tailored to different query samples and are aware of the task context. The attentive path introduces adaptive classification weights based on individual query examples attending to the task context. A multi-head self-attention network is used to encode global task information, different from the contextual path. The cross attention network is applied on each query sample and task-aware support set to produce Xap. Multi-head attention with h heads is utilized in both paths to enhance learning capabilities. The cross attention network is applied on query samples and task-aware support sets to produce Xap. Multi-head attention is used in both paths to learn comprehensive representations. Xcp\u2295ap combines latent representations for support sets and query samples to generate classification weights. The weights follow a Gaussian distribution with diagonal covariance. The classification weights for query samples are generated by a weights generator that considers task-context and individual query samples. The weights follow a Gaussian distribution with diagonal covariance, and are sampled during meta-training. The prediction for query data is computed using the sampled classification weights. Additionally, there are two decoders that reconstruct Xcp and Xap based on the generated weights. The weights generator produces classification weights for query samples based on task-context and individual query samples. Two decoders reconstruct Xcp and Xap using the generated weights. The weights are not sensitive to different query samples, indicating that information from the attentive path is not well retained. The weights generator produces classification weights for query samples based on task-context and individual query samples. However, the generated weights are not sensitive to different query samples, indicating that information from the attentive path is not well retained. To address this limitation, the proposal is to maximize the mutual information between generated weights and support as well as query data using Variational Information Maximization. The proposal is to use Variational Information Maximization to compute the lower bound of Equation 5, aiming to maximize the mutual information between generated weights and support/query data. This involves approximating the true posterior distribution using Gaussian distributions and maximizing the log likelihood to reconstruct data with L2 loss. The proposal suggests using Variational Information Maximization to maximize the mutual information between generated weights and support/query data by approximating distributions as Gaussian. The loss function for training the network involves reconstructing data with L2 loss and deciding weightage for different terms using hyper-parameters \u03bb1, \u03bb2, \u03bb3. The method forces the generated classification weights to carry information about support data and query samples, unlike in LEO where weight generation does not involve specific query samples. The proposed method involves maximizing mutual information between generated weights and support/query data using Variational Information Maximization. It avoids the inner update in LEO, reducing training and inference time significantly. Experimental evaluation is conducted on miniImageNet and tieredImageNet datasets. The empirical evaluation is conducted on miniImageNet and tieredImageNet datasets, comparing with other methods and analyzing the model's performance on subsets of the ILSVRC-12 dataset. MiniImageNet has 100 classes with 600 images each, while tieredImageNet has 608 classes and 779,165 images selected from 34 higher level nodes in ImageNet hierarchy. Image features from LEO are used for training. In total, there are 608 classes and 779,165 images selected from 34 higher level nodes in the ImageNet hierarchy.

The results of Dynamic on miniImageNet with WRN-28-10 as the feature extractor are reported in (Gidaris & Komodakis, 2019). Results on miniImageNet and tieredImageNet are shown in Table 1 and 2 respectively, with methods categorized into metric-based, gradient-based, and graph-based approaches. AWGIM outperforms all methods in the top parts of the tables and shows competitive performance in the bottom part. AWGIM is compared with other classification weights generation methods using WRN-28-10 as the backbone network, outperforming LEO in all settings. AWGIM demonstrates competitive performance, outperforming LEO in all settings. The attentive path is removed for comparison with LEO, and ablation analysis is conducted on different components. Classification weights are shuffled randomly to show optimality for query samples. Detailed analysis is provided in Table 3, with results of LEO for reference. Different generators are studied, with \"Generator conditioned on S only\" trained with cross entropy and reconstruction loss for support set. In the upper part of the table, the effect of attentive path is studied by implementing two generators. \"Generator conditioned on S with IM\" includes cross entropy and reconstruction loss for support set, while \"Generator conditioned on S only\" is trained with cross entropy on query set, achieving similar results to \"Generator in LEO\". Self-attention is found to be no worse than relation networks in LEO. By replacing attention modules with 2-layer MLPs in \"MLP encoding\", accuracy close to LEO is achieved even without attention for task-contextual information encoding. In the context of studying the effect of attentive path, the use of 2-layer MLPs, known as \"MLP encoding\", shows promising results in encoding task-contextual information without attention. However, the importance of maximizing information is highlighted when setting certain parameters to zero significantly drops performance. Ablation analysis on the impact of information maximization reveals the crucial role of maximizing mutual information between weights and support, with noticeable effects on performance when certain parameters are set to zero. The relative importance of classification on support and reconstruction is also investigated, showing that certain parameters affect performance noticeably. Maximizing mutual information between weights and support is crucial for performance, with \u03bb1 = \u03bb2 = 0 significantly degrading accuracy compared to \u03bb3 = 0. The importance of support label prediction for information maximization is highlighted. Classification weights in AWGIM are specific to each query sample, and shuffling them between samples within the same class or between different classes affects accuracy. Random shuffle between classes notably decreases accuracy in 5-way 1-shot experiments, while shuffle within class has minimal impact. In this work, Attentive Weights Generation via Information Maximization (AWGIM) is introduced for few-shot image classification. The generated weights for query samples are specific to each sample, with shuffling between samples within the same class or between different classes impacting accuracy. Random shuffle between classes decreases accuracy in 5-way 1-shot experiments, while shuffle within class has minimal impact. Larger support sets lead to more diverse and specific classification weights for each query sample in 5-way 5-shot experiments. AWGIM is introduced for few-shot image classification, generating optimal classification weights for each query sample. It maximizes mutual information between weights and query/support data. AWGIM utilizes mutual information techniques for few-shot learning, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets. The attentive path involves multi-head attention and encoding global task information. AWGIM is a method for few-shot image classification that generates optimal classification weights for each query sample. It utilizes mutual information techniques and multi-head attention for encoding global task information. Additionally, it can be adapted for few-shot regression tasks by modifying the number of classes and loss function during meta-training. During meta-training, AWGIM is adapted for few-shot regression tasks by setting N=1 and using mean square error instead of cross entropy loss. Data points (x, y) are used to generate weight and bias parameters for a three-layer MLP with hidden dimension 40. Sinusoidal and linear regression tasks are constructed, with multi-head attention improving performance in experiments on miniImageNet dataset. Single-head attention struggles with extremely scarce data, and AWGIM is compared with LEO in terms of convergence speed using a batch size of 16 for both methods. The results in Table 4 show that multi-head attention improves performance, especially in 5-way 1-shot experiments. Single head attention struggles with scarce data. AWGIM converges faster than LEO and outperforms it, with minimal computational overhead. Table 5 shows that AWGIM's use of self-attention and cross attention incurs negligible overhead. The experiments on miniImageNet with batch size 64 show that self-attention and cross attention in AWGIM incur minimal overhead compared to MLP encoding due to small values of N, K, and |Q|. Visualization of classification weights using t-SNE reveals closer clustering of decoded weights compared to input weights. The experiments on miniImageNet with batch size 64 show that self-attention and cross attention in AWGIM incur minimal overhead compared to MLP encoding due to small values of N, K, and |Q|. Visualization results in Figure 4 display the inputs to the generator g and the generated classification weights, indicating that g can generate adapted weights for different query samples."
