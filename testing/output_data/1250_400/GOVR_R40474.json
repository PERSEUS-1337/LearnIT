    "content": "This report analyzes recent laws and congressional proposals related to gun regulation in the District of Columbia. Key statutes and bills include federal provisions, the D.C. Firearms Control Regulation Act, the Second Amendment Enforcement Act, and the Firearms Control Amendment Act. Congressional proposals often coincide with discussions on voting rights for the District. The report discusses congressional proposals to amend the District of Columbia's gun laws, specifically Title II of S. 160 from the 111th Congress and H.R. 645 from the 112th Congress. It analyzes the impact of these proposals on DC firearms laws following the Supreme Court's decision in District of Columbia v. Heller, which affirmed an individual's right to possess a firearm for self-defense within the home. In District of Columbia v. Heller, the Supreme Court affirmed an individual's right to possess a firearm for self-defense within the home, declaring unconstitutional three provisions of the District's Firearms Control Regulation Act. In response to the Supreme Court's decision in District of Columbia v. Heller affirming an individual's right to possess a firearm for self-defense at home, the DC Council enacted emergency legislation to amend the city's gun laws. This led to the Firearms Control Emergency Amendment Act of 2008, which faced criticism for not fully complying with the Heller decision. Additionally, H.R. 6691, the Second Amendment Enforcement Act, was introduced in Congress to potentially loosen provisions of the District's existing gun laws. H.R. 6691, the Second Amendment Enforcement Act, was introduced in response to the Supreme Court's decision in District of Columbia v. Heller. It aimed to overturn or loosen provisions of the District's existing gun laws. The proposal was later adopted into H.R. 6842 but did not become law. Senator John Ensign also introduced an amendment using the language of H.R. 6842, which was approved by the Senate but faced stalled movement. The Firearms Control Amendment Act of 2008 (FCAA) and the Inoperable Pistol Amendment Act of 2008 (IPAA) were passed by the DC Council and transmitted to Congress for approval. These acts amended firearms provisions in the DC Code and imposed new restrictions on firearm regulation and ownership. The amendments were challenged but upheld in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in 2010. The DC Code was amended by the FCAA and IPAA, which imposed new restrictions on firearm regulation and ownership. These amendments were challenged but upheld in court. Congressional legislation like H.R. 645 seeks to overturn some of these provisions while considering the new acts. The DC Code was amended by the FCAA and IPAA, imposing new restrictions on firearm regulation and ownership. Congressional legislation like H.R. 645 aims to limit the District's ability to regulate firearm possession and repeal registration schemes. Federal firearms laws set minimum standards, allowing states to supplement with their own laws within the limits of the Home Rule Act. The Home Rule Act grants the District of Columbia the authority to create its own laws, including regulations on firearms. While Congress can still legislate for the District and impose limits on its authority, the Act allows the DC Council to amend laws passed by Congress. The Home Rule Act grants the District of Columbia the authority to create its own laws, including regulations on firearms. Congress can still legislate for the District and impose limits on its authority. The question of whether the District can amend or repeal a congressional enactment depends on Congress's intent. For example, H.R. 645 and S. 160 place limits on the District's legislative authority in certain areas. Section 3 of H.R. 645 and Title II-S. 160 impose limits on the District of Columbia's authority regarding firearms. The District cannot prohibit or unduly burden individuals from acquiring, possessing, transporting, or using firearms for lawful purposes. Private ownership or use of firearms cannot be discouraged or eliminated by the District's laws or regulations. The proposed language in H.R. 645 and S. 160 limits the District of Columbia's authority on firearms, ensuring that individuals can acquire, possess, transport, and use firearms for lawful purposes without being discouraged or eliminated by the District's laws. The Council would not have the power to create laws related to firearms regulation, and the District would be unable to prohibit possession of firearms not already regulated under federal law. The proposed language in H.R. 645 and S. 160 limits the District of Columbia's authority on firearms, ensuring individuals can possess firearms for lawful purposes without being discouraged by the District's laws. The District would be unable to create stricter provisions beyond federal laws, and its authority to regulate the carrying of firearms would be limited. The proposed language in H.R. 645 limits the District of Columbia's authority on firearms, allowing individuals to possess firearms for lawful purposes. The District could regulate concealed or open carry but may not have the power to prohibit carrying firearms altogether. This differs from Title II- S. 160, which stated that the District could regulate or prohibit carrying firearms. The congressional provision in H.R. 645 limits the District of Columbia's authority on firearms, allowing possession for lawful purposes. The DC Code's previous definition of \"machine gun\" included any semiautomatic weapon capable of shooting more than 12 shots without manual reloading, restricting registration to mostly revolvers. The NFA defines a \"machine gun\" as a weapon that can shoot automatically more than one shot without manual reloading. The District of Columbia amended its definition of \"machine gun\" to align with federal law, allowing semiautomatic firearms to be registered. However, the District also prohibits certain firearms based on a list similar to California's laws. If H.R. 645 is enacted, the definition of \"machine gun\" would revert to its pre-Heller state. The District of Columbia now allows the registration of semiautomatic firearms, aligning with federal law. However, certain firearms are still prohibited based on a list similar to California's laws. If H.R. 645 is passed, the definition of \"machine gun\" would revert to its pre-Heller state, continuing to align with federal regulations. The District of Columbia now allows the registration of pistols for self-defense under the FCAA, including semiautomatic handguns that meet federal definitions. The FCAA also exempts temporary possession of a registered firearm in the home for self-defense. Amendments to registration requirements prohibit those with certain criminal convictions from registering firearms. The FCAA in the District of Columbia allows the registration of pistols for self-defense, including semiautomatic handguns. Certain criminal convictions prohibit individuals from registering firearms, and applicants must complete a firearms training course. The Chief of Police is required to conduct ballistics identification on registered pistols and limit registrations to one per person every 30 days. H.R. 645 would repeal the registration requirement for firearms in DC, eliminating the need for a registration certificate or licensing of gun owners. The Chief of Police would still conduct ballistics identification on registered pistols and limit registrations to one per person every 30 days. H.R. 645 would eliminate the registration requirement for firearms in DC, removing the need for registration certificates or licensing of gun owners. The Chief of Police would no longer be required to conduct ballistics testing on pistols or limit registrations to one per person every 30 days. Additionally, the bill would allow the transfer of ammunition to any person, excluding restricted pistol bullets. H.R. 645 aims to eliminate registration requirements for firearms in DC, including the need for registration certificates or licensing of gun owners. It would also allow the transfer of ammunition to any person, excluding restricted pistol bullets, and remove the requirement for licensed dealers to track ammunition inventory. Additionally, the bill permits interstate purchase of firearms in different ways compared to Title II- S. 160. H.R. 645 and Title II- S. 160 propose different methods for interstate purchase of firearms. Title II- S. 160 suggests amending federal law to allow federal licensees in Maryland or Virginia to sell handguns to DC residents. On the other hand, H.R. 645 would amend the DC Code to allow Maryland and Virginia firearms dealers to sell handguns to District residents. This would require compliance with legal conditions in both jurisdictions. The GCA requires licensed dealers to sell handguns with secure storage or safety devices. The District of Columbia's trigger lock requirement was amended to mandate firearms be unloaded and secured by a trigger lock when in lawful possession. The FCAA in the District of Columbia mandates that firearms must be unloaded and secured by a trigger lock when in lawful possession to prevent minors from accessing them without permission. Violating these storage responsibilities can result in criminal penalties. Title II- S. 160 aims to repeal this section of the FCAA, while Section 7 of H.R. 645 proposes penalties for allowing minors access to loaded firearms resulting in injury. Section 7 of H.R. 645 proposes penalties for unlawful storage of loaded firearms that result in injury to minors. Violators could face a fine up to $1,000 and/or imprisonment for up to one year, with exceptions for securely locked containers or trigger locks. Penalties for unlawful storage of loaded firearms resulting in injury to minors include a fine up to $1,000 and/or imprisonment for up to one year, with exceptions for securely locked containers or trigger locks. Exceptions also apply if the firearm is stored on the person's body, if the minor gained access unlawfully, if the minor was acting in self-defense, if the minor was supervised during hunting or target shooting, or if the firearm is in possession of a law enforcement officer on duty. No prosecution is pursued if the victim is the child of the violator unless gross negligence is evident. The current chunk discusses the penalties for violating the firearm registration scheme in DC, including fines and imprisonment for unregistered possession of a firearm. H.R. 645 aims to repeal this registration scheme and remove criminal penalties for selling firearms to minors under 18. H.R. 645 aims to repeal the firearm registration scheme in DC and remove criminal penalties for selling firearms to minors under 18. It also harmonizes definitions between Titles 7 and 22 of the DC Code, allowing the District to restrict possession of firearms on its property. The IPAA amended DC law to allow the District of Columbia to prohibit or restrict possession of firearms on its property. Private property owners in DC can also restrict firearms on their premises, except for law enforcement personnel. H.R. 645 addresses property owners' ability to restrict firearms on their premises, unlike existing DC law. The proposed provision in H.R. 645 would further limit private landlords in DC from restricting tenants' possession of firearms on their premises. The District would have the authority to restrict firearms on public property with security measures in place, but this would not apply to lessees occupying residential or business premises. The proposed language in H.R. 645 would restrict the District's authority to regulate firearms to \"buildings or structures under its control,\" excluding lessees occupying residential or business premises. It is unclear if the District could regulate firearms on other real property under its control. The scope of the District's authority to regulate firearm possession in buildings under its control is ambiguous. The IPAA repealed the Chief's authority to issue licenses for concealed carry, which would be reinstated by H.R. 645. The bill also maintains the prohibition on carrying rifles or shotguns in DC, with exceptions for certain circumstances. H.R. 645 would reinstate the Chief's authority to issue licenses for concealed carry in DC, while also maintaining the prohibition on carrying rifles or shotguns within the district, with specific exceptions for certain circumstances. H.R. 645 would re-adapt and modify provisions regarding carrying firearms without a license in certain circumstances, including in a person's dwelling, place of business, on owned or invited land, for recreational purposes, or while being transported lawfully. If enacted, the Chief's authority to issue concealed carry licenses would be restored, allowing firearm owners to carry outside these specified scenarios. H.R. 645 would restore the Chief's authority to issue concealed carry licenses, allowing firearm owners to carry outside specified scenarios. The bill also maintains provisions for lawful transportation of firearms, requiring them to be unloaded and secured during transport. The IPAA made a technical change to the District Code by including toy and antique pistols as types of firearms prohibited from being used in violent crimes. H.R. 645 would provide jurisdiction to the Office of Administrative Hearings for cases related to firearms dealer licenses. The FCAA previously granted the office jurisdiction over firearm registration, but since H.R. 645 repeals the registration scheme, this jurisdiction may no longer be necessary. The FCAA granted the Office of Administrative Hearings jurisdiction over firearm registration, but with the repeal of the registration scheme under H.R. 645, this jurisdiction may no longer be necessary. The amendments to the DC Code related to dealer licenses and firearm transfers would also be affected by the repeal of the FCAA and IPAA. The FCAA created new requirements for obtaining a registration certificate to sell or transfer firearms. H.R. 645 would repeal the District's registration scheme, allowing individuals not prohibited by federal or District law to apply for a dealer's license or transfer firearms. Duties such as reporting loss or theft of firearms would also be repealed. The federal GCA prohibits certain individuals from possessing firearms. The federal GCA prohibits certain individuals from possessing firearms, including those convicted of certain crimes, fugitives, drug users, and those with mental health issues. Other prohibited individuals include those unlawfully in the US, dishonorably discharged from the Armed Forces, and convicted of domestic violence. It is illegal for both licensed dealers and non-licensed persons to sell or transfer firearms to someone they know or believe is prohibited. Under the federal Gun Control Act, certain individuals are prohibited from possessing firearms, including those convicted of crimes, fugitives, drug users, and those with mental health issues. It is illegal for licensed dealers and non-licensed persons to sell or transfer firearms to prohibited individuals. The Firearms Control Amendment Act imposes new eligibility requirements for registration certificates, requiring compliance with federal law and additional criteria under DC law. Non-licensed individuals can only sell or transfer firearms to licensed dealers, and private sales between non-licensed individuals must go through a licensed dealer. This would remain unchanged under H.R. 645. Under DC law, non-licensed individuals can only sell or transfer firearms to licensed dealers. H.R. 645 would remove the registration requirement under DC law, making only federal disqualifications applicable for transfers. The bill would also impact the assault weapons ban created by the FCAA, expanding the definition of \"assault weapon\" to include specific firearms and characteristics. The definition of \"assault weapon\" under the FCAA includes specific rifles, shotguns, and pistols with military-type characteristics. The Chief can designate any firearm as an assault weapon if it poses a similar threat. The new definition applies to the Assault Weapon Manufacturing Strict Liability Act of 1990, holding manufacturers liable for damages from bodily injury or death caused by the discharge of designated assault weapons. The FCAA defines \"assault weapon\" and holds manufacturers strictly liable for damages from bodily injury or death caused by the discharge of such weapons in DC. The FCAA also prohibits possession of large capacity ammunition feeding devices in the District. The FCAA prohibits possession of large capacity ammunition feeding devices in DC, even though residents can now register and possess semiautomatic firearms. This provision would be repealed by Section 14 of H.R. 645, which allows licensed dealers to transfer firearms after a background check through NICS. The licensee can transfer a firearm after a background check is completed and the transferee is approved, unless a state imposes a waiting period. The IPAA has extended the waiting period for all firearms to 10 days, not just pistols. Non-licensed persons are not required to perform a background check under federal law. The IPAA extends the waiting period for all firearms to 10 days, not just pistols. The FCAA adds provisions for microstamping on semiautomatic pistols manufactured after January 1, 2011. The FCAA introduces new provisions for microstamping on semiautomatic pistols manufactured after January 1, 2011. It requires manufacturers to provide specific information to law enforcement and prohibits the sale or possession of pistols not on the California Roster after January 1, 2009. The FCAA prohibits the sale, transfer, or import of certain pistols into DC after January 1, 2009, unless lawfully owned and registered before that date. Residents can only sell or transfer non-rostered pistols through licensed dealers. The Chief must review the California Roster annually and can revise the list of unsafe handguns. The IPAA requires a special permit for firearm discharge, except for self-defense. The District can restrict firearm possession on its property and private property owners can do the same. The FCAA prohibits certain pistols in DC after 2009, residents can only sell non-rostered pistols through licensed dealers. The IPAA requires a special permit for firearm discharge, except for self-defense. The District can restrict firearm possession on its property and private property owners can do the same, except for law enforcement personnel. H.R. 645 would repeal these provisions."
