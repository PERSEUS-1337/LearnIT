    "content": "Under the Congressional Review Act (CRA), agencies must submit a report to Congress and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) before a rule can take effect. For major rules, there is an additional waiting period for Congress to review and potentially overturn the rule using expedited procedures, primarily in the Senate. GAO also provides a report on each major rule's compliance with procedural steps in the rulemaking process. Members can use expedited procedures under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to overturn a rule. This process primarily occurs in the Senate and includes steps such as submitting a resolution of disapproval, a nondebatable motion to proceed, up to 10 hours of debate, and a simple majority vote. If both houses pass the resolution, it goes to the President for signature or veto, with the option for Congress to override a veto. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to overturn a rule with a simple majority vote. If a joint resolution of disapproval is passed by both houses and signed by the President (or if Congress overrides a veto), the rule is nullified and the previous status quo is reinstated. The CRA prohibits the issuance of a rule in a similar form unless authorized by a subsequent law. The CRA prohibits issuing a rule in a similar form after it has been nullified unless authorized by a subsequent law. The definition of \"rule\" under the CRA is broad and covers most executive branch entities, excluding actions of the President. The CRA adopts the APA definition of \"rule\" but includes three exceptions to that definition. The CRA adopts a broad definition of the word \"rule\" from the APA but creates three exceptions. The APA definition includes a wide range of agency actions, while the CRA narrows it down by excluding certain rules of particular applicability. The CRA adopts a broad definition of the word \"rule\" from the APA but creates three exceptions. The term \"rule\" does not include rules of particular applicability, agency management or personnel, or agency organization that does not substantially affect non-agency parties' rights or obligations. Determining if agency action is a rule involves two steps: first, determining if it qualifies as a rule under the APA, and second, checking if it falls within the exceptions to the CRA's definition of rule. The APA's definition of \"rule\" is broad, but not every agency action falls under it. To qualify as a rule, an agency statement must be of general applicability, have future effect, and be designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy. The CRA exempts rules of particular applicability, agency management or personnel rules, and rules of agency organization that do not substantially affect non-agency parties' rights or obligations. The CRA defines the word \"rule\" by incorporating the APA's definition, which requires agency statements to be of general applicability, have future effect, and implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy. The CRA exempts certain categories of rules, and the distinction between rules, orders, and investigatory acts is important under the APA. The APA distinguishes between rules, orders, and investigatory acts, with rules being of general applicability and future effect, while orders are specific to individual cases. Courts look beyond labels to determine if an agency action is a rule or an order. In the context of the APA, courts distinguish between rulemaking, adjudication, and agency investigations. Adjudications resolve specific disputes, while rulemaking affects broad classes of individuals. Agency investigations may not always be subject to rulemaking requirements, but some actions related to investigations may qualify as rules. In agency investigations, some actions related to investigations may qualify as rules under the APA definition if they meet certain criteria. This includes being \"of general or particular applicability,\" having \"future effect,\" and being \"designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy.\" The ambiguity lies in the requirement that a rule must have \"future effect.\" The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has noted that agency statements must be \"of general or particular applicability\" to qualify as rules under the APA. The requirement that a rule must have \"future effect\" is ambiguous, with courts differentiating rules from orders based on their prospective operation. Justice Scalia argued that rules must have legal consequences only for the future, distinguishing them from orders with both future and past legal effects. In a 1988 Supreme Court case, Justice Scalia interpreted the \"future effect\" requirement in the APA definition of a rule to mean that rules have legal consequences only for the future. Judge Silberman of the D.C. Circuit, drawing on Scalia's interpretation, argued that not every agency statement with future effect should be considered a rule, but only those that authoritatively address a policy or legal issue. These opinions raise questions about the binding nature of agency statements and the interpretation of \"future effect\" in the APA definition of a rule. In a 1988 Supreme Court case, Justice Scalia interpreted the \"future effect\" requirement in the APA definition of a rule to mean that rules have legal consequences only for the future. This interpretation raises questions about the binding nature of agency statements and the distinction between \"legislative\" and \"interpretive\" rules. The legal effect test for notice-and-comment rulemaking determines if a rule binds an agency, while the future effect inquiry tests if an agency action is considered a \"rule\" under the APA. The distinction between interpretive and legislative rules is important, as interpretive rules may not require notice-and-comment procedures but are still considered rules. The third requirement for an agency action to be an APA rule is that it must implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy. Congress exempted \"interpretative rules\" from rulemaking procedures, suggesting they are considered rules. For an agency action to be an APA rule, it must implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy. Agency documents that do not change existing law or policy are not considered rules. The APA outlines specific rulemaking procedures, including notice-and-comment rulemaking in the Federal Register. The APA outlines rulemaking procedures for agencies, including notice-and-comment rulemaking in the Federal Register. Not all agency acts classified as \"rules\" require compliance with these procedures. Interpretative rules, policy statements, and agency management matters may not need notice-and-comment rulemaking. Courts often exempt agency guidance documents from these requirements. The APA exempts agency management matters from notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures. Agency guidance documents like interpretative rules or general policy statements are often not required to undergo this process. The key factor is whether the agency action binds private parties or the agency itself with the 'force of law.' General policy statements are typically not legally binding and do not fall under substantive rules that necessitate notice-and-comment procedures. The distinction between interpretive rules and general policy statements lies in whether they bind private parties or the agency itself with the 'force of law.' General policy statements are not legally binding and do not require notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures. Some cases suggest that general policy statements may not be considered rules under the APA definition if they do not bind the agency. The APA distinguishes between general policy statements and rules based on their binding effect. While some courts have held that general policy statements may not qualify as APA rules if they do not bind the agency, others have considered them as such. The CRA incorporates the APA definition of \"rule,\" suggesting that judicial interpretations of this definition should apply. This means that even if an agency acts through an order or investigatory act instead of a rule, the requirements of the CRA may still apply. Some courts have imported the APA's distinction between rules and orders when interpreting the CRA. The CRA may not apply if an agency acts through an order or investigatory act instead of a rule. There is debate over whether guidance documents qualify as CRA \"rules,\" as the term \"guidance document\" is not defined under the CRA or APA. The key question is whether agency statements labeled as guidance fall within the statutory definition of \"rule\" and if they are exempt from the CRA. The key question is whether agency statements labeled as guidance fall within the statutory definition of \"rule\" and if they are exempt from the CRA. The CRA does not exclude general policy statements or interpretative rules from its definition of rule, which differs from the APA's exemptions. Agency guidance documents exempt from APA's notice-and-comment procedures may still be subject to the CRA. The CRA may encompass agency guidance documents that are exempt from APA's notice-and-comment procedures, but their legal effect may be limited. The post-enactment legislative history of the CRA suggests that it was intended to cover a wide range of agency actions. The Congressional Record statement asserts that the CRA covers a broad range of agency actions, including policy statements and interpretive rules, despite not being subject to APA's notice-and-comment requirements. There is ambiguity regarding whether non-binding statements are considered rules under the APA definition. The CRA covers a broad range of agency actions, including policy statements and interpretive rules, despite not being subject to APA's notice-and-comment requirements. There is ambiguity regarding whether non-binding statements are considered rules under the APA definition. GAO has concluded that general policy statements should be considered \"rules\" under the CRA, even if they fall within exceptions to the definition of a \"rule.\" The CRA has exceptions to the definition of a \"rule,\" including rules of particular applicability, agency management or personnel rules, and rules that do not substantially affect non-agency parties' rights or obligations. It also excludes rules concerning monetary policy by the Federal Reserve and allows agencies to determine when rules take effect, even if notice-and-comment procedures are dispensed with. The CRA has exceptions to the definition of a \"rule,\" including rules of particular applicability. The agency can determine when rules take effect, notwithstanding the CRA's requirements. The CRA exempts rules concerning monetary policy by the Federal Reserve and allows agencies to decide when rules take effect, even without notice-and-comment procedures. The CRA has exceptions for rules of particular applicability, which do not need to apply to the entire population. Examples include rules on rates, wages, prices, and financial structures. IRS private letter rulings and Customs Service letter rulings are cited as classic examples of such rules. The CRA has exceptions for rules of particular applicability, such as IRS private letter rulings and Customs Service letter rulings. The second exemption excludes rules related to agency management or personnel, covering internal matters that do not substantially affect parties outside an agency. The CRA's second exemption excludes rules related to agency management or personnel, covering internal matters that do not substantially affect parties outside an agency. The distinction in language suggests that Congress intentionally created a substantial-effect requirement for the third exception while omitting it from the second one. The CRA's second exemption excludes rules related to agency management or personnel, while the third exception requires a substantial effect on non-agency parties. This difference in phrasing may lead to a broader interpretation of the second exemption compared to the APA exception. Congress may have added the substantial-effect requirement to the third exception to clarify ambiguity in interpreting similar provisions in the APA. The APA made certain language unnecessary, and Congress added a substantial-effect requirement to the third exception to settle ambiguity. The CRA exempts agency rules that do not substantially affect non-agency parties' rights or obligations. Unlike the APA, the CRA does not explicitly limit this exception. Court cases interpreting the APA exemption may help define the scope of the CRA exemption. The CRA exemption excludes agency rules that do not substantially affect non-agency parties' rights or obligations. Court cases interpreting the APA exemption may help define the scope of the CRA exemption by considering the substantial impact and substantive value judgment of the rule. The CRA exemption under the APA considers whether a rule has a substantial impact on non-agency parties' rights or obligations. The focus is on the rule's effect, not its type, to determine exclusion. GAO sometimes uses APA case law to analyze if actions fall under the CRA. The CRA exemption under the APA considers the impact on non-agency parties' rights. GAO uses APA case law to analyze if actions fall under the CRA, but these tests may not directly apply. The CRA requires agencies to submit rules to Congress and GAO before they take effect. The CRA requires agencies to submit a report to Congress and the Comptroller General containing a copy of the rule, a concise statement about the rule, and information on cost-benefit analysis. GAO assesses compliance with additional requirements for major rules and includes its assessment in the major rule report. The report must be submitted to the House and Senate committees within 15 days of the rule's submission or publication in the Federal Register. The report agencies must submit to Congress and the Comptroller General includes a two-page form with required information. OMB provided a standard form for compliance with the CRA in FY1999. Final rules submitted to Congress are noted in the Congressional Record and a searchable database. Submission of rules to Congress under the CRA is crucial as it triggers expedited procedures for considering a resolution of disapproval. Failure to submit a rule prevents the use of fast-track procedures to strike down the rule. After the enactment of the CRA in 1996, concerns were raised about agencies not submitting their rules to Congress as required. In 1997 and 1998 hearings, it was noted that agencies were not fully compliant with the submission requirement. To improve compliance, Congress mandated OMB to issue guidance on the submission requirement, leading to the issuance of a memorandum by then-OMB Director Jacob J. Lew in March 1999. In 1998, Congress required OMB to issue guidance on the submission requirement of the CRA. OMB Director Jacob J. Lew issued a memorandum in March 1999 detailing where agencies should send their rules to Congress. GAO began monitoring agencies' compliance with the submission requirement by comparing final rules published in the Federal Register with those submitted to GAO voluntarily. In 1998, GAO began monitoring agencies' compliance with the submission requirement by comparing final rules published in the Federal Register with those submitted to GAO voluntarily. GAO conducted a review to ensure all final rules covered by the Congressional Review Act were filed with Congress and GAO to verify accuracy and agency compliance. GAO submitted a list of rules not filed with GAO to OIRA in November 1997 for distribution to affected agencies. After reviewing agency compliance with submission requirements, GAO submitted a list of rules to OIRA in November 1997. OIRA distributed the list to affected agencies, and GAO followed up in February 1998. GAO criticized OIRA for not being proactive in ensuring agencies were aware of and complying with filing requirements. GAO continued to track rules submitted by agencies against those published in the Federal Register until 2012 when they decided to only track major rules not received. In March 2012, GAO notified OIRA that it would no longer send lists of rules not received due to resource constraints. Instead, GAO decided to track only major rules not received. Agencies generally submit rules to Congress and GAO comprehensively, but compliance is more challenging for rules not subject to notice-and-comment procedures. GAO's methodology for tracking compliance did not result in a complete list of agency actions that should have been submitted. GAO's methodology for tracking agency compliance with submission requirements did not result in a complete list of agency actions that should have been submitted. Many rules that should have been submitted were likely undetected by GAO, leading to a higher incidence of noncompliance with the CRA's submission requirement. The GAO's methodology for tracking agency compliance with submission requirements did not result in a complete list of un-submitted rules, leading to a higher incidence of noncompliance with the CRA's submission requirement for agency actions conducted outside the notice-and-comment rulemaking process. In 1997, an administrative law scholar argued that agencies take numerous actions that would fall under the CRA's definition of a rule. Full compliance with the CRA's filing requirement could overwhelm Congress and the GAO with paperwork. Many agencies may not be aware of the extent of the CRA's coverage beyond notice-and-comment rules. Many agencies may not be fully aware of the extent of the CRA's coverage beyond notice-and-comment rules, potentially leading to non-compliance with the filing requirement, as highlighted in a 2012 GAO opinion regarding an action by the Department of Health and Human Services. The GAO disagreed with HHS's stance that guidance documents are not considered rules under the CRA. Congress's ability to review rules under the act could be hindered if agencies do not submit rules. The Senate has a practice of seeking GAO opinions on whether agency actions should have been submitted under the CRA. The GAO has issued opinions on whether certain agency actions should have been considered rules under the CRA, with 11 out of 21 opinions stating that the actions should have been submitted to Congress for review. The Senate relies on GAO opinions to determine the initiation and action periods for submitting disapproval resolutions under the CRA. The GAO plays a crucial role in determining if agency actions qualify as rules under the CRA, allowing Congress to use expedited procedures to overturn rules based on GAO opinions. The GAO's role in determining if agency actions qualify as rules under the CRA is linked to its other activities under the CRA. GAO voluntarily created an online database for non-major rules to facilitate implementation beyond its statutory requirement. The general counsel explained in congressional testimony in 1998 that GAO established a database to collect basic information about non-major rules. The database allows searching for rules by various elements and contains links to GAO's major rule reports. GAO's determination of agency actions as \"rules\" under the CRA is closely tied to monitoring agency compliance with submission requirements. The GAO's role in determining agency actions as \"rules\" under the CRA was highlighted in a congressional hearing on the Tongass Land Management Plan in 1997. GAO's general counsel testified that the plan should have been submitted as a rule under the CRA, indicating the voluntary nature of GAO's involvement in this regard. Former Senator Larry Craig questioned GAO's role in advising Congress on compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The GAO's general counsel stated that the CRA does not specify who decides what constitutes a rule, unlike major rule determinations. The GAO's role is advisory, and their recent opinion on the Tongass Land Management Plan was in response to a request from Congress. The GAO's role is advisory, and their recent opinion on the Tongass Land Management Plan was in response to a request from Congress. GAO has issued opinions on the applicability of the CRA since 1996, but Congress's response has varied over time. In response to GAO opinions on the applicability of the CRA, Congress's actions have varied over time. The first joint resolution of disapproval was introduced in 2008, and the first resolution acted upon was in 2012 by the House. The CRA's expedited procedures were used in 2012 by the House to pass a resolution overturning a Department of Health and Human Services memorandum. In 2018, the Senate passed a resolution overturning guidance from the CFPB on auto lending. GAO opinions on agency actions under the CRA are advisory and do not have immediate legal effect. The GAO opinions on agency actions under the CRA are advisory and do not have immediate legal effect. However, the Senate has treated GAO opinions as dispositive in determining whether an agency action is subject to the CRA. In some cases, Congress has used GAO opinions as a substitute for agency submissions, as seen in the enactment of a joint resolution of disapproval in May 2018 following a GAO opinion on a 2013 CFPB bulletin. The GAO opinions under the CRA serve as a substitute for agency submissions, allowing Congress to review rules that were not submitted. A CRA provision prevents judicial review of GAO opinions or congressional determinations regarding rule applicability. The CRA provision barring judicial review makes it unlikely that GAO opinions or congressional determinations regarding rule applicability will be challenged in court. This means that the question of whether an agency action is subject to the CRA will likely be settled in the political arena rather than in the courts, with GAO opinions potentially serving as the final word on the issue. Additionally, the provision may also address whether a rule has taken effect outside of the courts through GAO opinions. The provision barring judicial review in the CRA may mean that the question of whether a rule has taken effect will be addressed through GAO opinions rather than in court. Despite the requirement for agencies to submit rules to Congress before they take effect, courts have been reluctant to enforce this provision. The CRA provision barring judicial review may lead to GAO opinions determining if a rule has taken effect, as courts are hesitant to enforce the requirement for agencies to submit rules to Congress. The lack of submission may indicate the rule was not subject to the CRA, but the practical impact of rules lacking legal effect under the CRA may be minimal. The term \"effect\" in the CRA includes non-legislative rules without legal impact, suggesting that submission requirements apply to statements without legal effect. The CRA provision barring judicial review may lead to GAO opinions determining if a rule has taken effect, as courts are hesitant to enforce the requirement for agencies to submit rules to Congress. The practical impact of rules lacking legal effect under the CRA may be minimal. The term \"effect\" in the CRA includes non-legislative rules without legal impact, suggesting that submission requirements apply to statements without legal effect. The 21 GAO opinions to date on whether certain agency actions were rules eligible for disapproval under the CRA are briefly summarized. The Emergency Sale Timber Program, enacted as part of the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations and Rescissions Act of 1995, aimed to increase salvage timber sales for forest health. The Secretary of Agriculture issued a memorandum in 1996 providing policy clarifications for the program. The Secretary of Agriculture issued a memorandum in 1996 regarding the Emergency Sale Timber Program for salvage timber sales in federally owned forests. GAO determined that the memorandum was a rule under the CRA due to its general applicability and future effect. Additionally, the Forest Service's Tongass National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan was also considered a rule under the CRA. The Tongass National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan issued by the Forest Service was considered a rule under the CRA by the GAO. President Clinton's Executive Order 13061 for the American Heritage River Initiative was not deemed a rule under the CRA as actions by the President are not subject to it. The GAO determined that Executive Order 13061 was not subject to the CRA because the President is not considered an \"agency.\" However, the Environmental Protection Agency's Interim Guidance for investigating Title VI complaints was deemed a rule under the CRA. Additionally, the Farm Credit Administration issued a booklet providing guidance on national charters. The Farm Credit Administration issued a booklet in the Federal Register on July 20, 2000, providing guidance on the national charter application process and territory. GAO determined that the booklet constituted a rule under the CRA and was not exempt, as it would have an effect on non-agency parties. The Trinity River Record of Decision (ROD) was issued in December 2000 by the Department of the Interior. The Trinity River Record of Decision (ROD) issued in December 2000 by the Department of the Interior set policies to restore anadromous fish in the Trinity River, affecting non-agency parties. GAO determined the ROD was a rule under the CRA due to its broad impact on ecosystems and economic effects in the Sacramento and Trinity River basins. On July 18, 2002, the Department of Veterans Affairs issued a memorandum directing network directors on marketing activities to enroll new veterans in the VA health care system. On July 18, 2002, the Department of Veterans Affairs issued a memorandum directing network directors to stop certain marketing activities to enroll new veterans in the VA health care system. The memorandum was not considered a rule under the CRA as it was deemed a statement of agency procedure. The VA issued a memorandum terminating the Vendee Loan Program, which allowed the VA to make loans for the sale of foreclosed VA-guaranteed property. The memorandum did not affect veterans' ability to enroll in the VA health care system and was considered a rule relating to agency management, exempt from the CRA. The VA terminated the Vendee Loan Program, a discretionary method for disposing of foreclosed properties, which did not impact veterans' access to VA healthcare. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services issued a letter regarding the State Children's Health Insurance Program, clarifying requirements for preventing crowd out. GAO determined the letter was a rule under the CRA due to its general applicability and future effect on the SCHIP program. The GAO concluded that a letter regarding the State Children's Health Insurance Program was a rule under the CRA due to its general applicability and future effect on the SCHIP program. Additionally, the Department of Health and Human Services issued an information memorandum concerning the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which GAO also determined to be a rule for the purposes of the CRA. The GAO determined that a memorandum regarding the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program was a rule under the CRA due to its general applicability and future effect on TANF. The Environmental Protection Agency issued a proposed rule for greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources, which GAO concluded was not covered by the CRA. The GAO concluded that the proposed rule for fossil fuel-fired electric steam generating units and natural gas-fired stationary combustion turbines was not covered by the CRA. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation issued interagency guidance on leveraged lending on March 22, 2013. The interagency guidance on leveraged lending issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation outlined principles for safe leveraged lending activities. GAO determined that the guidance was a rule under the CRA due to its future effect and lack of exceptions. The Forest Service approved an amendment to the Tongass Land and Resource Management Plan, identified uses in the forest, and must update plans every 15 years. GAO concluded the amendment was a substantive rule under the CRA, impacting the regulated community. The Bureau of Land Management issued a resource management plan for four areas in Alaska on December 30, 2016. The Bureau of Land Management issued a resource management plan for four areas in Alaska on December 30, 2016, as required by the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. GAO determined that the plan was a rule under the CRA due to its general applicability and future effect, not fitting into any exceptions. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued a bulletin on \"Indirect Auto Lending and Compliance with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act\" in 2013. GAO concluded that the bulletin was a rule under the CRA because it applies to all indirect auto lenders and prescribes the Bureau's policy in enforcing fair lending laws. President Trump released a memorandum on global health assistance funding in 2017. The GAO's opinion, issued on October 19, 2017, did not address the timing of its opinion in relation to a bulletin issued in 2013. President Trump's memorandum in 2017 established the \"Mexico City Policy,\" which prohibited funding to foreign organizations promoting abortion. The Department of State and USAID implemented this policy through fact sheets and revisions, which GAO determined were not rules under the CRA. The GAO concluded that agency actions implementing President Trump's policy decision were not subject to the CRA, based on a 1989 D.C. Circuit case. The IRS announced it would not accept electronically filed individual tax returns for the 2018 tax filing season. The GAO determined that agency actions implementing President Trump's policy decision were not subject to the CRA. The IRS announced it would not accept electronically filed individual tax returns for the 2018 tax filing season if the taxpayer did not meet ACA reporting requirements. The agency statement was deemed not a rule under the CRA as it only changed the timing of IRS compliance measures, not taxpayers' obligations. The GAO concluded that two sections of the Social Security Administration's manual regarding the use of internet information in disability benefit claims were not subject to the CRA as they were procedural rules. The IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2018-38, which modified information related to tax return filing. The GAO concluded that the HALLEX sections regarding internet evidence in disability claims are procedural rules exempt from the CRA. The IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2018-38, modifying tax-exempt entities' reporting requirements. Senator Orrin Hatch requested GAO's opinion on whether the revenue procedure falls under the CRA definition of a \"rule.\" The IRS had submitted the procedure to Congress under the CRA, but argued it was not covered, leaving the decision to Congress. The IRS submitted Revenue Procedure 2018-38 to Congress under the CRA, but argued it was not covered by the definition of a \"rule.\" GAO's opinion focused on whether the submission triggered the CRA's timelines, stating that since the rule was already submitted, their opinion on CRA's applicability was unnecessary. The GAO stated that their opinion on the CRA's applicability was unnecessary as the IRS had already submitted the rule, triggering Congress's review powers. They confirmed that the IRS revenue procedure was available for congressional review under the CRA. The Attorney General issued a zero-tolerance policy for illegal border crossings, which GAO concluded was not a rule under the CRA. The Attorney General's zero-tolerance policy for illegal border crossings was deemed not a rule under the CRA by the GAO. The Secretary of Commerce's memorandum justifying the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census was also discussed. The GAO concluded that the Secretary of Commerce's memorandum to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census was not considered a rule under the CRA. The memorandum directed the Census Bureau to include the question, but it was not classified as a rule because it did not meet the criteria set by the APA."
