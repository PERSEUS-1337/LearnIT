    "content": "The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the discovery of Al Qaeda cells in Europe spurred EU efforts to combat terrorism and enhance cooperation in police, judicial, and intelligence fields. The EU aims to harmonize policies among its 28 member states to promote peace, economic prosperity, and internal security while safeguarding citizens' rights and enabling free movement within the Schengen area. The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks prompted EU leaders to enhance cooperation in countering terrorism and cross-border crimes, including police and judicial collaboration. Member states initially hesitated due to concerns about national sovereignty and insufficient resources. However, the attacks served as a wake-up call, leading to increased law enforcement efforts and arrests in countries like Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Germany and Spain were identified as key bases for the attacks on the United States. European law enforcement efforts, in cooperation with the US, led to arrests in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK. EU leaders recognized the challenges posed by open borders and different legal systems, allowing terrorists to evade capture by moving between countries with varying laws. Extradition requests often faced delays, highlighting the need for improved cooperation in countering terrorism. The EU recognized challenges posed by open borders and different legal systems, allowing terrorists to evade capture by moving between countries. Efforts were made to harmonize national laws against terrorism, establish a common definition of terrorism, and enhance tools for extradition and information sharing. Europol and Eurojust were bolstered to improve cross-border criminal intelligence and prosecutorial coordination. The EU implemented measures to enhance counterterrorism capabilities, including an EU arrest warrant, tools to combat terrorist financing, and improved border controls. The Madrid and London bombings further emphasized the need for increased security measures, leading to the establishment of a Counterterrorism Coordinator to enhance intelligence sharing and address homegrown extremism in Europe. The Counterterrorism Coordinator was tasked with improving intelligence sharing among EU member states and promoting existing EU policies. The 2005 London bombings by homegrown extremists raised concerns about Muslim integration and led to the EU's first plan to combat radicalization and terrorism. The EU has since expanded its efforts to combat terrorism, radicalization, and violent extremism by broadening its definition of terrorism and focusing on disrupting terrorist networks and promoting mainstream opinions. The EU has expanded its efforts to combat terrorism, radicalization, and violent extremism by broadening its definition of terrorism in 2008. This included adding new criminal offenses such as terrorist recruitment, providing terrorist training, and public provocation to commit terrorism. The establishment of the Radicalisation Awareness Network (RAN) in 2011 aimed to connect key groups involved in countering radicalization and violent extremism. The Radicalisation Awareness Network (RAN) was established in 2011 to connect key groups involved in countering radicalization and violent extremism in the EU. However, challenges in harmonizing laws and policies among member states, as well as concerns over data privacy and intelligence sharing, hinder progress in enhancing EU-wide cooperation against terrorism. EU policymakers are increasingly concerned about European citizens joining terrorist groups in the Middle East and North Africa. Up to 5,000 EU citizens may have traveled to fight in conflict zones, raising fears of potential attacks in Europe. Recent terrorist incidents in Europe have been linked to the Islamic State and other extremist groups. Recent terrorist attacks in Europe have raised concerns about \"lone wolf\" attacks inspired by Islamist extremist propaganda. Incidents include the 2014 Brussels Jewish Museum shooting, the 2015 Paris attacks, the Copenhagen shootings, and the 2015 train attack from Amsterdam to Paris. Recent terrorist attacks in Europe have raised concerns about \"lone wolf\" attacks inspired by Islamist extremist propaganda. The attacks include the 2015 Copenhagen shootings, the 2015 train attack from Amsterdam to Paris, and the 2015 coordinated attacks in Paris. These incidents have exposed weaknesses in European domestic security and border controls. European authorities have confirmed the identities of several assailants, most of whom were French or Belgian citizens with ties to the Islamic State in the Syria-Iraq region. Recent terrorist attacks in Europe have highlighted weaknesses in European domestic security and border controls. European authorities have struggled to monitor potential assailants and share information among EU countries' law enforcement and intelligence services. Perpetrators have exploited the Schengen system and the chaos caused by migrant influxes. Some attackers have traveled between European countries and Syria, despite being known to security services. The alleged Brussels gunman and suspected ringleader of the November Paris attacks traveled between European countries and Syria. Perpetrators entered Europe through Greece with fake Syrian passports. The EU faces challenges in implementing common policies to counter terrorism due to sovereignty issues. Balancing security with human rights has slowed progress. The EU faces challenges in implementing common policies to counter terrorism due to sovereignty issues. Balancing security with human rights has slowed progress. Key steps include enhancing information sharing through common EU databases like the Schengen Information System and Europol's Focal Point Travellers database. Europol also launched the European Counter Terrorism Centre in January 2016. The EU has implemented common policies to counter terrorism by enhancing information sharing through databases like the Schengen Information System and Europol's Focal Point Travellers database. Europol also established the European Counter Terrorism Centre in January 2016 for operational cooperation among member states. The success of these initiatives relies on receiving information from national authorities, with some experts noting that EU-wide information sharing related to terrorism still falls short. The establishment of an EU-wide system for collecting airline Passenger Name Record (PNR) data is also being finalized. Finalizing the EU-wide system for collecting airline Passenger Name Record (PNR) data has been under discussion for years, with a proposal stalled in the European Parliament since 2013 due to data privacy concerns. Pressure to adopt an EU PNR system increased after the 2015 Paris attacks, with the aim of improving information sharing on foreign fighters and enhancing tracking of terrorist suspects. A provisional agreement was reached in December 2015, expected to receive final approval in early 2016. The EU PNR proposal aims to harmonize PNR collection practices across member states. A provisional agreement was reached in December 2015, obliging airlines to provide PNR data to national authorities. Critics argue it infringes on data privacy rights, while others feel it doesn't go far enough in data sharing. EU governments will have two years to implement the agreement once formally adopted. The EU PNR proposal aims to harmonize PNR collection practices across member states. Critics argue it infringes on data privacy rights, while others feel it doesn't go far enough in data sharing. EU governments will have two years to implement the agreement once formally adopted. Concerns about the foreign fighter threat led to calls for increased security tools at the EU's external borders, but resistance to amending the Schengen Borders Code remains due to fears of internal border controls being reimposed. The surge of migrants and refugees in 2015 and the Paris attacks have put pressure on the Schengen area. The European Commission proposed targeted modifications to the Schengen Borders Code to introduce mandatory checks of EU citizens against law enforcement databases at external borders. They also suggested establishing a new European Border and Coast Guard to enhance border security. EU efforts include detecting and removing online content that promotes terrorism. The EU is working on enhancing member states' capacities at external borders, preventing radicalization through monitoring online content, and ensuring an adequate criminal justice response throughout the EU. This includes establishing an EU border guard corps, detecting and removing terrorist content online, and revising the Framework Decision on Combating Terrorism. The EU is revising its Framework Decision on Combating Terrorism to criminalize traveling abroad for terrorist purposes and receiving terrorist training. Some member states are hesitant to amend the common terrorism definition due to varying national policies and fears of infringing on national legal systems. EU officials argue that updating the definition is necessary to comply with U.N. Security Council Resolution 2178. The EU is updating its common terrorism definition to address the foreign fighter threat and comply with U.N. Security Council Resolution 2178. The European Commission has proposed revisions, which will be reviewed by EU member states and the European Parliament. U.S.-EU cooperation against terrorism has been a priority since September 11, 2001, with a focus on improving law enforcement and intelligence collaboration. The EU has made cooperation with the United States a top priority in counterterrorism efforts. This partnership has led to a new dynamic in U.S.-EU relations, focusing on law enforcement and homeland security issues. The Obama Administration has supported this collaboration in counterterrorism, border controls, and transport security, emphasizing mutual security and protection for citizens while upholding individual rights. In 2011, President Obama's National Strategy for Counterterrorism emphasized partnering with European allies, the European Parliament, and the European Union to advance counterterrorism efforts. The EU is a key partner in the Global Counterterrorism Forum, focusing on combating violent extremism and enhancing international cooperation against terrorism. Recent U.S.-EU cooperation has focused on addressing the foreign fighter phenomenon, especially concerns about European Muslims joining Islamist groups in Syria and Iraq. Worries have been expressed about European foreign fighters due to visa-free travel arrangements between the U.S. and most EU countries. The recruitment of European and American Muslims to fight with Islamist groups in Syria and Iraq has raised concerns among U.S. policymakers. Efforts are being made to develop shared strategies to address the foreign fighter threat, including enhancing counter-radicalization measures and information sharing between the U.S. and EU countries. EU countries have supported U.N. Security Council Resolution 2178 to combat the foreign fighter phenomenon globally. Security is collaborating closely with EU counterparts on measures to enhance counter-radicalization, border security, aviation security, and information sharing to address the foreign fighter threat. EU countries strongly support U.N. Security Council Resolution 2178 and provide support to the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State. Following the Paris attacks, U.S. and European ministers discussed terrorist threats and foreign fighters. U.S. officials are encouraging European governments and the EU to improve information exchanges and utilize existing EU-wide databases. The United States is urging European governments and the EU to enhance information sharing and utilize existing databases to combat violent extremism. President Obama has called for the implementation of agreements to share passenger information to prevent foreign terrorist fighters from entering undetected. Challenges in the U.S.-EU counterterrorism relationship include data privacy and protection concerns. Despite close law enforcement ties and existing U.S.-EU information-sharing arrangements, challenges remain in the evolving U.S.-EU counterterrorism relationship. Data privacy and protection concerns, detainee policies, differences in terrorist designation lists, and balancing border security with facilitating transatlantic travel and commerce are key issues. U.S. legislation passed in December 2015 to strengthen the Visa Waiver Program has also raised concerns in the EU. Contacts between U.S. and EU officials on police, judicial, and border control policy matters have increased since 2001, playing a crucial role in developing closer ties. The U.S. Departments of State, Justice, Homeland Security, and Treasury are actively engaged in this process, with high-level meetings between U.S. and EU counterparts occurring regularly. Discussions focus on police and judicial cooperation against terrorism, terrorist financing, and border and transport security issues. The U.S. and EU have established various dialogues and cooperation mechanisms on counterterrorism, border security, and law enforcement. This includes regular meetings on police and judicial cooperation, discussions on terrorist financing, and a high-level policy dialogue on border and transport security. Additionally, reciprocal liaison relationships have been set up between U.S. and EU agencies, with Europol and U.S. federal law enforcement agencies collaborating on various international crimes. The U.S. and EU have established dialogues and cooperation mechanisms on counterterrorism, border security, and law enforcement. Europol collaborates with U.S. federal law enforcement agencies on international crimes, including counterfeiting and cybercrime. U.S.-EU efforts against terrorism have led to operational successes in countering transnational crimes, with agreements in place for sharing strategic and personal information. In 2001 and 2002, U.S. and Europol agreements were made to share strategic and personal information for improved police and judicial cooperation. Negotiations were challenging due to EU data protection standards. In 2007, a security agreement for classified information was signed, and in 2010, extradition and mutual legal assistance treaties were ratified between the U.S. and EU. In 2010, new U.S.-EU treaties on extradition and mutual legal assistance entered into force to harmonize existing bilateral accords, simplify extradition, and enhance information-sharing for combating transnational crimes. Washington agreed to EU demands that extradited suspects will not face the death penalty, as EU law prohibits it. The U.S. and EU negotiated extradition and mutual legal assistance agreements to combat organized crime, drug, and human trafficking. The U.S. agreed not to extradite suspects to the EU if they face the death penalty, in line with EU law. The agreements modernize existing bilateral accords, streamline information exchange, allow access to European bank information, and permit joint investigations. Despite some critics, the collaboration with EU bodies is seen as beneficial for law enforcement efforts. Despite growing U.S.-EU ties in law enforcement, critics question the utility of collaborating with EU-wide bodies due to existing bilateral relations. Europol lacks enforcement capabilities and relies on national services for information. European officials criticize the U.S. for not sharing intelligence. European opposition to the U.S. death penalty and reluctance to extradite their nationals may hinder legal assistance and extradition of terrorist suspects. However, most U.S. and European officials are committed to enhanced cooperation with EU law enforcement. Most U.S. and European officials are committed to enhanced cooperation with EU law enforcement entities like Europol. In early 2015, new agreements were signed to improve cooperation against foreign fighters and illegal immigration. The U.S. and EU work together to track and suppress terrorist financing, benefiting from access to financial data through SWIFT. The Financial Action Task Force aims to suppress terrorist financing and improve international financial investigative tools. The U.S. and EU benefit from an agreement allowing access to financial data through SWIFT for the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program. The program has generated leads for EU governments and helped prevent terrorist attacks in Europe. However, the sharing of SWIFT data remains controversial in Europe due to data privacy concerns. U.S. and EU officials have collaborated since 2001 to bridge gaps in their lists of terrorist individuals and groups. The U.S. and EU have collaborated since 2001 to bridge gaps in their lists of terrorist individuals and groups. The EU maintains two lists of terrorist organizations and individuals, one focusing on Al Qaeda and Taliban affiliates and the other on non-affiliated entities. The composition of the EU's \"common terrorist list\" has been a subject of U.S.-EU debate. The EU maintains two lists of terrorist organizations and individuals, one focusing on Al Qaeda and Taliban affiliates and the other on non-affiliated entities. The consolidated version of the EU's \"common terrorist list\" includes over 80 individuals or entities based both in Europe and worldwide. Law enforcement measures vary depending on whether a person or group is considered \"external\" or \"internal\" to the EU. The EU maintains a common terrorist list with over 80 individuals or entities, subjecting them to asset freezes, financial restrictions, and police cooperation. All EU member states must unanimously agree to add or remove names from the list. The US and other countries have influenced the addition of organizations like PKK, FARC, Hamas, and Hezbollah's military wing to the EU's list. The EU and the US have influenced the addition of various organizations to the EU's common terrorist list, including PKK, FARC, Hamas, and Hezbollah's military wing. However, there are frictions in fully harmonizing the US and EU terrorist designation lists, with the EU hesitant to add suspected Hamas-related charities due to differing views on their activities. Charities like UK-based Interpal, designated as Hamas fronts by the US, have been cleared of funding terrorism by European authorities. EU member states have been divided on including Hezbollah on the EU's terrorist list, with some countries supporting it while others oppose due to concerns about relations with Lebanon. In 2012-2013, there was a debate within the EU on adding Hezbollah to the terrorist list due to events like the Burgas bombing and a Hezbollah operative's conviction in Cyprus. Some EU members hesitated because of Hezbollah's social services in Lebanon and its role in the government. In July 2013, the EU added Hezbollah's military wing to its terrorist list, following events like the Burgas bombing and a Hezbollah operative's conviction in Cyprus. This decision was seen as a compromise to avoid destabilizing Lebanon and maintain EU influence in the region. The EU emphasized that dialogue with political parties in Lebanon and humanitarian assistance would continue. The EU decision to include Hezbollah's military wing on its terrorist list was largely symbolic, sending a message that terrorist activities would endanger its legitimacy. Some experts hoped this would lead to increased intelligence investigations in Europe. Critics argued that only listing the military wing was insufficient as Hezbollah could still fundraise in Europe. The EU decision to include Hezbollah's military wing on its terrorist list was seen as symbolic, but critics argued it was insufficient as Hezbollah could still fundraise in Europe. The US Administration and Congress have long urged the EU to designate Hezbollah as a terrorist organization, especially after Hezbollah's involvement in the Burgas bombing in 2013. Members of Congress passed resolutions calling for sanctions on Hezbollah and for Europe to take proactive action against the group's financing and operational networks. The EU added Hezbollah's military wing to its terrorist list, but concerns remain about fundraising in Europe. The US urged the EU to designate Hezbollah as a terrorist organization, citing its involvement in the Burgas bombing. Data privacy is a key issue in US-EU information-sharing accords. EU data privacy regulations set common rules for entities in the EU holding personal data, prohibiting transfer to countries without adequate legal protections. Concerns have arisen in U.S.-EU information-sharing accords over the protection of European citizens' data, with allegations of U.S. surveillance programs straining transatlantic trust. Analysts are increasingly worried about the future of U.S.-EU information-sharing. The strained transatlantic trust due to U.S. surveillance activities in Europe has raised concerns about the future of U.S.-EU information-sharing arrangements. The European Parliament has expressed serious concerns and established a working group to investigate alleged U.S. collection activities and similar surveillance practices in EU member states. The European Parliament established a special working group to investigate alleged U.S. surveillance programs and similar practices in EU member states. Chaired by Claude Moraes, the group adopted the critical \"Moraes report\" in March 2014, which recommended revisions to U.S.-EU information-sharing agreements and urged the conclusion of negotiations on the U.S.-EU Data Privacy and Protection Agreement. The European Parliament's \"Moraes report\" called for the suspension of the SWIFT agreement and urged the U.S. to recognize the privacy rights of EU citizens. The report also demanded stronger data protection safeguards, leading to new rules expected to be approved in early 2016. The EU is set to implement new data protection rules in early 2016, with concerns raised by U.S. officials about potential impacts on law enforcement cooperation and U.S. companies. The U.S. reassures EU leaders of compliance with surveillance laws and oversight. A U.S.-EU working group was established to address concerns over NSA surveillance programs like PRISM and assess their proportionality. The EU and U.S. established a working group to address concerns over NSA surveillance programs like PRISM and assess their proportionality. In November 2013, the European Commission issued a report with recommendations to restore transatlantic trust. In June 2014, the Obama Administration announced plans to provide EU citizens with the right to pursue redress in U.S. courts for law enforcement data privacy violations. The Judicial Redress Act was introduced in the 114th Congress for this purpose. In efforts to conclude the DPPA, the Obama Administration aimed to work with Congress to pass legislation granting EU citizens the right to seek redress in U.S. courts for law enforcement data privacy violations. The Judicial Redress Act (H.R. 1428 and S. 1600) was signed into law in February 2016 to address this issue. Controversy over Europe's involvement in the U.S. Terrorist Finance Tracking Program arose in 2006, with assurances from U.S. officials that SWIFT data was only used for counterterrorism purposes and obtained through legal means. In 2007, the US and EU agreed to allow US access to SWIFT data for counterterrorism purposes, despite concerns about EU rights. Changes to SWIFT's systems in 2009 led to a new US-EU agreement for data sharing. In 2010, the European Parliament rejected a new version of the US-EU SWIFT agreement. In 2010, the European Parliament rejected a new version of the US-EU SWIFT agreement due to concerns about data privacy and civil liberties. Negotiations began for a revised agreement to address EP concerns about judicial remedy for European citizens in the US in case of data abuse. In May 2010, negotiations started for a revised U.S.-EU SWIFT agreement addressing concerns about data privacy and civil liberties. Key issues included guaranteeing judicial remedy for European citizens in the U.S. in case of data abuse and the use of \"bulk data\" transfers. Despite some MEPs calling for more targeted transfers, a new draft agreement in June 2010 allowed for administrative and legal redress for EU citizens in the U.S. and gave Europol authority over U.S. Treasury Department requests for SWIFT data. Some MEPs remained dissatisfied with certain provisions. The final iteration of the U.S.-EU SWIFT accord was approved by the European Parliament on July 8, 2010, with 484 votes in favor, 109 against, and 12 abstentions. The agreement included provisions for administrative and legal redress for EU citizens in the U.S., Europol's authority over U.S. Treasury Department requests for SWIFT data, and the appointment of an independent observer in Washington, DC. Additionally, plans for a European equivalent to the U.S. TFTP were required to be presented within a year to enable the EU to extract SWIFT data on European soil. The European Parliament approved the final U.S.-EU SWIFT accord on July 8, 2010, allowing for the extraction of SWIFT data on European soil. Despite concerns about the EU's role in the U.S. TFTP, the agreement entered into force on August 1, 2010, for a five-year period. Measures were recommended in 2011 to make the TFTP more transparent, including providing more information to Europol in writing. Several MEPs criticized Europol for readily approving vague U.S. requests for SWIFT data. The European Commission recommended measures to make the TFTP more transparent, including providing more information to Europol in writing. A second review in December 2012 concluded that the TFTP had benefits in fighting terrorism, with safeguards properly implemented. Unauthorized disclosures of U.S. surveillance activities in Europe since June 2013 renewed European concerns about data handling. The Parliament passed a resolution in October 2013 following reports of NSA monitoring in EU countries. In October 2013, the European Parliament expressed concerns over the US handling of EU citizens' personal data, following reports of NSA monitoring in EU countries. The Parliament passed nonbinding resolutions calling for the suspension of the US-EU SWIFT accord, but actual suspension would require action from the European Commission and member states. Reviews of the TFTP program showed that SWIFT data had been valuable in combating terrorism, including during the 2012 London Olympics and threats posed by EU nationals training with extremist groups in Syria and Iraq. In late 2013 and mid-2014, SWIFT data has been helpful for European intelligence services in investigating terrorist threats, including those during the 2012 London Olympics and posed by EU nationals training with extremist groups in Syria and Iraq. The US and EU had an initial agreement in May 2004 allowing airlines to provide passenger data to US authorities, which was controversial in Europe due to privacy concerns. The European Parliament challenged the agreement in the EU Court of Justice, leading to its annulment in May 2006. In May 2006, the European Parliament challenged the PNR agreement in the EU Court of Justice, leading to its annulment on legal grounds. In July 2007, the US and EU negotiated a new agreement allowing the transfer of PNR data, with provisions such as extended data storage time, sharing data with other US agencies, and access to sensitive passenger information. Airlines were required to send data to US authorities 72 hours before a flight's departure. The 2007 U.S.-EU PNR agreement allowed the transfer of passenger data, with the United States accessing sensitive information in exceptional cases. Airlines had to send data to U.S. authorities 72 hours before a flight, with the number of data fields collected reduced from 34 to 19. The European Parliament had to approve the agreement formally, facing objections from MEPs over data transfer amounts, data retention time, and redress for misuse concerns. Some MEPs feared U.S. authorities might use PNR data for data mining or profiling. Despite concerns, the Parliament agreed to postpone its vote on the agreement in May 2010. In May 2010, the European Parliament postponed its vote on the 2007 U.S.-EU PNR agreement due to concerns about data misuse and profiling by U.S. authorities. The Parliament called for a \"global external PNR strategy\" from the European Commission, which was issued in September 2010. This strategy proposed that PNR data should only be used for combating terrorism and serious crimes, passengers should be informed about data exchange, and they should have the right to redress. The Commission also called for the renegotiation of PNR agreements with the United States, Australia, and Canada. The Commission emphasized the limited use of PNR data for combating terrorism and serious crimes, the need for passenger information and redress rights, and restrictions on data retention. The European Parliament supported the Commission's PNR strategy and called for proportional data exchange with the U.S., emphasizing no data mining or profiling. The Obama Administration agreed to discuss adjustments to the PNR accord in recognition of the EP's concerns. The Obama Administration agreed to discuss adjustments to the PNR accord with the EU in recognition of concerns raised by the European Parliament. U.S. officials maintained that the 2007 accord protected data and privacy rights, and emphasized the importance of not degrading operational effectiveness. Resolutions were introduced in the House and passed in the Senate regarding the PNR agreement. The U.S. officials emphasized the importance of not degrading the operational effectiveness of the current PNR program and urged DHS to reject any modifications that would hinder its usefulness in fighting terrorism. In May 2011, the U.S. and the European Commission concluded negotiations on a revised PNR agreement with new provisions to enhance passenger data protection, including depersonalizing and masking portions of records, reducing data storage time, and limiting access to authorized personnel. The May 2011 agreement between the U.S. and the European Commission introduced new provisions to enhance passenger data protection, including depersonalizing and masking portions of records, reducing data storage time, and limiting access to authorized personnel. Despite revisions, some MEPs were still unsatisfied as the accord allowed the U.S. to retain passenger data for up to 15 years. Some MEPs were unsatisfied with the May 2011 U.S.-EU PNR agreement revisions, as it still allowed the U.S. to retain passenger data for up to 15 years. Concerns were raised about the increased data transfer requirements and broadened use of PNR data for criminal offenses. U.S. officials claimed the new draft was stronger and addressed EU concerns on data security and protection. The U.S.-EU PNR agreement was revised in May 2011 to address concerns raised by the EU, including data security, protection, and the scope of offenses covered. In November 2011, a new draft agreement was concluded with further improvements, limiting the use of PNR data to serious transnational crimes and varying retention time based on the type of crime. In December 2011, EU member states approved the new U.S.-EU PNR agreement with changes to limit data use to serious crimes and vary retention time based on crime type. Germany and Austria abstained due to concerns over data retention and redress provisions. Some MEPs criticized the changes as cosmetic, while others supported the agreement for stronger data protection guarantees compared to the 2007 version. The 2011 U.S.-EU PNR agreement was approved by the full Parliament on April 19, 2012, with strong data protection guarantees. The accord entered into force on August 8, 2012, and will be valid for seven years, with the option to renew for another seven years. The agreement reaffirmed the commitment to countering terrorism while protecting privacy and civil rights. The U.S.-EU PNR accord, adopted in 2012, will be valid for seven years with the option to renew for another seven years. The European Commission stated that the agreement is effective in fighting terrorism and serious crimes, but concerns have been raised about U.S. data protection safeguards. Some MEPs have questioned the adequacy of U.S. laws in protecting PNR data stored in cloud systems on U.S. soil. U.S. and EU leaders view information-sharing agreements like SWIFT and PNR as crucial in combating terrorism. Washington has sought an umbrella agreement with the EU to streamline negotiations on data-sharing accords. The European Parliament has called for a U.S.-EU framework agreement to enhance data protection in counterterrorism efforts. In 2010, the European Commission proposed a draft mandate for negotiating a U.S.-EU framework agreement on data protection in law enforcement. The goal was to bridge privacy rights differences and ensure high standards of data protection. This agreement would not cover the actual transfer of personal data, requiring specific agreements for that. EU member states approved the Commission's mandate in 2010, leading to negotiations on an umbrella Data Privacy and Protection agreement in 2011. In March 2011, the United States and the EU officially launched negotiations on an \"umbrella\" Data Privacy and Protection Agreement (DPPA) to protect personal information exchanged in a law enforcement context. U.S. officials aimed for mutual recognition of data protection systems, hoping for an EU finding of \"adequacy\" for U.S. data protection standards. Progress was reported in June 2012 on negotiating the DPPA. The negotiations on the Data Privacy and Protection Agreement (DPPA) between the US and EU made progress in June 2012, focusing on data security, transparency, and oversight. Controversial issues like purpose limitation and redress remained, with EU officials pushing for judicial redress rights for European citizens in the US. US administrations argued that EU citizens could seek redress through other means like administrative or judicial redress under different US laws. The U.S. Privacy Act limits judicial redress to U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents. EU citizens could seek redress through agency administrative or other U.S. laws. The DPPA negotiations were stalled due to the lack of judicial redress. However, revelations of U.S. surveillance activities in 2013 injected renewed momentum into the discussions. The European Parliament called for the negotiations to resume without delay and emphasized the need for judicial redress for EU citizens. Attorney General Holder announced support for bringing the negotiations forward in June 2014. The \"Moraes report\" in March 2014 emphasized the importance of concluding the DPPA for transatlantic trust. The U.S. committed to providing EU citizens with judicial redress for privacy violations. This decision aimed to restore EU trust in U.S. data privacy commitments. Negotiators finalized the DPPA text in September 2015, but the EU did not sign it. The Obama Administration made a decision to spur final agreement on the DPPA and restore EU trust in U.S. data privacy commitments. U.S. and EU negotiators finalized the DPPA text in September 2015, pending U.S. judicial redress legislation adoption. Legislation like H.R. 1428 and S. 1600 aimed to extend judicial redress provisions to citizens of covered countries or regional organizations. The Judicial Redress Act aims to extend privacy protections to citizens of covered countries or regional organizations, such as the EU, with whom the US has agreements. This is in response to the CJEU invalidating the US-EU Safe Harbor Agreement due to inadequate data protection and lack of judicial remedies for EU citizens in the US. The Act is seen as a way to address European concerns about US-EU data transfers. The CJEU decision highlighted the lack of judicial remedies for EU citizens in the United States, leading to hopes that the Judicial Redress Act would address European concerns about U.S.-EU data transfers. The Act passed the House on October 20, 2015, and was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee on January 28, 2016. The Judicial Redress Act, H.R. 1428, was passed by the House on October 20, 2015, and approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee on January 28, 2016. An amendment by Senator John Cornyn mandated that the Act would only apply to countries allowing data transfer to the U.S. without impeding national security. The amended Act was signed into law on February 24, 2016, viewed as necessary for the U.S.-EU DPPA signature. The U.S.-EU provisional agreement on Privacy Shield, H.R. 1428, was signed into law on February 24, 2016 (P.L. 114-126). The Judicial Redress Act's enactment is seen as crucial for the formal signature of the U.S.-EU DPPA, with the EU welcoming the act. Approval of the DPPA by EU member states and the European Parliament is required for it to take effect, a process that may take several months. Cooperation between the U.S. and EU in border control, aviation, and maritime security has been emphasized over the last decade. Over the last decade, the United States and the EU have emphasized cooperation in border control, aviation, and maritime security. They have worked on agreements to enhance international information exchanges on passports and promote the use of biometric identifiers for travel document security. Collaboration between the U.S. and EU has also played a key role in forging international declarations on aviation security and improving cargo and global supply chain security. In June 2011, they reaffirmed their commitment to bolster supply chain security and foster greater global cooperation on this issue. The United States and the EU have collaborated on aviation security, cargo security, and global supply chain security. They aim to find a balance between border security and facilitating transatlantic travel and commerce. Both parties have implemented measures to enhance aviation security since the 2001 terrorist attacks. Recent incidents have highlighted the importance of discussions on aviation and air cargo security, such as the 2009 airliner bombing attempt and the 2010 Yemen bomb plot. The United States and the EU have collaborated on aviation security, cargo security, and global supply chain security since the 2001 terrorist attacks. Recent incidents like the 2009 airliner bombing attempt and the 2010 Yemen bomb plot have emphasized the importance of discussions on aviation security. Tighter rules for carrying electronic devices on international U.S.-bound flights were implemented in July 2014 due to fears of terrorist threats. The U.S. and EU have worked together to bridge gaps in their policies to ensure the safety of transatlantic flights. Since 2001, the United States and the EU have collaborated closely on aviation security, including coordinating air cargo security measures. In 2003, some EU countries objected to U.S. rules requiring armed air marshals on certain flights, leading to discussions on alternative measures. In 2008, an agreement was reached to ensure the security of all cargo on passenger flights between the two territories. In June 2012, an air cargo security partnership was announced between the United States and the EU. The United States and the EU have reached an agreement on an air cargo security partnership in June 2012. This partnership mandates 100% screening of cargo on U.S. domestic and U.S.-bound international passenger flights, eliminating duplication of security controls and improving cargo security. The mutual recognition of air cargo security regimes will result in significant savings for U.S. and European cargo operators in terms of time and money, enhancing the speed of transatlantic shipments and reducing costs. Additionally, both sides have pledged to exchange information on the evolution and implementation of their security regimes. The EU and the United States have agreed to exchange information on their security regimes. Despite shared commitment to cooperation in aviation security, differences remain, such as the installation of body scanners. Some EU countries were hesitant due to privacy and health concerns, but the European Parliament eventually backed their use with safeguards in place. In July 2011, the European Parliament approved the use of body scanners at EU airports with privacy and health safeguards. The scanners were required to only produce stick figure images, not body images, and x-ray scans were banned. Passengers had the option to choose a manual search instead. In November 2011, the European Commission adopted these conditions for body scanner use at EU airports, but deployment was not mandatory for member states. Some concerns about body scanners at U.S. airports were alleviated in January 2013. In January 2013, the U.S. Transportation Security Administration announced the removal of full-body scanners that produce revealing images at airports. Concerns about privacy violations by body scanners were raised by Members of Congress and European Parliamentarians. U.S. officials were also worried about planned changes to EU regulations on liquids and gels in carry-on baggage. In 2010, the EU announced plans to eliminate restrictions on liquids in cabin baggage by April 2013, despite concerns about the effectiveness of current liquid-screening technology from U.S. policymakers and some EU governments. The EU postponed its 2013 deadline for introducing liquid screening equipment and eliminating restrictions on liquids and gels in carry-on baggage due to concerns about airline security and potential flight delays. In January 2014, the EU lifted prohibitions on \"duty-free\" liquids and gels in cabin baggage, with plans to end all restrictions on liquids and gels aboard planes by January 2016. In April 2004, the US and EU signed a customs cooperation accord, including extending the US Container Security Initiative throughout the EU. In April 2004, the United States and the European Union signed a customs cooperation accord to extend the U.S. Container Security Initiative (CSI) throughout the EU. CSI stations U.S. customs officers in foreign ports to pre-screen U.S.-bound maritime cargo containers for dangerous substances. In May 2012, the U.S. and EU agreed to recognize each other's trusted shipper programs to improve supply chain security and trade opportunities for trusted traders. European companies designated as \"trusted traders\" by the U.S. C-TPAT program or the EU's AEO regime aim to lower costs and simplify procedures for legitimate transatlantic trade. Recent tensions over 100% container scanning have receded, as both U.S. and EU officials view it as unrealistic and potentially disruptive to trade. Policymakers from both administrations share concerns about the cost and effectiveness of such scanning, highlighting existing programs to identify high-risk cargo shipments. U.S. policymakers in the Bush and Obama Administrations shared concerns about the cost and effectiveness of 100% container scanning, leading to deadline extensions. Proponents argue for full implementation due to inadequacies in current risk assessment methods. Tensions between the U.S. and EU over the Visa Waiver Program have also been a point of contention. The U.S.-EU tensions over the Visa Waiver Program stem from the EU's desire for equal application to all member states. New EU members sought to join the program post-2004 enlargement but faced exclusion due to not meeting requirements. Congress debated extending the program to new EU allies, citing security concerns post-9/11. Many European allies were skeptical of the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) post-9/11 due to security concerns, as terrorists with European citizenship had exploited the program. In response, Congress passed the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-53) to strengthen the VWP's security measures and expand eligibility to more EU members. This included requiring countries to meet security standards, share information, and submit biographical information through the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA). The U.S. Department of Homeland Security was also given the authority to waive admission requirements for new EU member states to join the VWP. Currently, 23 countries participate in the program. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) allows certain EU member states to submit biographical information through ESTA. P.L. 110-53 permits waivers for admission requirements, enabling new EU members to join the VWP. Currently, 23 EU states are part of the program, with efforts to include the remaining five. The EU introduced a reciprocity mechanism in 2014 to push for visa reciprocity with the US and other countries. The European Commission can suspend visa-free travel for a country without full reciprocity, but has not done so yet. Under new EU rules, the European Commission may suspend visa-free travel for a third country's citizens if there is no full visa reciprocity. The Commission has not yet suspended any visa-free travel, but is actively assessing the situation every six months. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) allows certain EU member states to submit biographical information through ESTA. The Obama Administration supports the VWP for transatlantic commerce and tourism, but additional biographic information and traveler screening requirements have been introduced for VWP countries. The Obama Administration supports the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) for transatlantic commerce and tourism. Additional security measures were introduced for VWP travelers, including submitting biographic information through ESTA and new screening requirements. Concerns about VWP security were heightened after the 2015 Paris attacks. The Administration made changes to strengthen VWP security, such as capturing past travel to terrorist safe havens in ESTA and assessing cooperation with the United States by VWP countries. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) was strengthened to enhance security controls, including capturing past travel to terrorist safe havens in ESTA. Legislation passed in 2015 prohibits certain individuals from VWP entry and mandates electronic passports for all participant countries. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) was strengthened in 2015 to enhance security controls, including prohibiting individuals from Syria, Iraq, Iran, or Sudan from entering the US under the VWP. Dual nationals of these countries must now obtain a visitor visa. The legislation also requires VWP countries to issue electronic passports and implement screening protocols. EU officials have raised concerns about the new requirements, arguing they could create a de facto visa regime and discriminate against dual nationals. EU officials are troubled by the new Visa Waiver Program (VWP) requirements, fearing they could create a de facto visa regime and discriminate against dual nationals. They question the effectiveness of the legislation, arguing it may impact European citizens traveling for legitimate reasons without detecting potential terrorists. US officials defend the law, citing exemptions for government and military personnel and the Secretary of DHS's authority to grant waivers on a case-by-case basis. EU leaders warn of possible reciprocal measures, such as restricting visa-free travel for US citizens. Members of Congress also express concerns about the VWP provisions. EU officials are concerned about the new Visa Waiver Program (VWP) requirements potentially discriminating against dual nationals. US lawmakers have introduced legislation to address these concerns, aiming to eliminate VWP restrictions on dual nationals. This move is seen as a way to prevent the EU from imposing reciprocal visa requirements on US citizens traveling to Europe. Both US and European officials emphasize the importance of balancing freedom and security without compromising civil liberties and human rights standards. The EU and US officials are concerned about potential reciprocal visa requirements for US citizens traveling to Europe. Tensions between the two regions have been fueled by issues such as the treatment of suspected terrorist detainees, including policies like the detention facility at Guant\u00e1namo Bay and the use of \"enhanced interrogation techniques.\" European media attention and investigations have focused on practices like \"extraordinary rendition\" and the possible presence of CIA detention facilities in Europe. The European media and authorities investigated the presence of CIA detention facilities in Europe and the treatment of suspected terrorist detainees, including practices like extraordinary rendition. Many European leaders criticized the US detainee and interrogation policies as violating international and European law, weakening efforts to counter terrorism, and degrading shared values on human rights. The Bush Administration defended these policies as crucial in the fight against terrorism and denied any violations of US human rights commitments. The Bush Administration defended its detainee and rendition policies as crucial in countering terrorism, denying violations of U.S. human rights commitments. U.S.-EU tensions over detainee policies eased with the Obama Administration, which aimed to close Guant\u00e1namo and banned torture. EU officials welcomed these changes and efforts to persuade countries to accept cleared detainees. Obama's executive order banned torture and initiated a review of Bush Administration legal opinions on detention and interrogation methods. The U.S. State Department appointed a special envoy in 2009 to close the detention facility by persuading countries to accept detainees cleared for release. Some EU members accepted released detainees, but others declined. The Obama Administration faced challenges in closing Guant\u00e1namo due to congressional opposition and restrictions on transferring detainees amid concerns of terrorist activity. As a result, Guant\u00e1namo remains open despite the administration's promise to shut it down. The Obama Administration has faced obstacles in closing Guant\u00e1namo due to congressional restrictions on transferring detainees and concerns about terrorist activity. Despite promises to shut it down, Guant\u00e1namo remains open. In 2011, an executive order created indefinite detention for dangerous detainees. European officials worry about the facility's impact as a recruiting tool for terrorist groups and the well-being of detainees. The European Parliament has called for the closure of Guant\u00e1namo. In May 2013, the European Parliament expressed concern for hunger-striking detainees at Guant\u00e1namo and urged the United States to close the facility. President Obama renewed his commitment to shutting down Guant\u00e1namo, and in December 2013, Congress eased restrictions on transferring low-risk detainees to other countries. However, restrictions on bringing detainees to the United States remain in place, with Congress requiring the Administration to submit a plan for closing the facility in the FY2016 defense authorization bill. In FY2016, Congress maintained restrictions on transferring Guant\u00e1namo detainees to the US but required a closure plan. President Obama urged Congress to help close the facility before his term ended in January 2017. 91 detainees remain at Guant\u00e1namo as of February 2016, with 35 cleared for transfer. European concerns persist about past involvement in US terrorist detainee policies. European concerns about past involvement in US terrorist detainee policies persist, with the European Parliament calling for investigations into alleged CIA detention facilities and rendition flights. In 2015, the Parliament directed committees to resume investigations following a US Senate report on CIA programs, urging the US to investigate and prosecute human rights violations. The European Parliament has called for investigations into the CIA's alleged transportation and illegal detention of terrorist suspects in EU countries. This resolution also urged the United States to investigate and prosecute human rights violations related to the CIA programs. Concerns about U.S. wrongdoing and rendition-related criminal proceedings in some EU states continue to impact U.S.-European intelligence cooperation against terrorism. U.S. Administrations and Members of Congress have supported U.S.-EU cooperation against terrorism since 2001. The George W. Bush Administration prioritized engaging the EU on police and judicial matters to benefit from Europe's role as a key U.S. law enforcement partner. Improved U.S.-EU cooperation on border controls and transport security aims to track suspected terrorists and prevent their entry into the U.S. or Europe. However, differences in competencies and policy preferences complicate counterterrorism cooperation. U.S.-EU counterterrorism cooperation is complicated by different competencies and policy preferences. The United States prefers bilateral negotiations on some issues, leading to potential frictions in the relationship. Despite tensions, both sides are committed to closer cooperation in counterterrorism, law enforcement, border controls, and transport security. This cooperation is crucial in combating threats posed by citizens fighting with Islamist groups. Aviation and cargo security, U.S. border control measures, and visa policies are key areas of focus. The Obama Administration has continued the Bush Administration's policy of engagement with the EU in counterterrorism efforts. U.S.-EU cooperation against terrorism is crucial in combating threats posed by citizens fighting with Islamist groups. Aviation and cargo security, U.S. border control measures, and visa policies are key areas of focus for Congress. Congressional decisions on intelligence-gathering reforms and data privacy issues could impact future U.S.-EU counterterrorism cooperation. The U.S. and EU are working together on counterterrorism efforts, with a focus on security controls and data privacy issues. Congressional decisions on intelligence reforms could impact future cooperation. EU officials have welcomed the U.S. Judicial Redress Act as a positive step towards rebuilding trust in information-sharing arrangements. Members of Congress may play a role in shaping the European Parliament's views on counterterrorism. Parliament's growing influence in counterterrorism areas and its role in approving international agreements, such as the U.S.-EU SWIFT and PNR accords, may allow Members of Congress to shape Parliament's views. Some European Parliamentarians appreciate dialogue with Congress on U.S. surveillance operations. Representative Jim Sensenbrenner testified before the European Parliament on surveillance legislation changes. Senator Chris Murphy and Representative Mike Rogers led congressional delegations to Europe to discuss U.S. intelligence activities and reaffirm U.S.-European relations. In recent years, Members of Congress and European Parliamentarians have shown interest in strengthening ties and cooperation between the two bodies. Such exchanges could enhance transatlantic dialogue on counterterrorism issues."
