    "content": "Legislation to rewrite and reauthorize the Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA) may be considered in the 111th Congress. Several pieces of legislation in the 110th Congress addressed penalties, enforcement, diversion of goods, and integration of export control data. The EAA controls sensitive dual-use goods and technologies with civilian and military applications, including those that can contribute to the proliferation of weapons. The EAA has been periodically reauthorized since its expiration in 1989, with the last extension expiring in August 2001. The export licensing system under the EAA is currently continued through the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA) controls exports of dual-use items and technologies with civilian and military applications. The EAA's export licensing system is currently continued through the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The regulations are administered by the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) under the Department of Commerce, focusing on regulating exports based on strategic relationships and threats to national security. There is a push to liberalize U.S. export regulations to enhance American companies' international competitiveness. The Export Administration Act of 1979 controls exports of dual-use items and technologies with civilian and military applications. The regulations are administered by the Bureau of Industry and Security under the Department of Commerce, focusing on regulating exports based on strategic relationships and threats to national security. Some argue for liberalizing export regulations to enhance American companies' international competitiveness, while others believe that controls should be tightened to address foreign threats to U.S. national security. This report discusses the evolution of the Export Administration Act, its major features, export licensing procedures, and issues concerning the maintenance of export controls under IEEPA. It also highlights controlled commodities and discusses competing business and national security perspectives. The Export Control Act of 1949 was enacted to address new security threats during the Cold War, focusing on the Soviet-Bloc countries. It identified reasons for imposing export controls and marked a shift towards extensive peacetime export control policies. The Export Control Act of 1949 was a response to the Cold War, focusing on the Soviet-Bloc countries. It identified reasons for export controls related to scarcity, foreign policy, and national security, including nuclear non-proliferation items. This marked a shift towards a comprehensive peacetime export control system. The Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (CoCom) was established in 1949 to restrict the export of goods and technology that could enhance the military capability of countries threatening US national security. It reflected a high level of restrictions similar to US controls. The Export Control Act was renewed multiple times without significant changes until the late 1960s when a reexamination and revision of the export control system occurred due to the US-Soviet era of \"detente.\" In the late 1960s, the US export control system underwent a serious reexamination and revision due to the US-Soviet era of \"detente.\" The Export Administration Act of 1969 replaced the Export Control Act of 1949, leading to a shift towards less restrictive export controls. Subsequent renewals and amendments in 1974, 1977, and 1979 further liberalized export controls. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989 marked a significant change in the external threat faced by the United States. The Export Administration Act of 1969 replaced the Export Control Act of 1949, leading to less restrictive export controls. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989 marked a significant change in the external threat faced by the United States. The export control system has been reduced in scope and streamlined since the George H.W. Bush Administration, but the basic structure of the law remains intact. The dissolution of CoCom in 1994 and its replacement by the Wassenaar Arrangement in 1997 significantly changed the export control environment. The Export Administration Act of 1969 replaced the Export Control Act of 1949, leading to less restrictive export controls. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989 marked a significant change in the external threat faced by the United States. The export control system has been reduced in scope and streamlined since the George H.W. Bush Administration, but the basic structure of the law remains intact. The dissolution of CoCom in 1994 and its replacement by the Wassenaar Arrangement in 1997 significantly changed the export control environment. This new multilateral arrangement is more loosely structured than CoCom, with members unable to block transactions of other members. The effectiveness of U.S. export controls in achieving national security objectives and the fairness of unilateral controls to American industry are questioned. Congress has not been able to agree on measures to reform the Export Administration Act, leading to temporary extensions and reliance on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Operating under IEEPA is seen as imposing constraints on the administration of the export control process and making it vulnerable to legal challenge, potentially undermining its effectiveness. Legislation passed in 2000 extended the Export Administration Act until 2001, temporarily removing the need to operate under IEEPA powers. However, export control authority has since been operating under IEEPA provisions. Efforts to rewrite the Export Administration Act have been ongoing in Congress, with bills introduced in multiple sessions. In the 104th Congress, the House passed the Omnibus Export Administration Act of 1996 (H.R. 361) on July 16, 1996. In the following Congresses, export control legislation was introduced but no significant action was taken. Senator Enzi introduced the Export Administration Act of 1999 (S. 1712) in the 106th Congress, but it faced concerns about national security impact. In the 107th Congress, Senator Enzi introduced the Export Administration Act of 2001 (S. 149), with hearings held in February 2001. In the 107th Congress, Senator Enzi introduced the Export Administration Act of 2001 (S. 149), which was favorably reported for consideration by the Senate and passed with amendments. The House version, H.R. 2581, was introduced with provisions related to oversight of nuclear transfers to North Korea and passed with amendments by the House International Relations Committee. The House version of the Export Administration Act, H.R. 2581, introduced by Representative Benjamin Gilman in 2001, included provisions on oversight of nuclear transfers to North Korea. The legislation underwent amendments in various committees but did not progress further in the 107th Congress. In the 108th Congress, a similar bill, H.R. 55, was introduced but no action was taken. The National Defense Authorization Act has also been used to attempt amendments to the export control regime. In the 108th Congress, Representative Dreier introduced EAA legislation (H.R. 55), identical to S. 149, but no action was taken. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) has been used to attempt amendments to the export control regime. In 2004, the House version of NDAA 2005 (H.R. 4200) contained provisions related to dual-use export controls, requiring licenses for certain goods and items. The House NDAA report expressed concern about potential transfer of U.S. goods or technology to China, but provisions requiring licenses for exports to China were not included in the final conference report signed by the President in 2004. In the 109th Congress, a bill to revise the Export Administration Act was introduced, focusing on penalties, enforcement, and multilateral control. In the 109th Congress, a bill was introduced to revise the Export Administration Act, focusing on penalties, enforcement, and multilateral control. The bill aimed to extend the expired EAA for two years and provide authorization of appropriations for export control activities. However, the bill did not receive consideration in Congress. Legislation in the 110th Congress sought to amend enforcement and penalty structures, integrate export control information into electronic filing, and target countries of diversion concern. In the 110th Congress, legislation was introduced to amend enforcement and penalty structures of the Export Administration Act. Bills aimed to integrate export control information into electronic filing, target countries of diversion concern, and require an investigation of BIS' validated end-user program. Only S. 3445 / H.R. 7112 was acted upon, with H.R. 7112 passing in the House. In 2009, the Export Control Improvements Act was introduced, focusing on export controls enforcement and integration of export control data in the AES. H.R. 7112 was introduced and passed in the House in September 2008. The Export Control Improvements Act (H.R. 3515) introduced by Representative Sherman in July 2009 focuses on export controls enforcement and integration of export control data in the AES. It grants additional enforcement authority for the Export Administration Regulations during the lapse of the EAA under the IEEPA. The draft legislation, H.R. 3515, grants investigative authority to departments and agencies under the EAR for conducting investigations in the US and abroad. It allows for search, detention, and seizure of goods by Commerce within the US and at ports of entry or exit. The bill also includes provisions for export control compliance programs, undercover investigations, and audit/reporting requirements. Title 1 of the bill aims to integrate licensing requirements and data collection rules into the Automated Export System. Title 1 of H.R. 3515 aims to integrate licensing requirements and data collection rules into the Automated Export System (AES) to prevent improper shipments. The issue of evasion of U.S. export controls through transhipment hubs, such as the UAE, remains a concern for Congress. The BIS proposed the creation of a 'Country Category C' in 2007 to address diversion concerns in the UAE. H.R. 3515 would legislate the concept, requiring the identification of countries of concern with respect to diversion to Iran within 180 days. The legislation would establish a 'Category C' designation for countries at risk of diverting items to Iran. Countries designated as concerns would face stricter export controls and increased monitoring. Additionally, an annual report on transfers of U.S. technology to these countries would be required. The legislation would establish a 'Category C' designation for countries at risk of diverting items to Iran, subjecting them to stricter export controls and increased monitoring. President Obama initiated a review of the U.S. export control system, aiming to streamline it by creating a single licensing agency, adopting a unified control list, and implementing a single integrated information technology system. Secretary Gates proposed a 4-pronged approach to streamline the U.S. export control system, including creating a single export control licensing agency, adopting a unified control list, establishing a single integrated information technology system, and setting up a single enforcement coordination agency. The changes would be implemented in three phases, with the final phase requiring legislative action. Phase I involves harmonizing the Commerce Control List with the U.S. Munitions List and developing standardized licensing processes. Phase II would implement a harmonized licensing system. Phase III of the proposed export control system involves the debut of a new system with a single licensing agency, merged control lists, and a Primary Enforcement Coordination Agency to consolidate enforcement activities. The proposed export control system in Phase III includes a single licensing agency, merged control lists, and a Primary Enforcement Coordination Agency to consolidate enforcement activities. Secretary Gates predicts the 3-phase plan will unfold over the next year, but many questions remain unanswered, including the need for legislative action and multilateral consultations for changes to the control lists. Changes to the structure of the control lists in Phase II may require legislative consent and multilateral consultations. The placement of the proposed licensing agency within existing departments or as an independent entity is undecided. Common principles in export control efforts include types of controls, licensing procedures, review processes, and enforcement measures. The U.S. export controls authorized types of controls for national security, foreign policy, and short supply, with licensing procedures and penalty enforcement under IEEPA authority. Dual-use export controls restrict items based on national security, foreign policy, or impact on the national economy. The Commerce Control List (CCL) and Export Administration Regulations control items based on these categories. The 1979 Act restricted exports that could enhance military capabilities of other countries. National security control items require National Security licensing under the EAR. The 1979 Act limits the export of goods or technology that could boost military capabilities of other countries, affecting U.S. national security. Items for national security control require licensing under the EAR, with Country Group D-1 as the controlled countries list. Licenses are reviewed case-by-case to ensure civilian use or no military contribution. The Secretary of Defense identifies items for control, periodically reviewed and revised by the Secretary of Defense and Commerce. The Military Critical Technology List is maintained for this purpose, aligning with the Wassenaar Arrangement. The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Commerce are obligated to periodically review and revise the Military Critical Technology List for national security controls. Items not covered by U.S. national security controls are controlled for foreign policy purposes, with a determination of foreign availability for effectiveness. The 1979 Act charges the Secretaries with determining if any item subject to export control meets foreign availability. The 1979 Act charges the Secretary, in conjunction with the Secretary of Defense, to determine if items subject to export control meet foreign availability. If a foreign availability determination is made, the item must be decontrolled unless the President determines it would harm national security. The bill also established an Office of Foreign Availability to assist in making these determinations and report to Congress on improvements in assessing foreign availability. The bill directed negotiations with control partners to eliminate availability, created an Office of Foreign Availability (now replaced by the Office of Technology Evaluation), and established the ETRAC committee to streamline the control list. BIS conducted a review of the CCL and lifted licensing requirements on thermal imaging cameras in 2009. BIS conducted a review of the CCL in 2007-8 and plans to review 1/3 of the CCL each year. On May 22, 2009, BIS issued a final rule lifting certain licensing requirements on thermal imaging cameras to 36 U.S. allied countries. The rule decontrolled low to mid-market night vision cameras, tightened export controls on higher-end thermal imaging cameras, and requires exporters to report transactions to BIS on a semi-annual basis. Some concerns remain about the length of time taken to resolve the issue. According to industry sources, it took six years for BIS to reach an agreement with the Defense Technology Security Administration on resolving foreign availability concerns. The concept of mass market status, proposed in EAA legislation, was controversial and a stumbling block in negotiations. The EAA legislation introduced in the 106th and 107th Congress considered various criteria for determining mass market status, including distribution, shipping conduciveness, and intended purposes. This feature was controversial and a stumbling block in negotiations, with concerns about wholesale decontrol of sensitive items. The EAA authorizes the President to control exports for foreign policy objectives, terrorism deterrence, and compliance with international obligations. Foreign policy controls are in place for anti-terrorism, regional stability, crime control, UN sanctions, embargoes, and non-proliferation objectives. These controls must be renewed yearly. The EAA legislation imposes limitations on foreign policy controls, requiring annual renewal and clear objectives. It mandates negotiations to eliminate foreign availability of controlled items and compliance with international treaties. Licenses are needed for exports to countries supporting terrorism, with exceptions for humanitarian aid. Controls do not apply to sales of medicine, food, or agricultural products under certain conditions. Controls on foreign policy are not authorized for sales of medicine, medical supplies, donations of food, medicines, seeds, and water resource equipment for basic human needs, or for sales of food causing malnutrition or hardship. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 amended controls on agricultural products and medicines. Catch-all controls require a license for export of any item if it will be used for proliferation activities. BIS maintains an end-user list subject to EPCI. Presumption of denial for licenses applies to certain entities in Russia, China, Pakistan, India, and Israel. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) maintains an end-user list of entities requiring licenses subject to Export Control and Prevention of Proliferation Activities (EPCI). Current regulations include a presumption of denial for licenses to certain entities in Russia, China, Pakistan, India, and Israel. The Export Administration Act (EAA) authorizes restrictions on exports to protect domestic industry. The Department of Commerce administers the license application process, with BIS reviewing applications totaling $72.1 billion in FY2008. In FY2008, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) reviewed 21,213 license applications totaling $72.1 billion. This included $50.2 billion in licenses for crude oil exports in exchange for refined petroleum. BIS approved 84% of applications, denied 1.0%, and returned 15%. China received the most licenses with a value of $2.7 billion, representing 3.7% of total exports to China that year. Chemical manufacturing facilities and equipment had the highest number of approved license applications. In FY2008, China was the largest destination for controlled goods with 1,990 licenses approved worth $2.7 billion, accounting for 3.7% of total exports to China. The Commerce Control List (CCL) was created in 1979 to control items for national security, foreign policy, and short-supply purposes. The CCL includes ten categories of controlled items such as nuclear materials, electronics, and propulsion systems. The Commerce Control List (CCL) categorizes controlled items into ten categories, each further divided into functional groups. Each item has an Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) and a description of the item. Nearly all U.S.-origin commodities are subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), allowing restrictions based on end-use or end-user, even if not listed on the CCL. Nearly all U.S.-origin commodities are subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), allowing restrictions based on end-use or end-user. Items on the Commerce Control List (CCL) may be eligible for license exceptions, while a commodity jurisdiction (CJ) determines if a product is dual-use or a munition. Exporters may prefer dual-use classification due to less restrictive controls. The jurisdiction (CJ) determines if a product is dual-use or a munition, affecting the regulatory regime. Exporters can request a commodity classification from BIS if their item doesn't match a CCL listing. However, there have been criticisms of the low number of referrals to State and Defense for classification requests. In 2005, out of 5,370 commodity classification requests processed, only 10 were referred to State and Defense, leading to jurisdictional disagreements and coordination problems between the two departments. Despite recommendations, the disputes have not been resolved, leaving exporters to determine restrictions and governmental review processes. The EAA and EAR establish policies for license review. The EAA and EAR establish policies and procedures for the review of license applications and the resolution of interagency disputes. The Secretary of Commerce has the power to review and determine the disposition of export licenses, with other agencies having the authority to review licenses as well. Agencies may waive their right to review certain licenses, and the Secretary must seek additional information within nine days of a license application's registration. The Secretary of Commerce has the authority to review and determine export license applications, with other agencies also having the power to review licenses. Agencies may waive their review rights for certain commodities or destinations. Within nine days of application registration, the Secretary must seek additional information, refer the application to other agencies, ensure correct security classification, return unnecessary applications, grant or deny the application. If another agency reviews the application, they must request additional information within 10 days. The reviewing agency must recommend approval or denial within 30 days, providing justification for denial. Failure to provide a recommendation within 30 days implies no objection. The Export Administration Review Board (EARB) was created in 1995 as a three-level interagency dispute resolution mechanism. It consists of the Secretary of Commerce, Secretaries of State, Defense, and Energy, with non-voting members like the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Advisory Committee on Export Policy (ACEP) and Operating Committee (OC) are also part of this structure. The Advisory Committee on Export Policy (ACEP) is under the Export Administration Review Board (EARB) and consists of the Assistant Secretary for Export Administration as Chair, along with relevant assistant Secretaries and officials. The Operating Committee (OC) of ACEP, made up of representatives from the departments, handles dispute resolution. The Chair reviews department recommendations and informs them of decisions within 14 days. Departments can appeal to ACEP within five days, and a majority decision is made within 11 days. If a department head disagrees, they can appeal to the Secretary within five days, and the EARB must decide by majority within 11 days. The President must state the basis for an appeal. ACEP members review and vote on applications within 11 days. A dissenting agency head can appeal to the Secretary within five days. EARB decides on the application within 11 days of the appeal. A member of EARB can appeal to the President within five days. The interagency appeal process must be completed within 90 days. BIS's denial of a license must be supported by specific reasons. An explicit appeal procedure is specified in the EAR, including foreign availability assessment as a basis for appeal. In FY2008, BIS reported that 422 cases were escalated to the OC, and a further 20 were examined by the ACEP. President George H.W. Bush extended export regulations in 1990 using emergency authority. IEEPA-based controls were terminated during temporary EAA extensions in 1993 and 1994. President Clinton took action after the second extension expired in 1994. President Clinton reimposed controls under IEEPA after the expiration of the EAA extensions in 1994. A major restructuring of export control regulations was published in 1996. President Clinton signed legislation in 2000 to extend the authority of the 1979 Act. President George W. Bush renewed emergency controls in 2001. Deficiencies in maintaining export controls under IEEPA authority include the need for enforcement agents to obtain Special Deputy U.S. Marshal status. President Clinton reimposed controls under IEEPA after the expiration of the EAA extensions in 1994. Deficiencies in maintaining export controls under IEEPA authority include the need for enforcement agents to obtain Special Deputy U.S. Marshal status, which consumes limited resources better used on enforcement. IEEPA does not authorize the President to limit the jurisdiction of federal courts or protect information from public disclosure. Additionally, it does not allow the executive to discourage compliance with foreign boycotts against friendly countries, leading to arguments that the U.S. lacks credibility in urging other countries to strengthen their export control laws. The United States lacks credibility in urging other countries to strengthen their export control laws due to expired U.S. export control laws. However, the International Emergency Economic Powers Enhancement Act raised criminal penalties to $1 million or up to 20 years' imprisonment for natural persons. The International Emergency Economic Powers Enhancement Act raised criminal penalties for violations involving national security controls to $1 million or up to 20 years' imprisonment for individuals. Controversial exports include telecommunications, advanced electronic equipment, precision machine tools, guidance technology, aerospace technology, synthetic materials, and specialized manufacturing equipment. Congressional attention has focused on technologically advanced computers, including supercomputers and HPCs. High-Performance Computers (HPCs) are technologically advanced machines capable of complex digital operations in seconds. They include supercomputers, workstations, mainframes, microprocessors, and software. The benchmark for HPC performance was previously measured in MTOPS, but a new standard called adjusted peak performance (APP) using weighted teraflops (WT) was approved in 2005. This new standard sets the control level at 0.75 WT. The new standard for High-Performance Computers (HPCs), called adjusted peak performance (APP), was incorporated into a BIS final rulemaking in April 2006. It measures the performance of 64-bit or larger floating point additions and multiplications using weighted teraflops (WT). The control level is set at 0.75 WT, replacing the previous 190,000 MTOPS benchmark. Export restrictions on HPCs have been in place since the Clinton Administration, but some argue that these restrictions are no longer practical or enforceable due to rapid advancements in computing capabilities and the availability of comparable models from foreign sources. During the Clinton Administration, export restrictions on High-Performance Computers (HPCs) were implemented, with thresholds for licensing raised multiple times. The last change in January 2002 increased the threshold for HPC exports to Tier 3 countries to 190,000 MTOPS. This decontrol process significantly impacted the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), reducing the number of license applications for computer assemblies and hardware. Despite the shift to weighted teraflops (WT) as the new performance metric, changes in control levels still require notification under the National Defense Authorization Act of 1998. The National Defense Authorization Act of 1998 imposed special conditions on the export of high performance computers, requiring prior notification for exports above the MTOPS threshold to Tier III countries. Encryption is the process of encoding electronic messages for secure data transfer. Keys are needed to decode the message. Encryption is crucial for secure data transfer in electronic messages. Keys are necessary to decode the message. The control authority of encryption technology was transferred from the Department of State to the Department of Commerce in 1996. Retail encryption products can now be exported to western countries and non-governmental end-users with a license exemption. The progressive decontrol of retail encryption technology allows for its export to western countries and non-governmental end-users through a license exemption. Stealth technology incorporates materials and designs to protect against electronic detection, with certain materials deflecting radar signals and others absorbing them. Export control concerns arise due to civil applications of stealth materials, making it challenging to retain U.S. leadership in this technology. Stealth technology materials prevent radar signals from reflecting back, posing export control challenges due to civil applications. Concerns led to reclassification of certain technology as munitions in the 1990s. Congress debated controlling exports of commercial satellites and monitoring foreign launch operations to prevent disclosures of missile secrets. Improper transfer of launch failure analysis to China was found in 1998. Authority to license satellite exports was transferred to the Department of State in 1999. The Department of Commerce licensed satellite exports until March 1999 when authority was transferred to the Department of State. The satellite industry has faced licensing delays and lost sales due to regulatory uncertainty. Commercial satellites may contain sensitive technology controlled under the U.S. Munitions List. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 2010-11 included a provision to transfer commercial satellite technology back to the Commerce Control List with congressional approval. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 2010-11 (H.R. 2410) allowed the President to transfer commercial satellite technology from the USML to the CCL with congressional approval. This technology includes advanced manufacturing equipment used for missiles and aircraft. The industry has expressed concerns about the lack of multilateral controls, especially regarding China. The BIS recommended decontrolling certain machine tools for export to China and Taiwan. The evaluation recommended decontrolling 5-axis simultaneously controlled machine tools for export to China and Taiwan, despite concerns raised by senators about the decontrol of sensitive technologies like \"hot section\" technology used in jet aircraft development. The civilian aviation industry is worried about the Department of State's increasing jurisdiction over civilian aircraft parts and components. The civilian aviation industry is concerned about the Department of State's increasing jurisdiction over civilian aircraft parts and components, leading to the need for clarification through legislation introduced by Representative Manzullo. The Department of State's jurisdiction over civilian aircraft parts and components has raised concerns in the civilian aviation industry. Representative Manzullo introduced legislation to clarify that civil aircraft equipment eligible for export airworthiness approval under FAA regulations should only be subject to controls under the EAA. After negotiations, a new rule clarified that Commerce will have jurisdiction over standard parts and components of civil aircraft not considered significant military equipment, eliminating the need for commodity jurisdiction determinations. The Federal Aviation Administration issues civil aircraft type certificates, making parts an integral part of the aircraft. Suppliers no longer need to submit these parts for commodity jurisdiction determination if they are not significant military equipment. Technology exports to foreign nationals in the US are considered exports and require a license. Deemed exports are not explicitly mentioned in the 1979 EAA, but have become a larger part of BIS activity, with 1,056 deemed export licenses reviewed in FY2007. In FY2007, BIS reviewed 1,056 deemed export licenses, with nearly 57% for Chinese nationals. BIS established a rule-making procedure in response to an IG report recommending changes to the standard governing foreign nationals subject to export controls. Foreign nationals are currently subject to controls based on citizenship or residency, but the IG suggested using country of birth. Deemed export controls will continue to be based on existing criteria. In December 2007, the Deemed Export Advisory Commission recommended a \"trusted entity\" program for academia and industrial entities to streamline the deemed export application process. The program would evaluate an applicant's probable loyalties based on various factors, including country of birth and current citizenship. The Commission proposed evaluating an applicant's probable loyalties based on factors like country of birth, prior residence, and current citizenship for a deemed export license. They also suggested simplifying terminology in regulations and establishing an expert panel for annual technology reviews. Industry and research groups criticized the recommendations as unworkable. BIS sought feedback on deemed export controls and country affiliation criteria. The Emerging Technologies and Research Advisory Committee (ETRAC) has started addressing these issues. The Commerce Control List is under scrutiny for deemed export controls and country affiliation criteria for foreign nationals. The tension between commercial and national security concerns is a key theme in export administration debates. Reform is favored by many to help U.S. businesses compete globally, while others prioritize effective controls on exports to security threats. Some advocate export control reform to enhance U.S. global competitiveness, while others prioritize national security concerns. Controversies arise over technology control, multilateral regimes, licensing process, and economic impact. Industry groups support EAA reauthorization provisions for foreign availability and mass market concepts. Industry groups support EAA reauthorization provisions for foreign availability and mass market concepts, arguing that unilateral controls on advanced technology are ineffective and harm American businesses while benefiting foreign competitors. They believe that current multilateral controls are ineffectual and that the global economy makes unilateral export controls increasingly unworkable. The unilateral nature of U.S. export controls is criticized for hindering foreign business opportunities and becoming unworkable in a globalized economy. Industry proponents argue that the current system is outdated as component parts are manufactured worldwide, making it easy to obtain them from other sources. Concerns are raised about delays in American licensing procedures, prompting companies like Daimler Chrysler Aerospace to reduce reliance on American components. Critics fear that industry arguments for mass market and foreign availability could undermine the entire U.S. control regime by decontrolling items used for proliferation. Participants in the export control debate are concerned about industry proponents' arguments regarding mass market and foreign availability. Critics argue that these standards could potentially nullify the U.S. control regime by decontrolling items used for proliferation. Industry advocates claim that national security is bolstered by strong export industries due to the changing nature of defense procurement and research. During the Cold War, the military focused on technical research and development, but now relies more on commercial applications. Industry argues that selling current technology is crucial for national security and competitiveness. Critics disagree, stating that selling advanced technology to potentially hostile states could compromise national security. Industry argues for a streamlined export process to facilitate exports, while critics warn against selling advanced technology to potentially hostile states, citing the example of Iraq using U.S. weaponry against Kuwait. Some suggest funding R&D for defense capabilities within the Defense Department to maintain control over technology exports. The rapid rise in computing power is seen as a challenge for export control systems. R&D for defense capabilities should be funded within the Defense Department to control technology exports. The rapid increase in computing power poses challenges for export control systems, with some arguing that attempting to control computing power is not feasible or effective. The ability to link microprocessors to create powerful computing systems blurs the line between super-computers and commodity computers, making it difficult to restrict access. The Defense Science Board noted that clustering commodity computers can breach export thresholds by creating parallel processing systems approaching super-computer capabilities. Advocates believe the US can restrict access to high-performance computing by limiting exports, citing American-made computers' perceived superiority in networking and service. Control advocates argue that qualitative differences are significant, as networking parallel processing systems presents unique challenges distinct from commodity computers. Control advocates emphasize the importance of qualitative differences in high-performance computing systems. Post-shipment verification requirements have been implemented to monitor the end-use of controlled goods, especially for exports to tier III destinations like China, Russia, and India. Lawmakers are particularly concerned about exports of HPCs to China, where monitoring compliance with export licenses has been challenging. The GAO reported challenges in monitoring U.S. high-performance computing exports to China due to restricted access and limited efforts by BIS to verify compliance. The close ties between Chinese state-owned enterprises and the military further complicate monitoring. The United States participates in multilateral export control regimes like the Wassenaar Arrangement and other proliferation-related control regimes. The United States participates in multilateral export control regimes such as the Wassenaar Arrangement, which is generally consistent with U.S. national security controls. Other proliferation-related control regimes include the Australia Group, the Missile Technology Control Regime, and the Nuclear Suppliers Group. These groups operate by national discretion, have common control lists, and require regular reporting. They pledge disclosure of export licensing decisions and consultation on sensitive licenses, but operate by consensus and have limited institutional structures. Some observers question the effectiveness of the Wassenaar Arrangement. Some groups adhere to a \"no undercut\" provision in export licenses, but are hindered by limited institutional structures. Critics argue that the Wassenaar Arrangement's reliance on consensus among member states is ineffective, leading to minimal reporting requirements and hindering effective pre-export consultation. Industry representatives emphasize the need for multilateral controls to ensure all states adhere to export regulations, especially concerning exports to China where there is no consensus on technology transfer limits. The machine tool industry criticizes the unilateral nature of US export policies, particularly regarding exports to China. There is no consensus among Wassenaar Arrangement countries on technology transfer limits to China. Industry spokesmen argue that stringent domestic controls and minimal multilateral constraints harm American companies. Proponents of tighter export restrictions believe the US must lead in export controls and non-proliferation efforts to convince other nations to follow suit. The United States must lead in export controls and non-proliferation efforts to convince other nations to follow suit. Industry spokesmen and advocates agree on the need to strengthen multilateral controls, but consensus is lacking on which countries pose a threat, particularly China. This lack of consensus creates an export control dilemma. The export control dilemma arises from the lack of consensus on which countries pose a threat, particularly China. The U.S. faces the challenge of balancing economic benefits with national security risks when exporting sensitive technologies to China. Some argue that current controls are too stringent. U.S. export control policy towards China aims to balance economic benefits with national security risks. Some argue that current controls are too stringent, hindering technology transfers to China. Concerns have been raised about China's acquisition of dual-use technologies, with evidence of evasion of export controls. China's acquisition of dual-use technologies has raised concerns, with evidence of evasion of export controls. The Cox Commission found that China illegally obtained missile and satellite technology, circumventing end-user controls on high-performance computers. China has also been implicated in nuclear, missile, and chemical proliferation activities. The final rule published by BIS on June 19, 2007, includes new licensing requirements for certain products for military end-use in China, a validated end-user program, and a requirement for an end-user statement for certain licensed products. This rule aims to address concerns about the export of commercial technology undermining the arms embargo against China. The proposed rule by BIS includes new licensing requirements for certain products for military end-use in China, a validated end-user program, and a requirement for an end-user statement for certain licensed products. It aims to address concerns about the export of commercial technology undermining the arms embargo against China. The new rule establishes military end-use controls on 20 product categories for the People's Republic of China, requiring a license for export, reexport, or in-country transfer. The new rule by BIS introduces licensing requirements for certain items for military end-use in China, expanding controls to 31 export control classification numbers. A license is now needed for exports to countries like Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria, as well as if the items are intended for military end-uses in China. The rule also establishes a presumption of denial for items that contribute significantly to China's military capabilities in key weapons systems. Additionally, the exemption threshold for obtaining End-Use Statements from the Ministry of Foreign Commerce of China has been increased. The Final Rule increases the exemption threshold for obtaining End-Use Statements from the Ministry of Foreign Commerce of China. It expands the EUS requirement to cover all license applications to China reaching a threshold of $50,000. The VEU establishes a method for trusted Chinese civilian end-users to receive items without a license if approved by BIS. The VEU is the third component of the China Rule, allowing trusted PRC civilian end-users to receive items without a license if approved by BIS. The approval process includes evaluating the entity's compliance record, capability to comply with recordkeeping requirements, and relationship with U.S. and foreign companies. Authorization from MoFCom is required for companies seeking VEU status, and not all items on the CCL are eligible for export under this program. On September 11, 2007, China's Minister of Foreign Commerce announced that companies seeking VEU status need authorization from MoFCom for plant or records inspections. Not all items on the CCL qualify for export under this program, and items controlled for crime control or missile technology by the EAR are excluded. The VEU application, once approved, allows import of items from any exporter and can be expanded or contracted by the ERC. The proposal aims to streamline licensing for certain companies, freeing up resources for more complex applications. On October 2, 2007, BIS expanded the VEU program to eligible companies in India, with General Electric India being the first eligible. On October 19, 2007, BIS announced the first five VEU companies: Applied Materials China, National Semiconductor, Boeing Hexcel AVIC I Joint Venture, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), and Shanghai Hua Hong NEC Corporation (HHNEC). These companies imported licensed goods valued at $54.3 million in 2006. In January 2008, the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control raised concerns about AVIC I and HHNEC's potential diversion risks due to their affiliations with Chinese government-owned companies involved with the military. The Wisconsin Project raised concerns about AVIC I and HHNEC's diversion risks due to their affiliations with Chinese government-owned companies involved with the military. BIS Undersecretary Mario Mancuso defended the companies' use of U.S. technology and the VEU program. Controversy surrounding the VEU program continued, with a GAO study recommending its suspension due to lack of inspection agreements and criteria for on-site reviews with China. Commerce has conducted checks under the VEU program. The VEU program with China has been suspended due to the lack of inspection agreements and criteria for on-site reviews. Commerce has conducted checks under a pre-existing 2004 end-use verification understanding. Representative Markey raised concerns about a VEU approved entity sharing an address with a state-owned firm sanctioned for illicit sales to Iran and Syria. At a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing, Representative Markey raised concerns about a VEU approved entity, Aviza Technology China, sharing an address with a state-owned firm sanctioned for illicit sales to Iran and Syria. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) regulates dual-use exports, consulting with other agencies for input. The Defense Technology Security Agency conducts national security reviews for license applications, while the Department of Energy reviews dual-use license applications for nuclear uses. The Directorate of Defense Trade Controls at the State Department administers the International Traffic in Arms Regulations. The Department of Energy reviews dual-use license applications for nuclear uses and nuclear end-users, while the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls at the State Department administers the International Traffic in Arms Regulations for weapons and military technology exports. Industry leaders have identified issues with the licensing system, including overlapping jurisdiction between Commerce and State Departments, lengthy approval times, lack of technological updates, and no opportunity for judicial review. The licensing system for export controls faces challenges such as overlapping jurisdiction, lengthy approval times, lack of technological updates, and no opportunity for judicial review. Some question the placement of the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) within the Department of Commerce, as they believe the DOC's mission is more focused on promoting exports and commercial interests rather than national security. Export administration officials claim to conduct thorough and fair license reviews, requiring time to check proposed export items against controlled lists and coordinate with various government agencies to prevent sensitive technologies from falling into the wrong hands. Some analysts question if the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) belongs in the Department of Commerce due to concerns about potential bias towards granting export licenses over national security goals. Others argue that the involvement of agencies like the Department of Defense ensures a fair process."
