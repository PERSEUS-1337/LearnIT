    "content": "The \"Lumbee Recognition Act\" is the short title of this Act. The preamble of the Act of June 7, 1956 is amended by making specific changes to the wording. The Lumbee Indians of North Carolina, descendants of coastal tribes, have been recognized by the state since 1885 and by Congress in 1956. They are seeking full federal recognition and the benefits that come with it. Federal recognition is extended to the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina, allowing them to receive benefits and services available to other Indian tribes. Any group of Indians in specific counties in North Carolina not enrolled in the Lumbee Tribe may petition for acknowledgment of tribal existence. The Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina and its members are eligible for services and benefits provided to federally recognized Indian tribes. Members residing in specific counties are considered to be on or near a reservation. The Secretary of the Interior and Health and Human Services will determine needs and budget for services in consultation with the tribe. The Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior and Health and Human Services, will develop a budget for services based on the tribal roll. The tribal roll, verified by the Secretary of the Interior, defines the service population of the Tribe according to membership criteria in the Tribe's constitution. The Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina may convey fee land to the United States for trust purposes, treated as on-reservation trust acquisitions if located in Robeson County. State jurisdiction is addressed in the legislation. The State of North Carolina has jurisdiction over criminal offenses and civil actions on land owned by the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina. The Secretary of the Interior can accept jurisdiction transfers from the state under an agreement with the tribe. This section does not affect the Indian Child Welfare Act. Authorization of appropriations is granted to carry out this Act."
