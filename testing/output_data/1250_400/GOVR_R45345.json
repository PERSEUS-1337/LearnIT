    "content": "Whistleblowing in the Intelligence Community (IC) involves reporting violations of law, mismanagement, waste of resources, abuse of authority, or threats to public health and safety. Protections for IC whistleblowers are focused on safeguarding classified information and ensuring lawful disclosures. These protections do not cover unauthorized disclosures like leaking to the media or foreign governments. Whistleblower protections in the Intelligence Community (IC) only apply to lawful disclosures, not unauthorized leaks to the media or foreign governments. They do not cover differences in policy or adverse personnel actions unless there is a concern over legality. Procedures for protected disclosures are defined by Congress and the executive branch to ensure the security of classified information. The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) provides guidance on whistleblowing for IC contractors, Armed Forces members, and federal employees. IC whistleblower protections have evolved in response to gaps in protections against reprisal. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 established a process for complaints but offered no specific protections. The Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 included general provisions for protecting IC whistleblowers. Presidential Policy Directive (PPD)-19 also addresses whistleblower process and protections for IC contractors, Armed Forces members, and federal employees. The evolution of IC whistleblower protections began with the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998, which established a complaint process without specific protections. Subsequent legislation and directives, such as the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, Presidential Policy Directive (PPD)-19, and the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, provided more specific protections for IC whistleblowers. Additionally, 10 U.S.C. \u00a71034 offers whistleblower protections for members of the Armed Forces in the IC. In January 2018, Congress passed P.L. 115-118 amending the National Security Act of 1947 and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 to address gaps in protections for Intelligence Community (IC) contractors. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 assists IC whistleblowers excluded from the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, allowing them to report complaints to the Inspector General of their agency. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 allows IC government employees or contractors to report complaints to the Inspector General of their agency, ensuring protection of classified information. The Act requires the IG to report credible complaints to the CIA Director or head of the establishment, who must then report to congressional intelligence committees within 7 days. If the IG fails to report accurately, the employee or contractor can directly submit the complaint to Congress after following certain procedures. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 allows IC government employees or contractors to report complaints to the Inspector General of their agency, ensuring protection of classified information. If the IG fails to report accurately, the employee or contractor can directly submit the complaint to Congress after following certain procedures. The ICWPA provides a process for whistleblowers to report complaints to Congress via the relevant IC agency IG, but lacks specific provisions for protecting whistleblowers from reprisal or punishment. The IAA for FY2010 included the first general provisions for protection of whistleblowers as part of legislation that established the Office of the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community. Section 405(a)(1) of the IAA for FY2010 added a new Section 103H to the National Security Act of 1947, allowing lawful disclosures to the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community (IGIC). The IGIC is authorized to receive and investigate complaints or information regarding violations of laws, rules, regulations, mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or threats to public health and safety. The identity of the employee making the complaint must be kept confidential unless unavoidable during the investigation or disclosed to the Department of Justice for prosecution consideration. The Inspector General of the Intelligence Community is authorized to receive and investigate complaints or information regarding violations within the intelligence community. The identity of the employee making the complaint must be kept confidential unless unavoidable during the investigation or disclosed to the Department of Justice for prosecution consideration. No reprisal can be taken against an employee for making a complaint unless it was knowingly false or with willful disregard for the truth. Contractors are also covered under this provision. The Inspector General of the Intelligence Community has access to employees and contractors within the intelligence community for investigations. Protections against reprisals for whistleblowers were clarified and expanded by various acts and executive orders. PPD-19, signed by President Obama in 2012, provides protections for IC whistleblowers who make lawful disclosures of violations of laws or regulations, mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or danger to public health or safety. It prohibits reprisals that could affect access to classified information or involve personnel actions. PPD-19 protects IC whistleblowers who report violations of laws or regulations, mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or danger to public health or safety. It prohibits reprisals that could impact access to classified information or result in personnel actions. IC elements must have a process for employees to seek review of personnel actions believed to be in reprisal for a disclosure. The Inspector General determines if a personnel action was retaliatory and makes recommendations for corrective action, which the agency head must consider. The Inspector General (IG) makes recommendations for corrective action in cases of reprisal for lawful disclosures within IC agencies. Agency heads are required to consider the IG's findings and recommendations, but they are not obligated to accept them. PPD-19 allows whistleblowers to request an external review by an IG panel if they have exhausted the agency review process. The IGIC must report annually to congressional intelligence committees on determinations and recommendations, with the agency having the discretion to consider but not necessarily accept the panel's recommendations for corrective action. The IG makes recommendations for corrective action in cases of reprisal for lawful disclosures within IC agencies. The agency must consider but does not have to accept the panel's recommendation. PDD-19 requires annual reporting to congressional intelligence committees on determinations and recommendations. Title VI of the FY2014 IAA provides statutory protections for IC whistleblowers against personnel actions in retaliation for lawful disclosures. Section 601 of Title VI protects whistleblowers from any retaliation for lawful disclosures to specified individuals. Section 601 of Title VI of the FY2014 IAA provides protections for IC whistleblowers who make lawful disclosures to specified individuals, including the Director of National Intelligence, Inspector General of the Intelligence Community, and congressional intelligence committees. However, contractors are not specifically mentioned in the legislation. Section 602 of Title VI also protects against retaliatory revocation of security clearances for covered government employee whistleblowers. Section 602 of Title VI protects government employee whistleblowers from retaliatory revocation of security clearances for making lawful disclosures. It includes provisions for appeal policies and procedures, allowing whistleblowers to retain their employment status pending appeal. The section does not allow for judicial review or a private right of action. ICD-120 provides implementing guidance for PPD-19, offering protections against reprisal for IC employees making protected disclosures. It excludes members of the Armed Forces and contractors. ICD-120 provisions provide protections against reprisal for IC employees making protected disclosures, including safeguards for whistleblowers' eligibility for classified information access. It mandates review processes for security clearance decisions and allows appeals for reprisal claims. Section 1034 of Title 10 U.S. Code also protects members of the Armed Forces from retaliatory personnel actions for lawful communications. The Office of the DNI has exhausted internal review processes and requested an External Review Panel chaired by the IGIC for whistleblower protections. Section 1034 of Title 10 U.S. Code protects Armed Forces members from retaliatory actions for lawful communications, allowing communication with various entities and participation in investigations involving Congress or an Inspector General. The curr_chunk discusses the protection of Armed Forces members from retaliatory actions for lawful communications, enabling them to communicate with various entities and participate in investigations involving Congress or an Inspector General. It also specifies prohibited personnel actions in reprisal for protected communication and requires the DOD Inspector General to prescribe uniform standards for investigations. The curr_chunk discusses inconsistencies in whistleblower protection for contractors in the intelligence community. Efforts have been made in Congress to address this gap, including the passage of P.L. 115-118 in 2018. Senator McCaskill introduced S. 2002 to provide protections for IC employees, but no further action was taken. Senator McCaskill introduced S. 2002 and S. 794 to provide protections for IC employees, but no further action was taken. P.L. 115-118, passed in 2018, addressed inconsistencies in whistleblower protection for contractors in the intelligence community. Section 110 of P.L. 115-118 amended existing whistleblower protections to enable Intelligence Community (IC) contractors to make lawful disclosures to the head of the contracting agency, appropriate inspector general, DNI, IGIC, and congressional intelligence committees. These protections are similar to those for IC employees under Title VI of the IAA for FY2014, providing unambiguous protections against retaliatory personnel actions. Section 110 of P.L. 115-118 amended whistleblower protections for Intelligence Community (IC) contractors, allowing them to make lawful disclosures to various entities. These protections extend to contractors of the FBI, including the IC element of FBI, similar to protections for IC employees and contractors under Title 50, U.S. Code. The provisions include safeguards against retaliatory personnel actions for lawful complaints related to violations of federal laws, gross mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or danger to public health or safety. Section 110 of P.L. 115-118 amended whistleblower protections for Intelligence Community (IC) contractors, allowing them to make lawful disclosures regarding violations of federal laws, gross mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or danger to public health or safety. This includes contractors of the FBI, with similar protections as IC employees and contractors under Title 50, U.S. Code. Additionally, H.Amdt. 894 of the 113th Congress redirected $2 million to fund the IC Whistleblower and Source Protection Directorate within the OIGIC, enhancing the ability to investigate fraud, waste, and abuse. The funds allocated to the Intelligence Community Management Account were intended to enhance the IGIC's ability to investigate fraud, waste, and abuse by hiring investigators and support staff. While not specifically protecting whistleblowers, the measure aimed to address a previously underfunded capability for responsive follow-up on whistleblower complaints."
