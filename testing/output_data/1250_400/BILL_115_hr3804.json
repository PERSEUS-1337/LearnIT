    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Safe Communities Act of 2017\" and includes findings. The Congress finds that land use and public facility planning lack adequate resources to address natural and human-caused disasters, leading to costly relief programs and security measures. It is important for the Federal Government and State governments to support incorporating disaster mitigation and emergency preparedness into comprehensive land use planning. Disaster response efforts impose significant costs on taxpayers, with a focus on post-disaster recovery rather than prevention. Disaster planning should be integrated into land use planning and urban development with support from the Federal Government and State governments. Emphasis should be placed on proactive mitigation strategies to prevent property damage and human casualties. Comprehensive planning should incorporate various practices to reduce risks from natural disasters and terrorist acts, with a focus on prevention rather than just response and recovery. The Federal Government and States should create a supportive environment for comprehensive planning. Comprehensive planning integrates various practices to reduce risks from natural disasters and terrorist acts. States are updating land use statutes to support safe communities. Efforts to coordinate investments at the State level are necessary for local plans. Urban planning considers the relationship between land use, transportation, and critical infrastructure for safe communities. Local governments should prioritize safety integration. Comprehensive urban planning integrates land use, transportation systems, water facilities, and open space to promote safe and economically viable communities. Safety considerations should be integrated into planning efforts, ensuring a broad range of safe housing options. Prevailing land use patterns often put people and environmental systems at risk, especially in poorly regulated rural communities and small towns facing significant growth pressures. The Federal and State governments should support Tribal governments and Native Hawaiian organizations in implementing land use planning and community development to enhance safety and socioeconomic conditions for Indian Tribes and Native Hawaiians. SEC. 3. SAFE COMMUNITIES PLANNING GRANTS. The Secretary of Homeland Security will establish a grant program to assist States and local governments in developing or revising land use planning statutes and comprehensive planning documents to mitigate natural and human-caused hazards, including acts of terror. This includes creating or revising State and local land use plans that incorporate risk reduction and hazard mitigation, as well as developing plans for multi-State regions. To be eligible for a grant under the program, a State or local planning director must submit an application demonstrating that their land use planning goals align with guidelines such as citizen engagement and multi-jurisdictional cooperation in the planning process. The land use planning process requires citizen engagement, multi-jurisdictional cooperation, and multi-agency coordination. Implementation elements include a timetable for action and defining roles and responsibilities. The implementation elements of land use plans include a timetable for action, defining roles and responsibilities, and ensuring consistency with capital budget objectives. Comprehensive planning encourages incorporating risk assessment and mitigation into comprehensive plans, urban design guidelines, building codes, and transportation plans. Grant funds received by a State or local government under subsection (a) shall be used for developing comprehensive land use plans, integrating natural hazard mitigation and security plan elements, assessing critical public infrastructure, and mapping for land use and community development. The grant funds received by a State or local government are used for various purposes such as developing land use plans, integrating hazard mitigation and security elements, assessing public infrastructure, developing geographical information systems, acquiring scenario planning technology, updating building codes and zoning regulations, implementing CPTED initiatives, assessing risk and vulnerability, and incorporating security elements in transportation plans. Implementing CPTED initiatives, assessing risk and vulnerability related to land use, incorporating mitigation and security elements in transportation plans, facilities, and operations, integrating regional security plans with transportation or land use plans, encouraging interagency cooperation, identifying natural hazard areas for comprehensive plans, land use regulations, zoning, and building codes. Grant amount not to exceed $1,125,000 with a Federal share not exceeding 90 percent, or increased for Tribal governments. The Secretary may increase the Federal share for Tribal governments or Native Hawaiian organizations if they lack funds for a project. The Inspector General will audit grants to ensure funds are used as specified. Federal land management agencies are encouraged to coordinate with State or local planning directors for land use planning. The Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security conducts audits on grants to ensure funds are used as specified. Audit results are considered for future grant awards. Definitions for \"land use planning legislation\" and \"comprehensive plan\" are provided in this section. Land use planning legislation is a government's regulatory framework for managing land, resources, and development practices. A comprehensive plan is a binding or non-binding document that guides future land use and urban development. The term \"State\" includes 50 states, territories, tribal governments, and Native Hawaiian organizations. The term \"Tribal government\" refers to a government entity in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, as well as a Native Hawaiian organization. State planning director and local planning director are officials responsible for drafting and updating land use regulations at the state and local levels, respectively. The term \"director\" refers to a local official responsible for drafting and updating local comprehensive plans or guidance documents regulating land use. \"Tribal government\" refers to the government of an Indian Tribe as defined in the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. SEC. 4. SAFE COMMUNITIES PLANNING RESEARCH. The Secretary of Homeland Security, along with various partners, will conduct research on best practices in land use and community planning to reduce threats from natural hazards and terrorism. This includes integrating federal facility security with local plans, assessing the impact of security strategies on the community, and using mapping and risk assessment tools. A report on community security and safety planning will be submitted to Congress within 2 years. The Secretary will report to Congress on best practices in community security and safety planning, including evaluations of land use codes, software tools for safe development, security design standards for residential development, and safety integration into infrastructure planning. The Secretary will evaluate best practices for incorporating safety and security into infrastructure planning, considering regional, State, and local differences, and assessing practices in terms of risk reduction and cost. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2019 through 2023 totaling $57,250,000, with $56,250,000 allocated for grants under section 3 and $300,000 for section 4 implementation."
