    "content": "The Act titled \"Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011\" is cited as the short title. The findings section follows. Congress finds that lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death, with a high incidence and low survival rate compared to other types of cancer. The disease is projected to increase significantly, especially among minority communities. The 5-year survival rates for lung cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and colon cancer are 15%, 89%, 99%, and 65% respectively. Despite being the leading cause of cancer deaths, lung cancer receives the least funding for research. Radon is identified as the second leading cause of lung cancer after smoking. Lung cancer, the most stigmatized cancer, is not only linked to smoking but also to radon and other environmental contaminants. Genetic and hormonal factors may also play a role. Nearly 20% of lung cancer patients never smoked, and 60% are former smokers. It is the sixth leading cause of cancer death in non-smokers, with a higher prevalence in women. It is the leading cause of cancer death across all ethnic groups. (10) Lung cancer in non-smokers, particularly women, is the sixth leading cause of cancer death. (11) It is the leading cause of cancer death in all ethnic groups, with a disproportionate impact on African-American males. (12) Military personnel and workers exposed to carcinogens have an increased risk of lung cancer. (13) Only 16% of lung cancer cases are diagnosed early, with no specific targets for early detection or treatment. (14) Actuarial analysis by Milliman Inc. was conducted. Only 16% of lung cancer cases are diagnosed early, with no specific targets for early detection or treatment. Actuarial analysis by Milliman Inc. in 2009 suggested that early detection could save over 70,000 lives annually in the US. A National Cancer Institute study projected a significant reduction in the economic burden of lung cancer with a 4% annual decline in mortality. The National Lung Screening Trial in 2010 compared low-dose CT scans to standard chest x-rays for lung cancer mortality. The National Cancer Institute's 2010 study compared low-dose CT scans to standard chest x-rays for lung cancer mortality, showing a 20% decrease in lung cancer deaths among those screened with CT scans. The Congress emphasizes the need for a national public health priority to reduce lung cancer mortality and calls for a comprehensive program coordinated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. This program aims to address all aspects of lung cancer and reduce mortality among current smokers, former smokers, and non-smokers. Additionally, a new Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Program is added to the Public Health Service Act. The Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011 mandates a program to reduce lung cancer mortality by 50% by 2020. The program involves collaboration with various health agencies and prioritizes research grants from the National Cancer Institute. The Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011 mandates a program to reduce lung cancer mortality by 50% by 2020. This includes strategic review and prioritization of research grants by the National Cancer Institute, funding for research programs on predispositions to lung cancer, interrelationships with other diseases, and development of screening and treatment innovations. The Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011 mandates funding for research programs to reduce lung cancer mortality, including developing screening and treatment innovations, collaborating on prevention and disease management research, and addressing the impact of lung cancer on minority populations. The Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011 mandates funding for research programs to reduce lung cancer mortality, including collaborating on prevention, early detection, and disease management research, establishing quality standards for computed tomography screening, and conducting compliance surveys for accuracy performance. The Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011 mandates funding for research programs to reduce lung cancer mortality, including establishing quality standards for computed tomography screening, conducting compliance surveys for accuracy performance, and providing funds for early detection services for high-risk populations. The Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011 mandates research on environmental contaminants linked to lung cancer in the workplace, implementing risk reduction measures, and early detection programs. It also requires State plans to include lung cancer mortality reduction measures, reviews on early detection methods, and coordination of programs within the Department of Health and Human Services to address disparities. The Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011 mandates research on environmental contaminants linked to lung cancer in the workplace, risk reduction measures, early detection programs, State plans, and coordination of programs within the Department of Health and Human Services to address disparities among women, minorities, rural, and underserved populations. The Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011 mandates coordination between the Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs, and Department of Health and Human Services for programs addressing lung cancer in military personnel and veterans. This includes a screening demonstration project and coordinated care programs for those diagnosed with lung cancer. The Congress supports a national lung cancer screening project to assess public health needs and develop an effective process. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a Lung Cancer Computed Tomography Screening and Treatment Demonstration Project within a year, in collaboration with various agencies and experts. The Lung Cancer Computed Tomography Screening and Treatment Demonstration Project will be established by the Secretary of Health and Human Services in collaboration with various agencies. The project aims to identify optimal risk populations for screening, develop effective and cost-efficient screening processes, ensure quality control, and integrate health information technology into the healthcare system. Selected centers will participate in the project. The Secretary will select various healthcare centers to carry out a demonstration project for computed tomography screening for lung cancer. Quality standards and guidelines will be established for licensing facilities conducting the screening to ensure equipment reliability and accuracy. The Secretary will conduct a 5-year demonstration project for computed tomography screening for lung cancer at selected healthcare facilities. Quality assurance and control programs will be established to ensure equipment reliability and accuracy, with standards set for radiation dose levels. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress on the project cost and provide annual progress reports. The Lung Cancer Advisory Board will monitor programs established under the Act, provide annual reports to Congress, and be composed of various government officials and representatives from different fields related to lung cancer. Authorization of appropriations is granted for fiscal years 2012 through 2016 to carry out the Act and its amendments."
