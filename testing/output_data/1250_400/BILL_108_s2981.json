    "content": "The Act titled \"Conventional Arms Threat Reduction Act of 2004\" is cited as the short title. The findings and sense of Congress are outlined in the following sections. Congress finds that the global proliferation of MANPADS, small arms, and tactical missile systems poses a direct threat to national security. The use of these weapons by terrorists hinders peace efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the spread of tactical missile systems threatens international peace. The Government Accountability Office estimates there are 500,000 to 750,000 MANPADS worldwide, and many countries no longer need these weapons for security but lack the means to dispose of them. Many countries have surplus conventional weapons and tactical missile systems that they no longer need for security but lack the means to eliminate or secure them. The US lacks a specific program to address this issue, and the Department of State has not used funds for eliminating tactical missile systems since 2002. Congress believes the US should assist countries in securing or eliminating these weapons to prevent proliferation and combat terrorism. The United States should provide assistance to countries in securing or eliminating stocks of MANPADS, conventional weapons, and tactical missile systems to prevent proliferation and combat terrorism. The United States policy is to help other countries safeguard or eliminate stocks of MANPADS, conventional weapons, and tactical missile systems that pose a proliferation threat. This is part of a global program to address arms proliferation. The Secretary of State is authorized to implement a global program to secure, remove, or eliminate stocks of MANPADS, conventional weapons, and tactical missile systems that pose a proliferation threat. The program may include activities such as humanitarian demining, destruction of small arms and light weapons, and assistance in safe handling and storage of these weapons. Cooperation with international organizations like NATO is also part of the program. The program authorized by the Secretary of State includes cooperative efforts with international organizations to assist countries in handling and eliminating MANPADS, conventional weapons, and tactical missile systems. Funds are utilized for the elimination and safeguarding of these weapons, as well as for managing them at secure locations. Actions are taken to ensure that equipment and funds are used for authorized purposes and to address proliferation threats. SEC. 5. OFFICE OF CONVENTIONAL ARMS THREAT REDUCTION. An Office of Conventional Arms Threat Reduction is established within the Department of State to formulate policy and administer programs for conventional arms threat reduction. SEC. 6. REPORT ON CONVENTIONAL ARMS THREAT REDUCTION. The Secretary of State must submit a report on conventional arms threat reduction to congressional committees within 180 days of this Act. The report includes details on past State Department efforts, progress of the Office of Conventional Arms Threat Reduction, and a country-by-country strategy for eliminating or safeguarding weapons. The report required under this Act must include a prioritization of elimination and safeguarding efforts for tactical missile systems, an evaluation of integration with other US programs, and a description of US programs related to eliminating such systems. The report will be unclassified but may have a classified annex. SEC. 7. Authorization of Appropriations: $50,000,000 authorized for the President in fiscal year 2005 under this Act, with a limitation of $10,000,000 until the Secretary of State submits a required report. The Act defines \"appropriate congressional committees\" as specific Senate and House committees. It also defines the \"Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund\" and \"small arms and light weapons\" in detail. The curr_chunk mentions various weapons such as recoilless rifles, portable missiles, rocket systems, mortars, ammunition, grenades, landmines, and explosives."
