    "content": "Both chambers of Congress passed legislation to reauthorize FDA programs and expand its authority for medical product safety. The bills, S. 1082 and H.R. 2900, renew key user fee programs set to expire, with FDA urging completion before layoffs become necessary. FDA has used reserve funds to delay layoff notifications. Congress is urged to reauthorize FDA programs before August 1, 2007 to avoid layoffs. FDA has used reserve funds to delay layoff notifications, causing a hiring freeze. The bills also reauthorize other authorities related to pediatric pharmaceuticals. FDA regulates the safety of human foods, animal feeds, cosmetics, and drugs. The FDA, under the Equity Act, regulates the safety of human foods, animal feeds, cosmetics, drugs, and medical devices. Products must undergo premarket approval for effectiveness, with postmarket surveillance. FDA can withdraw unsafe products from commerce. Congressional concerns about FDA's performance and funding have been raised due to media coverage of safety issues with food, drugs, and medical devices. The FDA has the authority to withdraw unsafe products from the market. Congressional attention has been drawn to FDA's performance and funding due to media coverage of safety issues with food, drugs, and medical devices. Congress has authorized FDA to collect user fees from manufacturers to speed up product approval processes. The FDA collects user fees from manufacturers to speed up product approval processes and ensure product safety. Efforts to reauthorize user fee authorities are underway, with PDUFA and MDUFMA generating a significant portion of FDA's revenue. PDUFA and MDUFMA account for 87% of FDA's user fee revenue and 19% of its total program budget in FY2008. PDUFA, enacted in 1992, allows FDA to collect fees for drug and biological product reviews. MDUFMA, established in 2002, collects fees for medical device applications and sets performance goals for premarket reviews. The expiring authorities in MDUFMA relate to user fees and performance goals. MDUFMA, like PDUFA, set performance goals for premarket device reviews and allowed third-party inspections. It introduced new regulations for reprocessed single-use devices. The expiring authorities in MDUFMA are related to user fees and performance goals. BPCA and PREA were enacted to encourage pediatric drug research by offering marketing exclusivity incentives and requirements. The BPCA and PREA laws provide incentives for studying pediatric drug use and require postmarket studies. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 offer incentives for creating pediatric medical devices and give FDA authority to mandate postmarket studies for approved devices. Developing medical devices for children is challenging due to lower demand and unique physical attributes, activities, and environmental influences compared to adults. The need for pediatric medical devices is emphasized in S. 1082 and H.R. 2900, with provisions for incentives and postmarket studies to ensure efficacy and safety. FDA's system for collecting data on marketed products is strengthened to identify adverse effects that may not be apparent during premarket clinical trials. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 include provisions to strengthen FDA's data collection system for identifying adverse effects of drugs, especially those that may not have been disclosed in clinical trials. There is a focus on the need for public access to negative trial results to ensure the safety and effectiveness of FDA-approved biomedical products. In 2004, concerns were raised about the safety and effectiveness of FDA-approved biomedical products with undisclosed negative trial results. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 address public access to clinical trial registration and results. FDA advisory committees provide independent advice on drugs, devices, and food, but conflicts of interest may compromise credibility. Reports in 2006 and 2007 suggested bias towards drug approval and conflicts of interest among committee members. In 2006 and 2007, reports highlighted bias and conflicts of interest among FDA advisory committee members regarding drug approval. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to address conflicts of interest in advisory committees and modernize scientific tools for evaluating medical products. The proposed creation of a Reagan-Udall Foundation aims to modernize scientific tools for evaluating medical products and address conflicts of interest in FDA advisory committees. The high cost of prescription drugs in the US has led some consumers to seek medications from foreign sources, but strict regulations by the FDA limit drug importation to only manufacturers. Lawmakers are exploring ways to allow access to lower-priced medications while ensuring safety standards are met. The FDA regulates drug importation to ensure safety, but some lawmakers are exploring ways to allow access to lower-priced medications from foreign sources. The FDA also oversees food safety, with recent outbreaks of foodborne illness prompting congressional attention. The FDA is addressing food safety issues in response to recent outbreaks of foodborne illness, prompting congressional attention. S. 1082 and two FDA reauthorization bills are tackling various aspects of food safety reform and FDA programs. Topics include prescription drug user fees, medical device user fees, drug safety, importation of prescription drugs, and miscellaneous provisions. The FDA's authority to collect user fees under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) will expire on October 1, 2007, unless Congress reauthorizes the program. PDUFA, enacted in 1992, provides FDA with fees from pharmaceutical manufacturers to expedite the review process for new products. This collaboration has led to decreased application review times. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) was enacted in 1992 to expedite the review process for new products by collecting fees from pharmaceutical manufacturers. PDUFA restricted the use of funds to new product review and established performance goals for review times. Reauthorizations in 1997 and 2002 allowed limited use of fees for postmarket drug safety activities. Discussions for a 2007 reauthorization focused on postmarket drug safety, with bills including fees for application, establishment, and product fees for both prescription and nonprescription drugs. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 focus on reauthorizing the Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments of 2007, including fees for application, establishment, and product fees for prescription and nonprescription drugs. The bills aim to enhance postmarket drug safety activities by improving adverse event data collection systems and analytical tools. Both Senate and House bills increase requirements for adverse event reporting to the HHS Secretary and the public, with fee revenues set at $393 million annually. Adjustments are made for inflation, workload, and rent-related costs. The House bills propose establishing fee revenues of $393 million annually with adjustments for inflation, workload, and rent-related costs. They would exempt orphan drugs marketed by companies with less than $100 million in revenue from certain fees. Additionally, a new section would authorize fees for advisory review of drug advertisements. The Senate bill would codify core elements of the prescription drug user fee program. The Senate bill would establish new fees for drug reviews, including an advisory review fee and an operating reserve fee. It would require annual reports to Congress and consultation with various stakeholders for PDUFA reauthorization. Public hearings and reviews would be mandated for setting performance goals, with a summary of public comments included in the submission to Congress. The House bill would have similar reauthorization and reporting requirements. The House bill, like the Senate bill, would require public hearings and reviews for setting performance goals in the medical device industry. It also mandates the Secretary to include a summary of public comments in the submission to Congress. Additionally, the House bill requires the Secretary to make minutes of agency negotiations publicly available before presenting recommendations to Congress. The Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002 (MDUFMA) amended the FFDCA to establish user fees for premarket reviews of devices, allow inspections by accredited third parties, and institute new regulatory requirements for reprocessed single-use devices. FDA's authority to collect user fees will expire on October 1, 2007, unless reauthorized by Congress. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose reauthorization through FY2012, with provisions to lower fee amounts for FY2008 and increase by 8.5% per year through FY2012. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose reauthorizing FDA's authority to collect user fees for medical devices through FY2012. The bills include provisions to lower fee amounts for FY2008, with an 8.5% annual increase through FY2012. They also introduce new types of fees and exemptions for government entities. Additionally, both bills extend the requirement for a minimum amount of medical device-related appropriations to be met in order for the Secretary to assess fees and meet performance goals. The bills propose changes to the requirements for medical device-related appropriations and fee assessments from FY2007 to FY2012. They would amend provisions on fee collection and authorize specific sums for postmarket safety information review. Additionally, they would adjust premarket notification fees and address reduced or refunded fees. The bills propose changes to medical device-related appropriations and fee assessments from FY2007 to FY2012. They would adjust premarket notification fees, reduce fees for small businesses, and specify a new refund policy for withdrawn applications. Both bills require annual reports, with H.R. 2900 focusing on postmarket safety activities and S. 1082 on previous cohorts of medical device applications. Both H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 require the Secretary to file annual reports through FY2012. H.R. 2900 focuses on postmarket safety activities, while S. 1082 includes information on previous cohorts of medical device applications and requires the reports to be made public. Both bills also mandate FDA to consult with various groups, publish recommendations, provide a public comment period, and hold a public meeting. H.R. 2900's user fee provisions take effect upon enactment, while S. 1082's provisions become effective on October 1, 2007. H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 would amend the FFDCA with user fee provisions, effective upon enactment and on October 1, 2007 respectively. Both bills extend third-party review authority and revise inspection requirements for medical devices. H.R. 2900 includes a study on nosocomial infections, while S. 1082 focuses on public reports and international quality systems standards. The bills H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 aim to streamline the process for medical device companies to qualify for FDA programs by reducing administrative requirements and expanding participation. They also allow device companies to submit reports by third parties on conformance with international quality standards. Both bills would restrict the registration period for device producers to between October 1 and December 31 of each year and require electronic filing as a default. FDA has approved many products for adult use. The Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) incentivizes drug manufacturers to conduct pediatric studies on their patented products to ensure safety and a  FDA has approved many products for adult use, leading to off-label prescribing for children which can result in ineffective treatment or adverse effects unique to children. The Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) incentivizes drug manufacturers to conduct pediatric studies on their patented products. It provides incentives for conducting pediatric studies and reauthorizes exclusivity provisions for another five years. The Act also mandates the listing of off-patent products needing pediatric studies for safety and effectiveness assessment. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) incentivizes pediatric studies on patented drugs. FDA can refer manufacturers who decline pediatric studies to the Foundation for the NIH. The Pediatric Rule in 1998 required pediatric testing data for new drug applications. The Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 (PREA) gave FDA authority for pediatric assessments. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 would reauthorize BPCA for five years. The BPCA incentivizes pediatric studies on patented drugs, while the PREA gives FDA authority for pediatric assessments of new drugs and biologics. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 would reauthorize BPCA for another five years, with key differences in exclusivity periods and FDA's authority under PREA. Title IV of the legislation would expand FDA's authority under PREA by strengthening standards for pediatric assessments of new drugs and biologics. H.R. 2900 would eliminate the tie between PREA's authorities and BPCA authorization, while S. 1082 would maintain that connection. Both bills also include provisions to encourage medical device manufacturers to develop pediatric products, such as the Pediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act of 2007, which modifies the humanitarian device exemption to waive certain application fees for devices aimed at small patient populations. The legislation allows manufacturers to market medical devices for small patient populations without proving effectiveness, aiming to assist patients with rare diseases. The bills extend the exemption through 2012 and 2013, with provisions for funding research on pediatric medical devices. Both H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 aim to extend the exemption for marketing medical devices for small patient populations through 2012 and 2013. They also require funding for research on pediatric medical devices, including establishing a contact point for developers and a demonstration project to promote device development. Grant funds would be used to connect innovators with manufacturers, manage the development process, and provide business assistance. Both bills emphasize coordination with NIH and FDA, with S. 1082 additionally requiring grantees to report annually on effectiveness and impact. Both H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 focus on extending the exemption for marketing medical devices for small patient populations and funding research on pediatric medical devices. They require coordination with NIH and FDA, with S. 1082 also mandating grantees to report annually on effectiveness and impact. Both bills authorize $6 million for demonstration grants and expand the focus of the Office of Pediatric Therapeutics to include pediatric medical devices. Additionally, they amend the FFDCA to incorporate postmarket surveillance measures for pediatric medical devices. The Secretary's authority under H.R. 2900 allows for postmarket studies to be required for pediatric medical devices with safety controls. These studies may exceed the 36-month limitation to assess the impact on pediatric populations' growth and development. H.R. 2900 also includes a dispute resolution provision for manufacturers. Since 1938, new drugs have had to demonstrate safety before FDA approval, with effectiveness added in 1962. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992 maintained focus on premarket review. The FDA requires new drugs to demonstrate safety and effectiveness before approval for marketing in the United States. However, rare adverse effects may not be recognized until a large number of individuals have taken the drug. The FDA cannot guarantee complete safety of any drug but assesses if it is safe enough for its intended use. Recent research has shown that some widely used drugs were more dangerous than expected, raising concerns about industry transparency and FDA's ability to identify and address risks. In recent years, concerns have been raised about the safety of some widely used drugs, leading to questions about industry transparency and the FDA's ability to address risks. The FDA asked the Institute of Medicine to examine its handling of drug safety, resulting in a 2006 report that addressed organizational culture, science, regulation, communication, and resources. Legislation such as S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to enhance the FDA's ability to identify and correct postmarket drug safety concerns. The Senate and House bills, S. 1082 and H.R. 2900, propose new authorities for the FDA to address postmarket drug safety concerns. They would establish public-private partnerships to develop a risk identification system and require sponsors to submit a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for drug applications. This aims to strengthen FDA's postmarket safety activities by expanding its authority to require postmarket studies. The Senate and House bills propose strengthened FDA authority for postmarket safety activities, including the requirement for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for drug applications. The bills differ on the criteria for when a REMS is necessary, with the House bill focusing on pre-approval benefits outweighing risks, while the Senate bill requires a REMS based on a serious risk signal. The Senate bill requires a postmarket study or clinical trial based on a serious risk signal for a drug, necessitating a REMS to assess or mitigate the risk. REMS would include core elements like timeframes, patient instructions, and distribution restrictions. A waiver for REMS restrictions is allowed for medical countermeasures during public health emergencies. The bill also ensures access to drugs with REMS for off-label use in serious conditions. The proposed REMS process adds structured follow-through, dispute resolution, and enforcement authority. The Senate bill proposes creating a mechanism to ensure access to drugs with REMS for off-label use in serious conditions. It includes elements for structured follow-through, dispute resolution, and enforcement. Both the Senate and House bills establish a Drug Safety Oversight Board and require reviews of approved REMS at specified times. The bills also authorize the Secretary to evaluate whether REMS elements assure safe use of a drug and do not limit patient access. The bills propose the Secretary and Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee evaluate REMS elements for drug safety and patient access. They differ on criteria for postapproval studies. The Senate bill requires assessment of serious risks and unexpected risks, while the House bill authorizes postapproval studies based on scientific information. The Senate bill authorizes the Secretary to require postapproval studies to assess known risks or signals of serious risk, with a multi-level process for labeling changes and dispute resolution. The House bill allows the Secretary to order labeling changes based on new safety information and requires submission of certain advertisements for review before dissemination. Both the House and Senate bills authorize the Secretary to order labeling changes based on new safety information and require submission of certain advertisements for review before dissemination. They also include provisions for civil monetary penalties for violations, with fines of up to $250,000 per violation and up to $1 million for violations adjudicated in a single proceeding. The House bill includes additional civil penalties for violations that continue after notice from the Secretary. Both bills would give the FDA new enforcement tools, authorizing fines of up to $250,000 per violation, with additional penalties for continuing violations. The Secretary could fine sponsors up to $1 million per day for violations posing a public health threat. Non-compliant drugs could be considered misbranded, and marketing products with REMS not in compliance would be prohibited. Separate civil penalty authority would be established for false or misleading direct-to-consumer ads, with fines ranging from $250,000 to $500,000 for violations. The Senate and House bills propose fines for violations related to false or misleading direct-to-consumer ads for prescription drugs. The House bill suggests fines of up to $250,000 for a first violation and up to $500,000 for subsequent violations, while the Senate bill proposes lower fines of up to $150,000 for a first violation and up to $300,000 for subsequent violations. Both bills also authorize increased appropriations for drug safety provisions, with the Senate bill allocating $225 million over FYs 2008 through 2012 and the House bill authorizing $125 million over a five-year period. Additionally, the House bill requires guidance for clinical trials of antibiotic drugs. The House bill would increase revenue under PDUFA by $225 million over FYs 2008-2012 for drug safety activities. It authorizes $125 million over five years and requires guidance for antibiotic drug trials. It also allocates $30 million annually for orphan drug development. The Senate bill designates antibiotics as orphan products, authorizing $35 million annually. It includes provisions for antibiotic access and innovation, such as extended marketing exclusivity. Additionally, it mandates standardized packaging for prescription drugs with counterfeit-resistant technologies. The Senate bill mandates standardized packaging for prescription drugs with counterfeit-resistant technologies and includes provisions for extended marketing exclusivity for certain antibiotics.

Additionally, it requires DTC ads to include a statement encouraging reporting of adverse effects to the FDA. The Senate bill includes provisions for drug safety, such as establishing an Advisory Committee on Risk Communication and requiring state-legalized medical marijuana to adhere to FDA regulations. It also introduces a priority review voucher for neglected or tropical disease products and mandates the publication of authorized generic drugs on the FDA website. Additionally, it sets up a procedure to prevent certain citizen petitions from delaying agency decisions. The FDA Commissioner would create a list of authorized generic drugs and prevent certain citizen petitions from delaying agency decisions. Federal registration requirements for clinical trials were established by the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose expanding the types of trials and information in the registry, as well as requiring the publication of clinical trial results. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose expanding clinical trial registration to include most trials involving drugs, devices, and biologics, including international trials seeking FDA approval. H.R. 2900 delays public release of medical device information until FDA approval, while S. 1082 exempts pediatric postmarket surveillance trials from registration. Both bills link requirements to trial completion dates. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose expanding clinical trial registration to include various trials involving drugs, devices, and biologics. H.R. 2900 delays the release of medical device information until FDA approval, while S. 1082 exempts pediatric postmarket surveillance trials from registration.

Both H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 propose expanding clinical trial registration to include various trials involving drugs, devices, and biologics. H.R. 2900 requires additional elements such as disclosure of agreements restricting non-employees from discussing trial results, while S. 1082 specifies more criteria for the registry to be searchable, including the age group studied in the trial. Both bills have provisions for establishing a public database containing clinical trial results. Both H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 propose expanding clinical trial registration to include various trials involving drugs, devices, and biologics. H.R. 2900 provides specific instructions for creating a results database, while S. 1082 requires the Secretary to establish a database based on NIH Director recommendations. H.R. 2900 specifies searchable categories, timing of submissions, and truthfulness of information. A requirement for non-promotional results summaries was replaced with a Comptroller General study on promotional information. H.R. 2900 mandates public posting of pre-approval study results within 30 days. The requirement for non-promotional results summaries was removed from an earlier draft of the bill, replaced by a Comptroller General study on promotional information. H.R. 2900 mandates public posting of pre-approval study results within 30 days, including for devices with pending FDA action. A provision allows for a posting delay of up to two years for studies on new uses of drugs or devices if a filing with FDA for a new use is imminent. Both bills include coordination, compliance, and enforcement provisions. The bills H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 include provisions for coordination, compliance, and enforcement related to registry and results database requirements. H.R. 2900 contains enforcement provisions for results database requirements and coordination between registry and results database, while S. 1082 requires FDA applications to certify registry requirement compliance. One controversial provision dropped from H.R. 2900 would have allowed causes of action for damages under state law. The bills H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 include provisions for enforcement of registry requirements. H.R. 2900 specifies penalties for noncompliance, while S. 1082 allows penalties for violations and subsequent violations. Both bills address conflicts of interest in FDA advisory committees. The bills H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 propose penalties for noncompliance with registry requirements, with fines of up to $10,000 for first violations and $20,000 for subsequent violations. They also address conflicts of interest in FDA advisory committees, aiming to change the process of recruiting committee members and disclosure of conflicts. The bills S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose changes to FDA advisory committees, affecting the recruitment process and conflict-of-interest waivers. The new provisions expand requirements to all advisory committees, defining financial interests and outlining circumstances for conflict-of-interest waivers. The bills S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose changes to FDA advisory committees, affecting recruitment processes and conflict-of-interest waivers. The new provisions expand requirements to all advisory committees, defining financial interests and outlining circumstances for conflict-of-interest waivers. Activities such as employment, trusteeship, or directorship are required to be disclosed, with provisions to discourage financial conflict waivers and allow non-voting guest experts with financial interests if deemed necessary by the Secretary. Full financial disclosure is required prior to meetings on related matters. The bills S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose changes to FDA advisory committees, expanding requirements for full financial disclosure and conflict-of-interest waivers. They would allow non-voting guest experts with financial interests if deemed necessary by the Secretary, preclude voting by members with conflicts of interest unless exempted, and permit waivers for essential expertise. Public disclosures for conflict-of-interest determinations, certifications, and waivers would be required, along with annual reports on advisory committee membership and conflict-of-interest waivers. Both bills mandate the review and update of FDA conflict-of-interest guidance every five years and establish a nonprofit corporation to advance FDA's mission on product development, innovation, and safety. The bills S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose changes to FDA advisory committees, expanding requirements for full financial disclosure and conflict-of-interest waivers. They would establish a nonprofit corporation to advance FDA's mission on product development, innovation, and safety, with a board including representatives from various organizations. The Foundation would coordinate with federal programs, award grants, contracts, and other agreements to advance goals, with funding from the Commissioner. The House and Senate bills propose changes to FDA advisory committees, establish a nonprofit corporation to advance FDA's mission, and create an Office of the Chief Scientist within the FDA. S. 1082 allows importation of prescription drugs and includes provisions not present in H.R. 2900. The Market Access and Drug Safety Act of 2007 would allow importation of drugs for commercial and personal use, with detailed procedures addressing safety, cost savings, and program administration. The Senate added a provision requiring certification from the HHS Secretary for implementation. Food safety is addressed in S. 1082, with regulations on pet food and animal waste standards. H.R. 2900 does not include food provisions. Title VI of S. 1082 addresses food safety by establishing regulations for pet food processing and ingredient standards, updating nutrient and ingredient information on pet food labels, creating an early warning system for adulteration and disease outbreaks, and coordinating activities to improve food safety programs for produce. The Secretary would also be required to collect and share recall information during food recalls. Title VI of S. 1082 aims to improve food safety by establishing regulations for pet food processing, creating an early warning system for adulteration and disease outbreaks, and coordinating activities to enhance food safety programs for produce. The Secretary would oversee the creation of a registry for reportable adulterated food, review and validate information before listing it, and issue alerts to the public for problematic food items. Responsible parties would be required to maintain records and report to the FDA in cases of adulteration. The bill would require the responsible party or importer of an adulterated food to maintain records and report to the FDA once adulteration is determined. The Secretary would also need to establish regulations for reporting suspected adulteration and notify the Department of Homeland Security in cases of deliberate adulteration. Additionally, the bill mandates an annual report to Congress on food imports, inspectors, violations, and enforcement actions. The provisions do not affect the regulation of dietary supplements. S. 1082 Title V includes provisions on various food issues such as pesticide residue monitoring, health hazards of meat preservatives, color additive program performance, risks of genetically engineered seafood, and marketing of crustaceans.
