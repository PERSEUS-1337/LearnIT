    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Alternative Energy Refueling System Act of 2006\" and pertains to alternative energy refueling systems. The Solid Waste Disposal Act is amended to include definitions for alternative energy refueling systems, which are used to refuel vehicles with various alternative fuels. Eligible entities are defined within this context. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 defines eligible entities as refueling vendors or owners/operators of facilities with alternative energy refueling systems. The Administrator will establish a reimbursement program for these entities to cover costs of purchasing and installing such systems from the Trust Fund. Eligible entities can receive reimbursement from the Trust Fund for purchasing and installing alternative energy refueling systems. An application must be submitted to the Administrator for reimbursement, and payment will be made within 30 days of verification by the Administrator and State agency. The Administrator will provide reimbursement to eligible entities within 30 days of verifying the installation and operation of an alternative energy refueling system. An entity cannot receive reimbursement if they have already received a tax credit for a qualified alternative fuel vehicle refueling property. An eligible entity cannot receive reimbursement for an alternative energy refueling system if the cost was considered in calculating a tax credit. Additionally, the entity is limited to receiving reimbursement for a maximum of 2 alternative energy refueling systems per facility. The reimbursement for alternative energy refueling systems is limited to 2 per facility owned or operated by the eligible entity. The reimbursement amount cannot exceed 30% of the system cost or $30,000. This provision does not impact other trust fund projects or activities. The Administrator shall not use Trust Fund funds obligated for other projects or activities. This does not affect an owner or operator's obligation to comply with other provisions of the subtitle."
