    "content": "Poverty rates have been rising since 2000, with only three significant declines between 2000 and 2015. Policymakers are reexamining the drivers of poverty and the effectiveness of policy responses. A diverse group of families and individuals are in poverty, with a focus on the role of work in their lives. The data shows that people in poverty are a diverse group, with a focus on the role of work in their lives. Factors like income from work, living arrangements, and other family well-being aspects influence individuals' experiences of poverty. This snapshot examines the composition of people in poverty, rather than other factors affecting family well-being. This snapshot focuses on the composition of people in poverty, looking at what groups make up the poverty population. It highlights how different demographic groups may have varying poverty rates and shares in the overall poverty population. For a more in-depth analysis of poverty rates among different groups and trends over time, readers are referred to CRS Report R44644. Poverty is a lack of resources to meet basic needs, with the official measure used by the U.S. Census Bureau being family-based. An individual's poverty status is determined by their money income compared to a dollar threshold based on family composition. The poverty status of an individual is determined by comparing their income to a dollar threshold based on family composition. The official poverty measure has limitations, such as only considering pre-tax money income and not accounting for government taxes and non-cash benefits. It also does not take assets into account, but recent changes now consider distributions from retirement savings as income. The official poverty measure looks at pre-tax money income and does not consider government taxes and non-cash benefits. It also does not include the value of assets, but recent changes now count distributions from retirement savings as income. The measure is uniform across the country and does not adjust for differences in living costs in different areas. The current definition of family does not account for modern resource-sharing arrangements like cohabiting couples. The Census Bureau has a supplemental poverty measure that considers taxes, transfers, housing costs, and uses an expanded family definition. In 2015, an estimated 43.1 million people had pre-tax money income below the poverty threshold, accounting for 13.5% of the total noninstitutionalized population. In 2015, an estimated 43.1 million people had pre-tax money income below the poverty threshold, accounting for 13.5% of the total noninstitutionalized population. Close to half of all people in poverty (45.1%) were living in deep poverty, defined as having income below 50% of the poverty threshold. The population of people living in poverty included individuals of all ages, both sexes, and various racial and ethnic groups. Figure 3 shows the composition of the population living in poverty by age group in 2015. In 2015, the population living in poverty included individuals of all ages, both sexes, and various racial and ethnic groups. Children comprised one-third of all people in poverty, with working-age adults making up the largest share. People age 65 and older accounted for 10% of those in poverty. Non-Hispanic whites were the largest racial/ethnic group among the poverty population. In 2015, the poverty population consisted of individuals of all ages and various racial/ethnic groups. Non-Hispanic whites were the largest group in poverty, followed by Hispanics and non-Hispanic African-Americans. Most minority groups were over-represented in poverty compared to their share in the total population. In 2015, minority groups were over-represented in the poverty population, including Hispanics, non-Hispanic African-Americans, American Indians, and persons of two or more races. Children in poverty were more racially diverse than adults, with Hispanic children making up a significant portion. Women were also over-represented in the poverty population compared to the overall population. In 2015, non-Hispanic white children accounted for 51.4% of the overall child population. Women slightly outnumbered men in the total population, making up 51%. However, women represented a larger share (55.9%) of the population in poverty, possibly due to heading single-parent households. Men earn more on average than women, contributing to this disparity. Poverty has different implications for children, working-age adults, and aged adults in terms of public policy considerations. Children are dependents, while working-age adults are expected to support themselves and their families. Aged adults may draw income from benefits after retiring from work. In 2015, non-Hispanic white children made up over half of the child population. Women slightly outnumbered men in the total population but represented a larger share in poverty, possibly due to heading single-parent households. Poverty has different implications for children, working-age adults, and aged adults in terms of public policy considerations. Children are dependents, while working-age adults are expected to support themselves and their families. Aged adults may draw income from benefits after retiring from work. The report separately explores poverty among children, working-age adults, and aged adults, highlighting the central role of work as the primary means of economic support. Living arrangements are also considered due to the importance of sharing resources in economic well-being. Children accounted for one-third of all people in poverty in America in 2015, despite making up less than a quarter of the total population. Children in America are disproportionately poor, with a poverty rate of 19.7% in 2015. They rely on adult caretakers for support, often from earnings. Over 90% of children lived in families with at least one adult earner, and 50.3% lived in families with two or more adult workers. Among children in the total population, over 90% lived in families with at least one adult earner, and 50.3% lived in families with two or more adult earners. Two-thirds of poor children lived in families with one or more earners, with 57.5% in families with one earner and 10.5% in families with two or more earners. The distribution of children who were poor in 2015 showed that 54.1% lived in female-headed families. In 2015, children in female-headed families made up the majority of those living in poverty, while children in married couple families accounted for one-third. Despite a low poverty rate for children in married couple families, the large population size meant a significant number of poor children lived in this family type. Married-couple families were underrepresented among children in poverty compared to the overall population. Poor children were more likely to live in larger families, which require more income to meet needs. In 2015, children in poverty were more likely to live in larger families, with 27% in families with four or more children. Working-age adults (18-64 years old) made up the majority of people in poverty, representing 56.6% of all individuals. In 2015, the majority of people in poverty in America were working-age adults (18-64 years old), representing 56.6% of all individuals. Among working-age adults who were poor, the majority did not have earnings from work, with only 38.8% working in some capacity. A small share (10.4%) worked full-time all year. When asked why they were not working, a wide range of reasons were given. In 2015, a majority of working-age adults in poverty were employed in some capacity, with only a small percentage working full-time all year. Reasons for not working included illness, caregiving, education, retirement, and job availability. Educational attainment was linked to success in the workforce, with higher credentials leading to higher earnings and more stable employment. Credentials indicating higher levels of education correlate with higher earnings and job stability. In 2015, the largest group of poor working-age adults had a high school diploma but no post-secondary credential. Even among those aged 25 to 64, high school graduates without further education remained the largest group among the poor. Family living arrangements were common among both poor and all working-age adults. Among working-age adults, those with only a high school diploma are the largest group among the poor. Family living arrangements are more prevalent in the overall population than among the poor. 41% of all working-age adults in poverty lived outside of a family, including those living alone, with cohabiting partners, or other unrelated adults/roommates. The poverty status of individuals living with others is based on each individual's income, with no pooling of income assumed in the official poverty measure. In 2015, aged adults accounted for 14.9% of the total population but only 9.7% of the population in poverty. The poverty rate among aged adults was 8.8% in 2015. Income from work plays a key role in determining the economic well-being of aged adults, with 77.0% of adults aged 65 and older not working in 2015. Income from work is crucial for the economic well-being of aged adults. Social Security, pensions, and other benefits earned from past work are common sources of income for aged individuals. However, a smaller percentage of aged adults in poverty receive these benefits compared to the overall aged population. In 2015, retirement, disability, or survivor pensions were received by the families of 48.5% of all aged persons, but only 7.7% of families of aged persons in poverty received these benefits. Earnings from current work were received by 40.7% of aged persons' families, with only 11.0% of families of aged persons in poverty receiving work-derived income. Most aged adults in the total population lived in families with income from work, either past work or current work, with a smaller percentage among aged persons in poverty. In 2015, almost three in four aged adults lived in families with income from work, including past work or current work. A significant portion of aged adults in poverty lived alone, with a lower likelihood of living in families compared to the overall aged population. The report provides basic information about the 43 million Americans below the poverty line in 2015, showing that they are a diverse group including children, working-age adults, and aged adults living alone or in families. The report in 2015 highlighted the diverse groups living below the poverty line, including children, working-age adults, and aged adults. Certain groups like women, minorities, and those living alone are over-represented in poverty. Income from work plays a central role in determining poverty status, with children relying on family members' work, working-age adults on their own work, and aged adults on past work or the work of those they live with. However, sometimes earnings from work are insufficient to prevent poverty. In 2015, the report highlighted various groups living below the poverty line, including children, working-age adults, and aged adults. Income from work is a key factor in determining poverty status, with children relying on family members' work, working-age adults on their own work, and aged adults on past work or the work of those they live with. However, sometimes earnings from work are not enough to prevent poverty."
