    "content": "The \"Commercial Fishermen Safety and Tax Fairness Act of 2000\" allows income averaging for fishermen by amending the Internal Revenue Code to include fishing business. The definition of elected farm income now includes fishing business, and a new definition for fishing business is provided as the conduct of commercial fishing as defined in the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The Commercial Fishermen Safety and Tax Fairness Act of 2000 includes a new section in the Internal Revenue Code, allowing a credit for the purchase of fishing safety equipment under SEC. 45D. The Commercial Fishermen Safety and Tax Fairness Act of 2000 introduced a new section in the Internal Revenue Code, providing a tax credit for eligible taxpayers who purchase qualified fishing safety equipment. The credit is 75% of the expenses incurred, up to a maximum of $1,500 per taxpayer. Eligible taxpayers are those engaged in a fishing business, and the equipment must meet specific safety requirements outlined in the legislation. The tax credit for fishing safety equipment applies to lifesaving equipment required on vessels under specific regulations. Special rules and aggregation rules apply, and no double benefit is allowed. The basis of the equipment is adjusted if a credit is claimed. The tax credit for fishing safety equipment allows for a basis adjustment on equipment when the credit is claimed. Additionally, there is a limitation on carrying back the credit before the effective date of the legislation. Conforming amendments are made to the general business credit section of the Internal Revenue Code. The enactment of section 45D allows for a fishing safety equipment credit under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Conforming amendments are made to the general business credit section. The amendments made by this Act, including the fishing safety equipment credit under Sec. 45D, will apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2000."
