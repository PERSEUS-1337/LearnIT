    "content": "Recent legislation has extended certain expiring provisions in the Internal Revenue Code, making some temporary provisions permanent. The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) reduced tax policy uncertainty by permanently extending most tax cuts and indexing the alternative minimum tax (AMT) for inflation. The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 retroactively extended provisions through 2014, and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 made permanent or temporarily extended all tax provisions that had expired at the end of 2014. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113) made temporary tax provisions permanent or extended them, known as \"tax extenders.\" The debate in the 114th Congress focused on whether expired tax provisions should be made permanent or temporarily extended. Making some provisions permanent reduced uncertainty in the tax code, but not all expired provisions were made permanent. In P.L. 114-113, expired tax provisions were either made permanent or temporarily extended, reducing uncertainty in the tax code. However, not all provisions were made permanent, leading to some tax extenders set to expire at the end of 2016. Debate in the 114th Congress may address whether these provisions should be extended. Additional information on specific extender provisions can be found in other CRS reports. The Consolidated Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113) contained the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (PATH Act), which extended or made permanent various tax provisions that had expired at the end of 2014. This included enhancements to child tax credit, American Opportunity Tax Credit, and earned income tax credit. Additionally, a two-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax was included. The PATH Act extended or made permanent various tax provisions that had expired at the end of 2014, including enhanced tax credits and a moratorium on the medical device excise tax. Other tax-related provisions in Division P of P.L. 114-113 included changes to high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage excise tax, extensions of tax credits for renewable power facilities, and changes to the Section 199 deduction for oil refineries. The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 extended expiring tax provisions for one year. Legislation considered in the 113th Congress proposed extensions and permanent provisions for certain tax measures. In the 113th Congress, various legislation was considered to extend or make certain expiring tax provisions permanent, including the Expiring Provisions Improvement Reform and Efficiency Act (S. 2260), Jobs for America Act (H.R. 4), and Tax Reform Act of 2014 (H.R. 1). In the 114th Congress, the House passed legislation to permanently extend certain expired provisions like the America's Small Business Tax Relief Act of 2015 (H.R. 636) and the American Research and Competitiveness Act of 2015 (H.R. 880). The Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 (S. 1946) aimed to extend various expired tax provisions for two years, including those from 2014 and one from 2013. The term \"tax extender\" is often used for packages of expiring tax provisions temporarily extended by Congress. The term \"tax extender\" is used for packages of expiring tax provisions temporarily extended by Congress. These provisions are often extended for a short period of time to evaluate their effectiveness before further extension. Temporary tax provisions may also provide relief during economic weakness or natural disasters, or for budgetary reasons. Enacting tax provisions on a temporary basis allows for evaluation of effectiveness before extension. However, the practice of regularly extending expiring provisions without systematic review undermines this rationale. The expiration date is meant to prompt policymakers to assess costs and benefits, but in reality, there is no real systematic review process in place. The practice of regularly extending expiring tax provisions without systematic review undermines the rationale of evaluating costs and benefits before extension. While most provisions have been extended in recent years, there have been exceptions like tax incentives for ethanol not extended beyond 2011 due to duplicative benefits. Congress may choose not to extend provisions if the benefits do not exceed the costs. Tax policy can be used to address temporary circumstances such as economic stimulus or disaster relief. Examples include bonus depreciation, casualty loss deductions, and grants in lieu of tax credits. Temporary provisions enacted for special economic situations should be allowed to expire once resolved. Congress may enact temporary tax policies for budgetary reasons. Tax policy can be used for temporary circumstances like economic stimulus or disaster relief, with provisions like bonus depreciation and grants in lieu of tax credits. Temporary tax cuts should expire once the situation is resolved, as it is easier to offset short-term extensions than long-term ones. The Congressional Budget Office assumes temporary tax cuts expire as scheduled, so routinely extending them would overstate projected revenues, making the long-term outlook stronger. Temporary tax benefits act as federal subsidies for eligible recipients. Tax provisions are often extended, leading the CBO baseline to overstate revenues. Temporary tax benefits act as federal subsidies, influencing economic behavior and resource allocation. Evaluating extenders involves considering economic efficiency, equity, and simplicity. Extenders can encourage more activity but may not always align with economic objectives. Temporary tax provisions may be efficient but not equitable, or vice versa. Policymakers must prioritize economic goals when deciding on extenders. Tax extenders may improve economic welfare by addressing market failures and stimulating desired activities. However, direct spending programs are often more effective at targeting resources than indirect subsidies like tax extenders. Fair taxation contributes to a socially desirable distribution of the tax burden. Extenders may not always align with economic objectives, as policymakers must prioritize goals when deciding on tax provisions. Tax extenders can lead to inequitable tax burdens as they benefit individuals with higher incomes more than those with lower incomes, reducing the progressivity of the tax system. This differential treatment deviates from the principles of horizontal and vertical equity in taxation. Tax extenders can lead to inequitable tax burdens by benefiting higher-income individuals more than lower-income individuals, reducing the progressivity of the tax system. This differential treatment deviates from the principles of horizontal and vertical equity in taxation. The tax extenders benefit higher-income individuals more than lower-income individuals, leading to inequitable tax burdens. This complexity in the tax code raises administration costs for the government and individual taxpayers, as seen in the extension of temporary tax provisions in P.L. 114-113. Most individual tax extender provisions that expired in 2014 have been extended, including deductions for classroom expenses, state and local sales taxes, tuition expenses, mortgage insurance premiums, and employer-provided mass transit benefits. These provisions have been regularly included in tax extender packages and were made permanent in P.L. 114-113. The deduction for classroom expenses, state and local sales taxes, tuition expenses, mortgage insurance premiums, and employer-provided mass transit benefits have been extended multiple times. Some business provisions that expired in 2014 include the research tax credit, rum excise tax cover-over, Work Opportunity Tax Credit, Qualified Zone Academy Bond allocation limitation, active financing exception, New Markets Tax Credit, bonus depreciation, and enhanced expensing allowances. The New Markets Tax Credit, bonus depreciation, and other business-related tax provisions expired at the end of 2014. Some provisions were made permanent in P.L. 114-113, while others were extended through 2019 or 2016. Four charitable provisions that expired in 2014 were also made permanent. The charitable provisions and energy-related tax incentives that expired at the end of 2014 were either extended through 2016 or made permanent in P.L. 114-113. The renewable energy production tax credit (PTC) was extended through 2019, with a phase-down starting in 2017. Several temporary energy-related tax provisions were first enacted in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Several energy-related tax incentives, including credits for energy efficient new homes and commercial buildings, were first enacted in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and extended through 2016. The alternative motor vehicle credit for fuel cell vehicles expired at the end of 2014, while incentives for other alternative motor vehicles expired at earlier dates. The tax credit for two-wheeled plug-in electric vehicles expired in 2013 but was extended in 2015. It was first enacted in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and extended once previously. The alternative motor vehicle credit for fuel cell vehicles and the credit for two-wheeled plug-in electric vehicles were extended through 2016. Congress regularly extends expired tax provisions, with the cost of tax extenders in one act estimated to reduce federal revenues by $628.8 billion between 2016 and 2025. The tax extenders in P.L. 114-113 made certain provisions permanent, increasing the cost compared to other proposals in the 114th Congress. The total estimated cost of extending these provisions between 2016 and 2025 is $628.8 billion, with $426.8 billion attributed to specific provisions. Permanent extensions account for $559.5 billion, with $361.4 billion associated with provisions made permanent in P.L. 114-113. The tax extenders in P.L. 114-113 cost $426.8 billion between 2016 and 2025, with $559.5 billion (89%) for permanent extensions. Provisions that expired in 2014 and made permanent in P.L. 114-113 cost $361.4 billion. A small portion, $17.7 billion, was for a two-year extension of provisions expired in 2014 through 2016. Legislation in the 114th Congress considered making certain temporary tax provisions permanent. The Senate Finance Committee's Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 would have reduced revenue by $97.1 billion between 2016 and 2025. The Senate Finance Committee reported legislation in 2015, the Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 (S. 1946), to retroactively extend expired tax provisions for two years through 2016. The JCT estimated the cost of extending these provisions at $86.6 billion over the 10-year budget window, with potential economic growth benefits. The cost estimate for S. 1946, which includes macroeconomic effects, is lower than without them. Extending all expiring tax provisions would reduce revenues by $897.9 billion over the 2016 to 2025 budget window, with specific costs for bonus depreciation and Section 179 expensing. According to CBO's estimates, extending expiring tax provisions would cost $897.9 billion over the 2016-2025 budget window. This includes costs for bonus depreciation, Section 179 expensing, and extensions to various tax credits. Most of the revenue cost is for provisions that were extended or made permanent in P.L. 114-113. CBO's revenue projections are higher than actual revenue levels, leading to smaller projected budget deficits under the current law baseline. The cost of providing a short-term extension for expiring tax provisions is less than extending them through the budget window. CBO's revenue projections are higher than actual levels, leading to smaller projected deficits. The 10-year revenue cost of extending provisions may be less than in 2015 due to tax deferrals. Bonus depreciation is an example of a timing provision with a greater short-term extension cost. The temporary extension of expiring tax provisions, such as bonus depreciation, may have a lower 10-year revenue cost compared to extending them through the budget window. Bonus depreciation, a timing provision, incurs a higher short-term cost but recovers much of it in later years. For example, the one-year extension in 2015 cost $1.2 billion over 10 years but $45.3 billion in 2015 alone. The extension through 2019 cost $11.3 billion over 10 years, with a significant cost in 2016 that is recovered in later years. Bonus depreciation shifts cost recovery forward, resulting in revenue losses in earlier years. The cost of bonus depreciation in 2016 is estimated to be $90.6 billion, with much of the revenue recovered later in the budget window. Making bonus depreciation permanent would cost $223.6 billion over 10 years. Legislation has been passed to make certain tax provisions permanent and extend others temporarily. The Senate Finance Committee reported the Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 before P.L. 114-113 was signed into law. The Senate Committee on Finance reported legislation to temporarily extend expired tax provisions, while the House considered making certain provisions permanent. The Senate Finance Committee also reported the Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 to retroactively extend expired tax provisions through 2016. Additionally, the House passed legislation to make eight temporary tax provisions permanent, including enhanced expensing allowances and expired S corporation provisions. Three expired charitable provisions were part of the America Gives More Act of 2015. The House passed legislation to make eight temporary tax provisions permanent, costing $317.5 billion over 10 years. These provisions included deductions for food inventory contributions, tax-free IRA distributions for charity, and special rules for conservation property contributions. Additionally, the American Research and Competitiveness Act aimed to make the research tax credit permanent. During the 113th and 114th Congress, various bills were considered to extend or make permanent certain tax extender provisions. The House passed legislation to make eight temporary tax provisions permanent, costing $317.5 billion over 10 years. Additionally, the Senate Finance Committee proposed a two-year extenders package, the EXPIRE Act, to extend most expiring provisions through 2015. The EXPIRE Act (S. 2260) proposed extending expiring tax provisions for two years through 2015. The House passed legislation to make nine provisions permanent, reducing revenues by $511.4 billion over 10 years. Some provisions were included in the Jobs for America Act (H.R. 4) and the America Gives More Act of 2014 (H.R. 4719). Additional international-related extender provisions were proposed to be made permanent but were not considered by the full House. Legislation during the 113th Congress aimed to make two international-related extender provisions permanent, but they were not included in the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-295). The health coverage tax credit and the credit for electric-drive motorcycles and three-wheeled vehicles were not extended in P.L. 113-295 but have been extended in subsequent legislation. The health coverage tax credit, first enacted in 2002, was modified and retroactively extended through December 31, 2019, as part of the Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-27). The termination date for certain provisions was enacted in 2011 and extended through 2019. The health coverage tax credit and incentives for electric-drive vehicles were modified and extended in subsequent legislation. Incentives for alternative technology vehicles have mostly expired, with some exceptions. Two energy-related provisions expired in 2014 and were not extended. The EXPIRE Act did not extend certain energy-related and disaster-related provisions that expired in 2014 and 2013, respectively."
