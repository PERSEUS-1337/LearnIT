A panel of banks is surveyed daily to determine rates, with averages reported at 11:30 a.m. There are separate LIBOR rates for 15 maturities and 10 currencies. In the U.S., contracts often reference the three-month dollar LIBOR, based on rates from a panel of 18 banks including Bank of America, Citibank, and JPMorgan Chase. The dollar LIBOR is based on rates from a panel of 18 banks, including Bank of America, Citibank, and JPMorgan Chase. The highest 4 and lowest 4 responses are discarded, and the middle 10 are averaged. Banks can apply to participate in the survey, and criteria such as market share and expertise are considered. Other regions have similar indexes like EURIBOR for Europe and TIBOR for Tokyo. The LIBOR index is used in various financial contracts and derivatives, serving as a benchmark for interest rates. It is also utilized by policymakers and futures exchanges. Other regions have similar indexes like EURIBOR for Europe and TIBOR for Tokyo. LIBOR is used as a benchmark in financial contracts and derivatives, futures exchanges, and by policymakers. It represents the cost of borrowing dollars by major banks globally, and lenders may choose to use it voluntarily as a reference for setting interest rates. The contract may specify that the borrower will receive a loan with an interest rate based on the LIBOR index value on the future date. Other benchmarks like U.S. Treasury yields or the Federal Funds Rate could be used, but they may have limitations due to differences in borrower type or loan maturity. The recent financial crisis highlighted that bank borrowing costs do not always align with government borrowing costs. Repurchase agreement rates in New York money markets could also be considered as an alternative benchmark. The value of loans, derivatives, and financial instruments referencing LIBOR is significant, with a large percentage of adjustable rate mortgages and municipal contracts tied to the index. While a single bank on a LIBOR reporting panel can influence the index, it may not always move it in the desired direction. A single bank on a LIBOR reporting panel can influence the index, but may not always move it in the desired direction. The dollar LIBOR calculation involves throwing out the highest and lowest responses, so a bank's response within the middle can affect the index. For example, if 4 banks report 3%, 10 banks report 8%, and 4 banks report 10%, the average would be 8%. If a bank with a 10% response wants to lower the LIBOR, it can impact the final index. In the example provided, a single bank can influence the LIBOR index by manipulating their reported interest rate. By strategically changing their bid, a bank can impact the average rate calculated, potentially shifting the index. However, there are limits to the magnitude of this effect, and in some cases, the actions of a single bank may not move the index at all. In some cases, a single bank can affect the LIBOR index by reporting false interest rates, but there are limits to the impact. Barclays admitted to submitting false survey responses to manipulate LIBOR, which is a violation of U.S. law due to its use in U.S. derivatives markets. The bank settled separately with UK officials for violating UK law. Barclays attempted to manipulate LIBOR in U.S. derivatives markets, violating U.S. law. The bank settled with UK officials for violating UK law. The settlement documents reveal employee emails showing manipulation tactics, including changing survey responses for trade positions and reputation protection, as well as attempting to influence other banks. Collusion could have a greater impact, but Barclays only attempted to reach out to other panel responders. During 2005-2007, Barclays' derivatives traders manipulated LIBOR by asking employees to submit false survey responses to benefit their trading positions. The traders' preferred LIBOR outcome changed daily, with some days preferring high rates and other days preferring low rates. This manipulation was limited in impact due to the methodology of LIBOR's calculation. Barclays' derivatives traders manipulated LIBOR by submitting false survey responses during 2005-2007. The traders' preferred outcome changed daily, with some days favoring high rates and others low rates. Barclays admitted to submitting false responses during this period. As financial turmoil increased in 2008, Barclays' management preferred lower responses to protect the firm's reputation. UK officials raised concerns about Barclays' responses being higher than others. Barclays' managers were cautious about drawing attention to the bank during financial turmoil in 2008. UK officials raised concerns about Barclays' higher LIBOR responses compared to other banks. Some Barclays employees believed UK officials wanted lower LIBOR submissions. Unlike previous years, Barclays consistently under-reported its cost of funds in 2008. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York also raised concerns with Barclays about its LIBOR responses. Barclays consistently under-reported its cost of funds in 2008, leading to concerns raised by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and UK regulators about the methodology for the LIBOR index. The FRBNY posted documents revealing its concerns with LIBOR calculations in 2008, including emails between Timothy F. Geithner and Mervyn King discussing recommendations for enhancing LIBOR credibility. On May 20, 2008, a MarketSOURCE report raised concerns about LIBOR's credibility. This led to an email exchange between Timothy F. Geithner and Mervyn King on June 1, 2008, discussing recommendations to enhance LIBOR's credibility. Additionally, on June 5, 2008, a presentation was made regarding market concerns about LIBOR."
