    "content": "In October 2017, the U.S. EPA proposed to repeal the Clean Power Plan (CPP), a rule finalized in 2015 to limit CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel-fired power plants. The CPP has faced legal challenges and has not been implemented. Disagreements revolve around legal justification, design, and cost-benefit analysis. The CPP set national CO2 emission rates for existing power plants, allowing states to choose compliance through rate-based or mass-based approaches. The EPA proposed to repeal the Clean Power Plan (CPP) in 2017, which aimed to limit CO2 emissions from power plants. States had the option to comply through rate-based or mass-based approaches, providing flexibility to achieve emission reduction goals. The repeal signifies a shift in the previous Administration's stance on the CPP, with EPA citing a change in interpretation of authority. EPA's regulatory analysis projected a 32% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030 under the CPP. The EPA proposed to repeal the Clean Power Plan (CPP) in 2017, citing a change in interpretation of authority under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act. The proposed repeal marks a significant shift from the previous Administration's stance on the CPP. EPA projected a 32% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030 under the CPP, but now believes it exceeds legal authority. The agency also estimated the benefits and costs of the repeal, which is considered an economically significant regulatory action. The EPA's proposed repeal of the Clean Power Plan in 2017 is a significant shift from the previous administration's stance. The agency estimated the benefits and costs of the repeal, which is considered economically significant. Changes in the benefit-cost analysis may influence how EPA estimates benefits and costs of other regulations, with some Senators requesting more information on the analysis. EPA's 2017 analysis may set a precedent for how federal agencies account for climate and human health benefits. The EPA's 2017 analysis of the Clean Power Plan repeal includes changes in how climate and human health benefits are estimated, potentially setting a precedent for future regulations. Senators have requested more information on the benefit-cost analysis conducted by the agency. The EPA's 2017 analysis of the Clean Power Plan repeal includes changes in estimating climate and human health benefits, setting a precedent for future regulations. EPA prepares benefit-cost analyses for regulatory actions in accordance with Executive Order 12866 and OMB Circular A-4. E.O. 12866 outlines principles for federal regulatory analysis, requiring agencies to assess benefits and costs of significant actions. Rules meeting specific criteria, such as $100 million annual impact on the economy, must undergo detailed analysis. Rules that meet specific criteria, such as a $100 million annual impact on the economy, must undergo a detailed regulatory analysis according to E.O. 12866. OMB Circular A-4 provides guidance on what constitutes a good regulatory analysis, emphasizing the need to explicitly state the proposed regulatory action, analyze alternative approaches, and assess benefits and costs. This aims to standardize the measurement and reporting of economically significant regulatory actions across federal agencies. The OMB Circular A-4 aims to standardize the measurement and reporting of benefits and costs of economically significant regulatory actions across federal agencies. It emphasizes the need for good regulatory analysis to determine if the benefits of an action justify the costs, even if they do not necessarily outweigh them. The circular also acknowledges that not all impacts can be quantified and directs agencies to quantify benefits and costs whenever possible while also considering non-quantified impacts that are important in the regulatory decision-making process. EPA prepared a regulatory analysis for the CPP in 2015 in accordance with E.O. 12866, OMB Circular A-4, and the agency's Guidelines for Preparing Economic Analyses. EPA prepared a regulatory analysis for the CPP in 2015, determining the rulemaking as economically significant. State-specific emission rate and goals were calculated for different scenarios, emphasizing the flexibility in implementation. The analysis estimated emission reductions and compliance costs using the Integrated Planning Model, providing a best assessment of likely impacts under various state approaches. Compliance costs were reported as the additional cost of complying with the CPP in a given year. EPA estimated emission reductions and compliance costs under the CPP using the Integrated Planning Model. Compliance costs included capital investment, operating pollution controls, fuel shifts, and monitoring expenses. The CPP was expected to reduce CO2 and non-GHG emissions, with associated climate benefits estimated using the social cost of carbon. EPA used the IPM model to estimate CO2 emission reductions and applied the social cost of carbon to determine the economic value of climate benefits. Additionally, human health benefits from reductions in non-GHG emissions were quantified as \"co-benefits\" by monetizing the expected reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions. EPA quantified reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions to estimate human health benefits from reduced exposure to PM and ozone. The \"benefit-per-ton\" approach was used to monetize these health benefits, with most of the value coming from reductions in premature deaths related to PM exposure. The majority of the estimated PM health co-benefits were from reductions in SO2 emissions. The monetized health co-benefits estimates mainly focused on PM health effects, with 98% attributed to reductions in premature deaths related to PM exposure. SO2 emission reductions accounted for the majority of the estimated dollar value of human health co-benefits in the scenarios analyzed for 2030. Ozone health effects contributed a smaller share of the monetized health co-benefits. Additionally, the EPA, under the Trump Administration, proposed to repeal the CPP two years after finalizing it under the Obama Administration, following the same rulemaking process mandated by the Clean Air Act Section 307(d). The EPA followed the same rulemaking process to repeal the CPP as it did to promulgate it. Clean Air Act Section 307(d) requires adherence to this process for rulemaking. The regulatory analysis for the repeal focused on summarizing data and specifying methodology. The benefits of repealing a rule are the avoided costs, while the costs are the forgone benefits. EPA defined the benefits of the proposed CPP repeal as the \"avoided compliance costs.\" The EPA defined the benefits of repealing the CPP as the avoided compliance costs, while the costs are the forgone reductions in emissions and associated climate and health benefits. EPA used existing power sector projections for the analysis and plans to conduct updated modeling using IPM for public comment before finalizing the repeal. EPA plans to conduct updated modeling using IPM for public comment before finalizing the proposed repeal. Benefit-cost estimates were based on power sector modeling results from 2015 and more recent projections from the U.S. Energy Information Administration's Annual Energy Outlook 2017. EPA also changed the accounting treatment of cost savings from demand-side energy efficiency measures. EPA's analysis of the Clean Power Plan (CPP) in 2015 showed that the benefits outweighed the costs. However, in 2017, the benefit-cost comparisons were less favorable. The 2017 analysis included changes in the accounting treatment of cost savings from energy efficiency measures, which were now counted as a positive benefit. This shift meant that the energy efficiency savings, which would not be achieved if the CPP were repealed, were considered as a forgone benefit. The net impact estimates in the 2015 analysis all showed benefits outweighing costs, but the 2017 analysis presented a different picture. The 2015 analysis of the Clean Power Plan (CPP) showed benefits outweighing costs, while the 2017 analysis had varying results. Net impact estimates in 2015 consistently showed benefits outweighing costs, but in 2017, estimates ranged from costs outweighing benefits to benefits outweighing costs. The 2017 analysis did not explicitly state whether the benefits of the repeal would outweigh the costs. The 2017 analysis of the Clean Power Plan (CPP) showed varying results on whether benefits outweigh costs. Benefit-cost estimates for the proposed repeal in 2030 ranged from $30.6 billion in net costs to $14.0 billion in net benefits, with half showing net benefits and half showing net costs. The impact of updated power sector projections on benefit-cost estimates is uncertain, as changes in the power sector have not been fully reflected in the estimates. EPA noted that the 2015 power sector modeling did not account for these changes. The EPA noted that updated power sector projections could impact the benefit-cost estimates of the proposed repeal of the Clean Power Plan. Changes in the power sector, such as shifts to lower-emitting sources and greater SO2 reductions, were not fully reflected in the 2015 estimates. The EPA plans to update its modeling and seek public input before finalizing the repeal. The EPA plans to update its power sector modeling and seek public input before finalizing the proposed repeal of the Clean Power Plan. AEO 2017 projections showed higher human health co-benefits due to greater SO2 reductions compared to EPA's 2015 estimates. A recent study analyzed the projections and found a greater reduction in coal emissions under the CPP in 2030. EPA revised its analysis of the CPP's benefits and costs by excluding international impacts of U.S. emissions and more strongly discounting future CO2 reduction benefits. The EPA revised its analysis of the Clean Power Plan's benefits and costs in three ways: excluding international impacts of U.S. emissions, discounting future CO2 reduction benefits, and counting energy efficiency savings as benefits. These changes affected the conclusions of the analysis but did not alter whether benefits outweigh costs. EPA and other federal agencies use the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) to value climate benefits of CO2 reductions. The SCC is an estimate of the monetary value of impacts from a change in CO2 emissions in a given year. The EPA uses the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) to value climate benefits of CO2 reductions. The SCC estimates the monetary value of impacts from changes in CO2 emissions, including changes in agricultural productivity, property damage, and energy system costs. SCC values are calculated using models to estimate the monetary value of associated climate benefits. In 2015, EPA estimated the climate benefits of the Clean Power Plan using SCC values ranging from $17 to $160 per metric ton of CO2 emissions in 2030. In 2015, EPA estimated the climate benefits of the Clean Power Plan using SCC values developed by an interagency working group (IWG), ranging from $17 to $160 per metric ton of CO2 emissions in 2030. The Trump Administration withdrew the IWG's SCC estimates in 2017 as part of E.O. 13783, directing agencies to ensure new estimates are consistent with OMB Circular A-4, focusing on domestic benefits and costs with discount rates of 3% and 7%. Circular A-4 does not consider regulation-specific issues like climate impacts. The Trump Administration's E.O. 13783 directed agencies to align new estimates with OMB Circular A-4, focusing on domestic benefits and costs with discount rates of 3% and 7%. EPA developed interim SCC values based on this directive, using models and assumptions similar to the IWG but adjusting for domestic values. EPA approximated domestic SCC as 10% of global SCC based on the DICE 2010 model. The EPA used three models to calculate domestic SCC estimates, adjusting global values to domestic values by approximating the domestic SCC as 10% of the global SCC. The interim, domestic SCC estimates from all three models are $7 and $1 per metric ton of CO2 emissions in 2030 at discount rates of 3% and 7%. Stakeholders have debated whether federal agencies should use domestic or global SCC values, with the IWG recommending global values in 2010. The IWG recommended using global SCC values in 2010, stating that most GHGs contribute to damages worldwide. EPA agreed in 2015, citing the interconnected global economy and potential spillover effects on national security, trade, and public health. Some stakeholders support global SCC, arguing that U.S. emissions cause damages beyond its borders. Some stakeholders recommend using a global social cost of carbon (SCC) to account for climate impacts beyond U.S. borders, citing economic, strategic, ethical, and legal justifications. However, others argue for domestic SCC estimates, aligning with OMB Circular A-4 guidance to focus on domestic benefits and costs. They believe that using a global SCC may overstate the benefits of U.S. climate regulations by including impacts that benefit non-U.S. populations. Some stakeholders criticize the use of global social cost of carbon (SCC) for climate regulations, arguing that it overstates benefits by including impacts on non-U.S. populations. EPA focused on domestic SCC estimates in the 2017 analysis of the proposed repeal, but did present global estimates in a sensitivity analysis. EPA presented global estimates of the social cost of carbon (SCC) in a sensitivity analysis in the 2017 regulatory analysis. Challenges in accurately estimating the domestic SCC were acknowledged, including the difficulty in capturing relevant regional interactions. OMB Circular A-4 discusses discount rate selection for benefit-cost analysis based on scenarios affecting consumer spending or private capital. The OMB Circular A-4 discusses discount rate selection for benefit-cost analysis, based on scenarios affecting consumer spending or private capital. The 3% and 7% discount rates recommended by OMB correspond to scenarios where regulations impact private consumption or alter capital investments. The 3% rate is based on the average saver's rate of discounting future consumption, while the 7% rate reflects the opportunity cost of capital. Discounting is the final step in calculating the social cost of carbon (SCC) by estimating climate change impacts to 2100 and beyond and then discounting their future value. The 7% discount rate for the social cost of carbon is based on the opportunity cost of capital and is used to calculate economic impacts occurring at different times. Selecting a discount rate for intergenerational climate change impacts is challenging as it involves valuing future generations without their input. The current generation must choose a discount rate for future generations without their input, considering potential preferences. Higher discount rates lead to lower present values, while lower rates result in higher present values. SCC estimates are sensitive to discount rate selection. OMB Circular A-4 recommends considering lower discount rates, with rates in the 1990s ranging from 1% to 3%. The Circular has not been updated since 2003, but the Obama Administration assessed discount rates in light of more recent market data. The Obama Administration assessed OMB Circular A-4 discount rates in light of recent market data, recommending lowering the rates. Stakeholders have divergent views on discount rate selection for the SCC, with environmental groups advocating for lower rates and industry groups for higher rates. Climate change studies typically use lower discount rates according to published literature. The majority of climate change impacts studies cited in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report (2014) used discount rates of no more than 5%. The Interagency Working Group (IWG) discounted the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) at rates of 2.5%, 3%, and 5%, which was supported by the EPA in the 2015 CPP analysis. Academics have recommended developing a new approach to calculate discount rates to better capture uncertainty over long periods of time. The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) recommended a new approach to calculate discount rates for the federal government to better capture uncertainty over long periods of time. They criticized the OMB Circular A-4 guidance for not addressing long-term discounting and uncertainty issues. EPA used lower Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) values in their 2017 analysis compared to 2015, resulting in notably lower benefit estimates for climate change impacts under the Clean Power Plan (CPP). EPA's 2017 analysis used lower SCC values compared to 2015, resulting in lower benefit estimates for climate change impacts under the Clean Power Plan. The domestic perspective and a 7% discount rate further reduced the estimates of climate benefits, affecting the forgone climate benefits of the proposed repeal. The agency acknowledged limitations in the interim SCC estimates and conducted a sensitivity analysis with global values and a 2.5% discount rate. The 2017 analysis also excluded forgone human health co-benefits from some benefit-cost comparisons. EPA's 2017 analysis diverged from the 2015 analysis by excluding forgone human health co-benefits from some benefit-cost comparisons, which was inconsistent with OMB's Circular A-4 guidance. The focus on a targeted pollutant, CO2, was explained as a way to assess cost-effectiveness in achieving reductions. EPA's 2017 analysis excluded human health co-benefits from some benefit-cost comparisons, focusing on CO2 reductions for cost-effectiveness. Stakeholders raised concerns about co-benefits and potential double counting in EPA's regulatory actions. Stakeholders criticized EPA's 2015 analysis for including monetized co-benefits, making it hard to assess the impact of the CPP on CO2. Questions were raised about potential double counting of PM benefits and whether they were attributed to the CPP. EPA's analysis considered co-benefits in line with federal guidance, which directs agencies to quantify and monetize both direct and indirect impacts. EPA's economic analysis includes co-benefits and adverse impacts, following federal guidelines. OMB reports show that Clean Air Act analyses monetize co-benefits, mainly from reducing public exposure to particulate matter. EPA applies a threshold to forgone health co-benefits in benefit-cost comparisons, counting only those exceeding a defined threshold for ambient PM levels. EPA's benefit-cost comparisons include estimated forgone health co-benefits, with thresholds applied to calculate PM mortality impacts based on federal air quality standards and long-term studies. EPA assumed zero deaths below defined thresholds for ambient PM levels in the 2017 analysis. The EPA used thresholds based on long-term studies to estimate deaths related to PM in benefit-cost comparisons. The PM air quality standard threshold had a greater impact on co-benefit estimates compared to the lowest measured level (LML) threshold. The comparisons of the proposed repeal were more favorable when using the PM air quality standard threshold. EPA used these thresholds to enhance transparency and provide insight into the uncertainty of estimated PM benefits at lower levels. The EPA used thresholds based on long-term studies to estimate deaths related to PM in benefit-cost comparisons. The PM air quality standard threshold had a greater impact on co-benefit estimates compared to the lowest measured level (LML) threshold. EPA justified the use of these thresholds to enhance transparency and provide insight into the uncertainty of estimated PM benefits at lower levels, citing scientific evidence and peer-reviewed studies. The EPA's analysis does not establish a clear threshold for PM-related mortality, citing peer-reviewed studies and the NAS. The agency's 2015 analysis acknowledged uncertainty in benefits at lower PM concentrations but did not apply a threshold, stating that federal air quality standards are not risk-free. EPA's 2017 analysis sought feedback on estimating and reporting PM impacts without a threshold and outlined plans for further research. The EPA's 2017 analysis includes benefits above and below federal air quality standards, aligning with scientific evidence. They plan to evaluate the uncertainty of the benefit-per-ton approach for estimating health impacts of pollutants like PM. Additionally, the EPA changed the accounting treatment of energy efficiency savings from a negative cost to a benefit in their 2017 analysis. In their 2017 analysis, EPA changed the accounting treatment of energy efficiency savings from a negative cost to a benefit, aligning with OMB guidance. This shift increased both estimated costs and benefits by the same amount, without altering the net impact of the proposed repeal. EPA's accounting change in the proposed repeal shifted energy savings from cost savings to forgone benefits estimate, resulting in higher estimates of costs and benefits. This change became significant in the cost analysis conducted under E.O. 13771, which focused on cost savings but omitted forgone benefits. EPA calculated the present value of avoided compliance costs for 2020-2033. The analysis conducted by EPA under E.O. 13771 reported cost savings of the proposed repeal but omitted the forgone benefits. EPA calculated the present value of avoided compliance costs for 2020-2033, excluding demand-side energy efficiency savings. Benefit-cost analysis is crucial for informing policy decisions by evaluating the potential effects of regulatory options. While informative, benefit-cost comparisons do not solely determine regulatory decisions. The benefit-cost analysis informs policy decisions by evaluating regulatory options, but it does not solely drive decisions. Decisionmakers consider various factors such as legal, technical, and ethical considerations when finalizing regulatory proposals. Quantifying and monetizing the benefits and costs of a regulation can be complex, drawing upon scientific data and involving ethical decisions. The EPA is required to follow rulemaking procedures under the Clean Air Act when proposing regulations. Quantifying and monetizing the benefits and costs of regulations can be complex, involving scientific data and ethical decisions. Changes in policy priorities and technical information can influence the estimation of benefits and costs. EPA's 2017 benefit-cost analysis reached different conclusions than the 2015 analysis due to changes in estimating economic impacts. Members of Congress have differing views on EPA regulatory policy, especially regarding GHG-related regulations. The EPA's assessment of the benefits and costs of the CPP changed between two Administrations due to differences in policy priorities. The use of new SCC estimates and thresholds influenced the climate and human health benefit estimates. Congress has varying views on EPA regulatory policy, especially regarding GHG-related regulations. The potential impact of regulatory decisions on major industries and the health of U.S. citizens is significant. The EPA's 2017 analysis used interim SCC estimates developed in response to E.O. 13783, differing from the Obama Administration's IWG SCC estimates. The interim SCC estimates focused on domestic measures and used a 7% discount rate, lowering the estimated CPP climate benefits. Congress may need to consider potential differences in federal agencies' decisions on GHG-related regulations without the harmonized IWG SCC estimates. EPA's analysis did not provide details on next steps for the SCC or implications for other federal analyses. EPA's 2017 analysis provided few details about next steps for the SCC and implications for other federal analyses. It is unclear if other agencies will use the same interim estimates in their regulatory analyses. The Department of Energy continued to use IWG SCC estimates in one rulemaking after the Administration withdrew those estimates. Congress may consider EPA's changes to health co-benefits analysis as setting a precedent for future air pollution rulemakings. The 2017 EPA analysis differed from the 2015 analysis in its approach to health co-benefits and threshold for calculating PM mortality impacts. The exclusion of health co-benefits from one benefit-cost comparison departed from previous analyses and federal guidance."
