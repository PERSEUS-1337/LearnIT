The \"Automobile Fuel Efficiency Improvements Act of 2003\" mandates phased increases in fuel economy standards for passenger automobiles, with minimum standards set for different model years ranging from 25 to 40 miles per gallon. Higher standards can be set by regulation. The \"Automobile Fuel Efficiency Improvements Act of 2003\" mandates phased increases in fuel economy standards for passenger automobiles. Higher standards can be set by regulation, including increasing the standard otherwise applicable for non-passenger automobiles. The amendment mandates phased increases in fuel economy standards for non-passenger automobiles, with specific mileage requirements set for different model years. The amendment requires phased increases in fuel economy standards for non-passenger automobiles, with specific mileage requirements set for different model years. If the Secretary does not increase the fuel economy standard within 24 months after the latest increase, a report must be submitted to Congress explaining the reasons for not increasing the standard. The amendment aims to increase the inclusiveness of definitions for automobiles and passenger automobiles. The amendment increases the weight limits for automobiles and passenger automobiles under title 49, United States Code. For automobiles, the weight limit is raised to 12,000 pounds, and for passenger automobiles, it is set at 12,000 pounds or less. The weight limit for passenger automobiles under title 49, United States Code is set at 12,000 pounds or less, with specific exclusions for certain types of vehicles. The amendments made by this section apply to automobiles manufactured for model years after the enactment of this Act, with specific criteria for vehicles with a capacity of more than 9 persons or a cargo area of at least 6 feet in length. The section discusses civil penalties related to the amendments for automobiles manufactured after the enactment of the Act, with specific criteria for certain types of vehicles. The amendment increases penalties for violations of fuel economy standards under title 49, United States Code. The dollar amount for penalties is now $10, adjusted annually based on the Consumer Price Index. The amendment increases penalties for violations of fuel economy standards under title 49, United States Code. The penalties are now $10, adjusted annually based on the Consumer Price Index. The amendments apply to automobiles manufactured for model years after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 5. ACCURATE FUEL ECONOMY TESTING. Biennial Report on Testing Quality: The Secretary of Transportation must submit a report to Congress every odd-numbered year on the accuracy of automobile fuel economy testing, including assessments of fuel economy accuracy and planned changes in testing methodology. The Secretary of Transportation and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency must consult on changes in testing methodology for road vehicle fuel economy. The Secretary of Transportation will submit the first biennial report on testing quality to Congress in 2005. A study will be conducted to improve the process for measuring fuel economy by determining the most accurate testing process for automobile fuel economy in various usage scenarios. The Secretary of Transportation will conduct a study to compare automobile fuel economy ratings in different usage scenarios and submit a report to Congress within two years. The Secretary of Transportation will submit a report to Congress on the results of a study comparing automobile fuel economy ratings. The report will include determinations and comparisons, as well as an estimate of the adjustment needed to align ratings with the most accurate testing process. Additionally, a revised testing procedure must be implemented within 180 days of the report. The Secretary of Transportation will prescribe a revised testing procedure for accurately measuring automobile fuel economy ratings within 180 days of submitting a report to Congress. This procedure will apply to determine the average fuel economy of automobiles manufactured after model year 2006. The Secretary of Transportation will amend fuel economy standards for automobiles manufactured after model year 2006 based on a revised testing procedure to improve accuracy in calculating fuel economy. The Secretary will amend fuel economy standards for post-2006 automobiles to reflect improved accuracy in calculating fuel economy, ensuring standards are as stringent as before the testing procedure revision. SEC. 6. STANDARDS FOR EXECUTIVE AGENCY AUTOMOBILES. Section 32917 of title 49, United States Code, is amended to set fleet average fuel economy standards for non-passenger and passenger automobiles. The amendment to Section 32917 of title 49, United States Code, establishes fleet average fuel economy standards for non-passenger and passenger automobiles, ensuring a minimum fuel economy for each model year. The President shall prescribe regulations requiring that at least 20% of passenger automobiles leased or bought by executive agencies have a fuel economy rating at least 5 miles per gallon higher than the average standard. Additionally, starting in fiscal year 2009, at least 10,000 vehicles in the executive agencies' fleet must have a fuel economy at least 5 miles per gallon higher than the average standards. Starting in fiscal year 2009, executive agencies must ensure that at least 10,000 vehicles in their fleet have a fuel economy at least 5 miles per gallon higher than the average standards for that model year."
