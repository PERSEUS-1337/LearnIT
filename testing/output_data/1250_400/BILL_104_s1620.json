    "content": "The \"Environmental Dredge Disposal Act of 1996\" may be cited as the Act. It pertains to dredged material disposal facilities. The Water Resources Development Act of 1986 is amended to include provisions for dredged material disposal facilities associated with Federal navigation projects. This includes upland, aquatic, and confined aquatic disposal facilities for harbors and inland harbors. The Federal share of costs for construction of these facilities is limited to funds not required for operation and maintenance. The Federal share of costs for construction of dredged material disposal facilities for Federal navigation projects is limited to funds not needed for operation and maintenance. The Federal share of operation and maintenance costs for Federal navigation projects is limited to $25,000,000 per fiscal year. Eligible costs include constructing and maintaining dredged material disposal facilities. The Federal government covers costs for operation and maintenance of navigation projects, including dredged material disposal facilities, environmental dredging, and remediation in critical port areas to support maritime commerce and navigation. The Federal government provides funding for dredging, management, and disposal of contaminated sediments in critical port areas to support maritime commerce and navigation. Preference is given to port areas where harbor maintenance fees exceed Federal expenditures. This applies to the construction of dredged material disposal facilities and associated navigation projects. The Federal government provides funding for dredging and disposal of contaminated sediments in port areas with high harbor maintenance fees. Contracts for construction of disposal facilities and navigation projects must be awarded before the enactment of this subsection. Existing cooperative agreements between the Secretary and non-Federal interests will be amended to comply with this subsection. The enactment of this subsection requires amendments to existing cooperative agreements between the Federal government and non-Federal interests for dredged material disposal facilities. The amendment must be applied prospectively and should not increase the non-Federal share of costs for any disposal facility."
