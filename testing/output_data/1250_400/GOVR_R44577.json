    "content": "The House and Senate passed their respective National Defense Authorization Acts for Fiscal Year 2017, containing provisions affecting military personnel. A conference committee resolved differences between the bills, leading to the final bill being signed into law on December 23, 2016. This report highlights selected personnel-related issues of high congressional interest. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 was signed into law on December 23, 2016. This report focuses on key personnel-related issues of congressional interest, including authorized active duty end-strengths and previous legislation impacting military personnel. The authorized active duty end-strengths for FY2001 were Army (480,000), Navy (372,642), Marine Corps (172,600), and Air Force (357,000). Congress increased Army and Marine Corps personnel in response to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but recent years saw decreases due to troop withdrawals and budget constraints. End-strengths for the Air Force and Navy have been declining since 2001. FY2016 and FY2017 end-strengths were proposed to be lowered in the Administration's budget, with the House approving higher end-strengths than requested. Notable increases were seen in the Army, Marine Corps, and Air Force. The House bill approved higher end-strengths for all services compared to the Administration's request. The Army saw the most significant increase, with an additional 5,000 personnel compared to FY2016. The Marine Corps and Air Force also increased, while the Navy saw a slight reduction but still higher than the Administration's request. The final bill set the minimum end-strengths at a level equal to the authorized end-strengths for FY2017. The overall authorized end-strength of the Selected Reserves has declined by about 6% over the past 15 years, with reductions in Navy Reserve strength. For FY2017, the Administration requested a reduction in authorized Selected Reserves end-strength for four of the seven reserve components and increases for two. The House bill approved higher end-strengths for all services compared to the Administration's request, with the Army National Guard and Army Reserve seeing increases. The House bill approved higher end-strengths for all services compared to the Administration's request, with increases for the Army National Guard and Army Reserve. Congressional interest in military personnel costs and pay raises remains a focus. The House bill approved a 2.1% pay raise for all servicemembers effective January 1, 2017, in accordance with the statutory formula. The Senate bill would have waived the automatic adjustment to basic pay specified in 37 U.S.C. The FY2017 President's Budget requested a 1.6% military pay raise, lower than the statutory formula of 2.1%. The House bill mandated a 2.1% pay raise for all servicemembers effective January 1, 2017, while the Senate bill proposed a 1.6% increase. The enacted bill specified a 2.1% pay raise, effective January 1, 2017. The Senate bill proposed changes to the calculation of Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) for servicemembers, affecting how housing allowances are determined based on paygrade, geographic location, and dependency status. The Senate bill proposed changes to the calculation of Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) for servicemembers, focusing on geographic location and paygrade rather than dependency status. It aimed to base BAH on actual housing expenditures up to a maximum amount for a given location/paygrade and adjust payments for servicemembers sharing living quarters. The new formula would have applied to certain members of the Armed Forces starting January 1, 2018. The Senate proposed changes to the calculation of Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) for servicemembers, focusing on geographic location and paygrade rather than dependency status. The new formula would have applied to certain members of the Armed Forces starting January 1, 2018, and required the Secretary of Defense to submit proposed regulations by March 31, 2017. The Senate proposed changes to the calculation of Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) for servicemembers, focusing on geographic location and paygrade rather than dependency status. The enacted bill requires DOD to provide a report on transitioning to a new pay structure by March 1, 2017, which eliminates BAH and BAS to recruit and retain a high-quality All-Volunteer Force. The conference report discusses the evolution of BAH as an entitlement over the past 20 years. The Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) has evolved over the past 20 years to provide a housing benefit for servicemembers in high-cost areas. The housing allowance is intended as compensation and the Secretary of Defense is directed to plan for a transition to a salary system aligning with this purpose. The military retirement system underwent changes in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2016 to modernize and reduce the retirement system. These changes will take effect on January 1, 2018, for eligible servicemembers. The military retirement system changes, effective January 1, 2018, include a reduction in the retired pay multiplier and the introduction of continuation pay as a retention incentive for servicemembers with 12 years of service. This has raised concerns about retaining certain occupational specialties at the mid-career point. The FY2016 NDAA authorized DOD to provide continuation pay at any point between 8 to 12 years of service in return for an additional commitment to service. The House and Senate agreed on a provision (Section 633) allowing DOD to offer continuation pay between 8 to 12 years of service in exchange for a 3-year commitment. This gives DOD flexibility in managing personnel based on retention trends. Additionally, the bill adjusts procedures for calculating continuation pay minimums for active and reserve component members. The Senate bill considered default contributions to the TSP to be to a Roth plan, which was not adopted. Cadets, midshipmen, and reservists in inactive duty status before January 1, 2018, were granted a 30-day election period for the new retirement system. Military servicemembers can receive retired pay after 20 years of service. The Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act allows state courts to divide military retired pay in divorce cases. The amount of retired pay is calculated based on qualifying years of service. The Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act (USFSPA) allows state courts to divide military retired pay in divorce cases. Up to 50% of a servicemember's disposable military retired pay may be divisible in a divorce case. Proposed changes would use pay grade and years of service at the time of a divorce court order. The enacted bill includes cost-of-living adjustments in spousal payments. The Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act (USFSPA) allows state courts to divide military retired pay in divorce cases, with up to 50% of disposable retired pay divisible. The enacted bill includes cost-of-living adjustments in spousal payments, authorized by \u00a7641. This provision does not affect divorce settlements prior to enactment. The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) provides a payment to surviving spouses of deceased servicemembers, usually 55% of the retired basic pay. Previously, the base amount for those who died on active duty was 75% of their basic pay. Reservists who died during inactive-duty training receive a lower SBP payment. Surviving spouses receiving both SBP and Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) have their SBP payments reduced by the amount of DIC, offset by the Special Survivor Indemnity Allowance (SSIA). Sections of the FY2017 NDAA addressed these disparities. The Special Survivor Indemnity Allowance (SSIA) is a payment made to surviving spouses to offset the reduction in Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) payments due to Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC). The enacted bill includes amendments to extend SSIA until May 31, 2018 and allow the Department of Defense to withhold SBP payments from Combat Related Special Compensation (CRSC) when retired pay is insufficient to cover the premiums. Section 646 extends SSIA until May 31, 2018 and allows CRSC to be used to cover SBP premiums. CBO estimates 65,000 surviving spouses will receive SSIA in FY2018. Section 648 requires an independent assessment of SBP effectiveness and comparison with other benefits. The report evaluates the effectiveness of the SBP for survivors of servicemembers, compares benefits with other government and private sector employees, and explores providing survivor benefits through alternative insurance products. TRICARE is the DOD-administered health benefits program for active duty servicemembers, retirees, and their families. Proposed changes include replacing TRICARE Prime, Standard, and Extra options with TRICARE Select and Preferred options with new enrollment fees and benefit structures. The Administration's FY2017 Budget proposed changes to TRICARE health care, including new enrollment fees, deductibles, and co-pays for retirees and military family members. The proposals aimed to replace TRICARE Prime, Standard, and Extra options with TRICARE Select and Preferred options, with increased pharmacy co-pays and an annual enrollment period. Additionally, the changes would reduce TRICARE for Life expenditures by implementing new benefit structures and cost-saving measures. TRICARE for Life is funded through the Medicare Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund, with uniformed services making annual payments. Proposed TRICARE changes include new enrollment fees, deductibles, and co-pays, with estimated savings and costs over a 10-year period. The enacted bill establishes a new TRICARE Select health plan option and modifies existing plans. The enacted bill establishes a new TRICARE Select health plan option to replace current options, set enrollment fees, deductibles, and co-payments for retirees joining TRICARE after January 1, 2018, and require an open enrollment period with qualifying events for annual participation. The Secretary of Defense must submit an implementation plan by June 1, 2017. The enacted bill establishes TRICARE Select to replace current options, sets enrollment fees, deductibles, and co-payments for retirees joining after January 1, 2018. The Secretary of Defense must submit an implementation plan by June 1, 2017, including a pilot program on value-based healthcare methodology in the TRICARE program. The Administration proposed changes to TRICARE health plans in the FY2017 budget request, including consolidating plan options, increasing pharmaceutical co-pays, and adding an enrollment fee for future TRICARE-for-Life enrollees. The House and Senate bills suggested different consolidation plans. The enacted bill includes cost-sharing tables for active-duty family members and retirees under TRICARE Select and Prime, with fixed amounts indexed to retirement pay increases. Exceptions are provided for disability retirees, dependents, and survivors, while TRICARE for Life beneficiaries' cost-sharing remains unchanged. A new category for \"reserve and young adult\" beneficiaries will be created. The cost-sharing tables for active-duty family members and retirees under TRICARE Select and Prime will be annually indexed to retirement pay increases. Exceptions will be provided for disability retirees, dependents, and survivors. TRICARE for Life beneficiaries' cost-sharing will remain unchanged. A new category for \"reserve and young adult\" beneficiaries will be created. Retired beneficiaries eligible for TRICARE before 2018 will face a $150 individual or $300 family annual enrollment fee 90 days after a report is submitted to the armed services committees by the Comptroller General. The report is due by February 1, 2020 and will review changes in health care coverage, appointment access standards, and network provider acceptance. The report due by February 1, 2020 will review changes in health care coverage, appointment access standards, network provider acceptance, and TRICARE Select beneficiary satisfaction. TRICARE Prime beneficiaries may need a waiver or pay 50% of the allowed charge if care is obtained without a required referral. The TRICARE pharmacy program provides access to outpatient prescriptions through military pharmacies, mail-order pharmacy, and retail network pharmacies. Active duty servicemembers have no pharmacy co-payments at military pharmacies. The 2016 NDAA allowed a one-time $3 increase to pharmacy co-pays and required refills for maintenance drug prescriptions to be filled through specified channels. The 2016 NDAA allowed a one-time $3 increase to pharmacy co-pays and required maintenance drug prescriptions to be filled through mail order or military pharmacies. The Administration's FY2017 budget proposed annual co-payment increases to save costs. The House-passed bill did not include a provision for a pharmacy co-payment increase. The FY2016 NDAA included a $3 increase to pharmacy co-pays, overriding the statutory increase. The Senate-passed bill would have allowed beneficiaries to receive drugs at no cost in military medical facilities and authorized the Secretary of Defense to exclude drugs of little value. The Secretary of Defense was authorized to exclude drugs of little value from coverage based on recommendations by the Department of Defense Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee. This would result in significant cost savings, with an estimated reduction of $640 million in DOD's pharmacy costs over the 2017-2021 period and $2.7 billion in net health care spending for TRICARE for Life beneficiaries over the 2017-2026 period. Additionally, implementing this measure would reduce accrual payments into the DOD Medicare-Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund by about $1.5 billion over the 2018-2021 period. The Defense Health Agency (DHA) was established in 2013 to support Armed Forces medical services. It manages TRICARE and shared services, including the National Capital Region Multi-Service Market. Implementing Section 702 would have reduced accrual payments into the DOD Medicare-Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund by $1.5 billion over 2018-2021. The Defense Health Agency (DHA) was established in 2013 to support Armed Forces medical services by managing TRICARE and shared services. It currently oversees military treatment facilities (MTFs) and aims to improve operational medical force readiness and the medical readiness of the Armed Forces through a single agency responsible for all MTFs. The organizational structure of the military health system is seen as hindering rapid decision-making and innovation. The conferees aim to streamline the military health system management structure to improve access to care, health outcomes, and lower costs. They believe the current organizational structure hinders rapid decision-making and innovation. The enacted bill combines provisions to assign the Director of the Defense Health Agency responsibility for MTF administration, budget, IT, and healthcare management. The enacted bill combines provisions to assign the Director of the Defense Health Agency responsibility for MTF administration, budget, IT, and healthcare management, including establishing a professional staff within the Defense Health Agency to oversee MTF administration and codifying the roles of the services' Surgeons General. The enacted bill assigns the Director of the Defense Health Agency responsibility for MTF administration, budget, IT, and healthcare management. It also requires the Secretary of Defense to maintain medical facilities to support the medical readiness of the armed forces in areas where civilian health care facilities are insufficient. Additionally, the bill mandates the development of an implementation plan and submission of reports to the armed services committees by specific deadlines. Chapter 55 of Title 10 of the United States Code requires the Secretary of Defense to maintain medical facilities to support the medical readiness of the armed forces in areas where civilian health care facilities are insufficient. The provision includes exceptions for covered beneficiaries when access to care through non-DOD providers is eliminated. The Senate bill proposed amending the citizenship requirements for reserve component enlistees to align with those for the active component, but this provision was not included in the conference bill. Current law requires reserve component enlistees to be citizens, lawful permanent residents, or have previous military service. Waivers for citizenship requirements can be granted if enlistment is deemed vital to national interest. The Department of Defense announced new policies for maternity and parental leave, extending maternity leave to 12 weeks and seeking legislative action to extend parental leave to 14 days. Parental leave for a servicemember whose spouse gives birth was first authorized in 2009 and is currently for a maximum of 10 days. Adopting servicemembers have been eligible for up to 21 days of leave since 2006. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 authorized up to 10 days of parental leave for a servicemember whose spouse gives birth. Since 2006, adopting servicemembers have been eligible for up to 21 days of leave. The new policy allows for up to 12 weeks of total leave for the primary caregiver in connection with the birth of a child, and 6 weeks for a primary caregiver in the case of adoption. Secondary caregivers could receive up to 21 days of leave. The Secretary of Defense will define \"primary\" and \"secondary\" caregivers for this benefit. Leave must be taken within a year of the event. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 authorized parental leave for servicemembers in connection with birth or adoption. The leave must be taken within a year of the event and is defined for primary and secondary caregivers. Servicemembers must be active duty or on active duty recall to be eligible. The leave is in addition to any other earned leave but may require extending service obligation or reducing existing leave. Section 521 of the final bill explicitly prohibits unauthorized leave for military servicemembers. The final bill adopted a provision prohibiting unauthorized leave for military servicemembers. Paid parental leave is supported for recruitment and retention, but opponents fear it may impact military readiness. About 60% of the active duty force has dependents. The Congress has shown concern for improving the Defense Commissary system in recent years, with no changes enacted yet. In FY2016, $1.4 billion was authorized for commissary funding, $100 million more than the President's budget request. The President's FY2017 budget proposed $1.2 billion for commissaries, reducing subsidies by $200 million from FY2016. Authorized patrons include active duty military members, retired personnel, disabled veterans, and DOD civilians overseas. The FY2016 NDAA required a report on budget neutrality for DeCA and the military exchange system. The FY2016 NDAA required a report on budget neutrality for DeCA and the military exchange system, acknowledging that privatization may not replicate the benefits provided by DeCA. Critics suggest a thorough evaluation by DOD and Congress before initiating a pilot program. The Comptroller General was directed to assess DOD's plan for commissaries and exchanges. The FY2016 NDAA mandated a report on budget neutrality for DeCA and military exchanges, with critics calling for a thorough evaluation by DOD and Congress before a pilot program. The Comptroller General assessed DOD's plan, noting that it lacked specific metrics for achieving budget neutrality by October 2018 and only partially addressed the mandated benchmarks. The FY2016 NDAA mandated a report on budget neutrality for DeCA and military exchanges, with critics calling for a thorough evaluation by DOD and Congress before a pilot program. The Comptroller General assessed DOD's plan, noting that it lacked specific metrics for achieving budget neutrality by October 2018 and only partially addressed the mandated benchmarks. Sections 661 and 662 of the enacted bill allow DeCA to set prices based on market conditions and customer demand, and authorize the use of the Military Star Card at commissaries. The reforms aim to preserve benefits, ensure savings for patrons, and provide ongoing support. The conference report highlights reforms to the commissary system, including setting prices based on market conditions, accepting the Military Star Card, and implementing private sector initiatives like variable pricing and private label products. These changes aim to preserve benefits, ensure savings for patrons, and provide ongoing support for morale, welfare, and recreational activities. The CBO estimates that DeCA will implement a provision to offer private label goods with variable pricing to offset operating costs. Proceeds from price markups are expected to reduce direct spending by less than $500,000 over the next decade. DOD is required to develop a strategy to optimize practices across DeCA and military exchanges to reduce reliance on appropriated funds while maintaining patron benefits and revenue. Flexible product pricing at commissaries must maintain current savings levels, and conversion to a non-appropriated fund entity is possible if benchmarks are met without impacting employee pay. The Defense Department may convert the commissary agency to a non-appropriated fund entity if savings are maintained for six months. The Defense Secretary must ensure no DeCA employee incurs a loss in pay. Contracts with grocery industry experts can assist in transforming the commissary system. Military Star Card can be accepted as payment at commissary stores. In the past few decades, Congress has enacted legislation and appropriated funds for servicemember off-duty education, credentialing programs, and transition services to support servicemembers and veterans in successfully translating military skills and experience into post-service education and employment. In the past few decades, Congress has enacted legislation and appropriated funds for servicemember off-duty education, credentialing programs, and transition services to support servicemembers and veterans in translating military skills into post-service education and employment. Section 561 of the final bill eliminates the requirement for third-party accreditation of credentialing programs and instead sets quality assurance benchmarks. Sections 567 and 568 require DOD reports on specific transition initiatives for servicemembers. Section 561 of the final bill eliminates third-party accreditation for credentialing programs and sets quality assurance benchmarks. Sections 567 and 568 require DOD reports on specific transition initiatives for servicemembers, including obtaining merchant mariner licenses and assessing college credit for military skills. Section 3590 sets deadlines for TWIC applications for separating military servicemembers, and Sections 562 and 563 mandate notification on separation payments recoupment and counseling on substance abuse during TAP training. Section 566 authorizes a pilot program for job placement/employment. The final bill includes provisions on transition initiatives for servicemembers, such as notification on separation payments recoupment and counseling on substance abuse during TAP training. It also eliminates third-party accreditation for credentialing programs and authorizes a pilot program for job placement/employment services. General and flag officers hold the most important military positions in the DOD. General and flag officers (GFOs) hold key military positions in the DOD, including the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and combatant commanders. The highest-ranking GFOs are generals or admirals with 4-star rank, followed by 3-star, 2-star, and 1-star ranks. Congress limits the number of GFOs in each grade and periodically reviews their duties and compensation. Proposed legislation aims to restrict the rank of service and functional component commanders under combatant commanders. The legislation aims to revise the number, duties, and compensation of General and Flag Officers (GFOs) in the DOD. It includes requirements for service and functional component commanders to hold ranks no higher than lieutenant general or vice admiral. The Senate bill proposes reducing the total number of active and reserve GFOs by 25%, with a focus on higher-ranking GFOs. Additionally, it suggests establishing a new unified combatant command for cyber operations led by an admiral or general. The Senate bill proposes reducing the number of active component General and Flag Officers (GFOs) by 11%, with a focus on higher-ranking GFOs. It also eliminates certain grade requirements in various communities and senior staff positions, allowing DOD to set grades as needed within overall GFO caps specified in law. The Secretary of Defense is required to reduce the total number of GFOs on active duty by 110 positions by December 31, 2022. The total number of GFOs on active duty will be reduced by 110 positions by December 31, 2022, amounting to an 11% reduction in authorized positions. The reductions will be distributed among the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and joint pool. The Secretary of Defense can adjust these reductions in the interest of national security, with reporting requirements and a global manpower study mandated. The provision mandates a reduction of 110 General and Flag Officer positions by December 31, 2022, with a 11% decrease in authorized positions. The Secretary of Defense can adjust these reductions for national security, with reporting requirements and a global manpower study required. Chapter 38 of Title 10 U.S.C. addresses the management of active duty officers trained in joint matters. There is debate over the current qualification requirements for joint qualified officers. Joint matters involve unified action by integrated military forces across different domains. The requirements for becoming a joint qualified officer involve completing specific joint professional military education and a full tour of duty in a joint assignment. The length of a joint duty assignment is typically two years for general and flag officers and three years for other officers, but this requirement can be waived by the Secretary of Defense. Both the House and Senate bills aimed to standardize the length of a joint duty assignment at two years for all officers. The House and Senate bills aimed to modify the criteria for joint duty assignments, standardizing the length at two years for all officers. The definition of joint matters would have been expanded to include various duties such as intelligence, fires, movement, protection, and sustainment. The Secretary of Defense would have been given the authority to designate other joint matters. Additionally, the definition of joint duty assignment would have been modified to require the preponderance of duties to involve joint matters. The enacted bill modified the criteria for joint duty assignments, standardizing the length at two years for all officers. It expanded the definition of joint matters to include various duties and gave the Secretary of Defense authority to designate other joint matters. The definition of joint duty assignment was also modified to require the preponderance of duties to involve joint matters. The Military Selective Service Act (MSSA) requires most males between 18 and 26 in the US to register with Selective Service. Women have never been required to register. Failure to register can result in penalties and loss of benefits. Recent DOD policy changes have raised questions about the registration exemption for women. Recent DOD policy changes have opened all military occupational specialties to women, raising questions about the Selective Service registration exemption for women. The Senate bill proposed expanding registration requirements to women turning 18 after January 1, 2018, but this provision was not adopted. Some have questioned the need for the Selective Service System and proposed alternative mechanisms for emergency manpower needs. The final bill requires DOD to conduct a detailed review of the Selective Service System and its viability, as well as an analysis of potential manpower needs in case of mass mobilization. The final bill requires DOD to produce a detailed review and report on the Selective Service System, including its benefits and viability, as well as an analysis of potential DOD manpower needs in the event of an emergency requiring mass mobilization. Sections 551 and 553-557 establish an independent commission known as the National Commission on Military, National, and Public Service to examine these questions. The 11-member commission includes appointees by the Administration and senior members of the House, Senate, and armed services committees. The provision establishes the commission over 36 months and authorizes $15 million in funding in FY2017. In the past decade, issues of sexual assault and harassment in the military have received significant attention from Congress and the media. In 2005, the Department of Defense (DOD) implemented its first department-wide sexual assault policies following recommendations from the Joint Task Force for Sexual Assault Prevention and Response. This led to the establishment of the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (SAPRO) as DOD's primary oversight body for service-level programs. DOD released its first Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR) strategic plan in May 2013, with updates in January 2015. The Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (SAPRO) was established in 2005 as DOD's primary oversight body for service-level programs. DOD released its first Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR) strategic plan in May 2013, with updates in January 2015. Between 2012 and 2016, DOD implemented strategic initiatives and congressionally mandated actions related to military justice, investigations, prevention, victim services, and reporting. The Senate bill aimed to extend reporting requirements to 2025, while the conference bill extended them to January 31, 2021. The reporting requirements for the DOD have been extended to 2025, with a deadline for annual reports to Congress moved to March 31. The FY2015 DOD Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military highlighted concerns about retaliation for reporting instances of sexual assault, leading to confusion in investigations. Both the House and Senate bills included provisions to increase training requirements for investigators. The House and Senate bills aimed to address confusion in investigations and reporting of retaliation in the military. The enacted bill includes provisions for increased training requirements for investigators and metrics to evaluate efforts to prevent and respond to retaliation in connection with reports of military sexual assault. Congress remains concerned about reports of retaliation against military personnel making protected communications. The enacted bill includes provisions for metrics to evaluate efforts to prevent and respond to retaliation in connection with reports of military sexual assault. It also amends the law to apply to servicemembers and veterans who experienced PTSD or TBI in connection with sexual trauma. The enacted bill (\u00a7\u00a7535 and 554) adopts Senate provisions amending the law to include servicemembers and veterans with PTSD or TBI from sexual trauma. Concerns were raised about the definition of sexual harassment in the military, leading to modifications in the bill. Reference: CRS Report R43168, Military Sexual Assault: Chronology of Activity in Congress. Background: Approximately 1.1 million dependent children of active duty military servicemembers are at risk of child abuse or neglect, with 7,676 confirmed cases in FY2014. While rates of abuse in military families are lower than the general population, concerns remain about prevention, management, and reporting within the Armed Forces. In FY2014, there were 7,676 confirmed cases of child abuse or neglect in military homes, marking a 10% increase from the previous year and a 10-year high. Concerns have been raised about prevention, management, and reporting of abuse in the Armed Forces. The Family Advocacy Program (FAP) implements initiatives for child and domestic abuse prevention, education, and training. DOD personnel are now required to directly notify state child welfare agencies of suspected instances of child abuse and neglect. Annual reports to Congress on instances of child abuse are also mandated. Section 575 of the final bill requires DOD personnel to directly notify state child welfare agencies of suspected child abuse and neglect. Section 574 mandates an annual report to Congress on instances of child abuse and domestic abuse in military families. Section 578, which would have required background checks for employees in DOD schools, was not included in the final bill. The final bill requires DOD personnel to notify state child welfare agencies of suspected child abuse and neglect. It also mandates an annual report to Congress on instances of child abuse and domestic abuse in military families. The bill did not include a provision for background checks for employees in DOD schools. Instead, it urged DOD to work closely with local school districts to improve employment screening policies for the safety of military children. The Department is directed to provide a report to Congress on efforts to identify and address any shortfalls in employee screening processes in local school districts educating military family members. In 2013, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel directed a comprehensive review of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and its implementation. This review was prompted by recommendations from General Martin Dempsey and included considerations from the Response Systems to Adult Sexual Assault Crimes Panel. The Military Justice Review Group (MJRG) was established to review the UCMJ and MCM, resulting in the submission of the Military Justice Act of 2016 to Congress for revision. The proposed House bill included comprehensive changes to military justice, addressing various aspects of the UCMJ. The Department of Defense submitted the Military Justice Act of 2016 to Congress in December 2015, leading to bills being introduced in the House and Senate to revise the UCMJ. The proposed House bill included comprehensive changes to military justice, focusing on courts-martial composition, trial procedure, sentencing, and appellate matters. Notably, the House bill aimed to grant the government the ability to appeal sentences deemed unlawful or unreasonable, a right previously held only by servicemembers. Additionally, the bill proposed reorganizing punitive articles and creating new offenses. The House bill proposed reorganizing punitive articles and creating new offenses, including prohibited activities with military recruits, fraudulent use of credit cards, offenses concerning government computers, and retaliation. The Senate bill addressed various aspects of military justice, such as courts-martial composition, trial procedure, sentencing, and appellate matters. Differences existed between the House and Senate language, with the House allowing the government to appeal sentences deemed unlawful or unreasonable. The House and Senate proposed the \"Military Justice Act of 2016\" with differences in language. The House allowed government appeals for unlawful sentences, while the Senate required military-specific sentencing criteria. The final bill included a comprehensive revision of the UCMJ, resolving differences between the two chambers. The final bill on the \"Military Justice Act of 2016\" included a comprehensive revision of the UCMJ, resolving differences between the House and Senate bills. Changes to Article 120 were made, prohibiting the wrongful use of position, rank, or authority to coerce acquiescence in a sexual act. Some provisions, such as interim guidance on sentencing parameters and an increase in minimum punishment for sex-related offenses, were not included in the final bill. The Medal of Honor (MOH) review process has been criticized for being lengthy and bureaucratic, leading to lost records and conclusions based on conflicting evidence. The reluctance to retroactively award the MOH or upgrade other awards aims to maintain the integrity of the process, but some believe it is overly restrictive, resulting in earned medals being denied. DOD periodically reviews inquiries and historical records to address these concerns. The DOD periodically reviews military awards and decorations, including the MOH process and recommendations for valor awards since September 11, 2001. The review results are due to the Secretary of Defense on September 30, 2017. Section 582 of the final bill waives time limitations to authorize the President to award certain valor awards during specific contingency operations. The President is authorized to award certain valor awards, including the Congressional Medal of Honor, to members of the Armed Forces during specific contingency operations. The time waiver expires on December 31, 2019. Section 583 of the final bill waives time limitations to authorize the award of the Medal of Honor to Gary M. Rose and James C. McCloughan for acts of valor during the Vietnam War. Rose is awarded for acts of valor from September 11 through 14, 1970, and McCloughan for acts of valor between May 13 and 15, 1969. Section 586 of the bill requires a review of service records for eligible Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander veterans of the Korean and Vietnam Wars previously awarded certain valor awards. If records support it, the Medal of Honor can be awarded, with a waiver of time limitations. Section 586 of the bill allows for a review of service records for eligible Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander veterans of the Korean and Vietnam Wars to potentially receive the Medal of Honor, with a waiver of time limitations if records support it. This section also applies to recipients of the Service Cross, Navy Cross, or Air Force Cross."
