    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Engineering Biology Research and Development Act of 2015\". The Congress finds that cellular and molecular processes can be utilized to develop new products, processes, and systems that benefit society, national security, and the economy. Engineering biology requires a diverse set of skills and long-term research for breakthroughs, necessitating government investment. The Federal Government can support the development of tools and technologies for engineering biology, as other countries are also investing in this field. The Federal Government can support the development of tools and technologies for engineering biology to maintain its competitive lead in this emerging field. A National Engineering Biology Initiative can establish new research directions, improve coordination, drive technology transfer, and ensure optimal returns on investment. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n(1) Advisory Committee: designated committee under section 5\n(2) Biomanufacturing: manufacturing products using biological technologies\n(3) Engineering Biology: science and engineering of cellular and molecular processes to develop new products and systems\n(4) Interagency Committee: designated committee under section 4(e)\n(5) Program: National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program established under section 4. The President will implement a National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program to advance societal well-being, national security, and economic productivity through research, supporting social science research, expanding training, accelerating commercialization, and improving interagency coordination. Program activities include sustained support for research and development through grants to individual investigators. The National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program aims to improve interagency planning and coordination of Federal Government activities related to engineering biology. Program activities include sustained support for research, education and training of students, and developing mechanisms to track economic benefits of engineering biology. The National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program focuses on research, education, and tracking economic benefits. It includes training students, developing mechanisms for economic tracking, and accelerating product commercialization through research opportunities, partnerships, entrepreneurship education, and startup support. The National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program aims to provide postdoctoral fellows with entrepreneurship education and training opportunities, support proof of concept activities, and encourage the formation of startup companies. It also focuses on expanding participation by reaching out to undergraduate and minority-serving institutions and promoting research collaborations. Program activities consider ethical, legal, environmental, and societal issues, including safeguards against unintended release of engineered materials. The program activities of the National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program address ethical, legal, environmental, and societal issues by supporting research in these areas and ensuring public input through mechanisms like citizen panels and consensus conferences. The President will designate an interagency committee on engineering biology to oversee the planning, management, and coordination of the Program, ensuring interagency coordination of Federal engineering biology research and activities. Public input and outreach will be integrated through mechanisms like citizen panels and consensus conferences. The Office of Science and Technology Policy will select a chairperson from the Interagency Committee to oversee the planning, management, and coordination of the Program. The Committee will coordinate Federal engineering biology research, establish goals and priorities, and develop a strategic plan every 5 years to guide the Program's activities. This plan will include support for interdisciplinary research, education, public outreach, and ethical considerations. The Program aims to support interdisciplinary engineering biology research and development, education, public outreach, and ethical considerations. It also focuses on moving research results into practical applications for societal benefit and competitiveness. Additionally, it proposes an interagency budget to maintain a robust research portfolio and utilize Federal programs like the Small Business Innovation Research Program. The Interagency Committee ensures funding balance, utilizes Federal programs like SBIR and STTR, considers recommendations from various groups, and prepares an annual report for Congress on the Program budget. The annual report includes the Program budget for the fiscal year, spending breakdown for each agency, assessment of Federal agencies' plan implementation, and details on Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer awards. SEC. 5. ADVISORY COMMITTEE. The President shall designate an advisory committee on engineering biology research and development with at least 12 members from various sectors. The committee will assess the progress, funding, priorities, and societal issues of the Program and report to the President every 3 years. The Advisory Committee on engineering biology research and development will assess the Program's activities, address societal issues, and report findings every 3 years to the President and relevant committees. The Federal Advisory Committee Act does not apply to this Committee. The Director of the National Science Foundation will convene a workshop with the National Academies to review ethical, legal, environmental, and societal issues related to engineering biology research. The workshop aims to assess current research, identify gaps, and provide recommendations for addressing research needs. A summary report of the workshop findings will be transmitted to Congress within 2 years of the Act's enactment. The National Science Foundation will support basic research at the intersection of biological, physical, and information sciences and engineering, research on environmental and social effects of engineering biology, provide research instrumentation support, and award grants for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. The Department of Commerce will establish a bioscience research program to advance standard reference materials and measurements for engineering biology and biomanufacturing. The National Institute of Standards and Technology will establish a bioscience research program to develop standard reference materials, provide access to advanced facilities, and offer technical expertise for engineering biology. The Department of Energy, as part of the Program, will support research in engineering biology disciplines such as synthetic biology, biofuel development, biobased materials, and environmental remediation. The Department of Energy will conduct and support research in engineering biology disciplines, including synthetic biology, biofuel development, biobased materials, and environmental remediation. They will also provide access to advanced facilities for research and testing. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration will conduct research in engineering biology fields related to Earth and space sciences, aeronautics, space technology, and space exploration. They will award grants for research on a competitive basis. The Program will award grants for research in engineering biology fields related to Earth and space sciences, aeronautics, space technology, and space exploration. The Environmental Protection Agency will support research on the environmental impact of engineering biology products and systems."
