    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Detection Canine Augmentation Act of 2005\". The Congress recognizes the importance of detection canines in homeland security to detect explosives, narcotics, and concealed humans in various areas. There is a shortage of detection canines available to assist law enforcement despite the authorization of new Border Patrol agents. Detection canines are crucial in homeland security to assist law enforcement in detecting explosives, narcotics, and concealed humans. The Congress has authorized 2,000 new Border Patrol agents annually for the next 5 years, but there is a lack of detection canines deployed with them. Canines are used in airports and need to be trained and deployed in mass transit systems. Urban search and rescue canines were effective during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Various agencies regularly use detection canines for security purposes. The Bureau of United States Customs and Border Protection, the United States Secret Service, the Coast Guard, and the Federal Protective Service use detection canines for security at National Special Security Events, Federal buildings, and sea ports. A hearing in 2005 highlighted a shortage of trained detection canines for homeland security activities. In fiscal years 2007 through 2011, the Secretary of Homeland Security will increase the number of trained detection canines by at least 25 percent in various agencies, including Customs and Border Protection, Transportation Security Administration, Coast Guard, Secret Service, Federal Protective Service, and Federal Emergency Management Agency. SEC. 4. COORDINATION AND ENHANCEMENT OF CANINE TRAINING PROGRAMS. The Secretary of Homeland Security is required to coordinate canine training programs for various security missions, utilize existing resources efficiently, and explore partnerships to increase the number of trained detection canines available to law enforcement agencies. A report on the Department's plan for this coordination must be submitted to relevant committees within 120 days of the enactment of the Act. The Secretary of Homeland Security must report to relevant committees within 120 days on the Department's plan to coordinate and consolidate its canine training programs, including increasing coordination with other Federal agencies like the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The Secretary of Homeland Security is required to prioritize increasing the use of domestically bred canines for counter-terrorism missions, consult with other agencies to encourage domestic breeding, and consolidate canine procurement to reduce costs across the Federal Government."
