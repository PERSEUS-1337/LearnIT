    "content": "The Energy and Water Development appropriations bill includes funding for various agencies, with a proposed budget of $38.02 billion for FY2020, which is 15% lower than the FY2019 appropriation. The bill also includes a 12% increase for DOE nuclear weapons activities. The FY2020 budget proposes substantial reductions in DOE energy research and development programs, including cuts in fossil fuels, nuclear energy, energy efficiency, and renewable energy R&D. The bill for Energy and Water Development appropriations in FY2019 was $44.66 billion, with a 12% increase for DOE nuclear weapons activities. The FY2020 budget request includes significant reductions in DOE energy research and development programs, with cuts in fossil fuels, nuclear energy, energy efficiency, and renewable energy R&D. Funding for various programs would be decreased, including energy efficiency grants, ARPA-E, and loan guarantee programs. Congressional consideration of the Energy and Water Development appropriations bill is influenced by budget enforcement measures. The Development appropriations bill is impacted by budget enforcement measures, including limits on discretionary spending from the Budget Control Act of 2011. These limits, enforced by sequestration, have not been increased for FY2020, leading to lower spending limits compared to FY2019. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 increased discretionary spending limits for FY2018 and FY2019, but limits for FY2020 remain unchanged. This results in lower limits for FY2020 compared to FY2019, with defense spending dropping by 11% and nondefense spending dropping by 9%. A bill to raise these limits for FY2020 and FY2021 has been reported by the House Budget Committee. Several issues raised by the Administration's budget request may generate controversy during congressional consideration of Energy and Water Development appropriations for FY2020. The Administration's budget request for Energy and Water Development appropriations for FY2020 could spark controversy in Congress. The request includes significant funding cuts for USACE and Reclamation, with reductions of 31% and 29% respectively compared to FY2019 levels. USACE's funding would limit new projects and prioritize those with higher benefits relative to costs, while the Administration proposes transferring a program from USACE to DOE. Reclamation's funding would be reduced to $1.11 billion for FY2020. The Administration's FY2020 budget request for Energy and Water Development appropriations includes significant funding cuts for USACE and Reclamation. USACE's funding would prioritize projects with higher benefits relative to costs, while the Administration proposes transferring a program from USACE to DOE. Reclamation's funding would be reduced by $461.6 million (29%) to $1.11 billion for FY2020. Additionally, the budget request includes mandatory proposals related to the Power Marketing Administrations, with plans to divest the assets of three PMAs that own transmission infrastructure. The Administration's FY2020 budget proposes divesting the assets of three Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) - BPA, SWPA, and WAPA - which own transmission infrastructure. This includes high voltage transmission lines and power substations, with an estimated $5.8 billion in savings over 10 years. The budget also suggests repealing borrowing authority for WAPA's Transmission Infrastructure Program and transitioning PMAs to a market-based rate setting approach, potentially generating $1.9 billion in new revenues over a decade. The budget proposes transitioning PMAs to a market-based rate setting approach, repealing borrowing authority for WAPA's Transmission Infrastructure Program, and divesting assets of three PMAs. These proposals have faced opposition from various groups and have not yet been acted upon by Congress. The FY2020 budget request proposes to terminate the DOE Weatherization Assistance Program and the State Energy Program (SEP), which provide grants for energy efficiency improvements in low-income housing units. The programs received $257 million and $55 million respectively in FY2019, despite previous proposals for elimination in FY2018 and FY2019. The DOE's Weatherization Assistance Program and State Energy Program (SEP) received $257 million and $55 million respectively in FY2019, despite previous proposals for elimination.

The DOE's proposed budget cuts for FY2020 include significant reductions in funding for energy research and development, with cuts of up to 75% for technologies such as wind energy, solar energy, geothermal technologies, and nuclear fuel cycle R&D. The focus is on shifting resources towards early-stage R&D and increasing reliance on the private sector for later-stage research and commercialization. Additionally, the budget includes new funding for a proposed nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, NV, with $116 million allocated for seeking an NRC license and developing interim nuclear waste storage capacity. The DOE's FY2020 budget includes $116 million for seeking an NRC license and developing interim nuclear waste storage capacity at the Yucca Mountain repository. Funding would come from two appropriations accounts, with $90 million from Nuclear Waste Disposal and $26 million from Defense Nuclear Waste Disposal. The Yucca Mountain site's license application was submitted in 2008 but was suspended in 2011 due to lack of funding. The Obama Administration deemed the site \"unworkable\" due to opposition from Nevada. The House approved funding for Yucca Mountain in FY2018 and proposed a $100 million increase for FY2019, but the Senate did not include it in the bills. The FY2019 Senate bill also included a pilot program for an interim nuclear waste storage facility at a voluntary site. The Senate Appropriations Committee did not include funding for Yucca Mountain in FY2018 or FY2019. The FY2019 Senate bill proposed a pilot program for an interim nuclear waste storage facility. The FY2020 budget request aims to halt further loans and loan guarantees for various DOE programs. The FY2020 budget request aims to halt further loan guarantees under DOE's Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program and rescind unused prior-year authority for loan guarantee commitments. Additionally, $169.5 million in unspent appropriations would cover loan guarantee \"subsidy costs.\" DOE provided $3.7 billion in additional Title 17 loan guarantees for new reactors at the Vogtle nuclear plant in Georgia. The Administration's request includes $107 million for the U.S. contribution to the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) in France.

Congressional concerns have been raised about ITER's management, schedule, and costs. The U.S. contributes to the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project in France with funding between $4.0 billion and $6.5 billion. The Advanced Research Projects Agency\u2014Energy (ARPA-E) faces potential elimination in the FY2020 budget, despite Congress increasing its funding in previous years. ARPA-E funds research on transformative energy technologies, and its phaseout would require oversight and management. The FY2020 budget proposes to terminate ARPA-E despite Congress increasing its funding in previous years. Oversight and management would still be required during a phaseout period. The FY2020 budget for DOE Weapons Activities is 12% greater than the FY2019 enacted level, with increases in funding for nuclear warhead life-extension programs. Notable increases include the W80-4 LEP by 37% and funding initiation for the W87-1 LEP.
