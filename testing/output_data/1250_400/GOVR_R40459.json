DOD may use up to 1% of US refined petroleum products, with foreign purchases potentially doubling consumption. The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) procures fuel for all DOD services and agencies, both in the US and overseas. DESC's origins trace back to World War II, evolving into the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) entity managing DOD's petroleum products and coal. In 1998, it became the Defense Energy Support Center with an expanded energy product management mission. The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), now known as the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), manages DOD's petroleum products and coal. DESC awards fuel contracts based on lowest cost, including bulk petroleum products, ships' bunker fuel, and refueling at commercial airports. DOD's fuel purchases from FY2000 to FY2008 are compared to overall spending, prices paid, and quantities purchased. The report summarizes DOD's fuel purchases from FY2000 to FY2008, comparing spending, prices, and quantities to overall DOD spending. It discusses refining, refineries supplying jet fuel, and fuel procurement practices. Recent legislation directs DOD to consider alternative fuels and stimulate commercial interest in supplying them. The DOD is directed to consider alternative fuels to meet its needs and stimulate commercial interest in supplying them. Recent high fuel prices have led to interest in producing alternative fuels from coal and oil shale, but no projects have reached commercial operation yet. Legislation now prevents federal agencies from spending taxpayer dollars on new fuel sources that worsen global warming. Proposed rules on greenhouse gas emission reporting may have minimal impact on refineries. Legislation to cap greenhouse gas emissions could affect refinery operations and the industry's responsiveness to DOD's fuel requirements. DOD's fuel consumption varies yearly based on mission changes and operational tempo, with the majority of bulk fuel purchases being JP-8 jet fuel for the Air Force and Army, and JP-5 jet fuel for the Navy. All services consume diesel fuel to varying degrees. DESC's bulk fuel purchases primarily consist of JP-8 jet fuel for the Air Force and Army, with the Navy consuming JP-5 jet fuel. Overall DESC fuel expenditures increased significantly from $3.6 billion in FY2000 to nearly $18 billion by FY2008, despite only a 30% increase in actual volumes purchased. DESC's purchases do not always align with DOD's actual consumption, as DESC may draw fuel from storage or replenish fuel stores with purchases. DESC's petroleum product purchases, summarized by volume and total cost, do not always correspond with DOD's actual consumption. Fuel costs and average prices continued to rise due to increasing crude oil prices and refining margins. The average cost of all petroleum products purchased increased significantly from $34.62 per barrel in FY2000 to over $133 per barrel in FY2008. Jet and diesel fuel prices also increased, reversing the price advantage military jet fuels once held over commercial equivalents. Earlier, JP-8 and JP-5 jet fuels had a price advantage over Jet A fuel, but this changed after setbacks in commercial aviation post-9/11 and the Iraq invasion in 2003. Fuel prices, including jet and diesel, increased, leading to a wider margin between crude oil cost and refined product prices. DESC responded by purchasing alternate jet fuels and increasing diesel fuel purchases when offered at lower prices than military specification fuel. Outlays represent cash payments made to liquidate government obligations in a fiscal year. From FY2000 through FY2007, total defense outlays increased 200%, with Operation and Maintenance spending increasing by 231%. Fuel costs rose by 497% during the same period, reaching 3% of DOD's spending by FY2008. The U.S. produces one-third of its crude oil, with the rest supplied by other countries. The U.S. produces one-third of its crude oil, with the rest supplied by other countries. Refineries have increasingly turned to heavier sour crudes due to diminishing supply of sweet crudes. Crude oil contains natural components for gasoline, kerosene/jet fuel, and diesel fuel. Refineries process residuum into gasoline and middle distillate range products using heat and pressure. Refineries process crude oil into various petroleum products such as gasoline, kerosene/jet fuel, and diesel fuel through atmospheric distillation. They may also use heat, pressure, hydrogen, and catalysts for further refining. Different grades of crude oil, such as light sweet or heavy sour, require specific processing methods. Topping refineries separate crude oil through distillation, while specifications for jet fuel are more stringent than for kerosene. Refineries process crude oil into various petroleum products through different refining methods. Topping refineries separate crude oil simply by distillation, while hydroskimming refineries run light sweet crude to produce gasoline. Cracking refineries add additional processes to run light sour crude, and coking refineries use coking/resid destruction to process medium/sour crude oil. The refinery's atmospheric distillation capacity determines its crude oil processing limit. Secondary processing units like catalytic cracking and coking add complexity to the refinery. The Nelson Complexity Index rates the proportion of secondary processes to primary distillation capacity in refineries. Refineries with coking capacity can increase their output volume. Gulf Coast refineries with higher complexity can yield significant amounts of jet fuel and diesel. Upgrading processes in refineries is necessary due to changes in crude oil supplies. Gulf Coast refineries with coking capacity can yield up to 8% jet fuel and over 30% diesel. Refineries are upgrading processes to handle heavier crude oils and meet EPA regulations for ultra-low sulfur diesel by 2010. Petroleum product pipelines transport various fuels to limit sulfur contamination. The U.S. Army has adopted the ASTM standard for diesel fuel quality, aiming to minimize the length of the fuel supply chain to a theater of operation. This involves relying on regionally supplied diesel fuel or JP-8, which can expose vehicles to fuel with elevated sulfur levels. The DOD has steadily substituted JP-8 for diesel fuel in operating land-based equipment tactical vehicles and equipment, following the \"single battlefield fuel\" concept. The U.S. Army has adopted the ASTM standard MIL-DTL-83133E for JP-8 fuel, limiting sulfur content to 3,000 ppm. EPA guidelines recognize the need for tactical vehicles to operate on JP-8 or JP-5. The Supreme Court ruled EPA can regulate CO2 emissions from vehicles. EPA proposed in 2009 that greenhouse gases contribute to emissions. The EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from automobiles and has proposed that greenhouse gases contribute to air pollution. A recent Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases rule would require petroleum refineries to report emissions, with potential future regulations to cap emissions. The EPA has proposed a rule that would require petroleum refineries to report emissions, which represent approximately 3% of U.S. GHG emissions. Compliance costs could be minimal, but the rule sets the stage for future legislation to cap emissions. Bills like H.R. 2454 aim to establish a cap-and-trade system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions from refineries. This legislation would gradually reduce emissions by 83% and allow trading of emissions permits. Currently, there are 142 refineries operating in the United States. Between FY2003 and FY2008, DESC reported its top domestic suppliers as Shell, Valero Marketing and Supply Company, ExxonMobil, and BP Corporation. These companies operate 31 refineries in the United States with nearly 6 million barrels per day of crude capacity. The number of refineries in the US declined from 155 to 141 between 2000 and 2009, but atmospheric crude oil distillation capacity increased to 18.6 million barrels per stream day. The number of refineries in the United States declined from 155 to 141 between 2000 and 2009. The atmospheric crude oil distillation capacity increased to 18.6 million barrels per stream day. The median capacity of currently operating refineries is roughly 80,000 bpd, with some refineries above the median making up 85% of overall U.S. refining capacity. Gulf Coast refineries may yield up to 8% jet fuel and over 30% diesel fuel. U.S. refineries produce roughly ten times more commercial jet fuel than military specification jet fuel annually. The U.S. refining industry produces more commercial jet fuel than military jet fuel annually. Military jet fuel production ranges from 9% to 11% of U.S. jet fuel production but makes up less than 1% of all refined petroleum products. DESC's jet fuel purchases exceed U.S. refineries' output, leading to increased purchases of commercial jet fuels to meet demand. This strategy has reduced DESC's spending as commercial jet fuel prices are lower. The lack of U.S. refining capacity does not compromise DOD's fuel supply. DESC has increased its purchase of commercial jet fuels like Jet A to make up for the disparity in military jet fuel production. This strategy has reduced DESC's spending as commercial jet fuel prices are lower. To ensure a closer supply chain, DESC also contracts with foreign refineries and suppliers to support U.S. forces outside the continental United States. The Secretary of the Navy has the authority to procure fuel in the best way possible for its intended use. The Secretary of the Navy has the authority to procure fuel in the best way possible for its intended use, relying on general procurement authority under 10 U.S.C. 2304. DESC awards contracts and purchases fuel in a one-step process under the Defense Working Capital Fund, transferring fuel to DOD customers internally. This allows for price breaks on large quantity purchases and provides stabilized prices for all products during the fiscal year. The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) procures fuel for the Department of Defense (DOD) through the Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF), allowing for price breaks on large quantity purchases and stabilized prices for all products during the fiscal year. The acquisition process is defined by Title 41 U.S.C. Section 403, with procurement governed by Title 10 U.S.C. Chapter 137 and the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) in Title 48 CFR. The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) procures fuel for the Department of Defense (DOD) through the Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF), allowing for price breaks on large quantity purchases and stabilized prices for all products during the fiscal year. The primary document for federal agency acquisition regulations is the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) in Title 48 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). DESC typically awards one-year bulk-fuel contracts and multi-year direct delivery fuel contracts using fixed-price contracts with economic price adjustment clauses. DESC uses economic price adjustment provisions in contracts for refined petroleum products. Supplies and related services are eligible for multi-year contracting provisions. DOD can enter initial five-year contracts for liquid fuels or natural gas with options for renewals up to twenty years. Multiyear contracts for supplies or services can last up to five program years, with performance in later years contingent on fund appropriations. These contracts differ from multiple year contracts by buying multiple years' worth of products or services without needing to exercise options each year. The authority for multiyear contracts comes from general procurement statutes under 10 U.S.C. 2306b. DOD agencies can use multiyear contracts for supplies to promote national security. The authority for multiyear contracts for supplies comes from general procurement statutes under 10 U.S.C. 2306b. DOD agencies can enter into these contracts to promote national security and achieve substantial cost savings. If Congress does not appropriate funds for succeeding years, the contract must be canceled. Multiyear contracting is encouraged to take advantage of lower costs and promote national security objectives. The contract cannot exceed $500 million until approved by the Secretary of Defense. The authority for multiyear contracts for supplies, in addition to the conditions listed in FAR 17.105-1(b), can be entered into if it promotes national security (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2306b (a) (6)). The contract cannot exceed $500 million until approved by the Secretary of Defense. DOD is authorized to procure fuel derived from coal, oil shale, and tar sands under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2922d, including multi-year contracts. The Secretary of Defense has waiver authority over acquisition of alternative fuels based on market conditions. The Secretary may waive provisions of law for DOD's acquisition of defined fuel sources like petroleum, natural gas, coal, and coke based on market conditions. Waiver authority includes terms and conditions of contracts, such as the five-year limit on multi-year contracts. DESC has not decided on waiving statutory limits on multiyear contracts to avoid jeopardizing sales authority granted under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2922e. Delivery price is based on the \"lowest laid down cost\" to the government. DESC bases contract delivery price on the \"lowest laid down cost\" to the government, which includes a surcharge for operating costs. While the contract specifies the final destination, additional costs may be incurred by the operational command for fuel delivery. The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for FY2009 now requires fuel logistics to be considered in acquisition processes, ensuring that new military capabilities factor in life-cycle cost analysis. The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for FY2009 requires fuel logistics to be factored into acquisition processes, considering the fully burdened cost of fuel for new military capabilities. DOD experienced a 500% increase in fuel costs over the past decade, leading to budget cuts in training and operations. Fuel costs have represented a significant portion of DOD spending, reaching as high as 3% of total spending and over 7% of the Operation and Maintenance budget. In 2006, rising fuel costs and military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan led the Air Force to reduce funding for training Air Combat Command aircrews. Fuel costs have been a significant expense for the Department of Defense (DOD), reaching up to 3% of total spending and over 7% of the Operation and Maintenance budget in the past decade. Unlike the airline industry, DOD has limited options to offset high fuel costs, resorting to requesting supplemental appropriations. DOD has explored strategies like fuel hedging, multi-year contracting, and alternative fuels to mitigate the impact of fuel price fluctuations and supply shortages. The FY2007 Emergency Supplemental Request addresses baseline fuel cost increases due to market fluctuations. DOD has implemented strategies like fuel hedging, multi-year contracts, and using commercial Jet A fuel to reduce costs and expand supplies. DESC's business model includes fixed-price contracts with economic price adjustment clauses to manage fuel price swings. This approach limits DESC's risk but does not control costs during rapid price increases. DESC's business model includes fixed-price contracts with economic price adjustment clauses to manage fuel price swings. This approach limits DESC's risk but does not control costs during rapid price increases. The airline industry uses hedging strategies to minimize the risk of future jet fuel price increases, such as buying \"futures\" contracts to lock in prices. Southwest Airlines successfully hedged its fuel at a lower price when crude oil prices peaked in 2008. The Defense Business Board also explored fuel hedging options for DOD to reduce exposure to price volatility. The Fuel Hedging Task Group was convened to reduce DOD's exposure to fuel price volatility. They suggested engaging in \"no-market\" hedging through the Department of the Interior's Mineral Management Service. The group proposed transferring funds between Interior and Defense to offset fuel costs during crude oil price spikes. However, challenges exist due to the allocation of revenues from Outer Continental Shelf leases and royalties-in-kind paid by OCS lessees. Congress established the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to prevent supply disruptions. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was created by Congress in response to the 1970s Arab oil embargo to prevent supply disruptions. OCS lessees pay royalties-in-kind, with oil delivered to the SPR. The SPR can hold up to 727 million barrels, representing 70 days of imported supply. Drawdowns can be in the form of a sale or exchange. In 1991, President George H.W. Bush's drawdown authorization led to a rapid crude oil price decline. Refineries processing heavy oil may face capacity issues if they run lighter oils, as 40% of U.S. refined crude in 2006 was heavier than SPR oil. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported in 2006 that 40% of U.S. refined crude was heavier than oil stored in the SPR, causing capacity issues for refineries. The types of oil in the SPR are not fully compatible with 36 vulnerable refineries, leading to a potential 5% decrease in U.S. refining throughput. The SPR's role in mitigating a DOD fuel supply disruption is not clearly defined, as refineries may not be able to produce enough jet fuel due to operational limitations. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 prohibits federal agencies from procuring alternative fuels without considering greenhouse gas emissions. The Air Force abandoned plans for a coal-to-liquid fuel plant, but DESC is interested in a pilot program. The Air Force abandoned plans for a coal-to-liquid fuel plant, but DESC is interested in a pilot program for synthetic fuels to support DOD JP-8 fuel requirements in Alaska. Despite declining crude oil prices, the possibility of supply shortages and price spikes remains. DOD is focusing on efficiency due to policy and economic constraints, considering the fully burdened cost of fuel for military operations. Refinery operators may question their responsiveness to DOD's procurement announcements during periods of high petroleum prices. The refining sector's lack of responsiveness to DOD's procurement announcements during high petroleum prices may concern Congress. Refinery operators may question the value of emission credits in response to proposed greenhouse gas emission caps. Congress may worry about potential refinery shutdowns impacting defense fuel suppliers. For background on alternative fuel sources and greenhouse gas legislation, refer to CRS reports. Avgas is high octane fuel for light aircraft. The curr_chunk discusses various types of fuels such as avgas, DFM, DF2, and FSII, along with trade terms like FOB. It also provides information on the cap-and-trade system and international transportation contracts. The curr_chunk explains trade terms related to international transportation contracts, specifically focusing on Jet A-1, Jet A, and Jet B fuels used in civilian aviation. It details the specifications and differences between these fuels, highlighting their flash points and freeze points. Jet B is a distillate fuel with a higher freeze point than Jet A-1, mainly used in very cold climates. It is supplied under ASTM D1655 specification in the United States and CAN/CGSB 3.23 in Canada. JP-4 and JP-5 are military equivalents of Jet B, with additional additives for corrosion inhibition and anti-icing. JP-5 is specifically designed for aircraft carriers due to its lower fire risk in confined spaces. JP-4, JP-5, and JP-8 are military aviation fuels with specific specifications and uses. JP-4 meets MIL-DTL-5624 U and DEF STAN 91-88 AVTAG/FSII standards, while JP-5 is designed for aircraft carriers with a higher flash-point. JP-8, the military equivalent of Jet A-1, contains corrosion and icing inhibitors, with the Air Force switching to it in 1996 for safety reasons. JP-8, a naphtha-based fuel, is used by the Alaska Air Guard for its cold-climate properties. It contains less benzene and n-hexane than JP-4, with an ASTM specification of MIL-DTL-83133. JP-8+100 includes an additive for thermal stability and is also used in diesel-powered tactical ground vehicles. Middle Distillate range fuels include kerosene, jet fuel, and diesel fuel. Mogas is the primary fuel for non-tactical ground vehicles. Multiyear contracting is a method to acquire known requirements for up to five years. Multiyear contracting is a special method to acquire known requirements for up to five years, even if total funds may not be available at the time of contract award. Naphtha is a petroleum distillate used in gasoline production for catalytic reforming."
