    "content": "The NTSB, established in 1967 under the DOT, investigates transportation accidents to identify safety improvements. In 1974, it became independent to conduct unbiased investigations and make safety recommendations. The agency determines accident causes, recommends safety improvements, assists victims' families, and serves as a board of appeals for transportation regulatory actions. It lacks authority to enforce its recommendations or regulate safety practices. The NTSB, established in 1967 under the DOT, investigates transportation accidents to identify safety improvements. It serves as a board of appeals for certain transportation regulatory actions and provides assistance to victims' families in major airline and passenger rail disasters. The agency consists of a five-member board and approximately 420 staff members, with regional offices in four locations. The NTSB Reauthorization Act of 2006 requires the agency to maintain at least one full-time employee in every state located more than 1,000 miles from the nearest regional office for initial investigative response to accidents. The NTSB, established in 1967 under the DOT, investigates transportation accidents to identify safety improvements. The NTSB Reauthorization Act of 2006 requires the agency to maintain at least one full-time employee in every state located more than 1,000 miles from the nearest regional office for initial investigative response to accidents. This measure directly impacts Hawaii, where the NTSB does not have a field office. The agency consists of a five-member board and approximately 420 staff members, with regional offices in four locations. Investigative and support staff are organized under separate offices for each transportation mode. The NTSB consists of a five-member board with staff organized by transportation mode. The agency serves as a court of appeals for airmen and mariners and has an Office of Safety Recommendations and Communications. They investigate transportation accidents and safety issues. The NTSB investigates transportation accidents involving civil aircraft, public aircraft, highway and railroad grade crossing accidents, railroad accidents with passenger trains, pipeline accidents, major marine casualties, and other catastrophic accidents. They also provide safety recommendations and coordinate communications with Congress and transportation stakeholders. The NTSB investigates transportation accidents involving various modes of transportation in the U.S., including civil aircraft, public aircraft, highway and railroad accidents, pipeline accidents, and major marine casualties. They rely on experts from manufacturers, transportation providers, and regulatory agencies through the \"party process\" to assist with investigations, ensuring independence in their findings and conclusions. The NTSB ensures independence in its investigations by relying on experts through the \"party process\" but bases its conclusions strictly on its own analysis. Formal procedures allow parties to petition for reconsideration of findings. The Safety Board must meet publicly on most matters related to accident investigations and members must disclose financial interests. Despite safeguards, there is still potential for external influence on the NTSB process. The NTSB must meet publicly on accident investigations and disclose financial interests. Despite safeguards, external influence on the process is possible. Balancing unique data from parties with impartiality is a challenge. Competing perspectives can prolong investigations. International standards guide aviation accident investigations. The NTSB participates in foreign aviation accident investigations as per international standards. They may assist other countries even without a vested interest, and may be reimbursed for costs. Legislative changes allow for offsetting collections from outside entities. The NTSB can be reimbursed for costs incurred during overseas investigations from outside entities like foreign governments. Legislative changes now allow for offsetting collections from such receipts, which were previously limited to activities of the NTSB Academy. The NTSB has recovered some costs through the Safe Skies for Africa program, with annual costs for international investigations ranging from under $1 million to almost $2.4 million. The NTSB issues safety recommendations to effect change in transportation safety regulations and practices. The NTSB issues safety recommendations to influence transportation safety regulations and practices. Since 1967, over 14,300 recommendations have been made to various recipients, with about 82% leading to implemented safety improvements. DOT agencies must respond to recommendations within 90 days, but there is no legal requirement to adopt them. The NTSB advocates for the implementation of its recommendations. The NTSB issues safety recommendations to influence transportation safety regulations and practices. Agencies must respond to recommendations within 90 days, but there is no legal requirement to adopt them. The NTSB advocates for implementation, highlighting key safety recommendations on a \"Most Wanted\" list. Implementation may be delayed due to rulemaking processes and feasibility concerns. The NTSB issues safety recommendations to influence transportation safety regulations and practices. The \"Most Wanted\" list highlights key safety improvements, including reducing fatigue-related accidents, improving rail transit safety oversight, promoting collision avoidance technologies, and strengthening occupant protection. These recommendations typically require action from DOT and states, often involving statutory and regulatory changes. The NTSB's advocacy programs have influenced transportation agencies' regulatory agenda and congressional decisions. The NTSB issues safety recommendations to influence transportation safety regulations and practices, with the \"Most Wanted\" list highlighting key improvements. These recommendations often require action from DOT and states, leading to statutory and regulatory changes. NTSB's advocacy programs have influenced transportation agencies and congressional decisions, resulting in legislation such as positive train control systems, airline pilot fatigue regulations, distracted driving laws, helicopter air ambulance safety standards, and pipeline safety improvements. Legislation like the FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016 draw on NTSB investigations and recommendations for airline pilot records database implementation and pilot training modifications. The FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016 (P.L. 114-190) incorporates NTSB recommendations for airline pilot training and mental health screening. It mandates the implementation of an airline pilot records database, training to monitor automated systems, and assesses mental health screening for pilots. These measures address concerns raised by NTSB investigations into pilot-involved accidents and incidents like the Asiana Airlines crash in 2013 and the Germanwings suicide downing in 2015. The NTSB raised concerns about pilot mental health following aviation accidents like the Germanwings suicide in 2015. Section 2105 of the FAA Extension Act mandates updates to crash-resistant helicopter fuel systems. The Pipeline Safety Act of 2011 addressed pipeline safety with provisions for more inspectors and automatic shutoff valves. The Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (Pipeline Safety Act; P.L. 112-90) included provisions to enhance pipeline safety, such as increasing federal inspectors, requiring automatic shutoff valves, verifying operating pressure, and increasing penalties for violations. The Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (RSIA08; P.L. 110-432) mandated positive train control on railroads to prevent incidents caused by human error. Positive train control is a communication and signaling system identified by the NTSB to prevent incidents caused by operator or dispatcher error. The NTSB also prioritizes minimizing operator distractions to improve transportation safety. Congress established a distracted driving incentive grant program in 2012 to discourage texting and cell-phone use while driving. Only one state qualified for a grant under this program in FY2014 and FY2015. In FY2014 and FY2015, only one state qualified for a grant under a distracted driving incentive program. The requirement for an increased fine for repeat offenders was removed in December 2015, allowing more states to qualify for grants. The NTSB's funding includes a base authorization, emergency fund, and supplemental appropriations for large investigations. The NTSB's funding historically included a base authorization, emergency fund for unforeseen accident costs, and supplemental appropriations for complex investigations. The existing statute maintains $2 million in the emergency fund, with authorization to increase it to $4 million. The NTSB has not used the emergency fund or sought supplemental appropriations in over a decade. The GAO evaluates the NTSB's operations and activities, including information management, resource management, workforce development, and accident investigations. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) evaluates the NTSB's operations and activities, including information management, resource management, workforce development, and accident investigations. The NTSB has been responsive to GAO findings and has fully implemented recommendations in the past. GAO recommended improvements in training center utilization, safety recommendation close-out processes, interagency communications, financial management, and workforce diversity management. The GAO recommended improvements in training center utilization, safety recommendation close-out processes, interagency communications, financial management, and workforce diversity management at the NTSB. Current issues include staffing resources, management of the NTSB Academy, recoverability of vehicle recorders, privacy of data collected, and potential use of recorder data. Legislation in the 114th Congress addresses NTSB funding and resources for railroad accident investigations. In the 114th Congress, legislation addressing railroad safety directly considers NTSB funding and resources for accident investigations. Despite increased staffing, limited resources have led to delays in accident investigations, including some pipeline and railroad accidents. The NTSB has a strategic human capital plan to address competency gaps and workforce diversity. Congress may debate the NTSB's ability to investigate all mandated accidents, especially fatal grade crossing and trespasser incidents. The NTSB faces challenges in investigating pipeline and railroad accidents, particularly fatal grade crossing and trespasser incidents. Congress may need to consider additional staffing to meet statutory requirements and enhance recruitment and retention of field investigators and specialists. Concerns about staffing shortages and skill gaps have been raised, especially in the Office of Railroad, Pipeline, and Hazardous Materials. The NTSB is experiencing staffing shortages and skill gaps in critical areas, particularly in the Office of Railroad, Pipeline, and Hazardous Materials. Despite efforts to improve training and operations through a contract with George Washington University, the NTSB Training Center has not achieved financial self-sufficiency and operates at a deficit. The NTSB Training Center, mandated to achieve financial self-sufficiency, has consistently operated at a deficit. Despite training NTSB staff and industry personnel, revenues from fees have not covered costs. The center also hosts transportation safety meetings but struggles to recover costs. A 2006 GAO study suggested that increasing revenues or reducing costs may not fully offset the training center's expenses. The NTSB Training Center has not been able to fully recover training center costs, despite hosting transportation safety meetings and training NTSB staff and industry personnel. A 2006 GAO study highlighted financial challenges and violations of the Anti-Deficiency Act related to the lease on the NTSB Academy facility. Remedies suggested include renegotiating the lease, obtaining a deficiency appropriation, or vacating the space. The NTSB Training Center has improved utilization and cost recovery, but still fails to recoup all operating costs. GAO suggests vacating the space as a cost-effective strategy, but potential benefits were not fully considered. Congressional oversight is needed to weigh the costs and benefits of maintaining the training center. The NTSB Training Center has seen improved cost recovery, with the annual operating deficit decreasing from $6.3 million in FY2004 to $2 million-$2.5 million in FY2013-FY2015. However, it still does not cover all operating costs. Data recorders are crucial investigative tools in aviation, but challenges exist in promptly recovering them after accidents and concerns about privacy. The challenges of promptly recovering data recorders after aviation accidents, particularly in cases like Air France flight 447, EgyptAir flight 804, and Malaysia Airlines flight 370, have raised concerns about privacy and the need for recorders to transmit data for easier retrieval without underwater recovery. The NTSB has issued safety recommendations to address these issues. The NTSB issued aviation safety recommendations urging aircraft used for overwater flights to transmit data on impact location and carry recorders allowing for the recovery of flight data parameters. They also called for harmonization of technologies and regulations with foreign aviation authorities. The Safe Aviation and Flight Emergency Tracking Act of 2015 would require certain large passenger aircraft to have continuous tracking information technology. The Safe Aviation and Flight Emergency Tracking Act of 2015 aims to improve the recovery of flight data and cockpit voice recorders through continuous tracking technology. The sinking of the U.S.-flag cargo vessel El Faro in 2015 highlighted concerns over locating and recovering maritime voyage data recorders. Under SOLAS regulations, certain vessels are required to carry retrievable fixed-mount or float-free voyage data recorders. New regulations mandate both types of recorders for new ships and installations. The NTSB has not made specific recommendations regarding the recovery or survivability characteristics of maritime voyage data recorders, but concerns over data recovery may prompt congressional interest in potential options to assist investigators. Event recorders are assisting accident investigators in various modes of transportation, raising questions about privacy and the use of data outside investigative proceedings. The Driver Privacy Act of 2015 addresses these concerns. Event recorders are aiding accident investigators in transportation modes like rail, trucking, and passenger cars. The Driver Privacy Act of 2015 aims to restrict access to data from event data recorders in passenger vehicles to protect privacy, allowing access only under specific circumstances such as court authorization, owner consent, or for safety research purposes. The bill aims to restrict access to event data recorders in vehicles for privacy protection, allowing access only under specific circumstances such as investigations, emergency response, and safety research. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is required to study and regulate the duration of data capture for crash investigations. Increased interest in railroad accident investigations has been prompted by recent incidents, with the NTSB facing resource challenges in investigating all required accidents. Increased interest in railroad accident investigations due to recent incidents, NTSB lacks resources to investigate all accidents as required by statute. Legislation proposes specific funding for NTSB railroad accident investigations and addresses safety recommendations, including plans for positive train control systems and grants for implementation. Additionally, a study on the effectiveness of these systems in reducing highway-rail grade crossing accidents would be conducted."
