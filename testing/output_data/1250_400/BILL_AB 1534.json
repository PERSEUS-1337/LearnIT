    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature in California aims to ensure county assessors follow state laws accurately for consistent assessment practices. They want decisions on property exemptions and ownership changes to be made by certified staff efficiently. Education and certification requirements will be implemented with the advice of the State Board of Equalization. Section 674 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended and renumbered to 681. Section 674 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to require competitive bids for appraisal work contracts, confidentiality of assessee information, and authorization for contractors to request information from assesses. Section 674 of the Revenue and Taxation Code now requires competitive bids for appraisal work contracts and ensures confidentiality of assessee information. The assessor or authorized contractor may request information from the assessee, but the contractor must not share appraisal data with unauthorized parties. After the contract ends, the contractor must return all assessee records to the assessor and provide a written declaration of compliance within 90 days. Section 674 of the Revenue and Taxation Code mandates competitive bids for appraisal contracts, ensuring confidentiality of assessee information. Contractors must return all records to the assessor and provide a written declaration of compliance. An assessor or their employee must hold a valid assessment analyst certificate to make decisions on changes in ownership. Article 8.5 states that assessors or their employees must hold a valid assessment analyst certificate issued by the board to make decisions on changes in ownership and property tax exemptions, except for homeowners' exemption claims. The board requires applicants for an assessment analyst certificate to pass an examination to demonstrate competency in making change in ownership or exemption decisions. Examinations are prepared with the assistance of a committee of assessors. Applicants denied a certificate have the right to a review. Holding a valid appraiser's or advanced appraiser's certificate exempts assessors from this requirement. The board requires assessment analysts to complete 24 hours of training annually to maintain certification, with excess training hours carrying over for up to three years. Failure to comply may result in certificate revocation following procedures outlined in the Administrative Procedure Act. The board requires assessment analysts to complete 24 hours of training annually to maintain certification, with excess training hours carrying over for up to three years. Failure to complete training may lead to certificate revocation following procedures in the Administrative Procedure Act. Advanced assessment analyst certification requires completion of advanced training or passing an advanced level examination, with ongoing training requirements of 12 hours per year to retain certification. The board prescribes an advanced course of study and examination for advanced assessment analysts. To maintain certification, holders must complete 12 hours of training annually, with excess hours carrying over for up to two years. Failure to comply may result in certificate revocation following procedures in the Administrative Procedure Act. Training includes updates on case law, statutory law, and administrative rules. Training for the advanced assessment analyst certificate includes updates on case law, statutory law, and administrative rules. Applicants must disclose financial interests annually. The board may issue a temporary certificate for new assessors or employees, valid for up to one year. Renewal of temporary certificates is not allowed. The board may issue an interim certificate to current assessors or employees of the county assessor's office to allow them to apply for an examination. The interim certificate is valid for up to four years, unless the person is elected or appointed as assessor. The article does not prevent assessors from efficiently managing staff resources, as long as noncertificated staff do not make exemption or ownership decisions. This article applies only in counties that have passed a resolution requiring certification."
