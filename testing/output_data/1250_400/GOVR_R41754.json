    "content": "The Senate Appropriations Committee reported a bill appropriating funds for the Departments of Transportation and Housing and Urban Development for FY2013. The bill recommends $3.210 billion for activities funded under the Community Development Fund account, including the Community Development Block Grant Program. The President's budget proposal for FY2013 includes $3.143 billion for the Community Development Fund account, supporting neighborhood revitalization and economic development activities. The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), provides financial assistance for neighborhood revitalization, housing rehabilitation, and economic development. The Obama Administration's budget request for FY2013 includes $3.143 billion for activities funded under the CDF account. The Obama Administration's FY2013 budget request includes $3.143 billion for activities funded under the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Community Development Fund (CDF) account, representing 8.9% of the total discretionary budget authority. The proposal would increase funding for CDF account activities by 4.5% or $135 million, reinstating funding for the Sustainable Communities Initiative and transferring funding for Section 4 capacity building activities. The Administration's FY2013 budget proposal includes $3.143 billion for activities funded under the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Community Development Fund (CDF) account. Funding for the CDBG formula grants would remain unchanged from FY2012, with $2.948.1 billion requested for the CDBG formula component. Additionally, $60 million is requested for Indian tribes, and funding for the SCI program activities would be reinstated. The Administration's FY2013 budget proposes reinstating funding for SCI program activities, requesting an appropriation of $100 million. The funds would support three components: Regional Integrated Planning Grants ($46 million), Community Challenge Grants ($46 million), and other initiatives to develop sustainable communities. The Administration's FY2013 budget proposes funding for various sustainable community initiatives, including Regional Integrated Planning Grants, Community Challenge Grants, and research on housing-transportation integration. Grants would focus on housing, transportation, economic development, energy, and land use planning. $46 million would be awarded to communities for reforming building codes and zoning ordinances to promote sustainable growth. $8 million would be allocated for research to evaluate the benefits of these efforts. The Administration's FY2013 budget proposes funding for sustainable community initiatives, including Regional Integrated Planning Grants and Community Challenge Grants. $3 million is requested for technical support in developing a residential energy modeling system and common energy standards. The CDBG Section 108 Loan Guarantee program allows states and communities to borrow up to five times their annual CDBG allocation for economic development activities. The Administration's budget proposes doubling the CDBG program's loan commitment ceiling from $240 million in FY2012 to $500 million in FY2013 to attract private capital for economic development activities. Communities can borrow up to five times their annual allocation for 20 years through bond issuance, with proceeds used for job creation and meeting CDBG program goals. The budget aims to help local governments finance large-scale job creation activities amidst credit market difficulties. The Administration's budget proposes increasing the CDBG program's loan commitment ceiling to $500 million in FY2013 to aid local governments in financing job creation activities. Additionally, a fee-based assessment for borrowers accessing the program is suggested to eliminate the need for an appropriated credit subsidy. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends $3.210 billion for CDF activities in FY2013, including $3.100 billion for CDBG formula grants, a 5% increase from the previous year. The bill recommends $3.210 billion for Urban Development and Related Agencies for FY2013, including $3.100 billion for CDBG formula grants. It also supports funding for Indian tribes and SCI activities, with $50 million allocated for SCI activities. Additionally, the bill calls for the conversion of Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based program and increasing the loan guarantee commitment to $500 million for FY2013. The bill supports the Administration's budget request for converting Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based program and increasing the loan guarantee commitment to $500 million for FY2013. It recommends $3.404 billion for activities funded under the CDF account, including $3.344 billion for CDBG formula grants. This is 13% more than the previous year's appropriation. The House bill, H.R. 5972, recommends $3.344 billion for CDBG formula grants under the CDF account, which is 13% more than the previous year's appropriation. It does not support the Administration's request to convert Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based structure, instead recommending $6 million in loan subsidies for a loan guarantee ceiling of $244 million. The House Financial Services Committee's bill, H.R. 5972, recommends $6 million in loan subsidies for a loan guarantee ceiling of $244 million. It also supports continued funding for Section 4 activities at $35 million but does not agree with transferring the program from its current account. During floor debate, amendments calling for funding reductions were introduced but not approved. During the FY2012 budget debate, amendments proposing funding reductions for various programs like the CDBG and Section 108 loan guarantee were defeated in the House. One proposed amendment sought to reduce funds for salaries and expenses in the Community Planning and Development account, while another aimed to eliminate funding for the CDF and Section 108 loan guarantee program. Additionally, an amendment to allow a higher percentage of Neighborhood Stabilization Program funds for demolition activities was challenged and ruled out of order. Congress debated the Administration's budget recommendations with a focus on reducing federal spending. During the FY2012 budget debate, Congress considered the Administration's budget recommendations for reducing federal spending. Supporters of the CDBG program highlighted its role in economic development and job creation. The Obama Administration proposed restructuring the CDF account in its FY2012 budget submission. The Obama Administration proposed restructuring the CDF account in its FY2012 budget submission, aiming to reduce funding for CDBG formula grants, eliminate NI and EDI programs, eliminate Section 107 activities, transfer SCI to a new account, and convert Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based program. The proposed funding level for programs under the CDF account was $3.804 billion, representing a 14.5% reduction from FY2010 enacted appropriations but an 8.6% increase from FY2011. The Administration's FY2012 budget proposed a total funding level of $3.804 billion for programs funded under the CDF account, which was a 14.5% reduction from FY2010 but an 8.6% increase from FY2011. The budget included an 11.5% increase in funding for CDBG states and entitlement communities, as well as funding for CDBG grants to insular areas, Indian tribes, Rural Innovation Grants, and Guam. The Administration's FY2012 budget proposed funding for Rural Innovation Funds targeted at rural areas with populations under 20,000, assistance to Guam for military relocation needs, and no funding for Economic Development Initiatives and Neighborhood Initiatives grants. The budget recommended transferring SCI programs to a new account with a $150 million appropriation for Regional Integrated Planning Grants and Community Challenge Grants. The Administration's budget proposed funding for SCI's components: Regional Integrated Planning Grants, Community Challenge Grants, and Housing-Transportation Integration Research. The budget also included doubling the program's loan commitment ceiling to $500 million in FY2012 to help local governments finance job creation activities. The Administration's budget proposed doubling the program's loan commitment ceiling to $500 million in FY2012 to help local governments finance job creation activities. Congress rejected the proposal and the House Appropriations Subcommittee recommended $3.501 billion for CDF activities in FY2012. The subcommittee approved a draft bill on September 8, 2011, recommending $3.501 billion for CDF activities, with $3.466 billion for CDBG formula grants and $35 million for Indian tribes. The draft bill aimed to maintain overall CDF appropriations at the FY2011 level, but there were recommendations to eliminate the program in the FY2012 Budget Resolution. The draft bill also suggested that states and local communities should use more of their own funds for community development activities to increase transparency and accountability. Funding priorities would shift, including eliminating the Sustainable Communities Initiative and reducing funding for CDBG. The draft bill recommended shifting CDF funding priorities, including eliminating the Sustainable Communities Initiative and reducing funding for CDBG Indian Tribes. It also rejected the proposal to restructure Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based program, maintaining the current structure with $6.8 million in credit subsidies. Additionally, the bill suggested lowering the ceiling on the percentage of funds grantees could use for CDBG administrative expenses from 20% to 10%. The bill recommended maintaining the current structure, including $6.8 million in credit subsidies for $275 million in Section 108 loan guarantees. It also proposed reducing the percentage of funds grantees could use for CDBG administrative expenses from 20% to 10%. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported a bill with a substantial reduction in CDF funding to $3.0 billion, excluding $400 million for CDBG supplemental disaster assistance. This was $500 million less than FY2011 appropriations and $280.4 million less than requested by the Administration. The Senate bill recommended $2.851 billion for CDBG formula funding, reducing it by 13.7% from the FY2011 level. Senator Inouye submitted an amendment to consolidate appropriations measures into a Minibus, which was approved by the Senate on November 1, 2011. Among the approved amendments was one proposed by Senator Coburn to prohibit the use of grants for repayment. The Senate approved a Minibus bill on November 1, 2011, including an amendment by Senator Coburn to prevent grants from being used for loan repayment. This has implications for the CDBG program and Section 108 loan guarantee program. The House requested a conference to reconcile differences in the bill on November 3, 2011, and a conference report was filed on November 14, 2011. The final version of the bill was approved by both the House and Senate on November 17, 2011. The House and Senate approved the conference version of H.R. 2112 on November 17, 2011, which was signed into law as P.L. 112-55 on November 18, 2011. The law allocated $3.308 billion for CDF activities, with $300 million for CDBG disaster activities. The funding for CDBG formula grants was $2.948 billion, a decrease from previous years. Other CDF activities, like the Sustainable Communities Initiative, were not directly funded for FY2012. The $2.948 billion for CDBG formula grants in FY2012 was 10.7% less than FY2011, 19.6% less than the President's request, and 15% less than the House recommendation, but 3.4% more than the Senate recommendation. Other CDF activities were not funded directly, but could be carried out with CDBG and Transformation Initiative funds. The decrease in CDBG funding reflects efforts to reduce federal spending for deficit reduction. P.L. 112-55 did not include provisions to prohibit federal grants from repaying federal loans or reduce the percentage of CDBG funds for administrative expenses. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012 included provisions such as directing a study on the effectiveness of CDBG and HOME block grant programs, requiring HUD to report on grantee accountability, and analyzing the use of CDBG funds for matching fund requirements. The Administration's proposal to convert Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based system was not supported for the third consecutive year. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012 included provisions directing HUD to analyze the use of CDBG funds for matching fund requirements. The Administration's proposal to convert Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based program was not supported for the third consecutive year. Additionally, the act appropriated $5.952 million in credit subsidies for Section 108 loan guarantees and included $400 million in CDBG supplemental disaster assistance for recovery efforts in areas declared disasters in 2011. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012 allocated $400 million in CDBG supplemental disaster assistance for recovery efforts in areas declared disasters in 2011. States and local governments were required to submit a disaster recovery plan detailing the use of funds for activities related to housing, infrastructure, and economic revitalization. HUD could waive certain provisions for fund use, except for fair housing, nondiscrimination, labor standards, and environmental review. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2011 allocated $3.508 billion for the Community Development Fund (CDF), with provisions for a mandatory across-the-board rescission of 0.2% and a 1% discretionary transfer to the Department's Transformation Initiative. The act granted the Secretary of HUD the authority to reduce the CDF account's total appropriation. On April 14, 2011, the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2011 allocated $3.508 billion for the Community Development Fund (CDF). This included a mandatory across-the-board rescission of 0.2% and a 1% discretionary transfer to the Department's Transformation Initiative. The Secretary of HUD was granted the authority to reduce the CDF account's total appropriation to $3.501 billion, approximately 16% below the amount appropriated for FY2010. The CDF, which includes the formula-based Community Development Block Grant program, was targeted for significant budget reductions in earlier legislative versions. The House-passed H.R. 1 bill aimed to reduce funding for HUD's Community Development Fund, including the CDBG program, as part of efforts to cut the federal budget deficit. Despite Senate rejection of the bill, negotiations led to the signing of P.L. 112-10, the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2011, on April 15, 2011. After negotiations, President Obama signed P.L. 112-10, the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2011, on April 15, 2011. The act allocated $3.508 billion for the CDF account, with $3.343 billion for CDBG formula funds. It also included a 0.2% mandatory across-the-board rescission and a 1% discretionary transfer to HUD's Transformation Initiative. The P.L. 112-10 appropriation of $3.501 billion for the CDF account includes a 0.2% rescission and a 1% discretionary transfer to HUD's Transformation Initiative. This amount is 21.3% less than the FY2010 appropriation and 20.1% less than the Administration's FY2011 request. The FY2011 appropriation is 133% higher than recommended by H.R. 1. The P.L. 112-10 appropriation of $3.501 billion for the CDF account is 21.3% less than the FY2010 appropriation and 20.1% less than the Administration's FY2011 request. The FY2011 appropriation is 133% higher than recommended by H.R. 1. The CDF account includes the CDBG program, with formula-based grants for various entities, and funds for the Sustainable Communities Initiative, which saw a 33% reduction in funding. The House passed H.R. 1, reducing funding for the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) by 33% and the CDF account by 66.3% below the FY2010 level. H.R. 1 prohibited funds for earmarks and SCI, without specifying allocation instructions for the CDBG program. 70% of funds allocated to entitlement communities and 30% to states and Puerto Rico for distribution to nonentitlement communities. Senator Inouye submitted an amendment to H.R. 1, which included $4.230 billion for CDF activities, with $3.990 billion for the CDBG program. The amendment would have frozen CDBG formula grant funds at the FY2010 level. The Senate bill included $3.990 billion for the CDBG program, freezing formula grant funds at the FY2010 level. FY2011 appropriations for CDBG totaled $3.296 billion, a 16.4% decrease from FY2010. FY2012 saw a further decline to $2.942 billion, with entitlement communities receiving smaller grant amounts. The CDBG program funding decreased to $2.942 billion in FY2012, a 10.7% decline from FY2011. Entitlement communities saw a 29.1% reduction in average grant amount, with state allocations decreasing by 25.4%. Despite the funding cuts, they were less severe than the proposed 62.5% reduction in H.R. 1, which would have significantly impacted community and economic development plans. The proposed funding reduction in H.R. 1 would have significantly impacted state and local governments' community and economic development plans, forcing them to postpone or terminate activities supporting job creation efforts, public facilities, and services. This would also undercut resources for non-profit organizations managing CDBG-funded services for low and moderate-income households. The reduction in funding for the CDBG program disproportionately affects low and moderate-income households. FY2012 appropriations are the lowest in over a decade, leading to delays in projects and reduced support for community-based organizations. Table 5 shows the distribution of funds to states and entitlement communities. The CDBG program funding was reduced in FY2011 and FY2012, with allocations decreasing by 16.4% and 25.1% respectively. 70% of funds are allocated to entitlement communities, while the remaining 30% goes to nonentitlement communities. CDBG funds are allocated to entitlement communities based on population, poverty, and overcrowded housing factors using Formula A or Formula B. The distribution of CDBG funds to metropolitan cities and urban counties is determined by two formulas: Formula A considers population, poverty, and overcrowded housing factors, while Formula B includes population growth lag, poverty, and housing built before 1940 factors. The distribution of CDBG funds to states is governed by a two formula system, with Formula A using population, poverty, and overcrowded housing factors, and Formula B considering poverty housing built before 1940 and persons living in poverty in nonentitlement areas. HUD uses Census Bureau data from the 2010 Decennial Census and the 2005-2009 American Community Survey for allocations, allowing for annual updates of data sources. HUD will use Census Bureau data from the 2010 Decennial Census and the 2005-2009 American Community Survey for CDBG fund allocations, allowing for annual updates to reflect demographic changes more accurately. Prior to FY2012, HUD used the 2000 Decennial Census for data sources. In December 2011, HUD released a study on the impacts of using 2010 Census and ACS data for CDBG grant allocations. The study found that communities in Puerto Rico, the Mid-Atlantic, and Pacific/Hawaii regions saw decreases in CDBG allocations, while those in the Rocky Mountain, Great Plains, and Midwest regions saw increases. The introduction of new data sources for CDBG grant allocations resulted in changes in funding distribution. Entitlement communities in the Rocky Mountain, Great Plains, and Midwest regions saw increases in their allocations, while principal cities and urban counties received a greater share of funds. Some states like New Mexico and Puerto Rico experienced significant declines in funding due to changes in poverty and housing factors. The full report can be found at http://www.huduser.org/publications/pdf/cdbg_redis_eff.pdf. Rico experienced the largest decline in funding, 27.4% and 27.3%, due to decreases in poverty and overcrowded housing shares. The report includes a comparison of funding allocations for 1,166 entitlement communities in FY2011. It reviews the funding history of the CDF account from FY2000 to FY2011, discussing CDBG formula grants, set-asides, and supplemental appropriations. Total appropriations for the CDF account fluctuated between $5.112 billion in FY2001 and $3.772 billion in FY2007. FY2011 appropriations for CDF activities are the lowest in over a decade. The funding for the CDF account has fluctuated between $5.112 billion in FY2001 and $3.772 billion in FY2007. The FY2011 appropriation for CDF activities is the lowest in over a decade. Supporters of the program have pushed for increased funding, citing a decline in appropriations and the challenge of sharing funds with an increasing number of eligible grant recipients. Critics argue that increased funding is not justified based on the program's PART score and the need to reduce domestic discretionary spending. The CDBG program funding for entitlement communities has been decreasing, with critics questioning the justification for increased funding. The average grant amount allocated to these communities declined by 26.7% from FY2000 to FY2010, but saw a 9% increase since FY2008. However, the FY2011 estimated average allocation is 34.5% less than in FY2000. The average allocation for CDBG entitlement communities had been declining but increased by 9% from FY2008 to FY2010. However, the FY2011 estimated average allocation of $1.9 million is 34.5% less than in FY2000. The decline is due to fewer dollars appropriated and an increase in the number of entitlement communities. The number of jurisdictions receiving direct allocation increased by 155 from FY2000 to FY2011. State allocations fluctuated less, with $1.183 billion allocated in FY2010, 7.4% less than in FY2000. In FY2010, $1.183 billion was allocated among the 50 states and Puerto Rico for distribution to nonentitlement communities, which was 7.4% less than in FY2000. The average state allocation declined from $25.5 million in FY2002 to $21.1 million in FY2008 before increasing to $23.2 million in FY2010. However, the FY2011 average state allocation decreased to $19.1 million, 23.3% less than in FY2000. Program funding declined by 40% in inflation-adjusted constant dollars from FY2000 to FY2011. Appropriations for CDBG formula grants fluctuated between $3.5 billion and $4.3 billion in the last decade. Appropriations for CDBG formula grants in the CDF account have varied between $3.5 billion and $4.3 billion in the last decade. The CDF also includes smaller programs with specific objectives and fewer recipients, some of which have been funded at the expense of the larger CDBG formula grant program. Set-aside programs in the CDF have seen fluctuations in both number and appropriations, with Congress allocating $647 million in FY2001 but only $61 million in FY2007. Earmarks were eliminated in FY2007, and in FY2010, $509 million was allocated for set-aside activities, with a focus on Economic Development projects. In FY2001, Congress allocated $647 million for CDF set-asides, dropping to $61 million in FY2007. Earmarks were eliminated in FY2007, and in FY2010, $509 million was allocated for set-aside activities, with a focus on Economic Development projects. Funding for CDF set-asides fluctuated due to Congress's decisions on categorical grant programs and earmarks. From FY2000 to FY2011, CDBG-related set-asides and earmarks declined by 59.4% in constant FY2000 dollars, rebounded in FY2009 and FY2010, but declined significantly in FY2011. Congressional earmarked projects funded by the EDI and NI programs were dominant in CDBG-related set aside appropriations, with earmarks being a source of debate in recent Congresses. Earmarks were removed from the CDF account in FY2007, and new rules were instituted for disclosure of earmark requests since then. In recent Congresses, earmarks funded by the EDI and NI programs have been a dominant source of debate. Earmarks were removed from the CDF account in FY2007, with new rules for disclosure of earmark requests. In FY2008 and FY2009, EDI and NI earmarks were the main components of CDBG-linked set asides programs. Congress did not fund NI and EDI earmarks in FY2011. Supplemental funds from the CDBG program have been used for disaster relief, recovery, and mitigation activities, as well as reducing abandoned properties. Supplemental funds from the CDBG program have been used for disaster relief, recovery, and mitigation activities, as well as reducing abandoned properties and supporting job creation in response to economic recession. Disaster relief and NSP funding were allocated to states or communities meeting specific criteria, with CDBG disaster funding only going to communities designated as disaster areas by a presidential declaration. CDBG-ARRA funds were allocated to all eligible CDBG entitlement communities, while disaster relief and NSP funding were allocated to states or communities meeting specific criteria. CDBG disaster funding was only given to communities designated as disaster areas by a presidential declaration, at the discretion of Congress. NSP-1 and NSP-3 funds were allocated to states based on mortgage foreclosure rates, with a minimum grant amount established by Congress. States were required to distribute a portion of these funds to local governments with high rates of mortgage foreclosures, subprime loans, and delinquencies. Congress established a minimum grant amount for each state under NSP-1 and NSP-3, requiring funds to be dispensed to local governments with high foreclosure rates. NSP-2 funds were awarded competitively, and a bill was introduced to rescind NSP-3 funds. On March 1, 2011, Representative Gary Miller introduced the Neighborhood Stabilization Termination Act, H.R. 861, to rescind $1 billion in NSP-3 funds. The House Financial Services Committee conducted a hearing on NSP and federal foreclosure programs, and on March 9, 2011, they considered and approved H.R. 861, requiring HUD to publish a notice of termination for the NSP program. Representative Miller characterized the program during these events. During the March 2, 2011, subcommittee hearing and the March 9, 2011, markup session by the House Financial Services Committee, Representative Miller criticized the NSP-3 program as ineffective and a waste of taxpayers' dollars. He argued for rescinding funding due to the need to address the federal debt and deficit. However, other Members defended the program, stating it has successfully assisted communities in combating the negative impacts of the mortgage foreclosure crisis. HUD's Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development testified that NSP is expected to impact 100,000 properties in the nation's hardest-hit markets. During the March 2 hearing, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development stated that the NSP program is expected to impact 100,000 properties in the nation's hardest-hit markets, with 36,000 units already under construction. The program is estimated to support more than 93,000 jobs nationwide and helps reduce the supply of abandoned, blighted, and foreclosed housing stock. The House passed the measure on March 16, 2011, by a vote of 242 to 182, with no companion bill introduced in the Senate."
