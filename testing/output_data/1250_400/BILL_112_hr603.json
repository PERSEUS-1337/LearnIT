Payments are allocated based on a formula considering the number of individuals to be served in each state. Individualized transition plans are also addressed. Each State receiving assistance under this subtitle must develop an individual transition plan for individuals with developmental disabilities transitioning from the secondary school system.

The primary focus of the TPS unit is to help individuals with developmental disabilities transition from the secondary school system to adulthood by developing and implementing Individual Transition Plans (ITPs) and employing transition brokers to coordinate with State agencies. Transition brokers are employed by the TPS administrative unit to facilitate coordination among State agencies in developing ITPs and provide assistance to individuals with developmental disabilities in navigating support services. Eligibility to serve as a transition broker requires expertise in developmental disabilities, benefits planning, transition services, employment, and job development. The individual must have expertise in developmental disabilities, benefits planning, transition services, employment, job development, workforce development, vocational rehabilitation, asset development, economic self-sufficiency tools, self-direction, and person-centered planning processes. The Transition Planning Services (TPS) administrative unit provides individuals with developmental disabilities and their families with knowledge on tax benefits, work incentives, matched savings plans, education financing, budget management, self-direction, person-centered planning, self-advocacy, self-determination skills, and peer mentoring. A transition broker is assigned to individuals based on their selection and approval by the State intellectual and developmental disabilities agency. The TPS administrative unit offers strategies for self-advocacy, self-determination skills, and peer mentoring to individuals with developmental disabilities and their families. They also provide information on Federal and State services, supports, and regulations, including asset development and financial savings tools. This information is updated quarterly for easy understanding.
