SHORT TITLE, ETC.\" The \"Business Transparency on Trafficking and Slavery Act\" requires disclosure of human rights impact of products in the US market, following California's lead in 2010. The Act aims to address forced labor and child labor in global supply chains, with exceptions for goods not produced in the US in sufficient quantities. Consumers are increasingly demanding transparency on these issues. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 allows imports of goods made with forced labor, with limited enforcement due to court rulings. Other mechanisms related to slavery and trafficking in commerce also face challenges in providing information on tainted goods. The legislative framework to prevent goods produced through forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor from entering the US commerce is inadequate. Legislation is needed to provide the public with information and encourage businesses to be transparent and responsive to consumer and investor demands. Businesses can address social issues by providing transparent information to consumers and investors, responding to their demands for ethical practices, rather than just following government regulations.
