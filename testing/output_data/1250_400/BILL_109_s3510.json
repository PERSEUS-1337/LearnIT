    "content": "AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS: The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 is amended to authorize $9,839,262,000 for fiscal year 2007, with $50,000,000 allocated for Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Sciences. Additionally, authorization for Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Sciences is included in the Act. SEC. 10A. PARTNERSHIPS FOR ACCESS TO LABORATORY SCIENCE (PALS) is added to the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002, with $50,000,000 allocated for this purpose in fiscal year 2007. The Director is authorized to award grants to high-need local educational agencies for partnerships to improve laboratory science access at the secondary school level. Grants are awarded based on merit and require partnerships with higher education institutions, businesses, and nonprofit organizations. High-need local educational agencies must form partnerships with higher education institutions, businesses, and nonprofit organizations to receive grants. The Federal share of the cost should not exceed 33 percent, and approved agencies can receive grants for up to 3 fiscal years. A plan developed in consultation with teachers and scientists is required for grant eligibility. To be eligible for a grant, a high-need local educational agency must submit a plan describing how laboratory improvements align with state academic standards and enhance math, science, engineering, and technology instruction. The plan should be developed in consultation with teachers, science administrators, and experts in laboratory science and classroom instruction. The comprehensive program aims to enhance math, science, engineering, and technology instruction through improved laboratory experiences. This includes clear learning outcomes, sequencing to complement classroom instruction, integration of science content, ongoing student reflection, teacher training, meeting safety requirements, and describing the laboratory setup. The curr_chunk discusses the requirements for grants awarded for improving laboratory facilities in secondary science education. It includes training for teachers, meeting safety regulations, maintenance of equipment, and using assessment methods to enhance research literature on student understanding. Grants must supplement existing programs, involve all partners, and focus on improving laboratory facilities. Grants awarded under this section are to supplement existing programs and improve secondary science education by enhancing laboratories and providing instrumentation. Activities must involve all partners and align with State academic standards for mathematics and science. This includes developing a plan for laboratory improvement, purchasing equipment, and scientific educational materials. The curr_chunk discusses the use of funds for improving laboratory facilities, purchasing equipment, providing professional development for teachers, integrating laboratory experiences with classroom instruction, training in laboratory safety, and implementing hands-on experiences to engage students. The curr_chunk outlines the limitations on the use of funds for grants awarded under this section, specifying that they cannot be used for the construction of new facilities. The Director may determine additional activities to achieve the goals of the subsection. Grants cannot be used for new facility construction. High-need educational agencies must submit an application detailing partnerships, implementation roles, plans, and activities to be funded. The proposal will include a plan for activities aligned with State standards, based on research, expected to improve student performance in mathematics and science. Activities will aim to strengthen instruction quality and encourage individuals' interest. The proposal will describe activities to improve student performance in mathematics and science, encourage interest in STEM fields, prepare individuals for postsecondary studies, assess changes in student achievement, evaluate partnership success, and make programmatic assessments available for research. The proposal includes descriptions of how changes in student achievement will be assessed, how partnership success will be evaluated, and how programmatic assessments will be shared with the research community. The Director will evaluate applications based on the partnership's ability to effectively carry out programs, alignment with relevant research and academic standards, and the likelihood of increasing student achievement. The program evaluation will assess the alignment with academic standards, potential for wider implementation, and impact on encouraging interest in STEM fields among underrepresented individuals. The Director will evaluate the program to identify best practices and compare effectiveness with other partnerships. Results will be disseminated to the public and relevant committees. The Director will disseminate evaluation results to the public and relevant committees. Materials developed under the program will also be made widely available. Technical assistance will be provided to high-need local educational agencies upon request. The Director will provide technical assistance to high-need local educational agencies in developing grant applications and activities. An annual meeting will be held for grant recipients to promote national collaboration. The Director will report on coordination efforts to relevant committees. The Director will report on coordination efforts with high-need local educational agencies to relevant committees. Definitions for terms like 'high-need local educational agency' are provided in this section. In this section, definitions are provided for terms such as 'high-need local educational agency' and 'National Laboratory'."
