FINDINGS.\" Congress finds the need to increase the number of high school students prepared for STEM education, emphasizes the importance of hands-on laboratory experiences in science education, and acknowledges the current poor quality of lab experiences for most students. The National Research Council and Government Accountability Office found that schools with higher concentrations of non-Asian minorities and poor students are less likely to have adequate science lab facilities. 40 percent of college students who left science fields cited problems with high school science preparation, including lack of lab experience and introduction to analytical modes of thought. It is in the national interest for the Federal Government to invest in research to improve high school science labs. The National Research Council and Government Accountability Office found that schools with higher concentrations of non-Asian minorities and poor students lack adequate science lab facilities. College students leaving science fields cited issues with high school science preparation, such as lack of lab experience and exposure to analytical modes of thought. It is in the national interest for the Federal Government to invest in research to enhance high school science labs. The grant program aims to enhance high school science labs, addressing issues with inadequate facilities and lack of preparation for students in science fields. Section 8(8) of the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 is amended to establish a pilot program called 'Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science' to improve laboratories and provide instrumentation for enhancing high school science labs. The 'Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science' pilot program awards grants to partnerships to enhance secondary school STEM instruction by improving laboratories and providing instrumentation, including equipment, maintenance, teacher training, and instructional program development. The curr_chunk discusses the improvement of laboratory facilities, professional development for teachers, development of instructional programs, training in laboratory safety, and hands-on laboratory experiences to encourage interest in mathematics and science. The curr_chunk focuses on encouraging individuals identified in specific sections of the Science and Engineering Equal Opportunities Act to pursue studies in mathematics, science, engineering, and technology through partnerships with higher education institutions and local educational agencies. The curr_chunk outlines the requirements for partnerships eligible for grants under the Science and Engineering Equal Opportunities Act, including the involvement of higher education institutions, local educational agencies, businesses, and nonprofit organizations. The Federal share of the cost for activities should not exceed 50 percent. The Director of the National Science Foundation will evaluate pilot projects funded by the grant program to improve student performance in STEM fields. A report on the evaluation results, best practices, and materials developed by grant awardees must be submitted to specific Senate and House committees within 5 years. $5,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2008, with additional funding for the following 3 years."
