    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature aims to increase enrollment and graduation rates for undocumented students by establishing Dream Resource Centers at public higher education institutions. Despite California's efforts to provide opportunities for undocumented youth, only 20 percent of high school graduates attend college. Many are unaware of laws like Assembly Bill 540, the California Dream Act, and DACA. Most college campuses lack centralized support services for these students. The creation of Dream Resource Centers at public higher education institutions aims to streamline financial aid and academic opportunities for students meeting Assembly Bill 540 requirements. These centers empower and support undocumented students, increasing enrollment, transfer, and graduation rates. Various college campuses, including UCLA, UC Davis, CSU Los Angeles, CSU Fullerton, and CSU Northridge, have established these centers to provide workshops, legal clinics, information on available programs, peer mentoring, and support services to enhance awareness of resources and employment opportunities. Each campus of the California Community Colleges and California State University is encouraged to designate a Dream Resource Liaison to assist students meeting specific requirements by streamlining access to financial aid and academic opportunities. Each campus of the California State University is encouraged to designate a Dream Resource Liaison knowledgeable in financial aid and academic opportunities for students meeting specific requirements. The University of California is also encouraged to designate a Dream Resource Liaison on each campus. Dream Resource Centers may offer various support services without requiring new construction, and may be housed within existing student service or academic centers. The section allows Dream Resource Centers to be housed within existing student service or academic centers, and the space where the Dream Resource Liaison is located can be considered a Dream Resource Center. The Trustees of the California State University, the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, and the Regents of the University of California are permitted to seek and accept gifts to aid in the creation and operation of Dream Resource Centers. If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act imposes state-mandated costs, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts will be made accordingly."
