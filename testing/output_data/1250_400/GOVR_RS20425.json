Major companies like EchoStar and DirecTV offer satellite television services through their DBS systems. Rainbow DBS also provides satellite channels through a service called Voom. SHVIA allows consumers greater access to broadcast network television programming via satellite dishes, including rebroadcasting local network signals. The 1999 SHVIA expands on the 1988 SHVA, allowing consumers access to broadcast network TV programming via satellite dishes. It permits rebroadcasting local network signals in the same market area. The distinction between local and distant network signals is crucial. Original SHVA established the Grade B contour for eligibility to receive distant network signals via satellite. Virginia is receiving a distant network signal from a Denver affiliate via satellite. The SHVA established the Grade B contour as the determining factor for eligibility to receive distant network signals. Consumers inside the Grade B contour were not allowed to receive such signals, leading to court challenges. Over 2 million consumers reportedly had their distant network signals terminated by satellite companies. Congress \"grandfathered\" illegal consumers who could not receive a Grade A signal, while new subscribers must follow the original rules to receive distant network signals. In 2002, EchoStar appealed a decision to the Supreme Court, which declined to hear the case. The 1999 law \"grandfathered\" illegal consumers unable to receive a Grade A signal. New subscribers must meet Grade B intensity requirements to receive distant network signals via satellite. The FCC determined that the Grade B standard should still be used. Consumers can seek a waiver if they believe they are not receiving the required signal strength. Waiver requests are forwarded from the satellite company to the local network affiliate with no time limit for action. Consumers seeking a waiver for distant network signals via satellite must apply to their satellite company. The company forwards the request to the local network affiliate, who has 30 days to decide on the waiver. If granted, the consumer can receive the signals; if denied, a signal intensity test can be requested at no cost to the consumer. Costs for the test are covered by the \"loser\" between the satellite company and affiliate, or by another agreed method. Exceptions apply for recreational vehicles and commercial trucks. Exceptions for receiving distant network signals via satellite include recreational vehicles, commercial trucks, and consumers using large \"C-band\" satellite dishes. These consumers may receive signals if they do not receive a Grade B signal locally, have their dish on an RV or commercial truck, or had been receiving illegal signals that were terminated. \"C-band\" dish users are not limited to a five-year period for receiving distant signals. SHVIA permits DBS companies to provide \"local-into-local\" service, transmitting local broadcast TV signals to consumers in the same designated market area. The law does not mandate this service, but under the \"must carry\" provision, DBS companies must provide all local broadcast stations in a market if they offer any local station in that market. This does not require them to carry local broadcast programming nationwide. The \"must carry\" provision under SHVIA requires DBS companies to provide all local broadcast stations in a market if they offer any local station in that market. This does not mandate carrying local broadcast programming nationwide. Cable companies were already subject to similar rules based on the size of their systems. The must carry provisions for DBS went into effect on January 1, 2002, and DBS companies opposed this requirement. EchoStar offered local-into-local in 152 markets, DirecTV in 106 markets as of October 2004, with plans to expand to more markets. EchoStar and DirecTV offered local-into-local services in multiple markets as of October 2004. EchoStar reported that 83% of the population could receive its service when it passed the 100 DMA mark. DirecTV aimed to provide local-into-local in at least 130 DMAs by the end of 2004, representing 92% of TV households. The LOCAL Act was passed in 2000 to ensure small and rural areas could access local television through satellite or terrestrial technologies. Compensation for copyright owners of television programming is another issue in satellite retransmission. The LOCAL Act, passed in 2000, ensures small and rural areas can access local television through satellite or terrestrial technologies. Satellite carriers have a compulsory copyright license for retransmitting distant network and superstation signals, with government-set prices. The 1999 law extended this license until 2004, and the 108th Congress is considering further extensions and price changes. Satellite companies have a royalty-free permanent compulsory copyright license for retransmitting local signals. Cable also has a permanent compulsory copyright license. The 108th Congress is considering extending the compulsory copyright license for satellite companies to retransmit distant network signals. Cable and satellite companies have permanent compulsory copyright licenses for retransmitting local signals. The SHVIA provisions allow satellite companies to offer local-into-local television service and make must-carry requirements effective for satellites. Subscribers affected by the 1998 Miami court rulings can have their distant network signals restored or continued until December 31, 2004. The 108th Congress is considering extending the compulsory copyright license for satellite companies to retransmit distant network signals. The SHVIA provisions allow subscribers affected by the 1998 Miami court rulings to have their distant network signals restored or continued until December 31, 2004. This includes retaining the Grade B signal intensity standard and allowing waivers for consumers to receive distant network signals if signal strength is in doubt. C-band satellite customers can continue receiving distant network signals indefinitely. The SHVIA provisions allow subscribers to seek waivers for distant network signals with uncertain signal strength at no cost. It also extends the compulsory license for satellite companies to retransmit distant network and superstation signals until December 31, 2004, with reduced copyright royalty payments. Additionally, it eliminates the 90-day waiting period for cable subscribers and allows satellite companies to offer a national PBS feed until January 1, 2002. The LOCAL Act, passed as part of the FY2001 appropriations act, created a loan guarantee program for small and rural markets to receive local television signals. A four-person board was established to select recipients for up to $1.25 billion in loans to build systems for nationwide access to local TV. The LOCAL Act established a loan guarantee program for small and rural markets to receive local television signals. A board was tasked with selecting recipients for up to $1.25 billion in loans to build systems for nationwide access to local TV. The program is technology neutral and aims to serve \"nonserved\" or \"underserved\" areas, with a focus on high-speed Internet access. The Board issued regulations for the program in 2003, with an application period ending in 2004. The loan guarantee program for small and rural markets to receive local television signals was established by the LOCAL Act. The Board voted to return an incomplete application and then opened another application period. The program is administered by the Rural Utilities Service and received funding from the FY2002 Agriculture appropriations act. GAO criticized the slow progress of the program in its reports. The \"Northpoint Provision\" required the FCC to conduct tests to determine eligibility. The FCC was required by the \"Northpoint Provision\" to conduct tests to determine if terrestrial systems operating in the same frequency band as DBS satellites would cause interference. MITRE Corporation concluded that the two systems could not co-exist without mitigating techniques for MVDDS systems. The FCC conducted interference tests in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band for MVDDS systems, concluding they could co-exist with DBS satellites with mitigating techniques. Northpoint objected to the FCC's decision to auction frequencies instead of allowing MVDDS providers to operate. The auction raised $118.7 million in 2004. Bills S. 564 and H.R. 1320 aimed to eliminate the auction requirement for fixed terrestrial services like MVDDS. The auction for frequencies in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band raised $118.7 million in 2004. Bills S. 564 and H.R. 1320 sought to eliminate the auction requirement for fixed terrestrial services like MVDDS."
