The Act allows funds to be derived from the Patent and Trademark Office Fee Surcharge Fund and authorizes the collection of fees under title 35, United States Code, and the Trademark Act of 1946. Amounts appropriated under this Act may remain available until expended. Adjustments to trademark fees are also authorized. SEC. 3. Amounts appropriated under this Act may remain available until expended. SEC. 4. Adjustments to trademark fees are authorized, with the fee for filing a trademark application set at $245. Any fee adjustments may not take effect before October 1, 1994. SEC. 5. Interim patent extensions are addressed. Section 156 of title 35, United States Code is amended to allow for interim patent extensions if the regulatory review period extends beyond the patent expiration date. The owner or agent can submit an application for an extension 6 months before the term expires, providing specific information about the product and patent. The owner or agent can submit an application for an interim extension of a patent under Section 156 of title 35, United States Code, providing specific information about the product and patent, including identity, claims, activities during regulatory review, and additional information required by the Commissioner. The Commissioner may grant an interim extension of a patent for a product under regulatory review, with the possibility of up to 4 subsequent extensions. The owner or agent must apply for each extension within specific timeframes before the expiration of the previous extension. The owner of record of a patent subject to subsection (g)(6)(C) can apply for only 1 subsequent interim extension. Each extension must be applied for 60-30 days before the expiration of the previous extension. The certificate of interim extension is recorded in the patent file and becomes part of the original patent. Any interim extension granted terminates 60 days after the product receives permission for commercial use, but can be further extended for up to 5 years from the original patent term expiration date if additional information is provided within that period. If the Commissioner grants permission and additional information is submitted, the patent can be further extended for up to 5 years from the original expiration date. The rights during the extension period are limited to the specific uses or methods under regulatory review. SEC. 6. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS. Amendments are made to Section 156 of title 35, United States Code, including changes to subsections (a), (b), and (e). SEC. 7. PATENT TERM EXTENSIONS FOR AMERICAN LEGION. SEC. 7. Patent term extensions for American Legion are granted for specific design patents, including badges for the American Legion, American Legion Women's Auxiliary, and Sons of the American Legion, each extended for 14 years. SEC. 8. INTERVENING RIGHTS. The renewals and extensions of patents under section 6 will not result in infringement for any use of the patent's subject matter that began after the patent expired but before the enactment of this Act."
