    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"United States-Canada Fair Grain Trade Act of 1993\". The United States-Canada Fair Grain Trade Act of 1993 addresses the negative impact of Canadian grain exports on American farmers, citing unfair provisions in the Free-Trade Agreement. The Act aims to mitigate financial losses and difficulties faced by domestic farmers due to increased Canadian grain exports. The Congress approved the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement with conditions related to consultations on the Canadian Wheat Board's price setting policy and exclusion of agricultural goods from transport rates for consumption in the United States. The United States has not made progress on consultations with Canada regarding the exclusion of agricultural goods from transport rates for consumption in the US. This failure led to a flawed binational panel decision that undermines the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement. TITLE I--GRAIN TRADE NEGOTIATIONS\n\nSEC. 101. PRICE TRANSPARENCY.\n\nThe President must negotiate with Canada to determine the price of agricultural goods sold by the Canadian Wheat Board to the US. If negotiations fail within 120 days, Canada will be considered in violation of the Free-Trade Agreement, and grain imports will be suspended until successful negotiations are completed.\n\nSEC. 102. RAIL TRANSPORTATION SUBSIDY. SEC. 102. RAIL TRANSPORTATION SUBSIDY. The President must negotiate with Canada to exclude agricultural goods from Canada's Western Grain Transportation Act if shipped via east coast ports for consumption in the US. If negotiations fail within 120 days, imports of Canadian grain receiving transport rate benefits will be suspended until successful negotiations are completed. SEC. 103. ACQUISITION PRICE OF GRAIN. The President must negotiate with Canada to clarify the term \"acquisition price\" in the US-Canada Free-Trade Agreement to include transportation subsidies, payments to producers, and other incurred payments. If negotiations fail within 120 days, imports of Canadian grain will be suspended until successful negotiations are completed. SEC. 104. Federal agencies must assist petitioners in countervailing duty cases regarding Canadian subsidies for wheat and barley exports. TITLE II--AGRICULTURAL TRADE PROGRAMS SEC. 201. Export Enhancement Program to promote grain exports. The Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 is amended to promote grain exports by allowing US exporters to compete effectively with Canadian exporters, considering transportation subsidies and pricing strategies. The Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 is amended to address transportation subsidies and pricing strategies affecting grain exports to Mexico and other foreign markets, particularly the sale of wheat by the Canadian Wheat Board below acquisition cost. These requirements will remain in effect until agreements are reached with the Government of Canada to address these issues. The Free-Trade Agreement Implementation Act of 1988 aims to counteract the sale of wheat by the Canadian Wheat Board below acquisition cost until an agreement is reached with the Government of Canada to ensure fair pricing. SEC. 202. AGRICULTURAL EXPORT PROGRAM PROTECTION. Amends the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 by adding a new subtitle for Agricultural Export Program Protection. The Agricultural Export Program Protection defines an agricultural trade program as export promotion, credit, guarantee, or international food aid program administered by the Commodity Credit Corporation under various acts. The Agricultural Export Program Protection defines key terms related to agricultural trade programs, including covered foreign commodities, entry, person, Secretary, and United States agricultural commodities. The term 'person' in the Agricultural Export Program Protection includes an exporter, assignee, and participant in an agricultural trade program. The term 'Secretary' refers to the Secretary of Agriculture. 'United States agricultural commodity' has the same meaning as defined in the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978. SEC. 1582. Monitoring of domestic uses of certain foreign commodities. SEC. 1582 requires an end-use certificate for covered foreign commodities and quarterly reports from consignees certifying usage and compliance with the certificate. The end-use certificates and quarterly reports required under SEC. 1582 must include the importer and consignee information, country of origin, and any transfer of ownership details for covered foreign commodities. The Secretary determines the necessary form and information for these documents. The quarterly report and end-use certificates under SEC. 1582 must include importer and consignee details, country of origin, commodity description, purpose of use, and transporter information. The quarterly report also requires information on end-use certificates held by the consignee. The quarterly report under SEC. 1582 must include importer and consignee details, country of origin, commodity description, purpose of use, transporter information, end-use certificates held by the consignee, quantity of covered foreign commodity used, exported, commingled with US commodities, and their disposition. The quarterly report under SEC. 1582 must include importer and consignee details, country of origin, commodity description, purpose of use, transporter information, end-use certificates held by the consignee, quantity of covered foreign commodity used, exported, commingled with US commodities, and their disposition. Additionally, the Secretary may require reporting of sales price for enforcement purposes and must ensure confidentiality of purchaser information. The Secretary sets sales prices to enforce trade laws and agreements, ensuring confidentiality of purchaser information. Entry of foreign commodities requires an end-use certificate, with penalties for violations. The Secretary enforces trade laws by setting sales prices and requiring end-use certificates for foreign commodities. Violations may result in civil penalties up to $10,000. Regulations are in place for the submission of quarterly reports. SEC. 1583: Compliance provisions under the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 apply to authorized programs. SEC. 1584: Suspension or debarment for using foreign agricultural commodities in certain trade programs. The Commodity Credit Corporation must offer a hearing before suspending or debarring a person from an agricultural trade program for misusing foreign agricultural commodities. A waiver may be granted if the person proves the misuse was unintentional and involved less than 1% of the total commodity quantity. The Commodity Credit Corporation may waive suspension or debarment for misusing foreign agricultural commodities if the misuse was unintentional and involved less than 1% of the total quantity. Any waiver granted does not affect other penalties imposed under agricultural trade programs. This section and its amendment will take effect 120 days after the enactment of the Act. The Commodity Credit Corporation may waive suspension or debarment for unintentional misuse of foreign agricultural commodities involving less than 1% of the total quantity. Any waiver granted does not impact other penalties under agricultural trade programs."
