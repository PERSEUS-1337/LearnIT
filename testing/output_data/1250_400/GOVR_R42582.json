The Administration's FY2013 request is for $18.1 million, a 20% decline from FY2012 appropriations, but the agency plans to maintain its program level by partnering with other agencies and reducing overhead costs. The Inter-American Foundation (IAF) received $22.5 million in congressional appropriations for FY2011, with additional funding from the Social Progress Trust Fund (SPTF) and the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) providing economic assistance to developing nations. SPTF funding for IAF is expected to decrease in future years, starting from FY2017. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) was established in 2004 to provide economic assistance to developing nations based on certain indicators. MCC awards compacts up to five years in length and smaller threshold programs. Three Latin American and Caribbean countries have been awarded compacts, and three others have been awarded threshold programs, receiving a total of $886.7 million in assistance. El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua have received compacts from the MCC, totaling $886.7 million in assistance. El Salvador's compact focused on developing its northern border region, addressing infrastructure, human capital, and connectivity projects. Honduras also signed a compact for economic development worth $215 million. El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua have received compacts from the MCC totaling $886.7 million in assistance. El Salvador's compact focused on infrastructure, human capital, and connectivity projects. Honduras signed a $215 million economic growth compact with projects for rural development and transportation. Honduras's compact was completed in September 2010, but MCC decided not to renew it due to poor performance on corruption. Nicaragua also received assistance from MCC. Honduras completed a $215 million compact with MCC in September 2010, but it was not renewed due to poor performance on corruption. MCC declared Honduras eligible for a $20 million threshold program to address corruption. Nicaragua had a $175 million compact focusing on economic growth in the western region, with projects including transportation, rural development, and property regularization. Funding for Nicaragua was reduced to $113.5 million after MCC suspended and terminated $61.5 million following disputed elections in November 2008. The MCC suspended and terminated $61.5 million in funding for Nicaragua after disputed elections in November 2008, reducing the total funding for the compact to $113.5 million. The compact ended in May 2011. Additionally, threshold programs were awarded to Guyana, Paraguay, and Peru to address fiscal policy, corruption, and immunization rates. In April 2009, MCC awarded Paraguay $30.3 million for a program focusing on reducing corruption in various sectors. Peru also received a $35.6 million program to increase immunization rates and combat corruption. The Peace Corps has had almost 65,000 volunteers in Latin America and the Caribbean since 1961. Program funding for the region was around $65 million in FY2011 and is expected to be around $60 million for FY2013. The number of volunteers in the region is projected to decline due to budget cuts. The Peace Corps program in Latin America and the Caribbean received around $65 million in FY2011 and an estimated $61 million in FY2012. The budget for FY2013 is set at about $60 million, leading to a decrease in volunteers to 1,800 by the end of FY2013. The Peace Corps plans to close programs in certain countries like Antigua and Barbuda, St. Kitts and Nevis, and Suriname due to budget constraints. Security concerns have also led to the suspension of operations in some countries in the region. The Peace Corps has suspended operations in some Latin American and Caribbean countries due to security concerns, leading to the withdrawal of volunteers from Haiti, Bolivia, and Honduras. Volunteer programs in El Salvador and Guatemala have been maintained with enhanced operational support. The agency intends to send new volunteers to these countries in 2013. In December 2011, the Peace Corps cancelled volunteer training classes for El Salvador and Guatemala due to security concerns. Volunteer programs in both countries continue, with plans to send new volunteers in 2013. The Obama Administration's priorities for U.S. policy in Latin America include promoting economic opportunity, citizen security, democratic governance, and clean energy. Citizen security programs in Mexico, Colombia, Central America, and the Caribbean account for 45% of the almost $1.7 billion foreign aid budget request for the region. The focus is on strengthening institutions to address crime and uphold the rule of law. The FY2013 foreign aid budget request for the region prioritizes citizen security programs in Mexico, Colombia, Central America, and the Caribbean, accounting for 45% of the total. Assistance for Haiti, focusing on earthquake recovery and development efforts, receives 20% of aid. \"Peace and Security\" assistance, including counternarcotics and counterterrorism, accounts for 30% of aid, while \"Governing Justly and Democratically\" programs receive about 24% of aid. The FY2013 foreign aid budget request for the region prioritizes different program areas. \"Peace and Security\" assistance accounts for 30% of aid, \"Governing Justly and Democratically\" programs receive about 24% of aid, \"Investing in People\" accounts for 23%, and \"Economic Growth\" accounts for about 20%. The request is about 10% less than the amount provided in FY2012. The FY2013 foreign aid budget request for Latin America and the Caribbean prioritizes different program areas such as peace and security, governing justly and democratically, investing in people, and economic growth. The request is about 10% less than the amount provided in FY2012. USAID plans to close its mission in Panama, manage programs for Guyana from Barbados, reduce aid to Colombia and Peru, and withdraw from sectors where progress has been made by partner governments or other donors. Some Members have expressed concerns about the proposed 10% decrease in aid for the region. Some Members have concerns about the proposed 10% decrease in aid for Latin America and the Caribbean. There is agreement on the importance of maintaining assistance for citizen security and counter-narcotics efforts in Mexico, Colombia, Central America, and the Caribbean. Assistance for Haiti's recovery is also a point of consensus, with calls for transparency and accountability in the aid program. However, some Members oppose parts of the Administration's FY2013 funding, such as the Global Climate Change Initiative for Latin American and Caribbean countries. Some Members oppose portions of the Administration's proposed FY2013 funding for Latin American and Caribbean countries, including the Global Climate Change Initiative. They also oppose increases in funding for Bolivia, Ecuador, and Nicaragua, citing concerns about their governments undermining U.S. interests. Additionally, some Members disagree with cuts in democracy funding for Cuba and Venezuela, arguing that it is vital to support democracy advocates. House and Senate Appropriations Committees have marked up versions of the FY2013 State Department appropriations that would reduce worldwide foreign aid funding. House and Senate Appropriations Committees have marked up versions of the FY2013 State Department appropriations that would reduce worldwide foreign aid funding. The House version potentially means a significant reduction from the Administration's request, raising concerns about cuts in democracy funding for Cuba and Venezuela. Members of Congress are urged to examine if the FY2013 request adequately reflects U.S. interests and objectives in Latin America and the Caribbean. The FY2013 request for foreign aid in Latin America and the Caribbean raises questions about its alignment with U.S. interests and objectives. Congress is urged to evaluate the effectiveness of aid programs and consider potential impact of proposed cuts. Coordination among government agencies and international donors is suggested to maximize impact of foreign assistance funds. The U.S. foreign assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean is currently fragmented among various government agencies, leading to potential overlap in aid efforts. Better coordination among State Department, USAID, and DOD could ensure complementary efforts and increase program impact. Congress should also consider closer coordination with international donors to maximize the effectiveness of foreign aid funds. The U.S. foreign assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean is currently fragmented among three agencies. Closer coordination among these agencies and with international donors could ensure complementary efforts and increase the impact of foreign aid programs. Coordination is essential to avoid duplication of efforts and conflicting goals, allowing for more efficient use of limited funds. The various donors in foreign assistance programs lack coordination, leading to duplication of efforts and conflicting goals. Closer coordination could ensure complementary efforts, focus on specific countries or sectors, and use limited funds more efficiently. However, determining leadership and division of labor could be challenging. Strategic objectives may conflict with development goals, but trilateral cooperation agreements with successful countries like Brazil, Chile, and Colombia aim to provide new solutions and expertise for more impactful aid programs. The United States has signed trilateral cooperation agreements with Brazil, Chile, and Colombia to provide new solutions and expertise for more impactful aid programs in third countries. Assistance includes strengthening development agencies, implementing agriculture and food security programs, and providing training for counternarcotics and law enforcement challenges. Support for emerging donors has potential benefits and drawbacks in building capacities for U.S. partners. $18.6 million will support Colombian government efforts to provide training and technical assistance for counternarcotics and law enforcement challenges. Critics raise oversight concerns about providing assistance through foreign governments. Questions for Congress include clarifying roles of U.S. agencies in foreign assistance and encouraging inter-agency coordination. U.S. agencies providing foreign assistance need clarification on roles and coordination. Questions include comparative advantage in certain assistance programs, strategic importance of countries and sectors, and ensuring funds are used in accordance with U.S. law. Congress should consider political will and program sustainability for Latin American and Caribbean nations. The State Department's QDDR emphasizes assessing host nations' political will for effective use of U.S. assistance. Partner nations must be willing to implement reforms for assistance to have the most impact. The State Department's QDDR emphasizes assessing host nations' political will for effective use of U.S. assistance. Partner nations must be willing to implement reforms for assistance to have the most impact. The Colombian government has undertaken reforms and raised revenue, allowing for a managed transition of U.S. assistance programs. USAID is closing missions in Panama and ending family planning programs in other Latin American countries due to partner nations' increased capacity. Despite successful transitions of U.S. assistance programs in Colombia and other Latin American countries, there have been challenges with sustaining efforts due to a lack of political will and funding. Reports have shown instances where U.S.-funded programs have struggled after support ended, highlighting the importance of partner nations' capacity to manage and fund initiatives. Several Latin American and Caribbean countries have struggled to maintain equipment provided by U.S. assistance programs due to a lack of resources and funding. Even projects funded by the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) have faced challenges with sustainability. Questions arise about the host country's capacity to maintain equipment, their plan for financial responsibility, and the amount of assistance needed to build their technical and financial capacity for long-term sustainability. The House Committee on Appropriations marked up FY2013 appropriations bills for the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs in May 2012, totaling $48.3 billion. This included funding for the core State Department and Foreign Operations budget as well as Overseas Contingency Operations. Total funding levels in FY2013 would have been 9.6% lower than the FY2012 estimate and 11.8% lower than the Obama Administration's proposal. The House Committee on Appropriations marked up a bill totaling $48.3 billion for the Department of State and Foreign Operations in May 2012. The Senate Committee on Appropriations marked up a bill totaling $52.3 billion, with lower funding levels than the Obama Administration's request. The Obama Administration criticized the House bill for going beyond agreed-upon cuts and potentially damaging national security. The House bill for foreign operations was criticized by the Administration for being \"unworkable\" and potentially damaging national security. Funding levels for Latin America and the Caribbean were not specified, but the House report expressed intentions to provide assistance above the Administration's request for some countries in the region. The Committee recommended restoring reductions for key countries in Latin America to address immediate security needs. The House and Senate reports recommend increased aid to Latin American and Caribbean nations to address security needs, support counternarcotics efforts, and strengthen democratic institutions in the region. The stability of these neighbors directly impacts the United States. The House and Senate reports recommend increased aid to Latin American and Caribbean nations to address security needs, support counternarcotics efforts, and strengthen democratic institutions in the region. Additional resources are directed to strengthen democratic institutions, professional police forces, and address poverty in the region. Specific funding levels are stipulated for certain countries and programs, with both reports calling for assistance above requested levels for Colombia and Mexico. The House and Senate reports recommend increased aid to Latin American and Caribbean nations to address security needs, support counternarcotics efforts, and strengthen democratic institutions in the region. In Colombia, the House report recommended funding levels above the request for training and technical assistance, while the Senate report supported additional economic development activities along the U.S.-Mexican border. The House also recommended funding for democracy programs in Venezuela, differing from the Senate's support for the Administration's request. The House and Senate differed in priorities for funding democracy programs in Venezuela and regional security programs. The House recommended higher funding levels for democracy programs in Venezuela and regional security programs in CARSI and CBSI. In contrast, the Senate supported the Administration's request for funding levels. Additionally, the Senate recommended increased funding for conservation programs in the Brazilian Amazon, while the House did not mention such programs. The Senate bill recommended higher funding for conservation programs in the Brazilian Amazon and the Inter-American Foundation, while the House bill funded at requested levels. Congress did not take action on the appropriations bills, instead enacting a six-month continuing resolution. Funding for State Department and Foreign Operations accounts in FY2013 remained the same as in FY2012, subject to budget sequestration cuts. The approved legislation (P.L. 113-6) funded federal programs through the end of FY2013, maintaining funding levels for State Department and Foreign Operations accounts from FY2012 with some exceptions. However, funding was also subject to budget sequestration cuts. Sequestration reduced funding by about 5%, applied at the account level, leading to country-level allocations for FY2013 not yet being available."
