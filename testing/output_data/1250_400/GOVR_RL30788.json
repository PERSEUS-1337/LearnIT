The Senate applies regulations from various parliamentary authorities based on key principles such as deriving procedures from multiple sources, the power to make its own rules, initiating enforcement of rules by Senators, conducting business by unanimous consent, following precedents, and adhering to informal practices. Senate procedures are not only found in standing rules but also in requirements imposed by the Constitution, standing orders, precedents, and statutory regulations. The Senate follows various parliamentary authorities and principles in its procedures, including deriving rules from multiple sources, enforcing rules by Senators, conducting business by unanimous consent, following precedents, and adhering to informal practices. Senate procedures are not only found in standing rules but also in requirements imposed by the Constitution, standing orders, precedents, and statutory regulations. The Senate's constitutional rulemaking authority allows it to determine its procedures by adopting amendments or creating new rules by majority vote. This authority also extends to creating standing orders and enacting rulemaking provisions found in statutes like the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act. Familiarity with Senate practices, not just standing rules, is crucial for understanding how the Senate conducts its business. The Senate can decide on its rules through majority vote, creating new rules or amendments. It can also waive rules by unanimous consent or suspend them with a two-thirds vote. Unlike the House, the Senate cannot supersede its rules by majority vote.

Consent agreements have the same authority as the Senate's standing rules and can only be altered by unanimous consent. The Senate's precedents detail how its rules are interpreted and applied, complementing and supplementing the rules themselves. The Senate's precedents play a crucial role in interpreting and applying its rules, serving as a guide when understanding how the rules are implemented. Similar to case law, Senators use precedents to support their arguments, defend against points of order, or appeal rulings made by the presiding officer. These precedents influence the application of current Senate rules by connecting past decisions to the specific case at hand. Precedents in the Senate are crucial for interpreting and applying rules, guiding decisions on questions of order and parliamentary inquiries. Senate precedents are established through votes on questions of order or rulings by the presiding officer, with decisions upheld until the Senate decides otherwise. Precedents based on Senate votes carry more weight than those from the presiding officer, reflecting the Senate's ultimate authority over its rules. Senate precedents are crucial for interpreting rules and guiding decisions. Precedents based on Senate votes carry more weight than those from the presiding officer.
