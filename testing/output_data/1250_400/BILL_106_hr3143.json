    "content": "The Act titled \"High Performance Schools Act of 1999\" is established for the purpose of improving school performance. The Congress finds that American K-12 schools spend over $6 billion annually on energy costs, educators and students perform best in a comfortable, healthy environment, over half of schools are over 40 years old and need renovation, inadequate ventilation, poor lighting, and uncomfortable temperatures can affect student performance, and inefficient water use is prevalent in older schools. Inefficient water use and poor lighting in older schools can impact student performance. Adopting a whole building approach in school design and renovation can lead to high-performance buildings, improving student and teacher performance while lowering life-cycle costs. Energy conservation in construction projects can save money for educational resources. Energy conservation in school construction and renovation projects can save costs, allowing more funds for teachers and educational materials. The use of renewable energy sources in low-energy buildings can meet energy needs without emissions. Implementing environmentally preferable products and ensuring fresh air supply improves indoor air quality in school buildings. Many school districts lack knowledge of efficient design and technologies for new construction or renovations. Congress is considering legislation to support school districts in building and renovating schools. Most school districts lack knowledge of efficient design and technologies for new school construction or renovations. Congress is considering legislation to assist school districts in building and renovating schools to be high performance, healthful, productive, energy efficient, and environmentally sound. The legislation aims to establish and administer a program to assist school districts in constructing and renovating schools to be high performance, healthful, productive, energy efficient, and environmentally sound. The High Performance Schools Program is established in the Department of Education to provide grants to school districts for energy efficiency improvements and renovations. Grants must achieve a 30% increase in energy efficiency beyond the 1998 International Energy Conservation Code levels. Grants are awarded based on demonstrated need for responding to school enrollments or renovating school facilities. Grants are provided to school districts with demonstrated need for responding to increasing school enrollments or renovating facilities. Funds must be used to develop high performance school buildings in accordance with approved plans. Grants can also be used for evaluating compliance with program requirements and promoting the development of high performance school buildings. Grants to school districts are used for compliance evaluation, promoting high performance school buildings, organizing programs, obtaining technical services, and collecting project data. Additionally, grants can be used for promotional activities and facilitating financing. Grants for high performance school building projects can be used for promotional and marketing activities, facilitating financing, working with school administrations, students, and communities, and coordinating public benefit programs. School districts must develop feasible plans in consultation with State offices of energy and education to receive grants, and are encouraged to supplement grant funds with other sources. Governors of States will receive funds for implementing the Act, with discretion to allocate funds to State agencies for assisting school districts. Funds under section 5 will be distributed with 70% for grants under section 3(b)(1), 15% for grants under section 3(b)(2), and 15% for grants under section 3(b)(3). The Secretary of Education may retain funds to assist State agencies in coordinating the Program. Authorization of appropriations for grants under section 3(b) includes $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2001, increasing annually to $230,000,000 for fiscal year 2004, with additional funding for subsequent years as needed. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. This section defines terms such as \"elementary school,\" \"secondary school,\" \"high performance school building,\" and \"renewable energy.\" High performance school buildings maximize renewable energy use, energy conservation, cost-effectiveness, and environmental quality. Renewable energy includes solar, wind, geothermal, hydropower, and biomass power."
