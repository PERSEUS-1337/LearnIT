    "content": "The unemployment rate is defined as the percentage of unemployed individuals in the civilian labor force age 16 and older. It can fluctuate based on changes in both the number of unemployed workers and the size of the labor force. During a recession, the labor force may decrease as discouraged workers stop looking for jobs, while it may increase if more people start actively seeking employment. During a recession, the unemployment rate can rise even when the economy shows signs of improvement. This is because discouraged workers may reenter the labor force, causing the rate to increase. Firms are cautious about hiring until they are confident in sustained economic growth. The unemployment rate is considered a lagging economic indicator, improving only after other indicators signal recovery. During a recession's end, firms are hesitant to hire new workers until they are certain of sustained economic growth. They may increase production by extending current employees' hours or having them work overtime instead. Job growth may not immediately follow signs of economic improvement. Labor market analysts rely on the Current Employment Statistics program for job data, which surveys nonfarm employers monthly.

The unemployment rate peaked at different points in each of the 10 recessions since World War II. In some instances, it continued to rise for a few months into the economic recovery, while in others, it did not peak until well into the recovery period. Job growth did not occur steadily until after the end of all recessions. After the end of all 10 recessions, job growth did not occur steadily until several months later. In most cases, the number of jobs on employer payrolls fluctuated for months after the recession's end. Sustained job growth typically began within three to five months of the start of recoveries, but in some instances, like the 1990-1991 and 2001 recessions, steady job growth was delayed for over a year, leading to jobless recoveries. The delayed improvement in the labor market after the 2001 recession led to jobless recoveries. While private sector employment started to rise in January 2010, fiscal issues in local governments slowed overall job growth."
