Mental health parity laws aim to provide equal coverage for mental health services compared to medical and surgical benefits. Mental health parity laws aim to provide equal insurance coverage for mental health services compared to medical and surgical benefits. Policymakers have developed three general approaches to achieving parity, based on coverage mandates and parity requirements. Federal mental health parity law prior to the ACA employed these approaches. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements by creating a mandated benefit for certain mental health and substance abuse disorder services. It does not mandate coverage of specific services but requires compliance with parity requirements for insurers covering both mental health and medical/surgical benefits. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements by mandating coverage for certain mental health and substance abuse disorder services in specific financing arrangements. It does not include a comprehensive coverage mandate for mental health services at the federal level but requires compliance with parity requirements established by two prior federal laws. The federal mental health parity requirements are established by two laws, MHPA and MHPAEA. These laws require parity in limits and benefits for mental health and medical/surgical services. Recent data shows that some employers have adjusted their benefits in response to MHPAEA, with a small percentage dropping mental health coverage. The ACA mandates coverage for certain mental health and substance abuse services in specific plans. The ACA mandates coverage for mental health and substance use disorder services in certain plans, including those offered through the Exchanges. MHPA was the first federal mental health parity law, employing a mandated offering parity approach with no coverage mandates but requiring partial parity by mandating dollar limits on mental health coverage to be no less than those for medical and surgical services. The Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA) and subsequent federal parity legislation mandate that group health plans and insurance issuers must provide mental health coverage on par with medical and surgical services. MHPA includes exemptions for small employers and cost increases, with annual extensions until 2008. The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) expands these requirements at the federal level to include substance use disorders. The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) expands federal mental health parity requirements to include substance use disorders, treatment limitations, financial requirements, and in- and out-of-network benefits. It also amends small employer exemptions and clarifies cost exemption parameters. These federal requirements do not apply to the individual market. The MHPAEA expands federal mental health parity requirements to include substance use disorders, treatment limitations, and financial requirements. It also clarifies cost exemption parameters. These requirements do not apply to the individual market. The ACA extends the applicability of federal mental health parity requirements and mandates coverage of certain mental health services by specific plan types. The ACA extends federal mental health parity requirements to include specific plan types like qualified health plans, Medicaid non-managed care benchmark plans, and individual market plans. It also mandates coverage of certain mental health services by these plans. The small employer exemption remains in effect, and starting in 2014, QHPs purchased through an Exchange must cover mental health services in compliance with federal parity requirements. The ACA extends federal mental health parity requirements to include specific plan types like qualified health plans, Medicaid non-managed care benchmark plans, and individual market plans. Starting in 2014, QHPs purchased through an Exchange must cover mental health services in compliance with federal parity requirements. The small employer exemption remains in effect, and the definition of small employer was expanded under the ACA. Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans must also offer mental health services in compliance with federal parity requirements. The ACA did not alter the applicability of parity requirements with respect to the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). The ACA extends federal mental health parity requirements to include specific plan types like qualified health plans, Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans, and individual market plans. It mandates coverage of certain mental health services for QHPs, Medicaid plans, and small group market plans. Prior to the ACA, federal mental health parity law did not mandate coverage but required full parity when benefits were offered. The ACA creates a coverage mandate for mental health and substance abuse services broadly for QHPs and extends this mandate to Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans. The ACA mandates coverage of mental health and substance abuse services for qualified health plans, Medicaid benchmark plans, and small group market plans. It defines essential health benefits that must be offered, including mental health and substance use disorder services. The ACA requires all Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) to offer essential health benefits (EHB), including mental health and substance abuse services. The scope of covered services within the EHB is determined through the rulemaking process, with coverage required for services in 10 general categories. Medicaid benchmark plans must also offer at least the EHB by January 1, 2014. The ACA mandates that all Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) must provide essential health benefits (EHB), including mental health services. While not a comprehensive federal mandate, these requirements create a federal-level obligation for insurers to cover mental health benefits. Some states also have parity laws mandating coverage for certain mental health conditions. Additionally, states can require QHPs to cover additional benefits beyond the EHB. The ACA mandates that all Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) must provide essential health benefits (EHB), including mental health services. States can require QHPs to cover additional benefits beyond the EHB, but they must assume the cost of those benefits. Federal mental health parity requirements apply to all QHPs in the same manner as health insurance issuers and group health plans. The ACA mandates that all Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) must provide essential health benefits (EHB), including mental health services. Federal mental health parity requirements apply to all QHPs in the same manner as health insurance issuers and group health plans, impacting small group and individual plans offered through the Exchanges. Large group plans may have less incentive to participate due to risk pooling advantages for enrollees in small group and individual plans. The federal mental health parity law under the ACA extends requirements to individual market plans, but the small employer exemption remains in place. The law applies to group and individual health insurance coverage, including plans offered through the Exchanges. The ACA conforming amendment extends federal mental health parity law requirements to individual market plans, but the small employer exemption may still apply. The definition of \"small employer\" has been expanded to include employers with 1 to 100 employees. The small employer exemption under federal mental health parity law may still apply, as the definition of \"small employer\" has been expanded to include employers with 1 to 100 employees. This means a wider range of employers may now be eligible for the exemption. The expanded definition of small employer now includes self-employed individuals, raising questions about whether plans offered to individuals in the individual market must comply with federal mental health parity requirements. There is uncertainty about whether small employer QHPs may be exempt from these requirements under ACA Section 1311(j). The application of mental health parity provisions to QHPs is not clearly defined, including the potential application of the small employer exemption. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans, which are not Medicaid managed care plans. These plans must comply with the federal mental health parity provisions found in the PHSA. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans, which must comply with parity requirements for treatment limitations and financial requirements. Plans offering EPSDT are deemed to meet the parity requirement. Medicaid benchmark or benchmark-equivalent plans are not required to comply with federal requirements for parity in annual and lifetime limits and for in- and out-of-network covered benefits, unlike Medicaid managed care plans. It is unclear if the parity requirements extend to plans offered under traditional Medicaid. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to all newly eligible Medicaid populations enrolled through benchmark or benchmark-equivalent non-managed care plans. It is unclear how this will impact coverage for mental health and substance abuse services for Medicaid enrollees. The CHIP statute also contains provisions related to federal parity requirements. The ACA extends federal mental health parity requirements to newly eligible Medicaid populations enrolled through benchmark or benchmark-equivalent non-managed care plans. The CHIP statute also includes provisions regarding federal parity requirements that may need to be aligned with ACA changes. The plan must comply with federal mental health parity requirements for Medicaid non-managed care benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans, as mandated by ACA Section 2001. CHIP plans offering EPSDT services are deemed to satisfy the parity requirement, but it is unclear if this fulfills all requirements. Compliance with PHSA Section 2705 is also required for coverage under SSA Section 2103. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to include plans in the individual market, QHPs, and certain Medicaid plan types. It mandates coverage of specific mental health services for certain plan types, although not a comprehensive federal-level coverage mandate. Compliance with PHSA Section 2705 is required for coverage under SSA Section 2103. Offering EPSDT services fulfills the parity requirement for CHIP plans. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to include plans in the individual market, QHPs, and certain Medicaid plan types. It mandates coverage of specific mental health services for certain plan types, although not a comprehensive federal-level coverage mandate. Federal mental health parity requirements are extended to all qualified health plans, but questions remain about the impact on small employer plans in the Exchange. Certain federal mental health parity requirements are extended to Medicaid non-managed care benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans, but it is unclear if they apply to non-managed care plans in traditional Medicaid. The CHIP statute contains two separate parity-related provisions. The federal mental health parity requirements are extended to Medicaid non-managed care benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans, but it is unclear if they apply to non-managed care plans in traditional Medicaid. The CHIP statute contains two separate parity-related provisions, with one having a more limited reach and the other applying the requirements in their entirety to CHIP plans."
