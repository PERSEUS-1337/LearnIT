    "content": "During the debates over the 1998 HEA amendments, campus crimes, particularly drug-related incidents, were a major concern for Congress. Representative Souder highlighted the increasing number of drug and alcohol-related incidents on college campuses, calling it an epidemic. As a response, Congress added a provision to P.L. 105-244, stating that students convicted of drug offenses would be ineligible for federal student assistance under Title IV of the HEA. The legislation under P.L. 105-244 specifies that students convicted of drug offenses will be ineligible for federal student assistance under Title IV of the HEA. The period of ineligibility depends on the type and number of convictions, with indefinite ineligibility for multiple convictions. Reinstatement of eligibility requires completion of a drug rehabilitation program or removal of the conviction from the student's record.

Reinstatement of eligibility requires completion of a drug rehabilitation program or removal of the conviction from the student's record. A student convicted of drug offenses may be ineligible for federal student assistance under Title IV of the HEA. To regain eligibility, they must complete a drug rehabilitation program that meets specific requirements, including receiving funds from government programs or insurance companies and undergoing unannounced drug tests. Participation in the program can reduce the period of ineligibility based on the number of convictions. A rehabilitation program for drug offenses can reduce ineligibility for federal student assistance under Title IV of the HEA. Participation requires at least two unannounced drug tests and completion of the program. Upon completion, the student self-certifies completion. Over 180,000 students have been affected by this provision, representing less than .25% of federal financial aid applicants. California and Texas have seen a high number of cases. Since the provision's adoption, a small percentage of federal financial aid applicants have been denied aid or faced delays. California and Texas have had numerous students declared ineligible. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 amended the provision to disqualify students only for drug convictions while enrolled in postsecondary education and receiving Title IV aid.

The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 amended the provision to disqualify students from federal aid only for drug convictions while enrolled in postsecondary education. The period of ineligibility depends on the type of conviction. Discussions are ongoing regarding potential modifications to this provision in the upcoming reauthorization of Title IV of the Higher Education Act. During the 1998 reauthorization discussions, the focus was on drug-related crimes leading to the provision disqualifying students from financial aid. Critics argue that singling out drugs is unfair compared to other crimes like rape or armed robbery. Supporters justify the focus on drugs due to their prevalence on college campuses. The implications of limiting aid eligibility to drug convictions are being debated. The provision disqualifying students from financial aid for drug convictions is more severe than for other crimes like rape or armed robbery. Supporters argue that drug-related crimes are more prevalent on college campuses, justifying the focus on them. The current policy does not differentiate between misdemeanor or felony drug convictions, resulting in loss of eligibility regardless of jail time served. Congress may consider reevaluating the distinction between selling and possession of controlled substances, as well as the difference between felony and misdemeanor drug convictions.

Congress may debate the distinction between selling and possession of controlled substances, as well as felony and misdemeanor drug convictions in relation to eligibility for student aid."
