    "content": "In the 109th Congress, legislation has been approved to reauthorize and revise the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Block Grant, including changes to the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program. The CSE program, enacted in 1975, is administered by the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) and funded by general revenues, providing services to families receiving TANF benefits. Child Support Enforcement (CSE) programs are operated in all 50 states and funded by federal matching funds. Families receiving TANF benefits, foster care payments, or Medicaid coverage automatically qualify for CSE services. Child support collected on behalf of non-welfare families goes directly to the family. Between FY1978 and FY2003, child support payments collected by CSE agencies increased significantly. However, the program still only collects 18% of child support obligations for which it is responsible. In FY1978 to FY2003, child support payments collected by CSE agencies increased from $1 billion to $21.2 billion. The number of children with established paternity increased by 1,274%. The program handles at least 50% of all child support cases and provides various services including parent location, paternity establishment, and support order establishment. Collection methods include income withholding and intercept of federal and state funds. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) agencies provide various services for children, including parent location, paternity establishment, child support order establishment, review and modification of support orders, collection and distribution of support payments, and enforcement of medical support. Collection methods include income withholding, intercept of federal and state income tax refunds, liens against property, and reporting to credit bureaus. Federal laws like the Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act of 1998 establish criminal offenses for noncustodial parents who fail to financially support their children. States are required to implement expedited procedures for securing assets to satisfy arrearages. The Child Support Enforcement agencies enforce laws to secure assets from noncustodial parents who fail to financially support their children, including intercepting payments and seizing assets. States are required to implement procedures to withhold licenses and conduct data matches with financial institutions to identify and seize resources. The Secretary of State is authorized to deny passports to debtor parents. The Child Support Enforcement agencies enforce laws to secure assets from noncustodial parents who fail to financially support their children. States are required to conduct data matches with financial institutions to identify and seize resources. P.L. 104-193 authorized the Secretary of State to deny passports to debtor parents and required states to enact the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act. The federal government reimburses states for administering their CSE programs and pays incentives for effective programs. P.L. 105-200 established a new cost-neutral incentive payment system. The government incentivizes states to operate effective Child Support Enforcement programs. The program has evolved to focus on service delivery, promoting self-sufficiency, and securing financial support for children. Child support payments are a significant income source for single-parent families, with an average of 17% of family income coming from child support. Child support payments are crucial for single-parent families, constituting 17% of family income on average and 30% for poor families. Bills S. 667 and H.R. 240 aim to enhance the Child Support Enforcement program to boost economic independence for former welfare families and provide stable income for single-parent households. Both bills simplify rules, strengthen family-first policies, and introduce new enforcement tools, with the Senate bill having a more extensive list of provisions. The 1996 welfare reform law introduced policies regarding Child Support Enforcement (CSE). Both bills, S. 667 and H.R. 240, modify CSE enforcement tools. Families receiving TANF benefits must assign their child support rights to the state, with assigned collections kept by states and the federal government as reimbursement. The child support assignment under the 1996 welfare reform law requires families receiving TANF benefits to assign their child support rights to the state. Assigned collections are kept by states and the federal government as reimbursement. The assignment date determines which arrearages are permanently or temporarily assigned to the state. Under the 1996 welfare reform law, families on TANF must assign child support rights to the state. The assignment date determines which arrearages are permanently or temporarily assigned. Proposed changes in legislation would affect the assignment of child support during TANF benefits, with differences between S. 667 and H.R. 240. Distribution rules determine the order of child support collections. The House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources approved H.R. 240 without changes to child support assignment rules. Distribution rules determine the order of child support payments, with states having discretion over how much to send to TANF families. The 1996 welfare law repealed the $50 pass-through requirement and allowed states to decide on their share of child support payments collected for TANF families. States are required to pay the federal government their share of child support collections. Both bills aim to incentivize states to direct more child support collected for TANF families to the families themselves, rather than reimbursing state and federal welfare benefits. The bills differ in the amount of federal cost-sharing provided. The bills aim to shift child support collections for TANF families towards the families themselves, with differences in federal cost-sharing. S. 667 proposes federal cost-sharing for pass-through and disregard policies, allowing states to pay up to $400 per month per child to families without reimbursing the federal government. The House bill, H.R. 240, aims to incentivize states to increase their pass-through and disregard policies for child support collections for TANF families. It allows states to pay more child support to families without reimbursing the federal government, with a limit on federal cost-sharing. The House bill, H.R. 240, proposes increasing pass-through and disregard policies for child support collections for TANF families. It limits federal cost-sharing and requires states to prioritize distributing child support to former TANF families before reimbursement. The 1996 welfare reform law aims to prioritize distributing child support to former TANF families, with the goal of reducing dependence on public assistance. Child support accrued before and after TANF goes to the family, while support during TANF goes to the state. States may choose to distribute the full amount of child support collected to former TANF families. The proposed legislation (S. 667 and H.R. 240) aims to give states the option to distribute the full amount of child support collected to former TANF families, including arrearages. The federal government would share the costs of paying child support arrearages to the family, simplifying the distribution process and reducing dependence on public assistance. The proposed legislation aims to give states the option of distributing the full amount of child support collected to former TANF families, including arrearages. Both bills include provisions for lowering passport denial thresholds, facilitating child support collection from various sources, and authorizing the comparison of noncustodial parent information for pursuing child support arrearages. The proposed legislation includes provisions to enhance states' ability to collect child support payments, such as authorizing the comparison of noncustodial parent information with insurer data and allowing assisting states to establish interstate child support cases. Additionally, the bills empower the HHS Secretary to seize financial assets of noncustodial parents who owe child support and require medical support for children from both parents. The proposed legislation includes provisions to enhance states' ability to collect child support payments, such as authorizing the comparison of noncustodial parent information with insurer data and allowing assisting states to establish interstate child support cases. It also empowers the HHS Secretary to seize financial assets of noncustodial parents who owe child support and requires medical support for children from both parents. Additionally, the bills include requirements for CSE agencies to notify health care plan administrators when a child loses health care coverage and to review and adjust child support orders of TANF families every three years. The proposed legislation aims to enhance states' child support collection abilities by allowing comparison of noncustodial parent information with insurer data, establishing interstate child support cases, and seizing financial assets of noncustodial parents who owe child support. It also includes provisions for medical support for children from both parents and requirements for CSE agencies to notify health care plan administrators of coverage changes and review child support orders for TANF families every three years. H.R. 240 and S. 667 introduce various provisions to improve the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program, such as increasing funding for access and visitation programs, adopting a later version of the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA), and allowing Texas to continue its CSE program for nonwelfare families without a federal waiver.
