    "content": "The FY2020 Defense Appropriations Act (P.L. 116-93) overview tracks its legislative history, budgetary context, and treatment of major components of the Trump Administration's budget request. The Trump Administration requested $750.0 billion for national defense activities, with $718.3 billion allocated to the Department of Defense. $689.5 billion of the DOD budget fell within the scope of the defense appropriations bill. The FY2020 Defense Appropriations Act, enacted as Division A of H.R. 1158, provides $687.8 billion for the Department of Defense, which is $2.86 billion less than President Trump's request. This bill does not include funding for military construction, family housing, or accrual payments for the TRICARE for Life program. The FY2020 Defense Appropriations Act, part of H.R. 1158, allocates $687.8 billion for the Department of Defense, $2.86 billion less than requested by President Trump. Since 2009, non-base budget funds have been designated for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) to address post-9/11 activities and other distinct costs. The OCO designation allows for spending exemptions from annual caps set by the Budget Control Act of 2011. The OCO designation allows for spending exemptions from annual caps set by the Budget Control Act of 2011. The FY2020 defense budget included $97.9 billion designated as OCO funding to avoid exceeding the spending cap. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 raised the defense spending cap for FY2020 to $666.5 billion. The Senate and House included \"OCO for base\" funds in the base budget request, but this became irrelevant with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 raising the defense spending cap for FY2020 to $666.5 billion. Separate versions of the FY2020 defense appropriations bill were reported by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. A compromise version was agreed upon by House and Senate negotiators and incorporated into H.R. 1158, which was passed by both chambers. The President's FY2020 budget request for DOD reflects a shift in strategic emphasis based on the 2018 National Defense Strategy, focusing on increased investment to counter threats from China and Russia. This marks a change from past U.S. national security policy, emphasizing competition between nuclear-armed powers. During the Cold War, the focus was on strategic competition with the Soviet Union and containing communism globally. The U.S. military establishment shifted its focus from the Cold War era strategic competition with the Soviet Union to dealing with regional aggressors like Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. After 9/11, the focus turned to countering terrorism in the Middle East while addressing North Korean and Iranian nuclear programs. The 2014 Russian invasion of Crimea and China's actions raised concerns about aggressive regimes in Moscow and Beijing. The 2014 Russian invasion of Crimea and China's militarization of islands in the South China Sea raised concerns about aggressive regimes in Moscow and Beijing. This highlighted the importance of competing with other great powers and addressing serious threats such as fragile states, terrorism, and nuclear proliferation. Adversaries may collaborate to achieve shared objectives and use social and economic tools to advance their agendas. The Trump Administration's National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy reorient U.S. national security towards great power competition with China and Russia, emphasizing the need to address serious threats like fragile states, terrorism, and nuclear proliferation. Adversaries collaborate to achieve shared objectives, blurring the lines between conventional and irregular conflict. The January 2018 National Defense Strategy (NDS) shifts U.S. national security focus to great power competition with China and Russia, emphasizing the need to bolster U.S. forces' competitive advantage. The document highlights the erosion of this advantage vis-\u00e0-vis Chinese and Russian threats and the need for U.S. forces to expect vigorous contestation of military objectives. The NDS aligns with prior Administrations in identifying China, Russia, North Korea, Iran, and global terrorist groups as significant threats, but places a higher priority on maintaining a strategic edge over China and Russia. The National Defense Strategy (NDS) identifies China, Russia, North Korea, Iran, and global terrorist groups as significant threats. The NDS prioritizes maintaining a strategic edge over China and Russia, leading to a \"2+3\" strategy. Federal spending has increased significantly over the past four decades, with mandatory spending for entitlement programs growing rapidly. Federal spending has increased significantly over the past four decades, with mandatory spending for entitlement programs growing rapidly by a factor of nine. The Budget Control Act of 2011 aimed to control federal spending through sequestration of government operating budgets if discretionary spending budgets exceeded set caps. Sequestration involves automatic cancellation of previous appropriations to meet the BCA cap. Caps on defense-related spending apply to discretionary funding for DOD and defense-related activities, excluding emergency or OCO funding. The Budget Control Act of 2011 set caps on defense-related spending, excluding emergency or OCO funding. Despite repeated legislation to raise the caps, the national defense spending cap for FY2020 remained at $576 billion. The Administration's FY2020 base budget request adhered to this cap but included $165 billion designated as OCO funding, with $98 billion intended for base budget purposes. Congress disregarded this tactic and considered all funding for base budget purposes as part of the base budget request. The FY2020 budget request included $165 billion in OCO funding, with $98 billion for base budget purposes. The House and Senate Committees considered all funding for base budget purposes. P.L. 116-93 funds a modest increase in active-duty military personnel but reduces the Army's end-strength by 7,500. It also funds a reduction in the Selected Reserve end-strength and a 3.1% increase in military basic pay. Additionally, $61.7 million is appropriated for DOD's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office. The FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 116-93) funds a 3.1% increase in military basic pay and allocates $61.7 million for DOD's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office. It also provides funding for the Special Victims' Counsel program and a pilot program for treating military personnel with PTSD related to sexual trauma. Additionally, $110 million is added to the childcare program for DOD, the largest employer-sponsored childcare program in the US. The FY2019 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 115-232) added $110 million to the DOD's childcare program, supporting plans to increase capacity and prioritize construction requirements. The act also supports the modernization of nuclear and long-range strike weapons, with a focus on the nuclear triad. The Trump Administration's FY2020 budget prioritizes modernizing the nuclear triad with hypersonic long-range missiles. These missiles can travel at speeds five times the speed of sound and maneuver throughout their flight trajectory. DOD has been funding hypersonic weapons development since the early 2000s, but recent efforts have been accelerated due to China and Russia's advancements in this technology. Congress has supported funding for the U.S. hypersonic program in both the FY2019 and FY2020 budgets. The FY2020 DOD budget request and enacted defense appropriations bill prioritize funding for hypersonic weapons development, with additional funding allocated for defenses against hypersonic missiles. A Joint Hypersonics Transition Office was created to coordinate R&D programs, although concerns were raised about potential duplication of efforts and increased costs. Overall, the Administration's proposals to strengthen defenses were supported. In FY2020, the DOD prioritized funding for hypersonic weapons development and defenses against ballistic missile attacks. The enacted defense bill supported the Administration's proposals to strengthen defenses, with adjustments made to the missile defense budget to reflect recommendations from the Missile Defense Review. Changes were made in response to DOD's cancellation of the Replacement Kill Vehicle program. The FY2020 defense bill reallocates funds to develop an improved interceptor missile to replace the Ground-Based Interceptors (GBIs) and their kill vehicles. It also includes funding for additional GBI missiles, support equipment, and research to enhance GBI reliability. Additionally, the bill supports the Administration's funding requests for military space satellites and satellite launches, with $40 million approved for the newly created Space Force. The FY2020 defense bill approved $40 million for the newly created Space Force, which was 44% less than requested. It also provided additional funding to upgrade the firepower of the Stryker wheeled troop-carrier by replacing its .50 caliber machine gun with a 30 mm cannon. The FY2020 defense bill approved $40 million for the Space Force, 44% less than requested. It also included funding to upgrade the Stryker troop-carrier with a 30 mm cannon, replacing the .50 caliber machine gun. The bill reflects mixed congressional support for the Army's new combat capabilities strategy, reallocating funds from existing upgrade programs to prioritize new systems like the Bradley fighting vehicles and CH-47 Chinook helicopters. The enacted bill provides less than requested for Bradley upgrades, with $223.0 million cut labeled as \"excess to need.\" The enacted FY2020 defense bill provides less funding than requested for Bradley upgrades, with $223.0 million cut as \"excess to need.\" However, it allocates nearly triple the amount requested for CH-47 Chinook upgrades, appropriating $46.2 million instead of $18.2 million. The bill challenges the Army's plan to forego upgrades to the existing CH-47 fleet and reins in the Army's third effort in 20 years to develop a replacement for the Bradley infantry fighting vehicle. The FY2020 defense bill challenges the Army's plan to forego upgrades to the existing CH-47 fleet and reins in the Army's third effort in 20 years to develop a replacement for the Bradley infantry fighting vehicle. P.L. 116-93 provides $205.6 million for the Optionally-Manned Fighting Vehicle program, which was later cancelled by the Army. The bill generally supports the budget request for major aviation programs of all four armed forces. The FY2020 defense bill challenges the Army's plan to forego upgrades to the existing CH-47 fleet and reins in the Army's effort to develop a replacement for the Bradley infantry fighting vehicle. The bill provides funding for the CH-47 Chinook helicopter upgrade and F-15 fighter aircraft to address gaps in Air Force fighter strength. The FY2020 defense bill allocated $985.5 million for eight F-15s to address Air Force fighter strength gaps due to delays in the F-35A Joint Strike Fighter program. Some funds were shifted for testing purposes. The bill also supports the Navy's shipbuilding budget to increase the fleet size to 355 ships, including funds for unmanned surface and subsurface ships. The FY2020 defense bill supports the Navy's shipbuilding budget to increase the fleet size to 355 ships, including funds for unmanned surface and subsurface ships. The bill also allocated funds for specialized ships and a landing craft to support amphibious landings by Marine Corps units. The FY2020 defense bill supports the Navy's shipbuilding budget to increase the fleet size to 355 ships, including funds for specialized ships and a landing craft to support amphibious landings by Marine Corps units. Additionally, $1.2 billion was provided for incorporating the Virginia Payload Module into funded ships, equipped with vertical launch tubes for additional Tomahawk missiles.
