    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\" is a condensed summary of the section title and findings. The Act titled \"Access to Women's Health Care Act of 1997\" emphasizes the importance of obstetrician-gynecologists in providing primary and preventive health care for women throughout their lifetime. Obstetrician-gynecologists play a crucial role in managing women's health beyond reproductive issues, reducing the need for referrals to other physicians, and offering basic health care services uniquely tailored to women. Obstetrician-gynecologists provide primary and preventive health care for women, managing their health beyond reproductive issues and offering basic health services. Some states promote access to these specialists, but others lack protections against access restrictions. SEC. 2. ASSURING ACCESS TO OBSTETRICAL AND GYNECOLOGICAL SERVICES UNDER GROUP HEALTH PLANS AND INSURANCE COVERAGE by amending the Public Health Service Act to establish standards for access to obstetrical and gynecological services. The provision ensures that female enrollees in group health plans can designate an obstetrician-gynecologist as their primary care provider without prior authorization requirements for obstetric and gynecologic care. The provision allows female enrollees in group health plans to designate an obstetrician-gynecologist as their primary care provider without prior authorization for gynecologic care. Group health plans cannot deny women eligibility based on this choice. Group health plans and health insurance issuers are prohibited from denying women eligibility based on choosing an obstetrician-gynecologist as their primary care provider. They cannot offer monetary incentives to encourage women to accept less coverage or penalize providers for following the requirements of this section. Plans must comply with notice requirements and reimbursement for care provided in accordance with this section is not to be limited. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 requires compliance with notice requirements for group health plans. Reimbursement negotiations with providers for care are allowed. State laws providing greater protections to enrollees than this section are not preempted. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 is amended to provide greater protections to enrollees in group health insurance coverage. Amendments include adding new sections and updating existing ones to ensure compliance with notice requirements and allow reimbursement negotiations with providers. State laws offering more extensive protections to enrollees are not preempted. SEC. 713. STANDARDS RELATING TO ACCESS TO OBSTETRICAL AND GYNECOLOGICAL SERVICES. In connection with group health plans, female enrollees are allowed to designate an obstetrician-gynecologist as their primary care provider without prior authorization for obstetric and gynecologic care. Female enrollees in group health plans can designate an obstetrician-gynecologist as their primary care provider for obstetric and gynecologic care without prior authorization. The plan must treat the ordering of other gynecologic care by the participating physician as prior authorization from the primary care provider. The plan cannot deny a woman eligibility based on this provision and must still adhere to coverage requirements for medical necessity and appropriateness. Group health plans and health insurance issuers cannot deny women eligibility based on avoiding requirements, offer incentives to accept less coverage, or penalize providers for following the section's guidelines. Imposing these requirements is considered a material modification in the plan, requiring notice to participants. The section outlines that any changes in the plan related to the requirements must be communicated to participants within 60 days of the first plan year. It also allows group health plans to negotiate reimbursement levels with providers. Additionally, it clarifies that state laws providing greater protections to enrollees in group health insurance coverage are not preempted by this section. The section clarifies that state laws offering more protection to enrollees in group health insurance coverage are not overridden by this provision. Standards relating to access to obstetrical and gynecological services are outlined in section 2752 of the Public Health Service Act. This provision applies to individual health insurance coverage. The provisions of section 2706 apply to individual health insurance coverage offered by a health insurance issuer. The issuer must comply with notice requirements similar to those for group health plans. State laws providing greater protections to enrollees than this section are not preempted. Section 2762 of the Act does not supersede State laws that offer greater protections to enrollees in group health insurance coverage. The effective dates for the amendments are specified for group health plans and individual market health insurance coverage. The amendment applies to health insurance coverage in the individual market starting January 1, 1998. Group health plans under collective bargaining agreements ratified before the Act's enactment are exempt until the last agreement terminates or January 1, 1998. Plan amendments to comply with the Act do not count as agreement terminations."
