    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Consumer Assurance of Radiologic Excellence Act of 2003\". Congress finds that over 300 million medical imaging exams and radiation therapy treatments are conducted annually in the US, with 7 out of 10 Americans undergoing these procedures each year. The impact of these procedures on public health and safety, as well as interstate commerce, is significant. It is crucial to minimize unnecessary radiation exposure by ensuring that personnel have proper education and credentials. Additionally, there is a need for a steady supply of well-educated individuals and accreditation programs overseen by State governments to uphold public health and safety standards. The importance of having adequately educated personnel with proper credentials for medical imaging and radiation therapy procedures is crucial for public health and safety. It is necessary for individuals in these roles to demonstrate competence through education, training, and experience. Both State and Federal Governments share the responsibility of ensuring the protection of public health from unnecessary procedures. Facilities conducting these procedures impact interstate commerce as patients often travel across state lines for services. Facilities conducting medical imaging or radiation therapy impact interstate commerce as patients travel across state lines for services. In 1981, Congress enacted the Consumer-Patient Radiation Health and Safety Act to establish Federal standards for education programs and certification in these fields. The Consumer-Patient Radiation Health and Safety Act of 1981 established Federal standards for education programs and certification in medical imaging and radiation therapy. Currently, 13 states do not require licensure for individuals performing these procedures, while others have varying levels of licensure for radiographers, radiation therapists, nuclear medicine technologists, and medical physicists. No states currently regulate or license medical dosimetrists. The purposes of the Act are to ensure accreditation of education programs and licensure or certification for individuals involved in patient dose for medical imaging and radiation therapy, as well as to guarantee the safety and accuracy of these procedures. 8 states license medical physicists, while no states regulate or license medical dosimetrists. SEC. 3. QUALITY OF MEDICAL IMAGING AND RADIATION THERAPY. This section amends the Public Health Service Act to address the quality of medical imaging and radiation therapy. The Secretary will establish standards for the safety and accuracy of medical imaging and radiation therapy, including licensure, certification, and accreditation requirements. Exemptions are provided for physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. Individuals must pass a national examination approved by the Secretary and meet other specified requirements before performing or planning medical imaging or therapy. The Secretary will certify private bodies for this purpose. The Secretary will certify private nonprofit organizations or State agencies as approved bodies for accrediting educational programs or administering examinations in medical imaging or radiation therapy. Minimum standards will be established for certification, recordkeeping, curriculum approval, instructor approval, fee charging, and other requirements as deemed necessary by the Secretary. The Secretary will certify private nonprofit organizations or State agencies as approved bodies for accrediting educational programs or administering examinations in medical imaging or radiation therapy. Approved bodies must comply with standards for recordkeeping, curriculum approval, instructor approval, fee charging, and other requirements as required by the Secretary. Withdrawal of approval may occur if the body fails to meet the established standards. The Secretary may withdraw certification of an approved body if it fails to meet standards. Accreditation or completion of exams by the body remains valid for a reasonable period. Existing State standards for licensure, certification, and accreditation prior to new standards are recognized. The Secretary will periodically evaluate approved bodies and include the results in a report to the Senate and House committees. Payment for services must be delivered within 18 months of the section's enactment. The Secretary will evaluate approved bodies and report to Senate and House committees. Payment for services must be delivered within 18 months of enactment. Alternative standards may apply in rural areas for medical imaging and radiation therapy. The Secretary will develop alternative standards for rural areas to ensure access to quality medical imaging and radiation therapy. Regulations must be implemented within 18 months of enactment, and definitions for approved bodies and medical imaging are provided. The curr_chunk explains the definition of medical imaging and radiation therapy, including the act of performing and planning these procedures. It also mentions the certification of organizations to administer examinations in this field. The curr_chunk defines terms related to medical imaging and radiation therapy, including exposure to radiation, positioning patients, planning procedures, and the use of radiation therapy for disease treatment in humans."
