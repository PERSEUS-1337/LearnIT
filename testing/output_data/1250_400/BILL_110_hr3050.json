The requesting state must reimburse for any losses or expenses incurred during the aid operation.\" The Compact states that any losses or expenses incurred during aid provision must be reimbursed by the requesting state.

The Compact states that workers compensation benefits must be provided to all employees and contract firefighters sent to a requesting state. The term \"employee\" includes volunteers or auxiliaries involved in forest fire fighting. Compact administrators may establish procedures for claims and reimbursement in accordance with state laws. The compact ensures that member states maintain adequate forest fire fighting forces and equipment without diminishing them. It also allows states to enact laws for fire prevention and control without limitations from the compact. Additionally, it does not impact existing cooperative relationships with the United States Forest Service. The compact allows representatives of the United States Forest Service to attend meetings of the compact administrators. Provisions related to reciprocal aid in combating forest fires are operative between states party to the compact and other states that have given assent to mutual aid provisions. The compact remains binding until a state's Legislature or Governor takes action to withdraw, with a six-month notice period."
