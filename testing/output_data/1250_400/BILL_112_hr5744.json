    "content": "The \"Catastrophic Wildfire Prevention Act of 2012\" aims to expedite wildfire prevention projects on Federal lands, reduce threats to endangered species from wildfires, and provide efficiency tools for project streamlining. The \"Catastrophic Wildfire Prevention Act of 2012\" defines terms like \"at-risk community\" and \"at-risk forest\" to identify areas with high wildfire risk on Federal lands. It also outlines the meaning of an \"authorized wildfire prevention project\" to address these risks. The \"Catastrophic Wildfire Prevention Act of 2012\" defines terms like \"authorized wildfire prevention project\" as measures developed for hazardous fuels reduction, forest health, and habitat protection on Federal lands. It includes projects for forest restoration, watershed restoration, and endangered species habitat. The \"Catastrophic Wildfire Prevention Act of 2012\" defines \"Federal land\" as National Forest System land or public lands, excluding areas where vegetation removal is prohibited by Federal law. The term \"Secretary concerned\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture for National Forest System land and the Secretary of the Interior for public lands. The term \"Secretary concerned\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture for National Forest System land and the Secretary of the Interior for public lands. \"Threatened and endangered species habitat\" on Federal land is identified based on natural fire regimes or wildfire threats to endangered or threatened species. SEC. 4. AUTHORIZED WILDFIRE PREVENTION PROJECTS. Authorized wildfire prevention projects will be implemented in at-risk forests and on threatened and endangered species habitat to reduce surface, ladder, and canopy fuels. Projects aim to protect endangered species and comply with species recovery plan guidelines. In authorized wildfire prevention projects, timber harvesting, thinning, and grazing may be used to reduce fuel loads and prevent wildfires. Grazing in these projects is exempt from utilization standards, and the projects aim to improve forest conditions and comply with species recovery plan guidelines. Authorized wildfire prevention projects may use timber harvesting, thinning, and grazing to reduce fuel loads and prevent wildfires, including catastrophic ones. The Secretary concerned is not required to revise land and resource management plans for conducting such projects. Public petitions for designating Federal land as at-risk forest or threatened species habitat must be reviewed and determined within 60 days. SEC. 5. PUBLIC REVIEW AND ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS. The Secretary must publish a notice of proposed wildfire prevention projects in the Federal Register, allowing the public to submit written comments within 30 days. Within 60 days of the initial notice, the final project will be designated after considering any received comments, with another 30-day period for comments on the final project from those who commented on the proposed project. The Secretary must comply with environmental laws for wildfire prevention projects, including the National Environmental Policy Act and Endangered Species Act. Special rules apply if projects involve timber harvesting or grazing, requiring an environmental assessment. Special rules apply to authorized wildfire prevention projects involving timber harvesting or grazing, requiring an environmental assessment to be completed within 30 days. Failure to meet the deadline deems the project compliant with the National Environmental Policy Act. Grazing projects are assessed for a minimum of 10 years, while timber harvest projects are assessed accordingly. Compliance with the deadline for environmental assessments on wildfire prevention projects involving timber harvesting or grazing deems the project compliant with various environmental acts. Grazing projects are assessed for a minimum of 10 years, while timber harvest projects are assessed for a minimum of 20 years. The Secretary is not required to study alternatives in the environmental assessment. SEC. 6. ADMINISTRATIVE AND JUDICIAL REVIEW.\n\nAdministrative review of authorized wildfire prevention projects follows the special process under the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003. Judicial review is conducted according to the Act as well.\n\nSEC. 7. THREATENED AND ENDANGERED SPECIES DESIGNATIONS.\n\nBefore listing a species under the Endangered Species Act, the Secretary must assess the impact on forest fuel loads and include wildfire risk analysis in recovery plans and habitat determinations."
