    "content": "The \"Easy Voting Act of 2011\" establishes a minimum early voting period for jurisdictions conducting early voting under the Help America Vote Act of 2002. This new section, SEC. 303A, outlines the requirements for states permitting early voting. SEC. 2. ESTABLISHING MINIMUM EARLY VOTING PERIOD FOR JURISDICTIONS CONDUCTING EARLY VOTING. This section requires states to ensure a 14-day early voting period (including weekends) before the election for Federal office starting January 1, 2012. SEC. 3. PROHIBITING STATES FROM REQUIRING STATE-ISSUED IDENTIFICATION FOR VOTING OR REGISTERING TO VOTE. This section prohibits states from mandating state-issued identification as a requirement for voting or registering to vote. SEC. 303B prohibits election officials from requiring individuals to provide State-issued identification for voting or registering to vote in Federal elections, effective January 1, 2012. This does not affect requirements for certain voters who register by mail. SEC. 303C requires states to offer same-day voter registration and change of address services on election day. SEC. 303C mandates states to allow same-day voter registration and address changes on election day, ensuring individuals can register and vote in federal elections at polling places. States must allow individuals to update their address at the polling place and cast a regular ballot instead of a provisional one for federal elections. This requirement does not apply to states without voter registration requirements for federal elections. The appropriate election official must transmit voter registration forms provided by individuals at the polling place. The Act mandates that states without voter registration requirements for federal elections must allow individuals to update their address at the polling place and cast a regular ballot. The appropriate election official must transmit voter registration forms provided by individuals at the polling place to the State election official. Compliance with these requirements is required starting January 1, 2012. The Act requires states to allow individuals to register to vote and update their address at early voting sites, similar to the requirements for Election Day registration."
