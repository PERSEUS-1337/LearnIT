Congress recognizes the need for federal assistance to protect these lands due to the lack of incentives from states and local governments. The Farms for the Future Act Amendments of 1995 aim to provide federal cost-sharing for the acquisition of farmland protection easements under section 1470C. The Farms for the Future Act Amendments of 1995 provide federal cost-sharing for acquiring farmland protection easements, which are defined as easements that restrict incompatible land uses and are binding on all future landowners in qualifying farmland deemed important for agricultural, economic, or environmental reasons by eligible States. The Farms for the Future Act Amendments of 1995 allow eligible States to acquire farmland protection easements through a matching grant program. These easements restrict land uses incompatible with agriculture and are binding on all future landowners. Matching grants are provided on a 50-50 basis to protect qualifying farmland or develop similar programs. The Farms for the Future Act Amendments of 1995 allow eligible States to acquire farmland protection easements through a matching grant program. Matching grants are provided on a 50-50 basis, with a maximum of 90 percent for states actively protecting farmland. States are limited to receiving 10 percent of the total grant amount per fiscal year, with pro rata distribution if fewer than 10 states participate. The Secretary must ensure conditions are met when providing assistance under this program.
