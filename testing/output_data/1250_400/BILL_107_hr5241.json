Approximately 4 million individuals in the United States have mental retardation or developmental disabilities and live with their families. Nearly 25% of the nation's elders have multiple chronic disabling conditions, requiring assistance with daily needs. Around 600,000 Americans die at home each year, often relying on extensive family caregiving. 42% of individuals needing daily living assistance in the US are under 65. There is a lack of resources to replace family caregivers with paid workers, which would cost approximately $200 billion annually. The family caregiver role is rewarding but can lead to emotional, physical, and financial hardships.

Family caregivers often struggle to find information about available respite care. Available respite care programs are insufficient and primarily cater to lower-income populations and the elderly. There is a limited number of respite care programs that have difficulty recruiting trained workers. The purpose of this title is to encourage the establishment of State and local lifespan respite care programs. The purpose of this title is to encourage States to establish State and local lifespan respite care programs, improve respite care information dissemination to family caregivers, provide respite care services, promote innovative approaches to respite care delivery and training, and support research on effective respite care services.

An 'eligible recipient' refers to a State agency or any other public entity capable of providing services. The term 'eligible recipient' includes State agencies, public entities, nonprofit organizations, political subdivisions with a population of at least 3,000,000 individuals, and recognized State respite coordinating agencies with specific capabilities.

The Secretary may award grants to eligible recipients for this purpose.
