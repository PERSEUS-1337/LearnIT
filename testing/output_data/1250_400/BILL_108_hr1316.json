    "content": "The Act titled \"Pulmonary Hypertension Research Act of 2003\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 contains findings related to the Act. The Congress finds that Federal investment in pulmonary hypertension research must be expanded to find a cure or effective treatment. Primary pulmonary hypertension is a rare lung disorder with a poor survival rate, affecting men and women of all ages and ethnicities. About 300 new cases are diagnosed in the US each year, with the highest number in women aged 21-40. Primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) can affect men and women of all ages and ethnicities, not just young women. It is a rare disease with a low prevalence, making it difficult to study. In advanced stages, patients may be bedridden and have symptoms even at rest. PPH is often not detected in routine medical exams and can be confused with other heart and lung conditions. In 1981, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute established the first PPH-patient registry, which provided valuable insights into the disease. Research on PPH is focusing on immunologic and genetic factors, pulmonary blood vessel narrowing, smooth muscle growth, and scar tissue formation. Anorexic drugs, taken by millions of Americans in 1996-1997, can contribute to PPH. During 1996-1997, millions of Americans took anorexic drugs, potentially leading to PPH. SPH has known causes like emphysema and bronchitis, as well as other diseases and heart defects. More cases of PPH from diet drugs are expected to be diagnosed in the future. Inflammatory or collagen vascular diseases like scleroderma, CREST syndrome, or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), congenital heart diseases causing extra blood shunting through the lungs, chronic pulmonary thromboembolism, HIV infection, liver disease, and certain diet drugs can cause pulmonary hypertension. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute is expanding its research activities on pulmonary hypertension. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute is expanding research activities on pulmonary hypertension by coordinating with other institutes and agencies to develop centers of excellence for research, training, and education on the condition. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute is developing centers for research on pulmonary hypertension in collaboration with public or nonprofit private entities. These centers will conduct research, training programs, and provide information to health professionals and the public. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute is establishing research centers for pulmonary hypertension in partnership with public or nonprofit private organizations. These centers will offer research, training programs, and disseminate information to health professionals and the public. The Director will coordinate information among the centers, ensure regular communication, and may require reports on their activities. Each center will operate from a single institution or a consortium of cooperating institutions. The Director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute will establish research centers for pulmonary hypertension, with each center operating from a single institution or consortium. The Director will provide support for at least three centers for up to 5 years, with possible extensions after review by a peer group. Additionally, a data system will be established for collection, storage, and analysis of information. The Director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute will establish research centers for pulmonary hypertension, with support for at least three centers for up to 5 years, extendable upon recommendation. A data system and information clearinghouse will be set up to collect and disseminate data on pulmonary hypertension. Public input will be facilitated to provide information on existing and planned programs of the National Institutes of Health. The Director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute will establish research centers for pulmonary hypertension, with support for at least three centers for up to 5 years. Public input will be facilitated to provide information on existing and planned programs of the National Institutes of Health, including primary hypertension. Biennial reports on activities conducted and supported under this section will be prepared. Authorization of appropriations up to $25,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2004 to 2008 is granted for these purposes."
