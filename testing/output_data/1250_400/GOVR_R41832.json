    "content": "Pakistan is crucial to U.S. interests due to its role in combating religious militancy and addressing various policy concerns such as terrorism, nuclear proliferation, Kashmir tensions, and economic development. Despite some cooperation in counterterrorism efforts, doubts about Pakistan's commitment to U.S. interests have deepened, especially regarding its tolerance of extremist groups operating within its borders. The country's economic challenges and political instability further complicate its security situation. Pakistan's commitment to core U.S. interests deepened in 2011, impacting the relationship in 2012. The country has a mixed record in battling Islamist extremism, with ongoing tolerance of Afghan insurgents and anti-India militants. Economic troubles, political instability, and security challenges pose serious obstacles for U.S. decision makers. The spread of Islamist radicalism has led to significant civilian and security force casualties, as well as financial losses. Pakistan experienced a high number of terrorist attacks in 2011, with officials highlighting the country's sacrifices. In 2011, Pakistan faced over 26 terrorist attacks per week, with significant financial losses. The relationship with the U.S. became tense after Osama bin Laden was found in Pakistan, leading to accusations of support for Afghan insurgents. NATO airstrikes on Pakistani army outposts further strained relations. In late November 2011, NATO troops in Afghanistan were attacked by Pakistani army outposts near the border at Salala, resulting in 24 Pakistani soldiers dead. Poor coordination and miscommunication were blamed for the incident. Pakistan demanded a full apology from the U.S. and moved to scrap and renegotiate all existing bilateral agreements related to supply lines into Afghanistan. Islamabad also closed the Pakistani ground lines of communication as a sign of anger. The closure of Pakistani ground lines of communication (GLOCs) has been a major point of contention between Islamabad and Washington, with Pakistan demanding a full apology from the U.S. for cooperation to resume. Despite ongoing negotiations, the GLOCs remain closed, leading to tensions and disagreements over potential fee hikes for NATO supplies. Additionally, a Pakistani doctor involved in a CIA operation received a lengthy prison sentence for treason, further straining relations between the two countries. The Pakistani doctor involved in a CIA operation received a 33-year prison sentence for treason, leading to anger and perplexity among Americans. The Senate Appropriations Committee responded by docking $1 million from U.S. aid funding for each year of the sentence unless the doctor is freed. Bilateral relations between the U.S. and Pakistan have remained strained, with anti-American sentiments prevalent among ordinary Pakistanis. The strained relations between the U.S. and Pakistan are evident as anti-American sentiments prevail among ordinary Pakistanis. The State Department warns of high travel risks in Pakistan, with American civilians facing abductions, including the case of Daniel Pearl. Islamist extremism in Pakistan poses a significant concern for U.S. foreign policy goals, hindering progress in combating terrorist groups and resolving the Pakistan-India rivalry. The strained relations between the U.S. and Pakistan are evident as anti-American sentiments prevail among ordinary Pakistanis. American citizens have been recruited and employed in Islamist terrorism by Pakistan-based elements, with key U.S. goals hindered by Pakistan's growing influence. Some American intelligence officials suspect that Al Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahiri may be receiving protection from elements of the Pakistani government. Increasing numbers in Congress question the effectiveness of current U.S. policy towards Pakistan, with calls for the curtailment of U.S. foreign assistance. Legislation placing new conditionality on aid and military reimbursements is moving through Congress. Some in Congress question the effectiveness of current U.S. policy towards Pakistan and call for the curtailment of U.S. foreign assistance. Legislation with new conditions on aid and military reimbursements is being considered. Pakistan's closure of GLOCs to Afghanistan has not had the expected impact, leading to potential diplomatic isolation. Pakistan's closure of GLOCs to Afghanistan has not had the expected impact, leading to potential diplomatic isolation. Islamabad risks losing foreign assistance and influence in post-war Afghanistan. President Obama urges Pakistan to increase participation in securing the region and neutralize terrorist safe havens. Secretary of Defense Panetta acknowledges Pakistan's ties to terrorist groups but emphasizes the necessity of maintaining a relationship with the country. The United States insists on Pakistan's commitment to neutralize terrorist safe havens in its territory despite acknowledging complicating factors in their ties to terrorist groups. Continued engagement with Pakistan is seen as the only realistic option, with some advocating for a more confrontational approach. The US has increased nonmilitary aid to improve the lives of Pakistanis and conditions military aid on their progress in combating militancy and fostering democratic institutions. However, $800 million in security assistance was suspended in 2011, indicating a more rigorous evaluation of Pakistan's cooperation. In July 2011, the US suspended up to $800 million in security assistance to Pakistan, indicating a more rigorous evaluation of Pakistan's cooperation in combating militancy. Additionally, $1 billion in approved coalition support fund reimbursements remains undisbursed due to bilateral disagreements. Analysts believe that Pakistan's foreign policy behavior is influenced by the military's strategic interests, leading to continued tolerance of safe havens for militant groups despite US aid levels or threats. Pakistan's foreign policy behavior is influenced by the military's strategic interests, leading to continued tolerance of safe havens for militant groups regardless of U.S. aid levels or threats. Analysts suggest strong U.S. support for Pakistan's civilian authorities to reduce conflict within Pakistan and with its neighbors. However, Pakistan's civilian leaders have shown reluctance to address security policies and extremism, often blaming the United States. Pakistan's civilian leaders are unwilling to address security policies and extremism, often blaming the United States. There is widespread support for Islamist militancy in the region, with official Pakistani participation in supporting groups like the Taliban. President Obama's decision to visit India without stopping in Pakistan has raised concerns among Pakistani officials about a perceived \"pro-India\" tilt in Washington's policies. The Administration's India policies are viewed suspiciously and even as threatening by Pakistani leaders and citizens due to perceived pro-India tilt in Washington. Pakistan fears strategic encirclement by external forces seeking to weaken the country, leading to a shift towards more narrow, issue-based engagement in bilateral relations. The tumultuous events of 2011, including the Salala incident, may signal the end of the \"post-9/11 period\" in US-Pakistan relations. Analysts predict a shift towards a more transactional, issue-based engagement, with new restrictions on US foreign assistance to Pakistan. Pakistan's military spokesman emphasizes a formal, business-like relationship moving forward. This approach is seen as a realistic alternative to potential noncooperation. The legislation suggests new restrictions on U.S. foreign assistance to Pakistan, aiming for a more transactional relationship. Ambassador Sherry Rehman outlines prerequisites for resetting the bilateral relationship, including apologizing for the Salala incident, releasing suspended CSF reimbursements, increasing counterterrorism intelligence sharing, halting drone strikes, and focusing on trade over aid. Former U.S. diplomats advise a more normal, constructive relationship with reduced mutual expectations and better-targeted economic aid. The outlook for a \"strategic bond\" between the US and Pakistan is poor, leading to suggestions for a more normal and constructive relationship. Recommendations include reducing mutual expectations, better targeting economic aid, fostering business ties, and supporting initiatives for regional stability. Optimism is found in the improved domestic status of the Pakistani military and relations with India. The Obama Administration is urged to consider these factors and avoid a purely security-oriented approach that could fuel anti-American sentiment. The Pakistani military's improved domestic status and better relations with India are seen as positive trends. Some U.S. analysts criticize Pakistan's stance on GLOCs and the Salala incident, urging the U.S. government to pressure Islamabad on counterterrorism. There are calls for a new U.S. policy towards Pakistan, with concerns about short-term thinking prevailing over long-term strategy. Some analysts advocate for a more adversarial approach towards Pakistan, suggesting targeted sanctions and cutting military aid. Others go as far as considering Pakistan an enemy in terms of Afghanistan policy. The key argument is to use credible threats to end assistance and retaliate if Pakistan does not comply with U.S. demands. Some analysts argue for a more adversarial approach towards Pakistan, advocating for credible threats to end assistance and retaliate if Pakistan does not comply with U.S. demands. Others believe that a shift to a hostile stance would be counterproductive and could jeopardize the U.S.-led project in Afghanistan. A Washington-based Pakistani analyst opposes the idea of exploiting internal Pakistani divisions, suggesting a more passive approach focused on providing security assurances and strengthening civilian governance institutions in Pakistan. Some analysts advocate for a hostile approach towards Pakistan, while others suggest a more passive strategy of providing security assurances and bolstering civilian governance institutions. The Pakistani military's willingness to engage in economic rapprochement with India raises questions about its strategic perspective. Pakistan's geostrategic status could suffer from international isolation if it continues to focus on conflict with India and \"strategic depth\" in Afghanistan. Embracing energy and trade cooperation with neighbors could help Pakistan move beyond its perpetual insecurity. The assassination of Punjab province governor Salman Taseer in 2011 highlighted the challenges faced by Pakistan in pursuing a more cooperative approach with its neighbors. Taseer, a liberal politician, was killed for criticizing blasphemy laws, revealing deep divisions within Pakistani society. The assassination of Governor Salman Taseer in 2011, a liberal politician critical of blasphemy laws, was a major blow to liberal forces in Pakistan. His killer, Malik Mumtaz Qadri, was hailed as a hero by some in Pakistani society. Minister Shabaz Bhatti, the only Christian member of the federal cabinet, was also assassinated for advocating tolerance towards religious minorities and reform of blasphemy laws. The killings were condemned by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and President Zardari, who addressed the assassinations in an op-ed. The assassination of Minister Shabaz Bhatti in 2011 was seen as an attack on values of tolerance and respect in Pakistan. President Zardari addressed the assassinations of Bhatti and Governor Salman Taseer, highlighting a growing threat of Islamist radicalism in the country. The incident involving Raymond Davis, an American diplomat accused of murder in Pakistan, further strained diplomatic relations between the two countries. Raymond Davis claimed self-defense during a robbery attempt, but Pakistani authorities accused him of murder. Despite U.S. officials asserting diplomatic immunity, Davis was revealed to be a CIA contractor tracking militants in Pakistan. The controversy strained U.S.-Pakistan relations, with Congress hinting at reduced aid. Senator Kerry visited Islamabad to ease tensions, expressing regret over the incident. CIA negotiated with ISI for Davis's release, which occurred after political pressure and a $2.3 million pledge. In late February, the CIA negotiated with the ISI for Raymond Davis's release, who was accused of murder in Pakistan. After weeks of closed-door negotiations and a $2.3 million pledge, Davis was freed. The incident strained U.S.-Pakistan relations, leading to calls to curtail U.S. assistance to Pakistan. The location of Osama bin Laden's death near a military academy in Pakistan raised doubts about the country's commitment to fighting extremism. Questions arose about Pakistan's role in sheltering bin Laden, leading to concerns about complicity or incompetence within the country's military and intelligence services. This event damaged Pakistan's credibility after years of denying refuge to wanted extremists. Pakistan's military and intelligence services faced criticism for failing to detect a foreign military raid that killed a top Al Qaeda leader on Pakistani soil. The incident led to domestic backlash, with the Army Chief warning against future incursions and Parliament condemning the U.S. raid. This event fueled anti-American sentiments, strained bilateral relations, and raised doubts about Pakistan's commitment to fighting extremism. The Abbottabad raid in Pakistan led to public demonstrations against the US and fueled bilateral distrust. Congress questioned the wisdom of continued engagement with Pakistan, while some senior members called for more oversight. Despite reasons for distrust, the US maintained a positive posture towards Pakistan post-raid. In the weeks following the Abbottabad raid, the US maintained a positive posture towards Pakistan despite serious questions about bin Laden's refuge. Senior Administration officials were divided over the future of the relationship, with some advocating strong reprisals for perceived Pakistani intransigence. On May 22, 2011, militants stormed Pakistan's naval base near Karachi, resulting in casualties and destruction of US-supplied equipment. Militants stormed Pakistan's naval base near Karachi, resulting in casualties and destruction of US-supplied equipment. The attack, claimed by the Pakistani Taliban as revenge for bin Laden's killing, raised concerns about the security of Pakistan's nuclear weapons. Suspicions of inside help were fueled by the attackers' ability to evade detection. The attack on Pakistan's naval base near Karachi raised concerns about the safety of the country's nuclear weapons. Suspicions of inside help were confirmed when a former navy commando was arrested. Three navy officers, including the base commander, are facing court-martial for negligence. The ISI is accused of ordering the torture and murder of journalist Syed Saleem Shahzad, who had written about Al Qaeda cells in the navy. A government inquiry into Shahzad's death began in June. The Pakistan Navy was investigating Al Qaeda cells within its ranks. Journalist Syed Saleem Shahzad, known for criticizing the Pakistani establishment, received threats from the ISI. An inquiry into his death revealed classified intelligence implicating senior ISI officials in his murder. Admiral Mike Mullen stated that Shahzad's killing was sanctioned by the Pakistani government. A Commission of Inquiry in 2012 failed to identify the culprits but recommended increased accountability for intelligence agencies. In July 2011, the Obama Administration suspended $440-$500 million worth of scheduled counterinsurgency training and equipment for Pakistan due to reduced U.S. military presence and delays in visa processing. This move was seen as a warning to Islamabad about potential aid cuts if improvements were not made. The Obama Administration suspended $300 million in planned FY2011 Coalition Support Fund reimbursements to Pakistan due to delays in visa processing, seen as a warning for improved cooperation. Pakistani military downplayed the impact, suggesting reprogramming U.S. security assistance towards development projects. Observers feared the decision would lead to resentment and validation of U.S. unreliability among Pakistani leaders and citizens. In October 2011, a Pakistani-American businessman referenced a memorandum allegedly \"dictated\" by the Pakistani Ambassador after bin Laden's death. In October 2011, a high-profile op-ed piece by Pakistani-American businessman Mansoor Ijaz mentioned a memo allegedly dictated to him by the Pakistani Ambassador after bin Laden's death. The memo requested U.S. assistance to prevent a military coup and install new leaders friendly to the U.S. The resulting \"Memogate\" scandal led to the investigation and resignation of the Ambassador, causing pressure on President Asif Zardari. Both deny involvement in the memo. The investigation into the \"Memogate\" scandal revealed no evidence of wrongdoing by civilians, leading to Amb. Haqqani being allowed to leave Pakistan. Concerns arose about a potential military overthrow of President Zardari, with senior army and intelligence officers claiming the memo was genuine. Prime Minister Gilani warned against conspiracies to remove the elected government, while the army publicly pledged support for democracy. Gen. Kayani emphasized the military's accountability to parliament. Prime Minister Gilani issued a warning about potential conspiracies to overthrow the elected government, emphasizing the military's accountability to parliament. Despite rumors of a military coup, the army publicly pledged support for democracy. The civilian government expressed frustration over the army and intelligence chiefs bypassing them in engaging the court, leading to tensions between the two sides. However, the likelihood of a military coup in Pakistan is considered low due to public aversion to direct military rule, lack of support from opposition politicians, an assertive judiciary, and a vocal media. Parliament reaffirmed its supremacy through a resolution by the end of January. In late November 2011, U.S. ground forces near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border faced heavy fire from hilltop positions inside Pakistan. The Pentagon stated that the U.S. commanders were unaware of nearby Pakistan army outposts, leading to a mistaken attack on Afghan insurgents. NATO air assets were called in, but the incoming fire continued, prompting the use of AC-130 gunship, F-15 jets, and Apache helicopters to neutralize the hilltop positions. Pakistani liaison officers were in communication during the incident. In late November 2011, U.S. forces near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border mistakenly attacked two small Pakistan army outposts, believing they were Afghan insurgents. Despite Pakistani officers informing their American counterparts of the situation, 24 Pakistani soldiers were killed before the air assault ended. This led to a grave breach of Pakistan's sovereignty, causing anger and resulting in the closure of NATO's ground logistics routes through Pakistan. The mistaken attack on Pakistani army outposts near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border led to the closure of NATO's ground logistics routes through Pakistan. Despite U.S. expressions of regret, Pakistan demands a formal apology and refuses to participate in the Pentagon's investigation. The investigation concluded that U.S. forces acted in self-defense with no intentional targeting of Pakistanis, citing miscommunication and poor coordination as central factors. The investigation into the mistaken attack on Pakistani army outposts near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border concluded that U.S. forces acted in self-defense with no intentional targeting of Pakistanis. Pakistan's military criticized NATO for blaming Pakistan and highlighted miscommunication as a central issue. The Obama Administration considered issuing an apology for the incident. The Obama Administration considered issuing an apology for the mistaken attack on Pakistani army outposts near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, but the plan was aborted after other incidents caused tensions to escalate further. Relations between the United States and Pakistan were strained, with debates within the Administration about the potential implications of an apology on counterinsurgency efforts. In Afghanistan, personnel accidentally burned Korans, leading to insurgent attacks blamed on the Haqqani Network. US-Pakistan relations worsened in 2012 due to a hearing on Baluchistan, with a resolution calling for self-determination. This angered the Islamabad government and sparked criticism from the Pakistani media. The Obama Administration distanced itself from the resolution. The hearing on Baluchistan in 2012, with a resolution calling for self-determination, angered the Islamabad government and sparked criticism from the Pakistani media. The Obama Administration distanced itself from the resolution, leading to a freeze in US-Pakistan relations pending a review by the Pakistani Parliament. The review process was seen as a sign of assertiveness by the civilian government, but some viewed it as a reflection of army policy making. The \"Guidelines for Revised Terms of Engagement with the United States\" were unanimously approved on April 13, 2012. The Pakistani civilian government showed unusual assertiveness in foreign policy by issuing 14-point guidelines for revised terms of engagement with the United States in 2012. Key demands included immediate cessation of drone attacks, stopping infiltration into Pakistani territory, and seeking an unconditional apology for a NATO/ISAF attack. The government also emphasized the need for justice in the Salala incident and prohibited verbal agreements on national security. The Pakistani government demanded an unconditional apology from the United States for violating its sovereignty and territorial integrity, called for justice in the Salala incident, and prohibited verbal agreements on national security. They also requested an end to drone strikes, banned private security contractors and intelligence operatives, and rejected the establishment of foreign bases on Pakistani territory. The Obama Administration expressed respect for Pakistani democracy and sovereignty, despite ongoing drone strikes. The Obama Administration has expressed respect for Pakistani democracy and sovereignty despite ongoing drone strikes. U.S. Special Representative Marc Grossman visited Islamabad for high-level talks, but no breakthrough was achieved. Pakistan's demand for a halt to drone strikes remains a major point of contention. The CIA's reluctance to give up the ability to target \"high-value targets\" and conduct \"signature strikes\" based on surveillance patterns raises concerns about civilian casualties. Analysts believe the CIA will be unwilling to relinquish the ability to strike \"high-value targets\" and conduct \"signature strikes\" based on surveillance patterns, raising concerns about civilian casualties. Pakistan's demands for an unconditional apology for the inadvertent deaths of Pakistani soldiers at Salala remain a major sticking point in negotiations with the U.S. government withholding military reimbursements and counterterrorism funding pending an agreement on bilateral reengagement. Pakistan's Foreign Ministry insists on abiding by Parliament's recommendations. The NATO summit in Chicago focused on future engagement in Afghanistan, with Pakistan boycotting a previous conference. President Zardari attended after a personal call from the NATO Secretary-General, but President Obama refused to meet him, worsening U.S.-Pakistan tensions. At the NATO summit in Chicago, President Obama snubbed President Zardari, worsening U.S.-Pakistan tensions. Zardari's participation was seen as embarrassing by some in Pakistan, but Foreign Minister Khar remained optimistic. Meanwhile, Shakil Afridi was convicted of treason in Pakistan. On May 23, 2012, a tribal court in northwestern Pakistan convicted Shakil Afridi of treason and sentenced him to 33 years in prison for his involvement with the CIA in collecting DNA samples from Osama bin Laden's compound. The sentence sparked outrage in the United States, with officials calling it \"shocking and outrageous\" and stating that Afridi should be praised, not punished. This development strained efforts to maintain a strategic relationship between the US and Pakistan. The Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee criticized the conviction of Shakil Afridi, stating that he should be rewarded, not punished. Islamabad defends the process as legal, but even some Pakistanis question the conviction due to lack of legal representation and unclear appeal rights. The Administration's assessment of Afghanistan and Pakistan policy in March 2011 showed little progress in key U.S. objectives, except for combating Al Qaeda. The U.S. assessment in the latter half of 2010 showed limited progress in key objectives in Pakistan, with notable improvements in combating Al Qaeda. However, there were concerns about the lack of effective execution of counterinsurgency efforts in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. Despite this, Secretary Clinton certified Pakistan's sustained commitment and significant efforts, allowing the release of security-related aid in FY2011. Pakistan's progress in combating terrorist groups was certified by Secretary Clinton in March 2011, allowing the release of security-related aid. Despite skepticism due to concerns about Pakistan's actions against terrorist networks, the certification was based on political considerations rather than ground realities. The certification of Pakistan's progress in combating terrorist groups in March 2011 was met with skepticism and seen as politically driven. The Administration's assessment in September 2011 showed little positive news, with indicators for civilian control and COIN capabilities remaining static or declining. This was attributed to decreased bilateral security cooperation. Indicators and metrics for Pakistan's COIN capabilities remained static, then declined, with negative trends due to decreased bilateral security cooperation. International community involvement efforts were also static, with limited progress in funding. The Pentagon's report noted positive trends in Afghanistan but highlighted the Taliban insurgency operating from sanctuaries in Pakistan as the most critical threat. Kabul's security situation was described as volatile. The Pentagon's report on the security situation in Afghanistan highlighted the Taliban insurgency operating from sanctuaries in Pakistan as the most critical threat. Pakistan's counterinsurgency operations and provision of safe havens were seen as undermining security in Afghanistan. U.S.-Pakistan relations were negatively affected by these issues. Pakistan's desire for an Afghan government with primacy for Pashtuns and limited Indian influence leads to allowing insurgent sanctuaries on its soil. U.S.-Pakistan relations have been strained by issues such as freedom of travel for U.S. diplomats and U.S. citizens working for the ISI to influence U.S. Kashmir policy. President Obama has not visited Pakistan since taking office, and formal sessions of the bilateral Strategic Dialogue have not occurred since October 2010. President Obama has not visited Pakistan since taking office, and formal sessions of the bilateral Strategic Dialogue have not occurred since October 2010. However, high-level interactions, especially among military and intelligence officials, have continued to be frequent. In October 2011, Secretary Clinton led a delegation to Islamabad to address the issue of militant safe havens in western Pakistan. The U.S.-Pakistan Strategic Dialogue at the ministerial level appears to have been postponed indefinitely. The U.S. will take action against militant safe havens in western Pakistan if necessary. The U.S.-Pakistan Strategic Dialogue at the ministerial level has been postponed indefinitely. Engagement has continued at other levels, with discussions on counterterrorism and Afghanistan. Amb. Grossman emphasized the desire for a constructive relationship with Pakistan. President Obama has not visited Pakistan since taking office. In March, Amb. Grossman met with President Zardari in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, emphasizing the desire for a constructive relationship with Pakistan. President Obama also met with Prime Minister Gilani in Seoul, South Korea, expressing the U.S. desire for cooperation on counterterrorism and Afghanistan. Senior U.S. and Pakistani military commanders held talks in Rawalpindi to discuss border coordination issues. Deputy Secretary of State Thomas Nides met with Foreign Minister Khar in Islamabad to build upon previous conversations. In April, military commanders including Gen. James Mattis and Gen. John Allen held talks with Gen. Kayani in Rawalpindi to discuss border coordination issues. Deputy Secretary of State Thomas Nides met with Foreign Minister Khar in Islamabad to build upon previous conversations. USAID Administrator Rajiv Shah visited Pakistan to express a strong U.S. commitment to improving ties through civilian assistance. Amb. Grossman and Foreign Secretary Jalil Abbas Jilani made no breakthroughs on major points of disagreement during the 6th Trilateral Core Group meeting. The United States, Pakistan, and Afghanistan held a group meeting with no breakthroughs on key disagreements. The U.S. focused on reopening GLOCs while Pakistan opposed further drone strikes. The Tripartite Commission met for the 35th time in Rawalpindi. Drone strikes in Pakistan by American UAVs have been controversial but effective against militants. President Obama personally approves the targeting \"kill list.\" Reaper UAVs, overseen by the CIA, are used in drone strikes against militants in western Pakistan. President Obama approves the \"kill list\" for these strikes. The strikes have been effective against Al Qaeda but criticized for civilian casualties and violating Pakistani sovereignty. The Pakistani government condemns the strikes as illegal and counterproductive, fueling anti-American sentiment. Despite protests, it is believed that Pakistan tacitly allows the strikes. The Pakistani government strongly condemns drone strikes as a violation of territorial integrity and international law, fueling anti-American sentiment. Despite official rejection, there is informed domestic debate with some analysts supporting the tactic as effective against Al Qaeda. Messaging to Pakistan is part of the program's intent, with strikes following key events like the release of Raymond Davis and suspension of U.S. military aid to Islamabad. The CIA's drone strikes in Pakistan have been closely tied to key events like Raymond Davis's release and the suspension of U.S. military aid to Islamabad. There are differing opinions within the Administration on the wisdom of continuing these strikes, with some urging for a reduction in pace. Despite the tactical effectiveness of UAV attacks, concerns remain about worsening relations with Pakistan and destabilizing the country. A mid-2011 White House review reaffirmed support for the program but introduced changes such as greater State Department involvement in strike decisions and providing advanced notice to Pakistani officials. The mid-2011 White House review reaffirmed support for the CIA drone program in Pakistan, with changes including greater State Department involvement in strike decisions and advanced notice to Pakistani officials. President Obama defended the program, claiming minimal civilian casualties, but independent analysts dispute this, estimating hundreds of civilian deaths. Despite targeting militants, violence in western Pakistan has not subsided. Despite disputed claims of minimal civilian casualties, independent analysts estimate that 145-535 civilians, including children, have been killed in CIA drone strikes in Pakistan. Violence in western Pakistan has not subsided despite the killing of militants and commanders. The U.S. government may have no better option than to continue using this tactic due to the upcoming drawdown of NATO troops in Afghanistan. Close U.S. links with Pakistan's ISI date back to the 1980s, but mutual mistrust and concerns about the ISI's activities have persisted. In 2008, doubts about ISI's activities and aims compounded, with concerns about its use of militant proxies and involvement in extralegal abductions. The agency is under direct army control, with Lt. Gen. Zaheer-ul-Islam appointed as DG-ISI in 2012. U.S. officials accuse ISI of supporting Afghan insurgents, sustaining their insurgency through sanctuaries in Pakistan. Islam is seen as a potential candidate for the COAS position after Kayani's retirement. The ISI has been accused by U.S. officials of actively supporting Afghan insurgents with money, supplies, and planning guidance. Reports suggest that the ISI increased direct contacts with the Taliban in 2011, encouraging more violence and supplying them with explosives. A leaked NATO report indicates that Afghan insurgents still receive support from the ISI, with senior Taliban leaders regularly meeting with ISI personnel for strategic advice. The leaked NATO report from January 2012 suggests that Afghan insurgents are still receiving direct support from the ISI, with senior Taliban leaders meeting regularly with ISI personnel for strategic advice. The ISI is also linked to anti-India terrorist groups, including the Lashkar-e-Taiba responsible for the 2008 Mumbai attack. Pakistani officials deny any cooperation with militants, but Secretary of State Clinton has expressed concerns about the connections between terrorist groups and the Pakistani government. Pakistani government officials are ambivalent about cracking down on terrorism, with concerns about relationships between terrorist groups and the military and intelligence services. Despite assurances that ISI is not cooperating with militants, independent observers believe that Pakistan's security services may be infiltrated by Islamist extremists. Reports suggest that some Pakistani military officers receive anti-U.S. biased training. Analysts argue that Pakistan's security services can be divided into nationalist and Islamist factions. CIA-ISI relations were strained even before the Raymond Davis incident, with American officials frustrated by the lack of Pakistani military operations. The CIA-ISI relations were strained before the Raymond Davis incident, with American officials frustrated by the lack of Pakistani military operations. The Davis affair heightened Pakistani scrutiny and hostility towards U.S. security officials in Pakistan. Following Osama bin Laden's death, Pakistan cracked down on its citizens working with the CIA and allowed American investigators access to bin Laden's widows in Pakistani custody. Following Osama bin Laden's death, Pakistan sought to crack down on its citizens working with the CIA and allowed American investigators access to bin Laden's widows in Pakistani custody. The ISI leadership was confronted with evidence of collusion between Pakistani officials and Afghan insurgents, including instances where the CIA alerted Islamabad about bomb-making facilities in FATA that were found abandoned by Pakistani army units. Additionally, a Pakistani newspaper published the name of the CIA's Islamabad station chief, believed to be deliberate disclosures by the ISI to demonstrate its leverage and express anger at U.S. policies. The CIA alerted Islamabad about bomb-making facilities in Pakistan's FATA, but they were found abandoned by Pakistani army units, leading to accusations of collusion. Despite interagency discord, joint intelligence work continued, resulting in the arrest of a senior Al Qaeda operative in Karachi with U.S.-provided intelligence. In June 2011, a key Al Qaeda courier was arrested in Karachi with U.S.-provided intelligence, seen as a Pakistani effort to mend relations. Successes in targeting militants with drones in FATA likely come with intelligence from Pakistan. In September, Pakistan announced the arrest of three senior Al Qaeda operatives near Quetta with CIA assistance. In August, a key Al Qaeda operative was killed in North Waziristan. Pakistan announced the arrest of three senior Al Qaeda operatives near Quetta in September with CIA assistance. Bilateral intelligence cooperation targeting Al Qaeda and the \"Pakistani Taliban\" has continued despite worsening government-to-government relations. The CIA has reportedly established a network of \"secret friends\" in Pakistan to counter less trustworthy army and ISI officials. Pakistani leaders have historically sought strategic depth with friendly relations in neighboring Afghanistan. Pakistani leaders have historically sought strategic depth with friendly relations in neighboring Afghanistan, supporting Afghan mujahideen in the 1980s and the Taliban regime from 1996 to 2001. The porous Durand Line border divides Pashtun tribes, causing tension between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Both countries are key U.S. allies in combating Islamic militancy, but their acrimony hinders American interests. Pakistan aims for a post-NATO Afghanistan that aligns with its interests, creating challenges for U.S. goals in the region. The relationship between the U.S. and Pakistan in Afghanistan is complex, with differing goals. Pakistan seeks a post-NATO Afghanistan aligned with its interests, potentially using proxies like the Quetta Shura and Haqqani Network. The U.S. aims for an independent Afghanistan, which could lead to increased cooperation with India. Washington relies on Islamabad for support in Afghan reconciliation talks, hoping to pressure Afghan insurgency leaders to negotiate. The Administration relies on Islamabad for support in Afghan reconciliation talks, seeking ISI pressure on insurgency leaders. Tensions arise from differing approaches, with Americans wanting to \"fight, talk, build\" and Pakistanis opting for \"cease-fire, talk, wait for Americans to leave.\" Some fear rewarding Pakistani intransigence by involving their security services in peace negotiations with insurgent forces they have supported. There are concerns that ISI has been working to reinstate the Taliban regime overthrown in 2001. Some argue that Washington risks rewarding Pakistani intransigence by involving their security services in peace negotiations with insurgent forces they have fostered. The ISI has been accused of trying to reinstate the Taliban regime overthrown in 2001. Pakistani cooperation is seen as necessary for reconciliation and stability in Afghanistan, despite ongoing tensions between Islamabad and Kabul. Afghan insurgents find safe havens in Pakistani cities, hindering pacification efforts in Afghanistan. Taliban's resurgence in the mid-2000s was linked to sanctuaries in FATA. Afghan officials continue to accuse Pakistan of aiding terrorism within Afghanistan. The Taliban's resurgence in the mid-2000s was facilitated by sanctuaries in FATA, leading to accusations of Pakistan aiding terrorism in Afghanistan. Afghan officials remain wary of Pakistani influence, with concerns over Islamabad's use of \"Pashtun jihadi proxies\" and military dominance ambitions. The U.S. drawdown from Afghanistan in 2011 signaled a potential shift in focus and commitment, causing unease in Islamabad about the region's future. President Obama's announcement of a U.S. military drawdown from Afghanistan in 2011 signaled a potential shift in focus and commitment, causing unease in Islamabad about the region's future. Pakistani leaders insist that Afghan stability is a vital interest and have made efforts to upgrade the Afghanistan-Pakistan Joint Commission to accelerate the peace process. Prime Minister Gilani's meetings in Kabul were seen as an attempt to wean Afghanistan away from its partnership with the U.S. and seek closer ties with Islamabad and China. Gilani criticized America's \"imperial designs\" and emphasized the need for Kabul and Islamabad to take ownership of the peace process. Prime Minister Gilani criticized America's \"imperial designs\" and emphasized the need for Kabul and Islamabad to take ownership of the peace process. The new Joint Commission met in June 2011, with Gilani and President Karzai expressing commitment to an \"Afghan-led and Afghan-owned\" process. Friction between Islamabad and Kabul arose due to increased \"reverse infiltration\" incidents, including a cross-border raid that resulted in the death of Pakistani soldiers. Afghanistan accused Pakistan of firing rockets into Afghan provinces, leading to tensions between the two countries. In Kunar province, Afghan officials accused Pakistan of firing rockets into Afghan provinces, killing at least 60 people. Relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan worsened after the assassination of Afghan High Peace Council chairman Burhanuddin Rabbani, with Afghan officials suspecting ISI involvement. Afghan president accused Pakistan of supporting terrorism as official policy. The Afghan president accused Pakistan of involvement in the assassination of Burhanuddin Rabbani, claiming the attacker was Pakistani and the plot was planned in Quetta. Afghan intelligence officials also stopped a plot to kill Karzai, linking the culprits to Al Qaeda and the Haqqanis in the FATA region. Pakistan supports peace talks with the Afghan Taliban but wants Kabul to set the terms, aiming to limit India's influence in post-conflict Afghanistan. Pakistani leaders captured Mullah Baradar, a key Taliban figure, in Karachi in 2010. In 2010, Pakistan captured Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, a key Taliban figure, in Karachi. This move was seen as an attempt to facilitate talks with Taliban commanders and potentially influence negotiations in post-conflict Afghanistan. Pakistan also made efforts to broker reconciliation between the Kabul government and the Haqqani Network, raising concerns about Islamabad's intentions to gain maximal influence in a future Kabul settlement. Later that year, NATO facilitated secret meetings between Afghan officials and Taliban representatives, including QST figures, in Kabul. In 2010, Pakistan captured Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar in Karachi, aiming to influence negotiations in post-conflict Afghanistan. NATO facilitated secret meetings between Afghan officials and Taliban representatives, including QST figures, in Kabul. In 2011, the U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan suggested that Pakistan was hesitant to allow Taliban leaders to travel to Kabul for reconciliation talks. Afghan President Karzai echoed these complaints, stating that insurgent leaders in Pakistan were not independent enough to negotiate on their own. By early 2012, Islamabad appeared to be allowing the U.S.-Taliban negotiating initiative to proceed. In early 2012, Afghan President Karzai asked Pakistani leaders to influence the Taliban for negotiations. Despite initial skepticism, Prime Minister Gilani later appealed to the Taliban for reconciliation. Concerns persist about Pakistan's ties to Afghan insurgent groups. The Obama Administration supports the peace efforts, amid doubts about the U.S. transition strategy in Afghanistan. Pakistan's security services are suspected of supporting Afghan insurgent groups to increase leverage in the reconciliation process. The Haqqani Network, led by Jalaluddin Haqqani and his son Sirajuddin, is considered the most dangerous insurgent group in Afghanistan. They maintain close ties with al-Qaeda and are seen as a strategic threat to Afghan stability and U.S. national security interests. Many experts believe military offensives are necessary to deal with the Haqqanis beyond 2012. Islamabad officials have been hesitant to launch military operations despite U.S. requests. The Haqqani Network, closely tied to al-Qaeda, is considered a major threat to Afghan stability and U.S. security. Military offensives are deemed necessary to address the group, but Pakistan has been reluctant to act due to their historical ties with the Haqqanis. Recent high-profile attacks by the Haqqanis in Afghanistan have strained relations with the U.S. and Afghan officials. Several high-profile attacks in Afghanistan, including assaults on Kabul's Intercontinental Hotel and a U.S. military base in Wardak province by Haqqani fighters, strained relations with U.S. and Afghan officials. The attack on the U.S. Embassy compound in Kabul on September 13, 2011, led to a significant shift in U.S.-Pakistan relations, with Admiral Mullen calling for Pakistani military action against Haqqani bases. The ability of militants to carry out a complex raid in Kabul raised concerns about Afghanistan's security. The attack on the U.S. Embassy in Kabul on September 13, 2011, led to increased pressure on Pakistan to take military action against Haqqani bases. Admiral Mullen accused the ISI of supporting the Haqqani network, leading to strained U.S.-Pakistan relations. This marked a significant shift in the post-2001 era, with Mullen directly implicating Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency in supporting attacks in Afghanistan. The Haqqani network, acting as an arm of Pakistan's ISI, was accused of orchestrating attacks in Afghanistan, leading to increased pressure on Pakistan. Secretary Panetta emphasized the need to pressure Pakistan to address the issue. Despite some ambiguity in intelligence, President Obama insisted on Pakistan addressing the problem. The Obama Administration did not fully align with Admiral Mullen's charges regarding Pakistan's alleged support for the Haqqani network. President Obama acknowledged unclear intelligence on the ISI-Haqqani relationship but urged Pakistan to address the issue. Secretary Clinton's attitude hardened after the Wardak truck bombing, with subsequent Haqqani attacks in Afghanistan. Pakistan denies responsibility and rejects allegations of supporting the Haqqanis, warning of strained relations with the US. President Zardari criticized verbal assaults against Pakistan as damaging bilateral ties. The Pakistani military denies supporting the Haqqanis and warns the US of strained relations. President Zardari criticizes verbal assaults against Pakistan. Pakistani officials have tried to facilitate talks between the Haqqanis and Kabul, but Al Qaeda links hinder progress. Pakistan is seen as influential with the Haqqanis and may be able to push them towards negotiations. Military officials claim they can bring the Haqqanis to the table to avoid a regional conflict. Unnamed Pakistani military officials claim they can deliver the Haqqanis to negotiations, potentially giving Islamabad a central role in the process. The Obama Administration considers designating the Haqqani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, but is also willing to negotiate with their leadership. Pressure for the FTO designation comes from senior Senators, complicating the decision. The potential decision on designating the Haqqani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) is complicated by the Administration's willingness to negotiate with their leadership. The Haqqani Network Terrorist Designation Act of 2011 was passed by the Senate, but has not progressed in the House committee. Congressional frustration with the delay in the formal review for FTO designation has increased in 2012. Ammonium nitrate is a widely used fertilizer that is also used in making improvised explosive devices by Islamist insurgents in Afghanistan. The review on the question of FTO designation has increased in 2012. Ammonium nitrate is widely used as a fertilizer and in making improvised explosive devices by Islamist insurgents in Afghanistan. The majority of IEDs in Afghanistan use AN, with illicit AN believed to come from Pakistan. Despite historic peaks in IED events in 2011, improved detection and clearing capabilities have led to a decline in the effective IED attack rate. Legislation in 2012 required a report on countering IED-related networks in Pakistan and Afghanistan. The US government is urging Pakistan to adjust national laws. The FY2012 legislation required a report on countering IED-related networks in Pakistan and Afghanistan. The US government is urging Pakistan to adjust national laws to restrict access to Ammonium Nitrate (AN) or enhance law enforcement efforts to prevent its movement into Afghanistan. Efforts include diplomatic, law enforcement, and science/technology initiatives, with Operation Global Shield combating illicit cross-border trafficking of AN precursors. Operation Global Shield is a multilateral law enforcement operation launched in 2010 to combat the trafficking of chemical explosives precursors, including Ammonium Nitrate (AN). Security agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement are involved in these efforts. Experts recommend adding urea fertilizer granules to AN to make processing for explosives more difficult. Other options include adding colored dyes or radio frequency identification tags to track AN shipments. Pakarab Fertilizers Ltd. in Multan, Pakistan, is the country's largest fertilizer complex, producing over 300,000 metric tons of AN annually since 2004. Pakarab Fertilizers Ltd. in Multan, Pakistan, is the country's largest fertilizer complex, producing over 300,000 metric tons of Ammonium Nitrate (AN) annually since 2004. Legislation in Islamabad aims to restrict AN and other precursors, but changes are unlikely in the near term. The United States relies on Pakistani authorities to combat corruption in AN shipments. NATO's supply routes to Afghanistan have been closed for six months due to Pakistan's reaction to the Salala incident. NATO has been reliant on Pakistan's ground and air lines of communication to supply forces in Afghanistan. These routes have been closed for six months due to Pakistan's anger over the Salala incident. Insurgents have targeted these supply lines, resulting in destroyed trucks and dead drivers. Truck drivers often have to pay bribes to officials to reach the Afghan border from Karachi. The closure of Pakistan's supply routes to NATO forces in Afghanistan led to destruction of trucks, deaths of drivers, and reliance on alternative routes like the Northern Distribution Network. Despite the preference for Pakistan's faster and cheaper logistics route, the U.S. military has expanded aerial and NDN routes, with the loss of Pakistani GLOCs proving to be less damaging than expected. The closure of Pakistan's supply routes to NATO forces in Afghanistan has led to reliance on more expensive aerial and NDN routes. Despite the challenges, the loss of Pakistani GLOCs has not been as damaging as expected, with the Pentagon expressing concerns about the backlog of equipment for Afghan security forces. NATO will need to remove thousands of shipping containers and vehicles from Afghanistan as they withdraw. The closure of Pakistani supply routes to NATO forces in Afghanistan has caused a backlog of equipment for Afghan security forces. NATO needs to remove thousands of shipping containers and vehicles as they withdraw. Pakistani GLOCs are expected to reopen soon after negotiations, with reports of a proposed fee per truck. Foreign Minister Khar indicated that reopening of Pakistani supply routes to NATO forces in Afghanistan was imminent. Reports suggested a proposed fee of $5,000 per truck, a significant increase from previous levels. This fee was deemed unacceptable by the Senate Armed Services Committee, with one member calling it \"extortion.\" Negotiations on the issue have not yet reached a resolution. Islamist extremism and militancy have been a significant issue in Pakistani society since 2007, with a peak in attacks and victims in 2009. Islamist extremism and militancy have plagued Pakistani society since 2007, with a peak in attacks and victims in 2009. Pakistan also faces a separatist insurgency in Baluchistan and politically motivated violence in Karachi. Despite a decline in terrorist incidents since 2009, Pakistan still ranks third in the world for both measures. Suicide bombings have increased in recent years, with Pakistan accounting for nearly half of all such deaths globally. Militants have targeted the country's military and intelligence agencies in spectacular attacks. Bombing in Pakistan has been a growing issue, with a significant increase in suicide bombings from 2002 to 2009. Despite a decrease in attacks in 2011 due to military operations and drone strikes, the country still faces challenges from various Islamist militant groups. Al Qaeda presence in Pakistan remains a concern, although the group has suffered losses in recent years. After 2009, various militant groups in Pakistan became more intertwined and supportive. Al Qaeda's presence in the country remains a concern, despite recent losses. The Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) emerged in 2007, with representatives from different tribal agencies and settled districts. The Quetta Shura Taliban and Haqqani Network are based in specific regions of Pakistan. Punjab province houses several militant groups, including the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), which poses a growing threat to U.S. national security. The densely populated Punjab province in Pakistan is a hub for Islamist militant groups with global jihadist aspirations. The Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) is a U.S.-designated terrorist group with ties to the ISI, posing a growing threat to U.S. national security. The Raymond Davis affair may have revealed new U.S. intelligence operations against the LeT. Analysts view the LeT as the most dangerous terrorist group in South Asia, capable of becoming a global threat. The LeT's charity wing, Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD), has a strong presence in Pakistan. Pakistan's former Ambassador to the U.S., Husain Haqqani, criticizes the country's focus on sovereignty violations over combating jihadist ideology that has claimed many Pakistani lives. Husain Haqqani criticizes Pakistan's focus on U.S. sovereignty violations instead of combating jihadist ideology that has cost many lives. The military has deployed troops in response to increasing militancy, with thousands of soldiers killed in combat. Pakistani military offensives have had mixed results, with discouraging assessments from the U.S. government. The Pakistani military has suffered 3,000 casualties in combat. Offensives in the Swat Valley and South Waziristan in 2009 were significant. U.S. assessments are pessimistic about recent efforts. Military operations have had some success in clearing areas but struggle to hold them. Independent analyses show mixed results in Swat and FATA from 2009 to 2011. The air force has conducted numerous combat sorties and bombings in the FATA. Fighting continues as government forces push forward. The Pakistani military has faced casualties in combat, with offensives in various regions. The air force has conducted numerous combat sorties and bombings in the FATA, targeting militant groups. Despite some successes in degrading militant capabilities, a simmering insurgency still affects most FATA agencies. The Pakistani military has faced casualties in combat, with offensives in various regions. The air force has conducted combat sorties and bombings in the FATA, targeting militant groups. Despite some successes in degrading militant capabilities, a simmering insurgency still affects most FATA agencies. In South Waziristan, militants attacked a constabulary fort and killed 15 soldiers. Bajaur also experienced a severe militant attack, with a TTP suicide bomber killing dozens, including the local Bajaur Levies commander and his deputy. North Waziristan is currently a significant haven for Afghan- and Pakistan-oriented militants, including the Haqqani Network and TTP forces. Pakistani officials have been hesitant to move into North Waziristan despite U.S. requests, citing the need to consolidate control in other areas. Pakistan's military is inexperienced in counterinsurgency and lacks effective nonconventional warfare capabilities. Islamabad's decision to eject U.S. military trainers in July 2011 has hindered U.S. efforts to support Pakistan in this regard. Pakistan's military forces are inexperienced in counterinsurgency and lack effective nonconventional warfare capabilities. The ejection of U.S. military trainers in July 2011 has hindered efforts to bolster Pakistan's COIN capabilities. Military operations, political strategies, drone strikes, and internal power struggles have splintered the Pakistani Taliban, leading to a decrease in suicide bomb attacks. Factional disputes among militant commanders have further destabilized the region. The Pakistani Taliban leader Mehsud has feuds with other militant commanders and was reportedly ordered killed by his former deputy. Pakistani officials considered negotiations with TTP militants in late 2011, but talks were denied by a TTP spokesman later on. Faqir Muhammad was removed from his TTP position for engaging in dialogue with the government. Negotiations with Pakistani militants have been ongoing, with reports of a pact to unify four major factions under Mullah Omar's leadership. This \"Shura-i-Muraqba\" aims to focus hostility solely on Afghanistan, unlike the TTP, which targets the Pakistani state. The Haqqanis are believed to be pushing for an end to the anti-Pakistan insurgency in order to redirect FATA militants' focus. The \"Shura-i-Muraqba\" comprised of the Haqqanis and other commanders is directing hostility towards Afghanistan, aiming to end the anti-Pakistan insurgency. The U.S. offered a $10 million reward for information on Hafiz Saeed, causing tension in U.S.-Pakistan relations. In April, a prison in Bannu was attacked by militants, freeing nearly 400 prisoners, including a terrorist sentenced to death for a plot against Musharraf. The government inquiry blamed various security forces for the lapse, which bolstered Pakistani Taliban force levels. In May, Secretary of State Clinton urged Pakistan to take more action against terrorist sanctuaries and criticized their inaction against Hafiz Saeed. The Pakistani state's security apparatus is under scrutiny following a coup, with concerns about terrorist sanctuaries in the country. Secretary of State Clinton urged Pakistan to do more against extremist groups like the Haqqani Network and LeT. There are worries about American citizens being recruited for terrorism by Pakistan-based elements, highlighted by the 2010 attempted car bombing in New York by Faisal Shahzad. In 2010, Faisal Shahzad, a Pakistani-born U.S. citizen, attempted a car bombing in New York City's Times Square, claiming he received training in Pakistan. Other cases involve U.S. citizens linked to terrorist plots, such as the 2008 Mumbai attack and David Coleman Headley's involvement with the LeT group. In 2008, the Mumbai terrorist attack occurred, and in 2009, David Coleman Headley, a Chicagoan convert to Islam, was charged with scouting for the attack by the Pakistan-based LeT group. Headley interacted with a retired Pakistani major and Ilayas Kashmiri, a former Pakistani special forces commando with ties to Al Qaeda. Indian officials gained access to Headley in 2010, revealing a Pakistani role in the attack. In 2011, testimony was heard in the trial of Tahawwur Rana, charged with supporting terrorism related to the Mumbai attack. In 2010, Indian officials gained access to David Coleman Headley, who revealed a Pakistani role in the Mumbai attack. In 2011, Tahawwur Rana was tried for supporting terrorism related to the attack, leading to strained US-Pakistan relations. Rana was acquitted of Mumbai attack charges but found guilty of aiding LeT and conspiring to attack a Danish newspaper. The bitter rivalry between Pakistan and India, marked by three wars and ongoing military tensions, stems from the acrimonious partition of British India in 1947 and the unresolved Kashmir sovereignty issue. The bitter rivalry between Pakistan and India, marked by three wars and ongoing military tensions, stems from the acrimonious partition of British India in 1947 and the unresolved Kashmir sovereignty issue. Both countries have built large defense establishments at significant cost to economic and social development. Despite some modest successes in the Composite Dialogue, relations deteriorated in 2008 following a terrorist attack on Mumbai. In 2008, Pakistan-India relations worsened after a terrorist attack in Mumbai, leading to unresolved territorial disputes over Kashmir, Siachen Glacier, and Sir Creek. Conflict over water resources also strained the relationship. Pakistan believes regional peace hinges on resolving the Kashmir issue, while the US maintains a hands-off approach. Islamabad accuses New Delhi of interference in Pakistan's western regions through Indian consulates in Afghanistan. Pakistan and India are engaged in a \"shadow war\" in Afghanistan, with high-visibility attacks targeting Indian interests. Islamabad accuses New Delhi of interference through Indian consulates in Afghanistan. Despite tensions following the 2008 Mumbai attack, peace talks resumed in 2011 after a brief \"cricket diplomacy\" event. India agreed to resume peace talks without mentioning terrorism. High-level talks were announced after a two-year hiatus, following \"cricket diplomacy\" in March 2011. Bilateral talks led to the establishment of a \"terror hotline\" and discussions on economic cooperation. Foreign secretaries agreed to expand confidence-building measures and increase trade and travel across the Kashmiri LOC. A Joint Statement in July was seen as a successful representation of the peace process. Trade ministers met in September to further liberalize trade. India and Pakistan agreed to resume peace talks, focusing on economic cooperation and increasing trade across the Kashmiri LOC. The Joint Statement in July was seen as a successful representation of the peace process. India dropped its opposition to waiving duties on Pakistani exports from flood-ravaged areas. The killing of OBL was seen as a significant step forward by Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, but there were concerns about the impact on U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. The killing of OBL was seen as a significant step forward by Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, but there were concerns about the impact on U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. New Delhi also viewed the discovery of OBL in Pakistan as an opportunity to press for extradition of terrorists linked to the 2008 Mumbai attacks and other anti-India figures. Afghan President Karzai's closer ties with India through a new strategic framework agreement heightened Pakistan's fears of strategic encirclement. Pakistan's fears of strategic encirclement increased due to Afghanistan's closer ties with India. The pact between Afghanistan and India was seen as provocative and could hinder efforts to reduce Pakistan's reliance on militant proxies in Afghanistan. Pakistan's relations with India have improved, with the Kashmir separatist rebellion at its lowest point since 1989. Pakistan vowed to grant Most-Favored Nation trade status to India, which could significantly boost bilateral trade. Pakistan's government vowed to grant Most-Favored Nation trade status to India by the end of 2012, which could greatly increase bilateral trade and bring new prosperity to the region. Islamabad's move towards freer trade with India, including a shift from a \"positive list\" to a \"negative list\" of prohibited items, indicates a shift in its stance on the Kashmir issue. Additionally, there have been no terrorist attacks in India traced to Pakistan in over three years, and President Zardari's visit to India in 2012 marked the first such travel by a Pakistani head of state since 2005. In April 2012, President Zardari made a historic visit to India, the first by a Pakistani head of state since 2005. This visit followed a vow by Pakistan to grant Most-Favored Nation trade status to India by the end of 2012, signaling a shift towards freer trade and a change in stance on the Kashmir issue. Additionally, a tragic avalanche at the Siachen Glacier highlighted the senselessness of the conflict over the region, where Pakistani and Indian troops have faced off for nearly 30 years. Despite this, both governments remain unwilling to redeploy their forces. In May 2012, Pakistan and India signed pacts with Turkmenistan to build a pipeline through Afghanistan for natural gas transportation, a project supported by Washington. In May 2012, Pakistan and India signed pacts with Turkmenistan to build a $7.6 billion, 1,100-mile-long natural gas pipeline through Afghanistan, supported by Washington. However, concerns remain about security in Afghanistan affecting investor confidence. India's willingness to make concessions is constrained by Pakistan's handling of terrorism issues, including the Mumbai attacks and the presence of LeT chief Hafiz Saeed in Pakistan. Islamabad faces criticism from New Delhi for its inaction. India is unsatisfied with Pakistan's handling of terrorism issues, including the Mumbai attacks and the presence of LeT chief Hafiz Saeed in Pakistan. Pakistan's generals play a key role in determining the future of relations between the two countries. Pakistan and China have a close relationship, with China being a primary arms supplier for Pakistan since the 1960s. China has been a primary arms supplier for Pakistan since the 1960s, helping build arms factories and supplying weapons systems. Chinese companies are heavily involved in the Pakistani economy. Despite concerns about international guidelines, China plans to build new civilian nuclear reactors in Pakistan. In 2010, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao visited Islamabad, signing multiple cooperative agreements. Contracts worth $15 billion were signed between Pakistani and Chinese businesses, in addition to nearly $20 billion in government agreements. In 2011, Pakistan and China signed contracts worth $15 billion in various sectors, adding to the existing $20 billion government agreements. Pakistan responded promptly to Chinese concerns about militants trained in Pakistan, with ISI Director Pasha visiting Beijing. China expressed worries about Uighur separatists finding refuge in Pakistan, straining bilateral relations. As U.S.-Pakistan ties soured, Pakistan increasingly relied on its friendship with China, with Pakistani leaders showing strong closeness to Beijing in 2011. In 2011, Pakistani leaders showed strong closeness to Beijing as U.S.-Pakistan ties deteriorated. China agreed to expedite delivery of fighter jets and is negotiating a defense purchase with Pakistan. Both the U.S. and China have an interest in strengthening Pakistan's counterterrorism capabilities. China sees its relationship with Pakistan as a way to balance against India's regional aspirations. China's support for Pakistan aims to counterbalance India's regional ambitions and strengthen Pakistan's counterterrorism capabilities. This partnership could lead to greater U.S.-China coordination in improving Pakistan's military and intelligence services, as well as potential pressure on Islamabad to dismantle terrorist groups. Despite diverging interests in India's role, the United States and China could expand cooperation in areas like nonproliferation, governance, and economic growth in Pakistan. China's military and diplomatic backing for Pakistan hinders India's regional goals, and as the U.S. deepens ties with India, China's reliance on Pakistan is expected to increase. China's support for Pakistan aims to counterbalance India's regional ambitions and strengthen Pakistan's counterterrorism capabilities. The Chinese government is unlikely to get involved in any U.S.-Pakistani rift and has no intention of replacing Washington as Islamabad's primary foreign benefactor. Pakistan's relations with Iran have been troubled by differences over Afghanistan and the presence of anti-Shia terrorist groups, but both countries aspire to complete a natural gas pipeline from Iran. Iran and Pakistan have cooperated on a natural gas pipeline project despite differences over Afghanistan and anti-Shia terrorist groups. Tehran claims construction on its side is complete and has offered $500 million for Pakistan's side. The US opposes the project due to sanctions on Iran, but Islamabad remains committed to completing it. Secretary of State Clinton warned that building a pipeline on the Pakistani side would violate Iran sanctions. Pakistan is determined to proceed with the project despite US concerns. Tehran has tried to bypass sanctions by trading oil for wheat and rice with Pakistan. The security of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal is a top US concern due to the influence of Islamist militants and past illicit proliferation activities. Although improvements have been made, concerns remain about the integrity of the nuclear security network. Metallurgist A.Q. Khan's nuclear network was exposed in 2004, but no criminal charges have been filed against him or his Pakistani co-conspirators. Concerns persist about the integrity of Pakistan's nuclear security and the rapid growth of its nuclear arsenal. China's plans to build nuclear reactors in Pakistan raise nonproliferation concerns for the Obama Administration. China plans to build two new nuclear reactors in Pakistan, raising nonproliferation concerns for the Obama Administration. The deal poses a dilemma as Beijing is asked to justify the plan. Pakistan faces economic challenges due to inflation, unemployment, food and energy shortages, exacerbated by devastating flooding in 2010 and 2011. Corruption hinders economic development, leading to a decline in foreign direct investment. Militancy, global recession, and political instability in Islamabad are identified as major factors contributing to the economic decline. Foreign direct investment in Pakistan plummeted to under $2.2 billion in FY2010/2011, attributed to increasing militancy, global recession, and political instability in Islamabad. Economic priorities include addressing inflation, budget deficit, and meeting challenges posed by higher global oil prices. Pakistan's GDP per capita was once higher than India's, but India's growth surpassed Pakistan's in the early 2000s. A 2008 balance-of-payments crisis led Pakistan to seek multi-billion dollar loans from the IMF. India's national wealth figures have shot upward compared to Pakistan's, despite having a population seven times larger. Pakistan faced a balance-of-payments crisis in 2008, leading to multi-billion dollar loans from the IMF. A $11.3 billion IMF program was put on hold in 2010 due to Islamabad's failure to implement required reforms. Security concerns delayed negotiations with the IMF in 2011, prompting Pakistan to seek U.S. help to influence the IMF for relaxed conditions. In May 2011, security concerns led the IMF to delay negotiations with Pakistani officials, further postponing the disbursement of remaining support funds. Pakistan sought U.S. help to influence the IMF to relax conditions and release the outstanding tranches. Repayment of IMF loans will strain Islamabad's federal budget due to low revenue generation and high military spending. Secretary Clinton criticized Pakistan's low tax-to-GDP ratio. Efforts to implement tax reforms and reduce fuel subsidies faced challenges and political turmoil. Pakistan's low tax-to-GDP ratio of 9% is criticized, hindering economic reforms. Efforts to implement tax reforms and reduce fuel subsidies have faced challenges, leading to political turmoil. Electricity shortages are causing economic deterioration, with businesses forced to shut down due to power outages. Public protests over gas shortages have turned violent, with inflation being the top concern among Pakistanis. In May 2012, violent protests erupted in Lahore and other Punjabi cities, with citizens ransacking offices and torching vehicles. Despite economic growth of 2.4% in FY2011, Pakistan faces challenges such as high public debt, inflation, and energy shortages. Plans to reform taxes and subsidies are delayed, with power outages impacting manufacturing and GDP growth. Structural deficiencies in the economy persist, including low tax revenues and power shortages. The Pakistani economy faces challenges such as low tax revenues, acute power shortages, and delayed reforms in taxes and subsidies. The World Bank highlights poor governance as a central cause of these issues, leading to a negative outlook with significant macroeconomic risks. International financial institutions recommend focusing on human development sectors like education and health to alleviate poverty. The World Bank and IMF report on Pakistan's economy highlights a deteriorated fiscal situation, significant macroeconomic risks, and poor governance. Recommendations include focusing on human development sectors, strengthening public finances, reforming the energy sector, and reducing inflation. Pakistani leaders aim to improve access to Western markets. The IMF recommends urgent policy action for Pakistan to strengthen public finances, reform the energy sector, and reduce inflation. Pakistani leaders seek better access to Western markets, especially for textile exports. The textile sector is crucial for the country's economy, employing 3.5 million people and accounting for 40% of urban factory jobs. Democracy in Pakistan has faced challenges, with power struggles among presidents, prime ministers, and army chiefs, and the country has experienced direct military rule for over half of its existence. Business leaders believe that eliminating American tariffs on cotton apparel, currently at an average of 17%, could increase exports by $5 billion annually. Pakistan's democracy has struggled with power struggles among presidents, prime ministers, and army chiefs, with the military still holding significant influence over foreign and national security policies despite a civilian government in power since 2008. Despite a civilian government led by the Pakistan People's Party, the military still holds decisive influence over foreign and national security policies. The government has struggled to stay in power and enact major reforms, while facing challenges from an empowered judiciary pursuing corruption charges. Economic chaos looms due to political turmoil and widening deficits, with threats to the government's majority status from coalition politics. In 2010 and 2011, the Pakistan People's Party faced threats to its majority status and government existence due to coalition politics with the Jamaat Ulema Islami and Muttahida Quami Movement. The MQM withdrew and rejoined the coalition multiple times, leading to concerns of government collapse. The PPP strengthened its standing through an alliance with the Pakistan Muslim League-Q faction in May 2011. In May 2011, the PPP's alliance with the PML-Q faction strengthened its standing. The party's support in Punjab and agreement to contest elections as PPP allies bolstered its status. The ANP, a PPP coalition ally, also runs the government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Senate elections in February 2012 ensured PPP's control through 2015, allowing them to block legislation even if they lose in future polls. OBL's death embarrassed the Pakistani military and led to rare domestic criticism. The ruling party's increased plurality allows them to block legislation even if they lose in upcoming National Assembly polls. OBL's death embarrassed the Pakistani military, leading to rare domestic criticism and creating an opportunity for civilian leaders to gain more control over foreign and national security policies. Despite media criticism of the security establishment, civilians have not taken advantage of this opening. Parliament established a commission to investigate bin Laden's presence in Pakistan and American forces' incursion into Pakistani territory, but initial lack of focus diminished expectations for meaningful outcomes. The Pakistani Parliament established a commission to investigate how Osama bin Laden found refuge in Pakistan and how American forces entered Pakistani territory. Civil-military tensions escalated after the bin Laden raid, leading to fears of a military coup in late 2011. In early 2012, Prime Minister Gilani faced contempt charges for not requesting Swiss authorities to reopen a corruption case against President Zardari. The Supreme Court found Gilani guilty of contempt but only sentenced him to the time served. In early 2012, Prime Minister Gilani faced contempt charges for not requesting Swiss authorities to reopen a corruption case against President Zardari. The court found Gilani guilty of contempt but only sentenced him to the time served. Legal scholars predict he will be disqualified from holding office after the appeal period expires in June. In late 2011, former cricket hero Imran Khan and his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party gained popularity, despite minimal representation in Parliament. In late 2011, former cricket hero Imran Khan and his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party gained popularity in Pakistan by attracting support from young and middle-class Pakistanis through anti-corruption and anti-American sentiment. Khan's rallies in Lahore and Karachi each drew crowds of over 100,000. He may not win enough seats in the upcoming parliamentary elections to become Prime Minister, but could play a significant role in future governance. Khan has pledged to cut off U.S. aid and end conflict with the Pakistani Taliban if he comes to power. Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party gained popularity in late 2011 by attracting support from young and middle-class Pakistanis through anti-corruption and anti-American sentiment. Khan may not win enough seats in the upcoming parliamentary elections to become Prime Minister, but could play a significant role in future governance. He has vowed to cut off U.S. aid and end conflict with the Pakistani Taliban if he comes to power. Khan's rise reflected the public's desire for honest politicians not tied to mainstream parties. Pakistan's conservative Islamist political forces have reemerged under the newly-formed Difa-e-Pakistan (DPC) coalition. The reemergence of Pakistan's conservative Islamist political forces under the Difa-e-Pakistan (DPC) coalition is a major concern for international observers. The DPC, comprised of over 40 Islamist and rightwing parties, opposes cooperation with the United States and any rapprochement with India. Leader Hafiz Saeed of the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorist group is openly involved in DPC rallies, which also oppose the reopening of GLOCs and accuse the US and India of involvement in Baluchistan's insurgency. Anti-American rhetoric has become a political tool in Pakistan. The human rights situation in Pakistan remains poor, with serious reported abuses including extrajudicial killings, torture, and disappearances by security forces and extremist groups.
