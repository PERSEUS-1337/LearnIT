    "content": "The Obama Administration pursued the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade agreement as part of its strategic rebalance to the Asia-Pacific region. The agreement was concluded in late 2015, signed in February 2016, and aims to liberalize trade among 12 member countries. Congress played an active role in the negotiations, and implementing legislation would be required for the TPP to take effect in the United States. The agreement's potential impacts are a subject of debate in Congress. The TPP's strategic importance is a subject of debate in Congress, with proponents highlighting its economic and strategic significance. Arguments include using the agreement to exert influence in the region, strengthen alliances, enhance national security, drive economic growth, and update trade architecture. The TPP aims to strengthen regional alliances, maintain U.S. leadership in the Asia-Pacific region, enhance national security, liberalize trade, and drive economic growth. China's economic rise and trade initiatives in the region are seen as attempts to minimize U.S. influence. China has been increasing its trade and investment initiatives in Asia, potentially to reduce U.S. influence in the region. The TPP is seen as a way for the U.S. to maintain leadership in Asia and establish trade rules with China in mind. Some argue that framing the TPP as a counter to Chinese initiatives could be counterproductive, as U.S. and Chinese trade goals may actually complement each other. Trade agreements involve both economic and political considerations, creating challenges for policymakers. The U.S. and Chinese trade goals in the Asia-Pacific region may be mutually reinforcing. Trade agreements involve economic and political elements, creating challenges for policymakers. The debate over the TPP focuses on its economic impact versus its strategic implications. This report will examine strategic arguments for and against the TPP in the Asia-Pacific region. This report examines strategic arguments for and against the TPP in the Asia-Pacific region, focusing on implications for Asia. The United States has advanced trade agreements like FTAs since World War II to promote broader foreign policy goals, with some agreements driven by security and foreign policy objectives rather than just economic considerations. The first U.S. FTA in Asia was with Singapore in 2004, emphasizing strategic interests. In the 2000s, U.S. FTAs with Bahrain, Morocco, and Oman were seen as not just economic agreements but also aimed at enhancing security and foreign policy objectives, particularly in combating terrorism. The first U.S. FTA in Asia with Singapore in 2004 emphasized strategic interests. The Obama Administration viewed trade policy initiatives like the TPP as crucial for geostrategic importance and shaping a global economic order reflecting U.S. interests and values. TPP is seen as a test of U.S. credibility as a regional leader. The TPP is viewed as a crucial economic initiative in the Asia-Pacific region, serving as a test of U.S. credibility as a regional leader. The agreement is seen as a key signal of U.S. integration into Asia's economic and diplomatic structures, with potential benefits for countries involved. Failure to approve the agreement could weaken the U.S. rebalancing strategy in Asia and its leadership role in the region. U.S. Trade Representative Froman argues that the economic benefits of the TPP are enhanced by the U.S. deepening its ties in the Asia-Pacific region. Proponents believe that the TPP's completion is crucial for U.S. credibility and leadership globally, as well as for fostering cooperation and resolving differences through respect for rules and norms. The TPP is seen as a key part of the U.S. strategy to strengthen regional institutions and promote cooperation. Proponents argue that the agreement will reinforce U.S. alliances and partnerships in East Asia, with Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter stating that passing TPP is as important as another aircraft carrier. However, critics question how exactly the deal would enhance U.S. security partnerships in the region. Some TPP proponents believe the agreement will strengthen U.S. alliances in East Asia, comparing its importance to another aircraft carrier. However, critics argue that the strength of security partnerships depends more on countries' security interests than on trade agreements like the KORUS FTA with South Korea. The short-term strength of the U.S.-South Korea alliance is likely determined by factors such as threats from China or North Korea, rather than the presence of the KORUS FTA. The future of the U.S.-Japan alliance is believed to depend more on Japan's strategic and political calculations rather than the success or failure of the TPP. In Vietnam's case, a successful outcome in the TPP negotiations could support reform-oriented decisionmakers and deepen relations with the United States. Vietnamese leaders view TPP approval as a signal of closer ties with the United States. Failure to approve the agreement could impact Vietnam's perception of the U.S. as a reliable partner. Some argue that TPP will help promote a global order reflecting U.S. interests and values, including a rules-based trading system. The link between TPP's trade rules and security realm is less clear, but large trade agreements like TPP may influence countries' strategic interests. The TPP's trade rules may impact U.S. security relationships by signaling key partnerships and locking in the U.S.'s Pacific presence. Failure to approve the TPP could be seen as a decline in U.S. interest in the region. Many Asian policymakers fear that a failure of the TPP in the United States could signal a decline in U.S. interest and leadership in the region. This could create an influence vacuum that China may fill, impacting U.S. credibility in Asia. Rejection of the TPP by Congress could lead to a loss of trust and cooperation in key relationships, such as with Japan. TPP backers argue that rejection of the agreement by Congress could lead to a loss of trust and cooperation in key relationships, impacting U.S. influence in the region. The TPP aims to promote economic growth, advance U.S. interests, and influence trade regimes by encouraging market opening, creating incentives for other nations to follow suit, and addressing new trade barriers. The TPP aims to promote economic growth, advance U.S. interests, and influence trade regimes by encouraging market opening, creating incentives for other nations to follow suit, and addressing new trade barriers. This includes updating critical gaps in existing trade rules and laying groundwork for future multilateral or plurilateral negotiations. The U.S. negotiating objectives in the TPP focus on updating the rules-based trading system and expanding economic engagement through trade. The United States played a leading role in liberalizing trade through GATT and establishing the WTO. The WTO Doha Development Agenda has stalled, prompting countries to pursue new trade agreements like the TPP. TPP proponents argue that its scale creates a significant bloc of nations with broad disciplines. The TPP is a trade agreement involving 12 countries, accounting for 37% of global GDP. It aims to create a significant bloc with broad disciplines, potentially drawing interest from other countries and promoting U.S. goals such as worker rights and environmental protection. The TPP aims to promote U.S. goals like worker rights and environmental protection by offering incentives to countries. Proponents believe it could lead to further trade liberalization in the region, drawing interest from other countries. However, critics point out that major Asian economies like China and India are not part of the agreement, limiting its comprehensive impact on trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific region. The TPP may not create comprehensive trade rules in the Asia-Pacific region as major economies like China and India are not part of the agreement. However, countries like Indonesia, the Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand have shown interest in joining a \"second round\" of TPP members. U.S. FTA partners like South Korea and Colombia are likely candidates for future TPP entry. The TPP and other mega-regionals could potentially boost trade liberalization efforts. TPP proponents argue that U.S. FTA partners like South Korea and Colombia are likely candidates for future TPP entry. They believe mega-regionals like the TPP could influence multilateral negotiations and set new trade standards beyond the WTO. Critics fear that focusing on bilateral and regional trade deals could divert attention from multilateral initiatives, potentially undermining the WTO's role in global trade liberalization. If trade negotiations shift away from the WTO, it may undermine the organization's legitimacy and role in future trade liberalization. Mega-regionals like the TPP and RCEP could create overlapping rules, complicating the trading system. The RCEP includes ASEAN members and six other nations in a collective FTA, excluding the United States. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) is a collective FTA joining ASEAN members and six other nations, excluding the United States. RCEP's provisions are still being determined, but it may differ from the TPP in terms of trade liberalization, intellectual property rights, investment, and labor and environmental provisions. Some view RCEP as an alternative or challenge to the TPP in shaping trade rules. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) includes provisions on trade liberalization, intellectual property rights, investment, and labor and environmental provisions. Some argue that RCEP presents an alternative or challenge to the TPP in shaping trade rules. The TPP is at a more advanced stage than RCEP, with potential differences in disciplines on state-owned enterprises. Compatibility and synergy between the two agreements are important, as some countries are members of both RCEP and the TPP. Negotiations for the TPP are more advanced than RCEP, with potential implications for the Asia-Pacific region. Both agreements are seen as pathways to the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific, with China's role being a key factor. The inclusion or exclusion of China in the TPP could have significant consequences for the United States and the region. China's inclusion in or exclusion from the TPP may have important implications for the United States and the Asia-Pacific region. The TPP is seen as a means of countering China's efforts to create a regional order that minimizes U.S. presence and power. The proposed TPP would allow the United States to shape a model in line with its interests by creating rules and norms for other regional nations to join. The proposed TPP aims to shape regional economic development in line with U.S. interests by creating enforceable standards and norms. This could influence China's economic and diplomatic decisions favorably towards U.S. interests. President Obama highlighted the importance of the TPP in setting international norms that China may have to consider. Additionally, a completed TPP could push China to further liberalize its trade regime and potentially join the agreement. The completion of the TPP could prompt China to align with international norms and liberalize its trade regime, potentially leading to its participation in the agreement. However, some argue that portraying China as an outlier in regional economic development may exaggerate its influence on trade rules and could provoke responses detrimental to U.S. interests. Additionally, they emphasize that China's economic initiatives in the region could benefit Asian countries, and opposing them may alienate the United States. China is proceeding with economic initiatives in Asia that could be beneficial for regional development. The Chinese government is focused on strengthening its economy and increasing its global role through various policies. This includes plans to construct a land-based Silk Road. China is pursuing economic initiatives to strengthen its economy and increase its global role through the \"One Belt, One Road\" initiative, including the construction of land-based and maritime Silk Roads. New financial institutions like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Silk Road Fund are providing capital for these projects. China is also working to increase the overseas use of its currency, the renminbi, to support Chinese assistance programs and enhance global economic integration. China's efforts to increase the overseas use of its currency, the renminbi, aim to simplify transactions for Chinese financial institutions, reduce commercial risk for Chinese companies in international trade, and enhance China's global economic stature. Chinese leaders also see the establishment of RCEP as a foundation for a broader FTAAP, reflecting Chinese leadership in regional rules and norms. Additionally, China is actively promoting reforms in multilateral institutions like the United Nations, IMF, and World Bank, with the AIIB offering an alternative model for development banks. China's efforts to reshape economic institutions and counter U.S. influence through initiatives like the AIIB and diplomatic actions, such as refashioning security systems and reclaiming disputed reefs in the South China Sea. China has undertaken extensive reclamation and construction on disputed reefs in the South China Sea to counter U.S. naval power. China's views on the TPP have varied, with initial portrayals of it as a U.S.-dominated process aimed at isolating China. However, President Obama clarified that the TPP was not meant to contain or disadvantage China, and hoped China would adopt some of its practices for fairness. China's criticisms of the U.S. role in the TPP have softened, with Chinese officials expressing openness to negotiations on the agreement. President Obama has indicated that China is welcome to join the TPP, although implementing its standards may be challenging for China. Analysts suggest that China's ultimate aim may be to participate in the TPP at some point. President Obama welcomed China to join the TPP, despite challenges in implementing its standards. The U.S. aims to integrate China into deeper trade commitments and establish new rules. Negotiations for a bilateral investment treaty with China could pave the way for its future participation in the TPP. Congress has been involved in guiding and overseeing the TPP since the U.S. joined in 2008. The United States is negotiating a bilateral investment treaty with China to boost investment flows and potentially join the TPP. Congress plays a direct role in guiding and overseeing TPP negotiations, including approving legislation for trade promotion authority. Congress will also have a role in considering TPP and its strategic elements, such as whether it furthers a broader foreign policy strategy in the Asia-Pacific region. The TPP proponents argue that the agreement is part of a broader foreign policy strategy to promote international rules and norms in the Asia-Pacific region, reinforcing U.S. leadership and encouraging economic and political reform. Congress should consider the strategic implications and weigh trade-offs before approving the agreement. The TPP proponents argue that the agreement is part of a broader foreign policy strategy to promote international rules and norms in the Asia-Pacific region, reinforcing U.S. leadership and encouraging economic and political reform. Congress may weigh trade-offs among the agreement's many potential implications, including its strategic benefits and impact on the U.S. economy. Some argue that the TPP's ultimate strategic impact will depend on membership expansion to other nations. The potential concerns surrounding the TPP agreement include questions about membership expansion and the balance between trade liberalization and U.S. economic interests. The implications of failed ratification could set back U.S. leadership in the region and delay the formation of alternative trade agreements. Congress may need to consider the potential impact of delays or rejection of the TPP agreement on U.S. leadership and credibility in the Asia-Pacific region. It is important to address concerns about membership expansion and ensure that U.S. economic engagement extends beyond the current TPP membership to maintain influence across the region. Congress may need to consider the potential impact of delays or rejection of the TPP agreement on U.S. leadership and credibility in the Asia-Pacific region. It is important to address concerns about membership expansion and ensure that U.S. economic engagement extends beyond the current TPP membership to maintain influence across the region. Analysts have mixed views on how \"mega-regional\" negotiations may impact the multilateral trading system, with some seeing it as an opportunity for the U.S. to advance new trade rules and disciplines, while others worry about the potential negative impact on countries not involved in the negotiations. The proposed TPP agreement may impact the multilateral trading system represented by the WTO. Some view it as an opportunity for the U.S. to advance new trade rules, while others worry it may undermine the WTO's legitimacy and negatively affect non-participating countries. Congress needs to consider if the TPP will promote global trade liberalization or lead to fragmentation. They may also need to decide on pursuing new global trade initiatives to ensure the TPP complements global efforts and doesn't shift focus away from the WTO."
