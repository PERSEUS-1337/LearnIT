The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was established in 1957 with the goal of promoting atomic energy for peaceful purposes and preventing its use for military purposes. The United States is the largest financial contributor to the IAEA and its Technical Cooperation Fund, which provides nuclear technical cooperation for peaceful purposes globally. The United States is the largest financial contributor to the IAEA's Technical Cooperation Fund, which provides nuclear technical cooperation for peaceful purposes globally. A report by the Government Accountability Office found that Cuba, Iran, Sudan, and Syria received over $55 million in assistance from 1997 to 2007, despite being designated as state sponsors of terrorism. The GAO report highlighted proliferation concerns with the Technical Cooperation Program, particularly regarding assistance provided to certain countries like Iran. Limited State Department documentation makes it difficult for the US to fully assess and resolve these concerns. The GAO report raised concerns about the Technical Cooperation Program, noting limited information on projects and the lack of exclusion based on countries' status as U.S.-designated state sponsors of terrorism. The report also highlighted shortcomings in U.S. policies and IAEA procedures related to proliferation risks. The GAO report raised concerns about the Technical Cooperation Program, questioning the effectiveness of safeguards to prevent weapons development in U.S.-designated state sponsors of terrorism. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 prohibits funds for programs in Libya, Iran, Cuba, or the Palestine Liberation Organization. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and subsequent Acts prohibited funds for programs in Libya, Iran, Cuba, or the Palestine Liberation Organization. The GAO report recommended withholding a share of future contributions to the Technical Cooperation Fund for projects in Cuba related to nuclear facilities. The GAO report suggested withholding funding to the IAEA for projects in Cuba related to nuclear facilities due to concerns about Iran's violations of UN Security Council Resolutions. Iran is continuing its work on heavy water-related projects and uranium enrichment, in violation of multiple United Nations Security Council Resolutions. The IAEA Director General reported that Iran has around 7,000 centrifuges, with almost 5,000 in operation, and has increased its stockpile of low-enriched uranium to over 1,300 kilograms, enough for further enrichment into high-enriched uranium for a potential atomic bomb. The Government of Iran currently possesses around 7,000 centrifuges for enriching uranium, operating nearly 5,000 of them, and has accumulated over 1,300 kilograms of low-enriched uranium, sufficient for further enrichment into high-enriched uranium for a potential atomic bomb. The IAEA Director General has raised concerns about possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear program and noted Iran's failure to implement the Additional Protocol for credible assurance regarding undeclared nuclear material and activities. Iran has not implemented the Additional Protocol, which is necessary for the IAEA to provide assurance about undeclared nuclear activities. Iran has also refused to provide access to additional locations related to centrifuge manufacturing and uranium enrichment. The IAEA has made no progress on concerns about possible military dimensions of Iran's nuclear program due to Iran's lack of cooperation. Iran has also failed to comply with resolutions adopted by the IAEA Board of Governors. Iran continues to defy IAEA resolutions and block inspections of its nuclear facilities, including denying access to the Natanz enrichment site. Additionally, Iran has not implemented the Additional Protocol or cooperated on concerns about possible military dimensions of its nuclear program. Iran has denied access to its enrichment site at Natanz to IAEA inspectors and refused a request for additional surveillance cameras. In April 2008, it was revealed that Syria, with North Korea's help, was building a secret nuclear reactor at Dair Alzour capable of producing plutonium for weapons. The reactor was destroyed by an Israeli air strike in September 2007. General Michael Hayden stated that the Syrian reactor could have produced enough plutonium for 1 or 2 bombs within a year of becoming operational. The IAEA Director General reported in November 2008 that the Syrian facility at Dair Alzour had features resembling an undeclared facility. The Syrian reactor at Dair Alzour could have produced enough plutonium for 1 or 2 bombs within a year of becoming operational. The IAEA Director General reported that Syria has not provided requested documentation or allowed access to other locations for inspection. Samples from the Miniature Neutron Source Reactor facility in Damascus also showed uranium particles of a type not previously identified. The Agency found uranium particles at the Dair Alzour and Miniature Neutron Source Reactor facilities in Syria, not included in Syria's declared inventory of nuclear material. The Agency found uranium particles at the Dair Alzour and Miniature Neutron Source Reactor facilities in Syria, not included in Syria's declared inventory of nuclear material. Prohibition on the use of funds. No US funds to IAEA can support assistance to countries like North Korea that are state sponsors of terrorism or in breach of nuclear agreements. The Secretary of State must withhold proportional voluntary contributions to IAEA spent on technical cooperation from 2007 to 2008. The Secretary of State must withhold US voluntary contributions to the IAEA proportional to the amount spent on technical cooperation from 2007 to 2008. If not done within 30 days, assessed contributions will also be withheld. The President can waive certain provisions if the IAEA suspends assistance to specified countries or if the President certifies that these countries no longer pose a threat. The President must direct the US Representative to the IAEA to block funds for assistance to these countries. A report on the Act's implementation must be submitted within six months. Within six months of enactment, the President must report to Congress on the Act's implementation. The Act defines \"appropriate congressional committees\" and \"state sponsor of terrorism.\""
