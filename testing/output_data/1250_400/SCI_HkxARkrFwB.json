    "content": "Deep learning NLP models use word embeddings like word2vec or GloVe to represent words as continuous vectors, enabling easier integration with neural layers. Storing and accessing embedding vectors for all words requires a large amount of space. Two efficient methods, word2ket and word2ketXS, inspired by quantum computing, reduce the space needed to store embeddings by a hundred-fold or more without sacrificing accuracy in NLP tasks. This approach converts the discrete space of human language into a continuous space for neural network processing. Modern deep learning approaches for NLP rely on word embeddings like word2vec or GloVe to convert human language into continuous vectors, reducing the need for large memory storage. These embeddings capture semantic relationships between words and allow downstream neural network layers to be more efficient. The d \u00d7 p embedding matrix needs to be stored explicitly for this process. The embeddings in modern deep learning for NLP capture semantic relationships between words, allowing downstream neural network layers to be more efficient. The d \u00d7 p embedding matrix, with dimensions reaching d = 10^5 or 10^6, is a significant part of the parameter space. In classical computing, information is stored in bits, while in quantum computing, a qubit is described by a two-dimensional complex unit-norm vector. In quantum computing, information is stored in qubits, which are interconnected to allow for entanglement. This enables exponential dimensionality of the state space compared to classical bits. Entanglement is a purely quantum phenomenon where the state of a multi-qubit system cannot be decomposed into individual qubit states. While classical bits are always independent, quantum registers can be approximated classically by storing vectors of size m using O(log m) space. In quantum computing, information is stored in qubits allowing for entanglement and exponential dimensionality. Quantum registers can be approximated classically by storing vectors of size m using O(log m) space. The loss of representation power in approximations does not significantly impact NLP machine learning algorithms. Two methods, word2ket and word2ketXS, efficiently store word embedding matrices during training and inference. Empirical evidence shows high space saving rates with little cost in NLP tasks. The new word2ket embeddings offer high space saving rates with little impact on NLP model accuracy. A tensor product space of two separable Hilbert spaces V and W, denoted as V \u2297 W, is constructed using ordered pairs v \u2297 w, where v \u2208 V and w \u2208 W. The inner product between vectors in the tensor product space follows specific properties, and a vector in this space is often referred to as a tensor. The tensor product space V \u2297 W is constructed using pairs v \u2297 w from V and W, forming an orthonormal basis {\u03c8 j \u2297 \u03c6 k }. The dimensionality of V \u2297 W is the product of the dimensionalities of V and W. Tensor product spaces can be created by multiple applications of the tensor product, with arbitrary bracketing, and are associative. In Dirac notation, a vector u \u2208 C 2 is commonly used in quantum mechanics and quantum computing. The tensor product space V \u2297 W is constructed using pairs v \u2297 w from V and W, forming an orthonormal basis. The dimensionality of V \u2297 W is the product of the dimensionalities of V and W. Tensor product spaces can be created by multiple applications of the tensor product, with arbitrary bracketing. In Dirac notation, a vector u \u2208 C 2 is commonly used in quantum mechanics and quantum computing. The tensor product space of the form H = U \u2297 V \u2297 W is said to have tensor order 3 of n. In some cases, vectors in the tensor product space cannot be expressed as \u03c6 \u2297 \u03c8. The tensor product space V \u2297 W contains vectors of the form v \u2297 w and their linear combinations. It may not always be possible to express v \u2297 w as \u03c6 \u2297 \u03c8. Tensors of rank greater than one are called entangled. The maximum rank of a tensor in a tensor product space of order higher than two is not known. A word embedding model maps word identifiers into a p-dimensional real Hilbert space to capture semantic information from language corpus. The word embedding model involves mapping word identifiers into a p-dimensional real Hilbert space to capture semantic information from the language corpus. In practical implementations, word embeddings are represented as entangled tensors, using a tensor of rank r and order n. The resulting vector has dimension p = qn, taking up space O(rq log q log p). The word embedding vectors in a tensor product have dimension p = qn, requiring space O(rq log q log p). Inner product calculations between word embeddings take O(rq log q log p) time and O(1) additional space. For processing in neural networks, a small number of embedding vectors are needed, with a total space requirement of O(bp + rq log q log p) for a batch of b words. Reconstructing a single p-dimensional word embedding vector from a tensor of rank r and order n takes O(rn log^2 p) arithmetic operations. The proposed word2ket representation involves a balanced tensor product tree structure for efficient parallel processing of word embeddings. It allows for reconstructing word embedding vectors with fewer arithmetic operations and enables gradient descent training with differentiable arithmetic operations. The representation can be viewed as a sequence of linear layers with linear activation functions, reducing the processing to O(log2n) sequential steps. The word2ket representation utilizes a balanced tree structure for efficient processing of word embeddings. It involves linear layers with activation functions, reducing operations to O(log2n) steps. To address high Lipschitz constant gradients, LayerNorm is used at each node in the tree. Linear operators A and B map vectors from V to U and W to Y, respectively, with A \u2297 B being a linear operator mapping V \u2297 W to U \u2297 Y. The linear operator A \u2297 B maps vectors from V \u2297 W to U \u2297 Y through its action on simple vectors and linearity. In the finite-dimensional case, A \u2297 B can be represented as an mn \u00d7 mn matrix. A word embedding model involves a linear operator F : Rd \u2192 Rp that maps one-hot vectors to word embedding vectors. The word embedding matrix can be interpreted as the matrix representation of the linear operator F. The word embedding matrix can be represented as a linear operator F with dimensions p \u00d7 d. To save space, tensor product-based exponential compression is applied horizontally and vertically to the whole matrix. Lazy tensors are used to avoid reconstructing the full matrix for small row multiplications. The use of lazy tensors allows for efficient reconstruction of rows in the embedding matrix for downstream NLP tasks like text summarization, language translation, and question answering. Space-efficient word embeddings were compared to regular embeddings in accuracy for these tasks, with positive results shown in experiments using the GIGAWORD dataset. In text summarization experiments, space-efficient embeddings were proposed to achieve accuracy comparable to regular embeddings. The models used a bidirectional RNN encoder-decoder architecture with attention mechanisms and were trained for 20 epochs. Results showed a 16-fold reduction in trainable parameters with a slight drop in Rouge scores. In text summarization experiments, space-efficient embeddings were proposed to achieve accuracy comparable to regular embeddings. The models achieved a 16-fold reduction in trainable parameters with a slight drop in Rouge scores. Additionally, in German-English machine translation tasks, BLEU scores were used to measure performance with different embedding dimensions, showing a slight drop of about 1 point in results. In text summarization experiments, space-efficient embeddings were used to reduce trainable parameters by 16-fold with a slight drop in Rouge scores. For the BLEU score measurement in German-English machine translation tasks, different embedding dimensions were explored, resulting in a 1-point drop. In another task using the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD), a model with 3-layer bidirectional LSTMs was trained for 40 epochs, showing a 0.5 point drop in F1 score with a 1000-fold reduction in parameter space. DrQA uses embeddings with a vocabulary size of 118,655 and dimensionality of 300, resulting in a 0.5 point drop in F1 score with significant space savings. The computational overhead for word2ketXS embeddings increased training time, with a single NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU card used for the experiments. The training time for experiments increased to 9 hours on a machine with 2 Intel Xeon Gold 6146 CPUs and 384 GB RAM. The memory footprint of word embeddings in sequence-to-sequence models decreased significantly, impacting the input layers of the encoder and decoder. Transformer models like BERT, GPT-2, RoBERTa, and Sparse Transformers require hundreds of millions of parameters to function effectively. In RoBERTa BASE, 30% of the parameters are dedicated to word embeddings. In RoBERTa BASE, a significant portion of parameters are allocated to word embeddings, impacting memory usage during training. Various methods, such as dictionary learning and word embedding clustering, have been proposed to reduce the memory footprint of these networks. Various approaches have been used to lower space requirements for word embeddings, including dictionary learning, word embedding clustering, bit encoding, and optimized quantization methods. Methods like pruning, quantization, sparsity, and low numerical precision have been utilized for model compression. Fourier-based approximation methods have also been employed. However, none of these methods can match the space-saving rates achieved by word2ketXS. None of the approaches mentioned in the previous paragraph can achieve the space-saving rates of word2ketXS. Bit encoding methods are limited to a saving rate of 32 for 32-bit architectures, while other methods like parameter sharing or PCA offer higher saving rates but are limited by vocabulary size and embedding dimensionality. Tensor product spaces have also been used for document embeddings."
