    "content": "A helper in the construction industry is typically an unskilled worker who assists skilled craftsmen. They may have a range of skills but lack formal training. Helpers are often not union members and are paid less than skilled workers, but can still perform well in certain tasks. They are valued for their flexibility and cost-effectiveness, especially in tasks requiring specialized assistance. A helper in the construction industry is a flexible addition to a work crew, assisting skilled craftsmen in performing narrow aspects of complex tasks. They receive minimal training and are considered temporary workers. The debate on the economic efficiency of this arrangement continues, with apprentices receiving formal training while helpers are not permanent crew members. The Davis-Bacon Act recognizes apprentices and trainees in formal programs for wage rate purposes but generally does not recognize helpers. Helpers are considered temporary workers with minimal training, assisting skilled craftsmen in specific tasks on construction sites. The Act requires construction contracts over $2,000 to state minimum wages based on prevailing rates determined by the Secretary of Labor. The Davis-Bacon Act requires construction contracts to state minimum wages based on prevailing rates determined by the Secretary of Labor. The Secretary is responsible for defining concepts like \"wages\" and \"prevailing\" and determining the scope of the locality where the work is performed. The concept of helpers and their common use in the area of federal construction work has been a contentious issue for over 60 years. The Davis-Bacon Act has been a focus of contention, rulemaking, and congressional debate for over 60 years. The concept of helpers in federal construction work has also been contentious, with Congress legislating in broad strokes and leaving further definition to the Secretary of Labor. The Act refers to various classes of laborers and mechanics, with evolving regulations focusing on apprentices and trainees in formal training programs. The Davis-Bacon Act has been amended over the years, focusing on laborers and mechanics. The regulations evolved to include apprentices and trainees in formal training programs. The term \"helper\" was used casually without a precise definition, causing confusion in wage rate determinations. Business economist Armand Thieblot noted the need for defined terms in the regulations. Armand Thieblot emphasized the importance of defining terms in the Davis-Bacon Act regulations, particularly regarding the classification of helpers in prevailing wage determinations. He highlighted the need for helpers to be reclassified as journeymen or laborers if they do not meet prevailing classification criteria. Thieblot also mentioned the use of semi-skilled labor and the requirement for them to be enrolled in DOL-approved apprenticeship programs to be considered journeymen for pay purposes. Additionally, he noted that helpers would only be recognized for Davis-Bacon rate purposes in areas where their classification is prevalent among open shop firms. The Davis-Bacon Act regulations emphasize the importance of defining terms, especially regarding the classification of helpers in prevailing wage determinations. Helpers will only be recognized for Davis-Bacon rate purposes in areas where their classification is prevalent among open shop firms. This recognition is crucial to prevent contractors from undercutting prevailing wage rates by misclassifying workers. The Building and Construction Trades Department (BCTD), AFL-CIO, has no issues with apprentices and trainees recognized by the Department of Labor (DOL), but restrictions on employing helpers at sub-craft rates are seen as essential for preserving labor standards in the building trades. The Building and Construction Trades Department (BCTD), AFL-CIO, supports restrictions on employing helpers at sub-craft rates to prevent undercutting prevailing wage rates. They argue that misclassification of workers allows non-union contractors to underbid union contractors on federally funded projects, which goes against the intent of the Davis-Bacon Act. Efforts for reform or repeal of the Act began in the late 1970s through direct legislation or regulatory processes. In the late 1970s, efforts for reform or repeal of the Davis-Bacon Act began, with the Building and Construction Trades Department (BCTD) advocating against employing helpers at sub-craft rates to prevent undercutting prevailing wage rates on federally funded projects. The Carter Administration proposed a rule in December 1979 to revise the administration of Davis-Bacon, emphasizing the classification of laborers and mechanics based on the work performed rather than skill levels. The proposed rule in the late 1970s aimed to establish special wage rates for helpers based on their distinct duties, separate from other laborer and mechanic classifications. The final rule published in mid-January 1981 did not provide a definition for helpers, despite defining other terms like \"laborer\" and \"mechanic.\" The Department of Labor's position on helpers was clarified, with the emphasis on preventing undercutting prevailing wage rates on federally funded projects. The final rule published in mid-January 1981 did not define helpers, unlike other terms like \"laborer\" and \"mechanic.\" The Department of Labor emphasized the importance of preventing undercutting prevailing wage rates on federally funded projects by only allowing apprentices and trainees under approved programs. The Department of Labor emphasized the importance of preventing undercutting prevailing wage rates on federally funded projects by only allowing apprentices and trainees under approved programs. The Department anticipated difficulties in recognizing the use of helpers and determining appropriate locally prevailing wage rates for these workers, leading to a delay and eventual withdrawal of the Davis-Bacon regulations in February 1981. The Department of Labor faced challenges in recognizing the use of helpers and determining prevailing wage rates, leading to a delay and eventual withdrawal of the Davis-Bacon regulations in February 1981. During the Reagan era, consideration of the helper issue occurred in three periods: issuance of a proposed rule in August 1981, publication of a final rule in May 1982, and subsequent litigation throughout the Reagan Administration. The Reagan Administration proposed a new rule in August 1981 allowing for a helper classification on wage determinations when identifiable in the locality, to reflect actual industry practices and rates. The Department of Labor proposed new regulations in August 1981 to issue helper wage determinations based on actual industry practices and rates, allowing for increased use of helpers in the construction industry. The regulations defined helpers as a component of the terms \"laborer\" or \"mechanic\" and prohibited the use of journeymen as helpers to prevent abuse. The new regulations defined a \"helper\" as a semi-skilled worker who assists a journeyman in various tasks, prohibiting the use of journeymen as helpers to prevent abuse. The helper works under the journeyman's direction, performing duties such as preparing materials, cleaning work areas, and using tools under supervision. The Department of Labor issued a final Davis-Bacon rule in May 1995, changing the ratio of helpers to journeymen from 1:5 to 2:3. This decision was made after receiving over 1,000 comments specifically addressing the helper issue. The new regulations allow helpers to perform semi-skilled tasks under the direction of a journeyman, using tools of the trade. The Department of Labor raised the helper to journeyman ratio from 1:5 to 2:3 in the final Davis-Bacon rule, despite opposition from trade unionists. The new ratio allows up to 40% of the on-site workforce to be helpers, leading to cost savings. Critics like John Dunlop and the Building and Construction Trades Department, AFL-CIO, argued that the new rule would allow excessive use of helpers and cross-craft helpers. The Department of Labor raised the helper to journeyman ratio to 2:3 in the final Davis-Bacon rule, despite opposition. The rule allows almost unlimited use of helpers within a craft and 'cross-craft' helpers, with industry favorably disposed to the change. The American Farm Bureau Federation and U.S. Chamber of Commerce commended the Reagan administration for the revision. The American Farm Bureau Federation and U.S. Chamber of Commerce praised the Reagan administration for revising the Davis-Bacon regulations, allowing contractors to use semi-skilled workers at lower wages. The AFL-CIO expressed concern over the new helper classification, stating it undermines the minimum wage requirement and will harm minority workers. They filed a lawsuit to stop enforcement of the changes. The AFL-CIO filed a lawsuit to stop the enforcement of changes in the Davis-Bacon Act, particularly the new helper classification that could lead to wage-cutting and misclassification of minority construction workers. Judge Harold H. Greene issued a preliminary injunction against the Secretary of Labor, addressing concerns about employers avoiding paying skilled laborers' wages by classifying workers as \"helpers.\" Congress was aware of this issue when enacting the Davis-Bacon Act to prevent such practices. The Senate Committee report highlighted concerns about employers classifying workers as \"helpers\" to avoid paying skilled laborers' wages, leading to a breakdown in wage standards. The report recommended construction contracts specify minimum wages based on prevailing rates for different classes of laborers and mechanics, a concept central to the statutory scheme. The new regulations risk allowing the practices Congress sought to prevent in 1935. The new regulations risk permitting contractors to assign general helpers to perform tasks across different classes of laborers and mechanics, potentially leading to lower wages and undermining the requirement for wages to be based on corresponding classes. The new regulations may allow contractors to assign general helpers to perform tasks across different classes of laborers and mechanics, potentially leading to lower wages and undermining the requirement for wages to be based on corresponding classes. The new regulations under the Davis-Bacon Act may allow for the use of general helpers in various construction tasks, potentially leading to lower wages and deviating from the Act's central purpose. This change could result in the substitution of traditional craft workers with helpers in construction projects, which goes against prior practice and the original intent of the Act. It is unlikely that these regulations will be upheld in the long run, as they represent a significant departure from historical interpretations of the law. Judge Greene noted that previous administrations had consistently interpreted and enforced the Davis-Bacon regulations without significant changes. He issued a permanent injunction against the helper rule, which was partially upheld and partially overturned by the U.S. Court of Appeals. The Appeals Court declared that the provision allowing helper classification based on being 'identifiable' in an area undermined the Act's fundamental purpose. The U.S. Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit, reviewed Judge Greene's decision on the helper issue. They partly upheld and partly overturned the District Court verdict, stating that the provision allowing helper classification based on being 'identifiable' in an area undermines the Act's fundamental purpose of mirroring local prevailing wages on federal construction projects. The Appeals Court also highlighted the potential for underclassification in union-dominated areas, emphasizing that Congress viewed underclassification as contrary to the act's purposes. The Appeals Court split on the helper issue, upholding the District Court on \"identifiable\" versus \"prevailing\" practice but accepting the Secretary's new definition of \"helper.\" The regulation blocked implementation of the helper rule, leading to unions appealing the decision. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case in January 1984. The Appeals Court upheld the District Court on the \"identifiable\" versus \"prevailing\" practice issue but accepted the Secretary's new definition of \"helper.\" This decision blocked the implementation of the helper rule, leading to unions appealing the case. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case in January 1984, leaving the Secretary of Labor to restructure the helper regulation for judicial approval. In late August 1987, a new proposed rule on the use of helpers was issued, conceding the issue of \"prevailing\" versus merely identifiable. Defining \"prevailing\" remained a challenge, with the Department presenting several options for consideration. On September 24, 1990, Judge Greene vacated the injunction, allowing the Department of Labor to implement the helper regulation. The building trades unions immediately filed an appeal, and on December 4, 1990, the Department announced that the helper rule would take effect on February 4, 1991. Contractors were required to report the number of helpers, apprentices, and trainees they employ in each craft, along with their wage rates. Congress later intervened with the \"Dire Emergency Supplemental Appropriations\" bill of April 10. In April 1991, Congress passed a bill barring the Department of Labor from implementing the helper regulations, leading to a dispute over whether the restriction was temporary or permanent. Despite DOL's efforts to secure funding in the FY1992 budget, the request was denied, and the new budget was signed without the requested funding in November 1991. The Appeals Court decision on the matter was still pending as of April 21, 1992. The Appeals Court concurred with the Department's definition of \"helper\" and \"prevailing\" but deemed the ratio of helpers to journeymen as \"arbitrary and capricious,\" leading to its invalidation. The court criticized the fixed ratio as lacking rational decision-making and being unsubstantiated, stating that it did not reflect industry practices. The Department's regulation on the ratio of helpers to journeymen was deemed arbitrary and capricious by the Appeals Court, leading to its invalidation. The Department issued a new rule removing the fixed ratio, which was seen as a blow to building trades unions but a victory for industry critics. Implementation of the new rule was delayed, causing debate within Congress and the policy community. The Department's regulation on the ratio of helpers to journeymen was invalidated by the Appeals Court, leading to a new rule being issued. Industry critics saw this as a victory, while building trades unions were disappointed. Debate continued on the wisdom of the helper regulation and its effects on manpower utilization and costs. Major revision or repeal of the Davis-Bacon Act through legislation was not a viable option, with reform through the rulemaking process being considered. Senator Nickles introduced legislation in 1982 to amend the act by including helpers in its provisions. Senator Nickles introduced legislation in 1982 to amend the Davis-Bacon Act by including helpers in its provisions. Efforts to codify the regulations followed, with debates on the use of helpers on federal projects resurfacing in 1993. Senator Nickles proposed deletion of language blocking the use of helpers, citing potential savings of nearly $600 million annually for the federal government. Senator Nickles proposed the deletion of committee language blocking the use of helpers on federal projects, citing potential savings of nearly $600 million annually for the government. He argued that restricting helpers would waste taxpayer money and deny job opportunities to hundreds of thousands of Americans. Senator Harkin opposed the proposal, expressing concerns about the impact on minority workers and apprentice training programs. Senator Nickles proposed removing committee language blocking the use of helpers on federal projects, citing potential savings of nearly $600 million annually. Senator Harkin opposed the proposal, expressing concerns about the impact on minority workers and apprentice training programs. The committee's amendment to suspend implementation of DOL's helper regulations for one year was passed by a vote of 60 yeas to 39 nays. The House Appropriations Committee later defeated a proposal to remove the helper funding restraint from a pending DOL appropriations measure. On June 21, 1994, the House Appropriations Committee defeated a proposal to remove the helper funding restraint from a pending DOL appropriations measure. Representative DeLay argued for the removal of the restrictive language to allow the helper regulation to go into effect, citing cost savings and increased job opportunities. In contrast, Representative Ford supported the Davis-Bacon requirement, stating it prevents undermining of wages and benefits in local communities, ensures quality construction, and saves money in the long run. He warned that implementing the regulation could lead to shifting work from journeymen to lower skilled and lower paid helpers, undermining apprenticeship training programs. Representative Ford argued against the removal of the helper funding restraint, stating that it would undermine apprenticeship training programs and create low-skilled, low-paying jobs. He noted that the Department planned to issue revised helper regulations and urged the defeat of the DeLay amendment, which was ultimately defeated by a voice vote. The language prohibiting implementation of the helper regulations was retained in the bill, as Congress had sought to modify the Davis-Bacon Act through various means over the years. The DeLay amendment, seeking to remove helper funding restraint, was defeated by a voice vote. Efforts to modify the Davis-Bacon Act through amendments and repeal continued in Congress, with bills introduced in both the Senate and House for repeal. During a hearing, the Committee voted along party lines to report a measure for the repeal of the Davis-Bacon and Copeland Acts. In the House, Representative Ballenger introduced H.R. 500 for the same purpose, which was referred to the Subcommittee on Workforce Protections. The Subcommittee, chaired by Representative Ballenger, voted along party lines to report the measure to the full Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities. Additional repeal legislation was introduced as S. 1183 (Hatfield) and H.R. 2472 (Weldon), seen as a compromise to reform rather than repeal the Davis-Bacon Act. Representative Weldon argued against repeal, stating it would harm skilled construction workers and their families. The Hatfield and Weldon bills proposed comprehensive revisions to the Davis-Bacon Act, including provisions for helpers. The Hatfield and Weldon bills proposed revisions to the Davis-Bacon Act, including provisions for helpers. The bills aimed to reform rather than repeal the Act, with Representative Weldon arguing against repeal due to potential harm to skilled construction workers and their families. However, technical issues regarding helper classifications and compensation rates remained unresolved in the proposed legislation. The Hatfield and Weldon bills aimed to reform the Davis-Bacon Act, including provisions for helpers, but technical issues regarding helper classifications and compensation rates remained unresolved. The Department suspended the helper regulation in November 1993, and there was no spending prohibition for fiscal 1997. In June 1996, enforcement of the revised helper regulations was no longer obstructed by statutory obstacles. The Department suspended the helper regulation in November 1993, and there was no spending prohibition for fiscal 1997. In June 1996, the Associated Builders and Contractors (ABC) sued to enforce the regulations, citing a cost of over $500 million per year to taxpayers. The Department quickly responded, with Assistant Secretary of Labor Bernard Anderson stating that the current helper regulation was non-administrable due to unclear distinctions between helpers and other workers. In 1996, Assistant Secretary of Labor Bernard Anderson stated that the current helper regulation was non-administrable due to unclear distinctions between helpers and other workers. The Department had no intention of implementing the regulation in its current form, as detailed in the Federal Register of August 2, 1996. The Department noted that additional information had become available during the suspension of the rule, warranting a review of the suspended regulation. The Department noted that new information had become available during the suspension of the rule, prompting a review of the regulation. Concerns were raised about the potential abuse of the helper classification and its impact on wages and apprenticeship programs. The Department of Labor expressed concerns about the impact of the helper classification on wages and apprenticeship programs, leading to a reexamination of the regulation. The suspension of the rule would continue while the Department engages in substantive rulemaking. Public comments were requested and evaluated during this process. The Department of Labor decided to continue the suspension of the helper rule while engaging in substantive rulemaking. Public comments were solicited and evaluated, with industry and trade union groups providing feedback. The Building and Construction Trades Department agreed with the suspension, while the Associated General Contractors disagreed, arguing for a quicker implementation process. The Department of Labor decided to continue the suspension of the helper rule, despite disagreement from the Associated General Contractors. The Department believes it would take longer than 60 days to fully implement the regulations, citing past experience. The rule would provide a 60-day effective date for compliance, with an additional 30 to 60 days before contracts could be signed. The Department of Labor decided to continue the suspension of the helper rule, citing the need for additional time for implementation. Contracts must be advertised for 30 to 60 days before awarding, with potential delays in conforming changes to regulations and contract forms. Contractors can use helpers if the contract contains a wage determination or if the Department approves adding a helper classification. Wage determination and prevailing practice surveys could further delay the ability to pay workers at helper rates. The Department of Labor decided to continue the suspension of the helper rule due to the need for additional time for implementation. The Department affirmed that it had not decided to repeal the helper regulations and intends to complete a substantive rulemaking action within approximately one year. The comments received did not provide any new information to change the Department's belief in continuing the suspension. The Department of Labor decided to continue the suspension of the helper rule, stating that comments received did not provide new information to change their belief. They affirmed that they had not decided to repeal the helper regulations but would reexamine the basis and effect of the regulations. The Department expressed concerns about the use of helpers, potential abuse of the classification, and the impact of the regulation. The Department of Labor expressed concerns about the use of helpers, potential abuse of the classification, and the impact of the regulation, noting that enforcement may be difficult due to subjective standards. The Department of Labor is concerned about the subjective standard for the helper classification under Davis-Bacon, which may make enforcement more challenging. Critics worry that allowing lower wages for apprentices could discourage contractors from participating in training programs, leading to a shortage of skilled labor and limited opportunities for workers. The Department of Labor is concerned about the impact of the helper classification on apprenticeship programs, as it could lead to a shortage of skilled labor and limited opportunities for workers. Some in the industry view helpers as entry-level workers, providing a pathway for gaining experience and skills. However, there are divergent opinions on the helper/apprentice relationship, prompting the need for further rulemaking to clarify its understanding. The Department of Labor suspended the helper regulation due to divergent opinions on the helper/apprentice relationship, prompting the need for further rulemaking. The U.S. District Court ruled in favor of the Department's indefinite suspension of the regulations in 1997. Judge Stanley Sporkin acknowledged the Department's \"good cause\" for the suspension in 1993, given the Congress's prohibition on expenditure for implementation. Judge Stanley Sporkin upheld the Department of Labor's indefinite suspension of helper regulations, stating that the Department had \"good cause\" for the suspension in 1993 due to a congressional spending ban. He argued that the Department was not obligated to implement the regulations once the ban expired in 1996, allowing them to review and update the regulations as needed. Judge Sporkin upheld the Department of Labor's suspension of helper regulations, citing new data collected during the two-and-a-half year period between the suspension and the expiration of the congressional ban. The Department argued that the new information undermined the basis of the revised regulations, allowing them the discretion to review and update the regulations as needed. Judge Sporkin supported the Department of Labor's decision to suspend helper regulations due to new data undermining the basis of the revised regulations. He noted that the plaintiffs focused on the substance of the regulations rather than procedural issues, offering little evidence of arbitrary delays by the Department. Judge Sporkin ruled in favor of the Department of Labor, suspending the helper regulations indefinitely. The court found that the Department's rationale for the regulations was reasonable, and recent data called into question the cost-saving claims. A new proposed rule on the use of helpers on Davis-Bacon projects was published in the Federal Register on April 9, 1999. Judge Sporkin ruled in favor of the Department of Labor, suspending the helper regulations indefinitely. A new proposed rule on the use of helpers on Davis-Bacon projects was published in the Federal Register on April 9, 1999, affirming the re-institution of the longstanding policy on the helper issue. The Department of Labor's findings under the Clinton Administration differed from those of the Reagan and Bush Administrations regarding helper proposals, with conclusions that the suspended rule may not be effectively enforced, the use of helpers in the private sector is not as widespread as assumed, and full implementation could negatively impact apprenticeship and training opportunities. The Department of Labor found that the use of helpers in the private sector is not as widespread as assumed and that the suspended rule could have a negative impact on apprenticeship and training. The agency concluded that the rule posed significant administrative difficulties and cannot be effectively enforced. The definition of \"helper\" in the earlier rule was criticized as internally inconsistent and not distinguishable from that of a general laborer. Wage and Hour struggled with developing enforcement guidelines based on tasks performed by each job classification. The Department of Labor found that the definition of \"helper\" in the earlier rule was criticized as internally inconsistent and not distinguishable from that of a general laborer. Wage and Hour struggled with developing enforcement guidelines based on tasks performed by each job classification, including the distinction between semi-skilled and skilled workers. The Department of Labor analyzed the provisions of a suspended rule regarding the distinction between semi-skilled helpers and other workers on a worksite. They argued that the rule lacked practical standards for differentiation and provided little guidance. The overlap in duties between helpers and laborers made it difficult to classify them accurately, increasing the risk of misclassification. The term \"helper\" was found to have multiple, varied meanings. The Department of Labor found that the suspended rule lacked practical standards for differentiating between semi-skilled helpers and other workers due to significant overlap in duties, making accurate classification challenging. The term \"helper\" was noted to have multiple meanings within the construction industry, leading to difficulties in conducting wage determinations. The Department concluded that the assumption of widespread use of helpers was in error or overstated. The Department of Labor found that the assumption of widespread use of helpers in the construction industry was incorrect. Survey data showed that the use of helpers was substantially lower than previously thought. The Department emphasized the importance of formal apprenticeship training programs in producing skilled and productive workers, with a focus on encouraging training for unskilled and semi-skilled workers, including women and minorities. The Department of Labor emphasized the importance of formal apprenticeship training programs in producing skilled and productive workers, with a focus on encouraging training for unskilled and semi-skilled workers, including women and minorities. The proposed new helper rule aimed to prevent contractors from using helpers instead of apprentices and trainees in formal programs. The comment period for the new rule lasted until June 8, 1999, with no set target date for publication of a final rule. Late in the 105th Congress, Representative Norwood introduced legislation related to this issue. The proposed new helper rule, with a comment period until June 8, 1999, aimed to establish helpers as a separate classification under the Davis-Bacon Act. Representative Norwood introduced legislation in both the 105th and 106th Congress to define helpers as semi-skilled workers assisting journeyman mechanics. The bill introduced in March 1999 aimed to establish helpers as a separate classification under the Davis-Bacon Act. The Department of Labor issued a final rule on the use of helpers on Davis-Bacon projects in November 2000. The Department of Labor issued a final rule in November 2000 regarding the use of helpers on Davis-Bacon projects. The regulation, effective from January 19, 2001, amended the regulations to recognize helpers as a separate category of workers. The Department concluded that the proposed legislation was imprecise and would result in significant administrative burdens. The BCTD of the AFL-CIO agreed with the Department's approach, while industry spokespersons disagreed. The Department of Labor concluded that the proposed regulations on helpers would be difficult to administer and enforce due to the duties-based approach. Industry spokespersons disagreed, suggesting that helper classes could be identified through area practice surveys. The Department stated that helpers performing duties of other classifications without limitations would make it challenging to identify their work for enforcement and wage determination. The Department of Labor suspended a rule that allowed helpers to perform duties of other classifications without limitations, making it difficult to identify their work for enforcement and wage determination. This decision was made to prevent helpers from overlapping with other classifications and undermining the prevailing wage structure. The Department acknowledged the challenges in defining helper roles and distinguishing between semi-skilled and skilled work in today's construction market. The Department of Labor suspended a rule due to difficulties in defining helper roles and distinguishing between semi-skilled and skilled work in the construction market. The Department expressed concerns about the ambiguity and challenges in evaluating supervision on worksites, as well as the definitional ambiguities of the suspended rule. The Department of Labor suspended a rule due to difficulties in defining helper roles and distinguishing between semi-skilled and skilled work in the construction market. Concerns were raised about the ambiguity and challenges in evaluating supervision on worksites, as well as the definitional ambiguities of the suspended rule. The impact of the suspended rule on wage determination processes was highlighted, with the Department emphasizing the importance of protecting prevailing wages and not securing the cheapest possible labor. The Department of Labor found that the use of helpers in construction was less prevalent than previously thought, with only 3.9% of classifications showing the use of helpers. This contradicted earlier projections and highlighted the importance of protecting prevailing wages in the industry. The Department of Labor found that the use of helpers in construction was not as widespread as previously assumed, with only 3.9% of classifications showing their use. This could have a negative impact on formal apprenticeship and training programs in the industry if low-wage helpers were substituted for skilled workers. The Department of Labor found that the suspended helper rule could have a negative impact on formal apprenticeship and training programs in the construction industry. Building trades unions argued that allowing contractors to use low-wage helpers instead of apprentices would undermine the apprentice training program and lead to a shortage of skilled craft workers. Employers disputed this claim, stating that the rule did not discourage formal craft training. The Department of Labor and building trades unions expressed concern that the suspended helper rule would undermine formal apprenticeship programs in the construction industry. Employers disputed this, stating that the rule did not discourage formal craft training. The Department emphasized the importance of structured training programs over informal on-the-job training alone. The Department of Labor restored the definition of \"helper\" to its original meaning after concerns that the suspended rule would undermine formal apprenticeship programs in the construction industry. The final rule now requires a distinct classification of \"helper\" in wage determinations for Davis-Bacon projects, with clear duties, established prevailing practice, and not employed as a trainee in an informal program. The Davis-Bacon and Related Acts cover helpers with clearly defined duties, prevailing practice, and not as trainees. Legislation addressing helper issues was introduced in Congress in the early 2000s, but no action was taken. In 2001, Representative Norwood introduced the \"Helpers Job Opportunity Act\" (H.R. 1972) addressing helper classification for Davis-Bacon purposes. In 2003, Representative Blackburn reintroduced the bill as H.R. 2283, defining a helper as a semi-skilled worker assisting a journeyman. The bill was referred to the Committee on Education and the Workforce. The \"Helpers Job Opportunities Act\" (H.R. 3907) introduced by Representative Blackburn and Representative Norwood in 2005 addressed helper classification for Davis-Bacon purposes. The bill defined a helper as a semi-skilled worker assisting a journeyman. It was referred to the Committee on Education and the Workforce but no action was taken on the proposal. The Davis-Bacon Act has been a focus of public policy debate since the 1960s, with reviews in the 1970s and changes to prevailing wage in 1964. Carter Administration's regulations in the late 1970s were withdrawn in 1981, leading to new proposals that faced litigation. Congress intervened in 1992 regarding helper classification. In 1981, new regulations were proposed to address the issue of helpers under the Davis-Bacon Act. Litigation ensued, and portions of the proposed rule were approved by the court over the years. However, the helper provision only gained approval in 1992, a decade after it was first proposed. Congress intervened in 1996, blocking enforcement of the regulation until mid-1996. The Department of Labor (DOL) eventually declared the regulation \"non-administrable\" and suspended it for further review in December 1996. This action reverted DOL back to the status quo of the late 1970s. In December 1996, the Department of Labor suspended the implementation of the helper regulation, reverting back to the late 1970s. New evidence prompted a reassessment of the regulation, leading to a new proposed rule in April 1999. The final helper rule was published on November 20, 2000, taking effect on January 19, 2001. The Department of Labor published its final helper rule on November 20, 2000, which took effect on January 19, 2001, after a lengthy process spanning over two decades. The new rule reverted to the longstanding practice from the 1970s regarding the wage treatment of helpers on Davis-Bacon projects, repudiating the policies of the 1980s and 1990s. Congress had also been involved in the debate surrounding the \"helper\" issue. The Department of Labor reverted to its 1970s practice regarding helpers on Davis-Bacon projects with a final rule in November 2000. Congress debated the \"helper\" issue, with legislation introduced in the 109th Congress but not reemerging in the 110th Congress."
