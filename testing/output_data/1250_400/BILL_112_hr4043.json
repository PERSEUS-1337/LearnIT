    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Military Readiness and Southern Sea Otter Conservation Act\" and pertains to the Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness and Conservation Act. The Congress finds that the United States Fish and Wildlife Service has developed a relocation and management plan for southern sea otters. National defense activities at San Nicolas Island have not adversely affected sea otters, but further expansion into the designated management zone may impact national security. Military training programs need flexibility due to evolving real-world events. The Sikes Act Compliant Integrated Natural Resources Management Plans in California address the needs of threatened species and provide conservation benefits. Public Law 99-625 allows for the designation of otters as a nonessential experimental population to meet military readiness requirements. The purpose is to enhance conservation of the southern sea otter. The Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas are designated to enhance conservation of the southern sea otter while allowing for military readiness activities. The Secretary of Defense is required to establish these areas for national defense purposes, including Naval Base Ventura County San Nicolas Island and Begg Rock. The Secretary of Defense is mandated to establish Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas for national defense purposes, including specific coordinates and areas around Naval Base Ventura County San Nicolas Island, Begg Rock, Naval Base Coronado San Clemente Island, and Marine Corps Base Camp. The Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas include specific coordinates around Naval Base Coronado San Clemente Island and Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, where incidental takings of southern sea otters are permitted for national defense purposes. The Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas allow for incidental takings of southern sea otters during military activities, exempting them from certain environmental protection laws. The Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas exempt southern sea otters from certain environmental protection laws, treating them as endangered species for conservation purposes. The Secretary of the Interior can revise or terminate these exceptions if military activities hinder otter conservation. Monitoring is also required. The Secretary of the Interior can revise or terminate the exemption of southern sea otters from environmental laws if military activities impede conservation efforts. The Secretary of the Navy is responsible for monitoring the otter population every three years and reporting to Congress. This section does not override other federal laws, except for specific provisions. Ecosystem management is also addressed. The Secretary of the Interior can revise or terminate the exemption of southern sea otters from environmental laws if military activities impede conservation efforts. The Secretary of the Navy is responsible for monitoring the otter population every three years and reporting to Congress. This section does not override other federal laws, except for specific provisions. Ecosystem management is addressed through the development of an ecosystem management plan for waters off the coast of California to ensure the recovery of the southern sea otter, black abalone, white abalone, and the commercial harvest of shellfish fisheries at current levels. The Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service will assess the carrying capacity of southern sea otter habitat, including impacts of water quality and causes of degradation. The existing relocation and management plan for southern sea otters will continue until the required management plan and assessment are completed. The management plan and assessment for southern sea otters will continue until completed. Definitions include incidental taking, optimum sustainable population, southern sea otter, and take under the Endangered Species Act. The term 'southern sea otter' refers to Enhydra lutris nereis. 'Take' is defined under the Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act. 'Military readiness activity' is defined in the Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003. The Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003 defines 'military readiness activity' as all training and operations related to combat, including testing military equipment for combat use. Establishment of the Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas."
