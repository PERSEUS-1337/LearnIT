The \"Microcredit for Self-Sufficiency Act of 1998\" highlights findings on severe poverty in the developing world, child mortality rates, malnutrition, and the challenges faced by women in poverty. It emphasizes the positive impact of aiding the poorest, especially women, on family well-being and education. Women in poverty often lack stable employment and turn to self-employment for livelihood. The poor in the developing world, especially women, lack stable employment and social safety nets, leading many to turn to self-employment. These entrepreneurs struggle to access credit at reasonable rates, often resorting to high-interest money lenders. An international Microcredit Summit aimed to expand access to credit for self-employment to 100 million of the world's poorest families, particularly women, by 2005. The Microcredit Summit aimed to provide access to credit for self-employment and financial services to 100 million of the world's poorest families, especially women, by 2005. This initiative would benefit nearly half of the world's absolute poor by allowing them to expand their incomes and businesses through loans at reasonable interest rates. NGOs like Grameen Bank and Accion International have successfully lent to the very poor, with repayment rates averaging 95% or higher. Microcredit institutions play a crucial role in reducing poverty. Bank, Accion International, and FINCA have successfully lent to the very poor with repayment rates of 95% or higher. Microcredit institutions reduce poverty and dependency on foreign assistance by leveraging resources through recycled loans. Sustainable microcredit institutions are crucial for global poverty reduction and economic development. AID launched a Microenterprise Initiative in 1994 to expand funding for these institutions. In 1994, AID launched a Microenterprise Initiative to expand funding for microcredit institutions providing credit to the poorest. Funding reached $137,000,000 in fiscal year 1994, with a goal to support programs with loans under $300 by fiscal year 1996. However, funding decreased to $111,000,000 in 1996, with only 39% benefiting the poorest. Increased investment in microcredit institutions is crucial for achieving poverty reduction goals. AID's funding for microenterprise activities should be expanded to $160,000,000 for fiscal year. Increased investment in microcredit institutions serving the poorest is critical to achieving the Microcredit Summit's goal. AID's funding for microenterprise activities in the developing world should be expanded to $160,000,000 for fiscal year 1999 to parallel the growing capacity of microcredit institutions. Providing the United States share of the global investment needed to achieve the goal of the Microcredit Summit will require only a modest increase in United States funding for international microcredit programs, with an increased focus on institutions serving the poorest. To reach tens of millions of the poorest with microcredit, it is crucial to expand and replicate successful microcredit institutions. Microcredit institutions need assistance in developing their institutional capacity to expand their services and tap commercial sources of capital. PVOs and other nongovernmental organizations have a role to play in this effort. To expand microcredit services for the very poor, successful institutions need assistance in developing their capacity and accessing capital. PVOs and NGOs have shown competence in creating networks of local microcredit institutions. AID should prioritize investing in these organizations to create a global infrastructure for financial services for the world's poorest families. AID aims to expand successful microcredit institutions globally to provide financial services to the poorest families. This Act focuses on developing microcredit institutions, making microenterprise the core of AID's economic growth strategy, and supporting PVOs and NGOs in offering credit, savings, and training services to microentrepreneurs. The Act aims to make microenterprise development the focus of AID's economic growth strategy, support PVOs and NGOs in providing financial services to microentrepreneurs, and increase assistance for access to credit for the poorest, especially women in developing countries.
