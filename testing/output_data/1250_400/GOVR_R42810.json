    "content": "The Honoring America's Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act of 2012 (H.R. 1627, P.L. 112-154) is an omnibus bill impacting various veterans programs. It reflects a compromise agreement by the House and Senate Committees on Veterans Affairs on multiple provisions. The Department of Veterans Affairs operates the nation's largest integrated health care system for veterans. Eligibility for VA medical care is based on factors like veteran status, disabilities, income, and exposures. The VA, through the VHA, operates the largest integrated health care system for veterans. Eligibility for VA medical care is based on factors like veteran status, disabilities, income, and exposures. Congress has passed legislation providing special treatment authority for certain groups of veterans, such as those exposed to Agent Orange and ionizing radiation. In 1993, Congress passed P.L. 103-210 to provide health care for Persian Gulf War veterans possibly related to exposure to toxic substances. P.L. 112-154 addressed chemical exposure at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, providing eligibility for VA health care services for certain veterans stationed there from 1957 to 1987 when the well water was contaminated. VA health care services are provided to certain veterans and their eligible family members who were stationed at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, from 1957 to 1987 when the well water was contaminated. Eligible veterans can receive medical care for fifteen specified illnesses or conditions, with the VA being the final payer for eligible family members. The State Veterans' Home program is a federal-state partnership for building nursing home facilities. The VA is the final payer for eligible family members of veterans stationed at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina from 1957 to 1987. The State Veterans' Home program is a federal-state partnership for building nursing home facilities, with the VA providing grants and per diem for care. State laws govern admission criteria for State Veterans' Homes. VA pays full cost of care for veterans with 70% or more service-connected disability or related nursing home care in specific facilities. The Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-461) equalized the cost of nursing home care for veterans with a 70% or more service-connected disability, regardless of the care setting. This act also allowed for higher per diem rates for State Veterans Homes caring for these veterans, but these homes were not eligible for funding from other federal sources like Medicare or Medicaid. However, some state veterans' nursing homes reported receiving smaller reimbursements after the new reimbursement methodology was implemented. The Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-461) equalized nursing home care costs for veterans with a 70% or more service-connected disability. State Veterans Homes received higher per diem rates but were not eligible for Medicare or Medicaid funding. Some homes reported smaller reimbursements post-implementation. P.L. 112-154 requires VA contracts with SVHs for nursing home care for veterans with service-connected conditions. GAO found 300 sexual assault incidents reported to VA police from 2007 to 2010. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found 300 sexual assault incidents reported to VA police from 2007 to 2010, including various types of assaults. P.L. 112-154 requires VA to establish a policy for reporting and tracking sexual assault incidents at medical facilities, with regular reporting requirements. The VA is required to establish a policy for reporting and tracking incidents at medical facilities, including sexual assaults. The policy must be reported 60 days after implementation and annually thereafter. The VA must consider the effects on veterans' mental health and substance abuse treatments in developing the policy. Additionally, the VA must submit an interim report to Congress on the progress of developing the policy within 30 days of enactment. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant issue due to blast injuries from operations like OEF/OIF. Three factors contribute to the increase in TBI: blast injuries from explosives, improved survival rates due to better medical care, and increased awareness leading to more accurate diagnoses. The total number of veterans with TBI is unknown, and concerns have been raised about limited rehabilitative care provided by the VA. The VA is required to provide rehabilitative care to veterans with TBI to maximize independence and improve behavioral and mental health functioning. Telemedicine and telehealth are used for medical purposes when distance separates participants. Telehealth and telemedicine utilize communication technologies for medical purposes when distance separates participants. Telehealth encompasses long-distance clinical health care, patient education, and health administration, while telemental health refers to behavioral health services provided through communication technology. Telemental health services, including clinical assessment, psychotherapy, and cognitive testing, are delivered remotely using communication technology. The Department of Defense refers to this as telebehavioral health, while the VA has been a leader in telehealth since 1977. Telehealth is commonly used to provide care to veterans in rural areas, offering cost-effective alternatives to in-person treatment. VA is required to implement a teleconsultation program for remote mental health and TBI care. VA hospitals may find it challenging to provide in-person treatment, leading to the adoption of telehealth services. Research has shown that telehealth offers numerous benefits and can be a cost-effective method of care delivery within the VA health care system. Section 108 of P.L. 112-154 mandates VA to implement a teleconsultation program for remote mental health and TBI assessments in facilities lacking the capability without contract or fee-basis care. Additionally, VA must provide telemedicine training to medical residents in facilities utilizing telemedicine. Veterans enrolled in the VA health care system do not pay copayments for service-connected conditions or illnesses, with those rated at 50% or more disabled exempt from copayments for any condition. Outpatient services like VA health fairs are also copayment-free for veterans. Veterans with service-connected conditions rated at 50% or more disabled are not charged copayments for any treatment, including for nonservice-connected conditions. Outpatient services like health fairs, screenings, counseling, and hospice care are also copayment-free. Veterans without service-connected conditions or receiving care for nonservice-connected conditions generally pay $15 for primary care visits and $50 for specialty care visits. Only one outpatient copayment is charged per day, with telehealth services exempt from copayments under Section 103 of P.L. 112-154. The Department of Veterans Affairs provides service dogs to veterans with hearing or mobility impairments under P.L. 107-135. Additionally, P.L. 111-117 allows service dogs for mental illnesses like PTSD, and P.L. 111-84 authorizes research on using service dogs for veterans with injuries or disabilities, including PTSD. Service dogs trained by accredited entities may access VA facilities under P.L. 112-154. The VA was authorized to conduct a three-year research study on using service dogs to treat veterans with injuries or disabilities, including PTSD. Service dogs trained by accredited entities may access VA facilities. The Office of Rural Health was established in 2006 to assist with data collection on rural veterans and reduce disparities in service. Veterans Rural Health Resource Centers were opened in FY2009 to develop special practices for facilities nationwide. The VA opened three Veterans Rural Health Resource Centers in FY2009 to develop special practices for rural veterans. These Centers serve as field-based clinical laboratories experimenting with new outreach and care models. They are required to improve understanding of challenges faced by rural veterans, identify disparities in healthcare availability, formulate programs to enhance healthcare delivery, and develop special practices for the benefit of rural veterans. The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (P.L. 99-272) gave the VHA authority to bill veterans and insurers for nonservice-connected care to help with medical service costs. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33) allowed the VHA to retain these funds in the VA's Medical Care Collections Fund for providing medical services to veterans. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33) allowed the VA to retain third-party payments in the Medical Care Collections Fund for providing medical services to veterans without fiscal year limitations. This change in billing from \"reasonable costs\" to \"reasonable charges\" was intended to increase collections. In FY2004, there was a recommendation to consolidate various medical collections accounts into the MCCF. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2004 recommended consolidating various medical collections accounts into the MCCF, allowing funds to be deposited for medical services for veterans without fiscal year limitations. The VA was granted permanent authority to deposit funds from specific accounts into the MCCF by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005. Additionally, the VA was required by P.L. 112-154 to develop a plan to identify and collect billable third-party revenue for deposit into the MCCF. The VA was required by P.L. 112-154 to develop a plan to identify and collect billable third-party revenue for deposit into the MCCF, including effective processes, policies, training, revenue goals, and monitoring systems. Additionally, a three-year initiative was mandated to assess the feasibility of treating Vet Centers as VA facilities for beneficiary travel reimbursement in highly rural areas. The VA is required to assess the feasibility of treating Vet Centers as VA facilities for beneficiary travel reimbursement in highly rural areas. This reimbursement authority will be valid for three years and limited to veterans living in highly rural areas traveling to and from their nearest Vet Centers. The VA Secretary must report to Congress within 180 days of enactment on the initiative's beneficiaries and analysis. VA currently provides eligible veterans mileage reimbursement, special mode transport, and common carrier transport for healthcare travel. Pre-authorization is required for ambulance and common carrier expenses, except in medical emergencies. In FY2012, VA proposed using Medicare rates to reimburse ambulance providers for cost savings. The Vow to Hire Heroes Act allowed VA to pay the lesser of the actual amount charged or the Medicare rate for ambulance services. However, the change in law did not have the desired effect as it only applied in situations where VA pays before determining the veteran's eligibility for transport. The Vow to Hire Heroes Act allowed VA to reimburse ambulance providers at the lesser of the actual charge or the local Medicare rate, with exceptions for non-VA emergency care. This change corrected a previous law that only applied when VA paid before determining eligibility for transport. The new reimbursement methodology for ambulance transportation will apply to all situations except for unauthorized non-VA emergency care of nonservice-connected conditions approved for payment. Means testing for veterans seeking care for nonservice-connected conditions is established by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985. P.L. 112-154 authorizes the VA to use the veteran's household income to determine eligibility for VA health care and makes changes to the Specially Adapted Housing Program for veterans with service-connected disabilities. P.L. 112-154 makes changes to the VA's Specially Adapted Housing Program, providing grants for veterans with certain disabilities to purchase or remodel homes. There are two grant programs within the SAH Program, one for mobility impairments and one for blindness or loss of hand use. The dollar limit for mobility grants is higher, and both types are available for severe burn injuries. Section 202 of P.L. 112-154 expands qualifying disabilities for mobility grants. Section 202 of P.L. 112-154 expands qualifying disabilities for \u00a72101(a) grants to cover veterans or servicemembers who have lost use of one or more lower extremities, affecting balance and propulsion, requiring aids for ambulating. Section 203 changes the blindness measure for \u00a72101(b) grants. Section 204 increases the maximum assistance amount for \u00a72101(a) grants to $63,780. The VA visual impairment standard for disability compensation has been changed to 20/200 vision in the better eye with the use of a corrective lens. The maximum assistance amount for grants has been increased to $63,780 for \u00a72101(a) grants and $12,756 for \u00a72101(b) grants. The VA Secretary is required to annually adjust the award limits based on a cost-of-construction index. A provision in the law allows veterans to use grants to modify the homes of family members temporarily, known as the Temporary Residence Adaptation (TRA) grant. The SAH law, under P.L. 112-154, increased the maximum TRA grants for veterans to modify family members' homes temporarily. The maximum grants were raised to $28,000 for \u00a72101(a) and $5,000 for \u00a72101(b), with adjustments based on a cost-of-construction index. The authority for TRA grants was extended to December 31, 2022, and an exception was created to grant funding limits for previously-adapted homes. The SAH law under P.L. 112-154 increased TRA grants for veterans to modify family members' homes temporarily, with maximum grants raised to $28,000 for \u00a72101(a) and $5,000 for \u00a72101(b). An exception was created for grant funding limits for previously-adapted homes damaged in disasters, allowing assistance for acquiring another suitable home without counting towards the veteran's maximum benefit. The VA Loan Guaranty Program provides mortgage insurance for eligible veterans entering into mortgages with private lenders. The VA guarantees to pay lenders a portion of losses in case of borrower default. Veterans pay a one-time fee based on factors like down payment amount and military service. Fees may be waived for veterans with service-connected disabilities or certain surviving spouses. The VA Loan Guaranty Program provides mortgage insurance for eligible veterans, including surviving spouses of veterans who die while receiving compensation for a service-connected disability. Fees may be waived for veterans with disabilities, and certain duration requirements must be met for eligibility. The VA Loan Guaranty Program provides mortgage insurance for eligible veterans and surviving spouses of veterans with disabilities. Amendments to the program include waiving fees for qualifying surviving spouses and allowing dependent children of veterans on active duty to satisfy occupancy requirements. Additionally, programs for guaranteeing adjustable rate mortgages have been made permanent. The VA Loan Guaranty Program amendments include waiving fees for qualifying surviving spouses and allowing dependent children of veterans on active duty to satisfy occupancy requirements. Sections 208 and 209 of P.L. 112-154 make adjustable rate and hybrid adjustable rate mortgages permanent. Section 210 modifies when veterans with service-connected disabilities may have the loan guaranty fee waived. Section 702 addresses guaranteed loan fees, maximum guaranty amount, and loan sales securities. Section 702 of P.L. 112-154 addresses guaranteed loan fees, maximum guaranty amount, and loan sales securities. It extends current loan fees until October 1, 2017, reinstates higher maximum loan guaranty amounts for housing in high-cost areas, and temporarily increases the maximum guaranty amount. The Freddie Mac statute sets the conforming loan limit at $417,000 for single-family homes, with a maximum guaranty amount of 25% of the loan. In high-cost areas, the loan limit can be as high as 175% of $625,500, or $1,094,625. The VA's authority to bundle and sell vendee loans has been extended. The VA's authority to bundle and sell vendee loans has been extended through December 31, 2016. Prior to this extension, the VA used the Enhanced Use Lease (EUL) process to lease unused VA property for various purposes, including providing housing for homeless veterans. The VA's Enhanced Use Lease (EUL) program previously allowed for various uses of VA properties, including housing for homeless veterans. However, a change in legislation now restricts EUL properties to be used solely for \"supportive housing\" for homeless or at-risk veterans and their families. Existing leases before January 1, 2012, are not affected by this change. The VA's Enhanced Use Lease (EUL) program now limits properties to supportive housing for homeless or at-risk veterans and families. Qualifying housing types include transitional, permanent, SRO, congregate, independent, or assisted living. Leases before January 1, 2012, are not affected. The Grant and Per Diem program authorizes grants for transitional housing and services for homeless veterans. The Grant and Per Diem program provides capital grants for facilities to serve as service centers or transitional housing for homeless veterans. Grantees are reimbursed for housing and supportive services costs at the current per diem rate of $38.90 per day. Funding can also be used for construction, acquisition, and rehabilitation of properties, and can be combined with Low Income Housing Tax Credits. Private nonprofit organizations can receive funds from other sources as long as they operate the project. Section 301 of P.L. 112-154 allows grantees to use Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTCs) along with VA Grant and Per Diem funding. The law specifies that funds can be received from other public and private sources, as long as the project is operated by a private nonprofit organization. The definition of private nonprofit organization is expanded to include for-profit limited partnerships or limited liability companies with a nonprofit organization as the sole general partner or manager, similar to LIHTC-financed developments. Section 305 authorizes the VA Grant and Per Diem program at $250 million for FY2013 and $150 million for subsequent fiscal years. The program targets homeless veterans with special needs and has been expanded to include male veterans with dependent children. In 2001, Congress created the Grant and Per Diem program to assist homeless veterans with special needs. Section 303 of P.L. 112-154 expands eligibility for the program to include male veterans with dependent children, eliminates certain requirements for grantees, allows funds to be used for services to dependents of homeless veterans, and extends the authorization level for the Special Needs grant. The Health Care for Homeless Veterans program provides outreach, care, and treatment for medical, psychiatric, and substance use disorders for homeless veterans. Section 302 of P.L. 112-154 makes homeless veterans eligible for the HCHV program. The HCHV program provides care and treatment for medical, psychiatric, and substance use disorders for homeless veterans. Section 302 of P.L. 112-154 expanded eligibility to include homeless veterans, regardless of mental illness. HUD-VASH is a collaborative program between the VA and HUD to provide housing vouchers and clinical services. Section 304 of P.L. 112-154 allows the VA to contract with other entities to help veterans find housing and connect them with services. The VA can enter contracts with outside entities to assist homeless veterans in finding housing and accessing services. This is done when there is a shortage of affordable housing, a veteran needs more help than the VA can provide, or if the veteran does not live near a VA facility. Additionally, the HVRP and SSVF programs, which help homeless veterans find employment and provide support for very low-income veterans and their families, have been extended through FY2013. The HVRP program helps homeless veterans find employment, extended through FY2013 at $50 million per year. The SSVF program assists low-income veterans and families transitioning from homelessness, authorized for FY2013 at $300 million. The DEA program provides educational assistance to dependents of disabled or deceased servicemembers, with an amendment allowing up to 81 months of entitlement for eligible individuals. The Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) provides educational assistance to eligible servicemembers and veterans who served on active duty after September 10, 2001, and their eligible family members. Section 401 of P.L. 112-154 allows DEA-eligible individuals to combine benefit programs for up to 81 months of entitlement. Section 402 of P.L. 112-154 requires reports to Congress on the Post-9/11 GI Bill and DEA annually until January 1, 2021. Section 402 of P.L. 112-154 mandates annual reports to Congress on the Post-9/11 GI Bill and DEA, starting from November 13, 2013, through January 1, 2021. The reports must cover various aspects such as the impact of benefit levels on recruitment and retention in the Armed Forces, cost coverage for education, necessity of benefits for recruitment, efforts to inform Armed Forces members of eligibility requirements, program expenditures, student outcomes, and recommendations for administrative and legislative changes. This section also repeals the requirement for biennial reports on the MGIB-AD. Section 402 of P.L. 112-154 mandates annual reports to Congress on the Post-9/11 GI Bill and DEA, covering aspects such as impact on recruitment, program expenditures, student outcomes, and recommendations for changes. It also repeals the requirement for biennial reports on the MGIB-AD. Additionally, under Section 501, the process for submitting additional evidence for benefits claims is streamlined to avoid delays in appeals. Under Section 501 of P.L. 112-154, the local VA office's initial review of newly submitted evidence will be automatically waived unless the claimant requests it. If no request is made, the BVA will provide the initial review. Section 502 of P.L. 112-154 allows court-appointed representatives or caregivers to sign applications on behalf of claimants for benefits adjudication. Section 505 of P.L. 112-154 allows the VA to waive its duty to assist requirement when sufficient evidence is already available for maximum benefit award. It also encourages claimants to submit relevant private medical records to prevent unnecessary resource expenditure. Section 507 clarifies that if a veteran receiving benefits dies, the surviving spouse is entitled to the same benefits. The Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA; P.L. 106-475) requires the VA to notify claimants of evidence needed for their claims and how the VA can assist in gathering it. This notice is provided after a claim is filed and includes information on disability compensation and how ratings are determined. The VCAA notice, required by the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000, provides information on disability compensation and how ratings are determined. Section 504 of P.L. 112-154 allows for more flexibility in sending the notice, including printing it on claims forms, using electronic communications, and waiving notification requirements in certain cases. The VA has developed the Fully Developed Claim (FDC) process to expedite disability claims, allowing for notification flexibility and waiving requirements when granting the highest evaluation. Veterans can establish an effective date for their claim up to one year before submitting the application under the FDC process. The FDC process allows veterans to establish an effective date for their disability claim up to one year before submitting the application. This change is only available for original claims received before August 7, 2015. Additionally, a joint application form for VA survivor benefits and Social Security allows applicants to apply for benefits with both agencies. The Improved Disability Pension program provides monthly cash benefits to low-income elderly or disabled veterans with active military service during a period of war. Section 508 of P.L. 112-154 increases the maximum annual benefit for married couples who are both veterans and require regular aid and attendance. The maximum annual benefit is raised from $30,480 to $32,433. Income received by the veteran or surviving spouse reduces the maximum cash benefit amount for both the Improved Disability Pension and the Improved Death Pension. Reimbursements for casualty are excluded when calculating income for benefit purposes. The maximum annual benefit for the Improved Disability Pension program is increased to $32,433 for married couples who require regular aid and attendance. Income received by the veteran or surviving spouse reduces the cash benefit amount. Reimbursements for casualty losses are excluded when calculating income for benefit purposes. Additionally, disabled veterans and servicemembers may be eligible for financial assistance from the VA to purchase an automobile or adaptive equipment, with the option for assistance to purchase a second automobile if the first one was destroyed due to a natural disaster. The VA Secretary can provide assistance to a veteran for the purchase of a second automobile if the first one was destroyed due to a natural disaster. The VR&E program offers employment-related services for veterans with disabilities and provides independent living services when employment is not feasible. Section 701 of P.L. 112-154 expands provisions of the VR&E program for veterans affected by disasters. Veterans in the program may receive a subsistence allowance during and after completion. Section 701 of P.L. 112-154 expands provisions of the VR&E program for veterans affected by disasters, allowing for an extended subsistence allowance for veterans displaced by natural or other disasters. Additionally, the law waives the annual participation limit for IL services for veterans affected by disasters. Section 601 of P.L. 112-154 increases time, place, and manner restrictions on demonstrations at veterans' funerals, extending the period to 120 minutes before and after the service. Demonstrations are also restricted at Arlington National Cemetery and other VA-controlled cemeteries. Violations of these restrictions can result in statutory damages ranging from $25,000 to $50,000. Section 602 of P.L. 112-154 prohibits the reservation of gravesites at Arlington National Cemetery before an individual's death, with the President having the authority to waive this prohibition. The Secretary of the Army can designate areas and establish monuments or markers at Arlington National Cemetery to honor veterans and servicemembers missing in action. Section 604 of P.L. 112-154 outlines requirements for establishing monuments at the cemetery. The Secretary of the Army can set aside areas in Arlington National Cemetery to honor veterans and servicemembers missing in action. Monuments or markers can be established, with a 25-year waiting period after service ends, unless waived by the Secretary of the Army. Public sources can fund a monument sponsored by a nongovernmental entity after an independent study of other locations. Congressional notification and consultation with relevant committees are required for any proposed monument in Arlington National Cemetery. The Secretary of the Army can designate areas in Arlington National Cemetery for honoring veterans and servicemembers missing in action. Monuments or markers can be established with a 25-year waiting period, unless waived. Congressional notification and consultation with relevant committees are required for any proposed monument. The VA provides a certificate with the President's signature to eligible survivors of deceased veterans discharged under honorable conditions. The eligibility for the Presidential Memorial Certificate has been expanded to include persons who die in active military service. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) provides protections for servicemembers in the event that their military service impedes their ability to meet financial obligations. It suspends civil claims against servicemembers, protects them from default judgments, prohibits eviction, creates a 6% cap on interest on pre-service debts, and safeguards life and health insurance policies. The SCRA includes provisions to protect military members and their dependents from eviction, cap interest on pre-service debts at 6%, safeguard insurance policies, and prevent taxation and forced property sales. Amendments have been made to the SCRA since 2003, with recent changes extending protections related to mortgages and foreclosures until December 31, 2014. Specifically, Section 710 of P.L. 112-154 addresses mortgages and trust deeds for servicemembers unable to make payments due to military service. Section 710 of the SCRA addresses mortgages and trust deeds for servicemembers unable to make payments due to military service. It prevents vendors from taking action to rescind or terminate the contract, foreclose, or seize property until one year after active duty ends. Additionally, the Comptroller General must submit a report to Congress on the protections within 540 days, and the Secretary of the VA must take action within 180 days of enactment. Section 701 of the SCRA requires a report to Congress on protections within 540 days, while Section 703 mandates the VA to report on evaluating and training employees within 180 days. Section 502 grants special authority to the VA for competitions involving small businesses owned by veterans. After additional training and re-evaluation, employees' skills are still unsatisfactory. Section 502 of the Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006 allows the VA to conduct competitions for small businesses owned by veterans and make noncompetitive awards to them. Firms misrepresenting their status for contracting preferences face debarment from government contracts. The VA can debar firms that misrepresent their status as a veteran-owned or service-disabled veteran-owned small business for contracting preferences. Debarments are imposed for punishment and can only occur if status is willfully and intentionally misrepresented. The period of debarment is now set at a minimum of five years, and specific time frames for debarment actions are established. Additionally, principals of debarred firms are also addressed in the process. Section 706 of P.L. 112-154 sets the debarment period at \"not less than five years\" for firms that misrepresent their status, with specific time frames for debarment actions. Principals of debarred firms are also included in the debarment for the same period. Section 707 requires the VA Secretary to report on conferences costing $20,000 or more attended by 50 or more people within 30 days of each fiscal quarter. The VA Secretary must report on conferences costing $20,000 or more attended by 50 or more people within 30 days of each fiscal quarter. Federal contractors with contracts of $100,000 or more must report annually to the Department of Labor on employment of veterans. The DOL Secretary is required to establish a website for public disclosure of this information, and the VA Secretary must establish the VetStar program to recognize businesses' contributions to veterans' employment."
