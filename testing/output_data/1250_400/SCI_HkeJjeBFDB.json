    "content": "Knowledge distillation is a model compression technique where a smaller model mimics a larger pretrained model. To improve the generalization and robustness of compact models, introducing noise at input or supervision levels can be beneficial. Variability through noise can enhance model performance, as seen in experiments like \"Fickle Teacher\" and \"Soft Randomization\". Adding Gaussian noise to the student model's output from the teacher on the original image enhances adversarial robustness significantly. Random label corruption also has a surprising impact on model robustness. The study emphasizes the advantages of incorporating noise in knowledge distillation and encourages further research in this area. Designing Deep Neural Networks for real-world deployment requires consideration of memory, computational requirements, performance, reliability, and security. Compact models that generalize well are essential for resource-constrained devices and applications with strict latency requirements like self-driving cars. It is crucial to evaluate model performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data to ensure reliability under distribution shift. Additionally, models need to be resilient to malicious attacks by adversaries. In the study, knowledge distillation is focused on as an interactive learning method to improve model performance. It involves training a smaller network (student) under the supervision of a larger pre-trained network (teacher). Despite promising gains, there is still a performance gap between the student and teacher models. The importance of model robustness to distribution shift and malicious attacks is highlighted. Hinton et al. (2015) proposed mimicking the softened softmax output of the teacher model to improve the student model's performance. However, there is still a significant performance gap between the two models. Capturing knowledge from the larger network and transferring it to a smaller model remains an open question. Incorporating methods to improve the student model's robustness to perturbations is crucial. Inspiration is drawn from neuroscience on how humans learn, emphasizing the importance of collaboration and neuroplasticity in learning. The importance of collaboration and neuroplasticity in learning is highlighted in neuroscience studies on how humans learn. Cognitive biases and trial-to-trial response variation play a significant role in decision-making and encoding valuable information about stimuli in the brain. Introducing constructive noise in the student-teacher collaborative learning framework may mimic trial-to-trial response variation. Introducing constructive noise in the student-teacher collaborative learning framework can act as a deterrent to cognitive bias and improve learning by mimicking trial-to-trial response variation in humans. This noise can help address memorization and over-generalization in neural networks, ultimately enhancing model generalization and robustness. The study provides a comprehensive analysis on the effects of adding various types of noise in the collaborative learning framework, aiming to inspire further exploration on how noise can benefit learning outcomes. The study explores the effects of noise on model generalization and robustness, introducing novel approaches like \"Fickle Teacher\" and \"Soft Randomization\" to improve student models. Random label corruption is shown to enhance adversarial robustness without significant generalization drop. The presence of noise in the nervous system is also discussed. The method \"Soft Randomization\" introduces random label corruption to improve adversarial robustness without a significant drop in generalization. Various noise techniques have been used historically to enhance generalization in deep neural networks. Noise injection during training and inference has proven effective against adversarial attacks. Randomization techniques, including noise injection during training and inference, have been shown to be effective against adversarial attacks. Randomized smoothing transforms classifiers into smooth classifiers with certifiable robustness guarantees. Label smoothing improves deep neural network performance but may impair knowledge distillation. Combining knowledge distillation with constructive noise could lead to lightweight, well-generalizing models with improved robustness. Empirical analysis was conducted using CIFAR-10 dataset due to its relevance in knowledge distillation. Incorporating constructive noise into a knowledge distillation framework shows promise in creating lightweight, robust models. CIFAR-10 dataset was used for empirical analysis, with experiments conducted on Wide Residual Networks. The Hinton method was employed to train the student model, with parameters set at \u03b1 = 0.9 and \u03c4 = 4. Evaluation of model generalization was done using ImageNet images from the CINIC dataset. In the context of incorporating noise into knowledge distillation, different types of noise are injected into the student-teacher learning framework to analyze their impact on model generalization and robustness. Signal-dependent noise is added to the output logits of the teacher model, with zero-mean Gaussian noise proportional to the output logits for each sample. Incorporating signal-dependent noise in the student-teacher learning framework of knowledge distillation improves generalization and robustness of the model. Adding Gaussian noise proportional to output logits enhances performance on CIFAR-10 test set and slightly increases adversarial and natural robustness. This method contrasts with previous approaches by training the teacher model without noise, resulting in improved distillation effectiveness. Our method improves knowledge distillation by adding noise to the student model's softened logits, inspired by trial-to-trial variability in the brain. We use dropout in the teacher model to introduce variability in the supervision signal, resulting in different output predictions for the same input. This approach contrasts with previous methods that train the teacher model with noise. Our method enhances knowledge distillation by incorporating dropout as a source of uncertainty encoding noise for distilling knowledge to a compact student model. Unlike previous approaches, we use the teacher model's logits with activated dropout to train the student model for more epochs, capturing the teacher's uncertainty directly. This method improves generalization on unseen and out-of-distribution data, as well as robustness to attacks. Performance is compared for dropout rates in the range [0-0.5] at intervals of 0.1. Our method incorporates dropout to enhance knowledge distillation, improving generalization on unseen and out-of-distribution data, as well as robustness to attacks. Performance is compared for dropout rates in the range [0-0.5] at intervals of 0.1. Training the student model with dropout using our scheme significantly improves in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization over the Hinton method. Dropout rates up to 0.2 increase PGD Robustness and natural robustness, suggesting that trial-to-trial variability aids in distilling knowledge to the student model. Adding trial-to-trial variability aids in distilling knowledge to the student model, improving robustness to attacks. Injecting Gaussian noise in the input image enhances adversarial robustness but reduces generalization. A novel method involves training the student model with Gaussian noise from a teacher model trained on clean images. The proposed method minimizes a loss function in the knowledge distillation framework to retain robustness gains while mitigating generalization loss. Our method involves minimizing a loss function in the knowledge distillation framework to increase adversarial robustness and decrease generalization. Training with Gaussian noise levels shows significant improvements in both aspects, outperforming models trained with noise alone. The method also enhances robustness to common corruptions, with notable improvements in noise and blurring resistance. Our method achieves 33.85% adversarial robustness compared to 3.53% for the student model alone, improving robustness to common corruptions. The robustness to noise and blurring corruptions increases significantly with Gaussian noise intensity. Weather corruptions show improved robustness except for fog and frost, while digital corruption except for contrast and saturation also improves. Changes in effect are observed at different intensities, with the method allowing the use of lower noise intensity for increased robustness. A regularization technique based on label noise is proposed to counter over generalization in deep neural networks. A regularization technique based on label noise is proposed to counter over generalization in deep neural networks by randomly changing target labels to incorrect classes during training. This method aims to improve model generalization by discouraging memorization and overconfidence in predictions. Previous studies have focused on improving DNN tolerance to noisy labels, but using random label noise as constructive noise for generalization improvement is a novel approach. The study explores the impact of random label corruption on model generalization, showing that using label corruption during knowledge distillation improves generalization, while training the teacher model with label corruption leads to a drop in generalization. The study shows that using label corruption during knowledge distillation enhances generalization, while training the teacher model with label corruption reduces generalization. Additionally, random label corruption significantly boosts adversarial robustness, with a notable increase in robustness observed with 5% random labels. This phenomenon warrants further investigation. Variability in the knowledge distillation framework through noise at different levels is introduced to mimic trial-to-trial variability in the brain. The study introduces variability in the knowledge distillation framework through noise at different levels to improve generalization and robustness. Fickle teacher and soft randomization techniques significantly enhance in-distribution and out of distribution generalization, as well as adversarial robustness. Random label corruption alone boosts adversarial robustness and generalization, showing promising results for training compact models. Injecting noises to increase trial-to-trial variability in the knowledge distillation framework shows promising results for training compact models with good generalization and robustness. The method involves using the final softmax function with a raised temperature and smooth logits of the teacher model as soft targets for the student model, minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between output probabilities. Domain shift in real-world models can adversely affect generalization performance. Neural networks generalize well when test data matches training data distribution. However, real-world models often face domain shift, impacting generalization. Test set performance alone is not enough to evaluate generalization. Out-of-distribution performance is measured using ImageNet images from CINIC dataset. Deep Neural Networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. The performance of models trained on CIFAR-10 can approximate out-of-distribution performance on ImageNet images. Deep Neural Networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, leading to the need for evaluating and defending against such attacks using methods like Projected Gradient Descent (PGD). In evaluating model robustness against adversarial attacks, the Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attack is used with random noise within an epsilon bound. The model needs to be resilient to both adversarial attacks and naturally occurring perturbations. Deep Neural Networks have been shown to be vulnerable to real-world perturbations. Robustness to adversarial attacks is crucial for security as it involves worst-case distribution shift. Recent studies have highlighted the vulnerability of Deep Neural Networks to real-world perturbations, not just adversarial examples. Researchers have curated sets of naturally occurring examples that significantly degrade classifier accuracy, showing the importance of model robustness to common perturbations. In our study, we use robustness to common corruptions and perturbations as a proxy for natural robustness. It is essential to strike a balance between generalization and adversarial robustness when enhancing model resilience. In the study, researchers emphasize the trade-off between generalization and adversarial robustness in model training. Adversarially trained models may improve robustness to certain perturbations but can degrade performance on naturally occurring perturbations. It is crucial to rigorously test the effects of robustness to norm bounded perturbations on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization. The study highlights the trade-off between generalization and adversarial robustness in model training. Adversarially trained models improve robustness to mid and high frequency perturbations but at the expense of low frequency perturbations. Various studies show a trade-off between adversarial robustness and generalization. Random swapping noise methods are proposed to exploit the uncertainty of the teacher model for a sample, improving in-distribution generalization. Two variants of random swapping are suggested: Swap Top 2 and Swap All. The proposed random swapping methods aim to improve in-distribution generalization by swapping softened softmax logits below a certain threshold. Different training schemes for distillation with dropout are also discussed, with varying dropout rates requiring different numbers of training epochs and learning rate reductions. Training schemes for distillation with dropout involve different numbers of epochs and learning rate reductions based on the dropout rate. Dropout rates of 0.1 and 0.2 require training for 250 epochs with learning rate reductions at 75, 150, and 200 epochs. A dropout rate of 0.3 necessitates training for 300 epochs with reductions at 90, 180, and 240 epochs. Dropout rates of 0.4 and 0.5 lead to training for 350 epochs with reductions at 105, 210, and 280 epochs. Adversarial Robustness techniques involve noise on teacher supervision to improve student accuracy on unseen data but not generalization to out-of-distribution data. The curr_chunk contains various image processing techniques such as elastic transform, JPEG compression, pixelation, saturation, Gaussian noise, impulse noise, shot noise, speckle noise, defocus blur, Gaussian blur, glass blur, motion blur, zoom blur, brightness, fog, frost, snow, spatter, and contrast adjustments."
