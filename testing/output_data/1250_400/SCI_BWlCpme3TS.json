    "content": "We investigate the suitability of self-attention models for character-level neural machine translation, testing a novel transformer variant that outperforms the standard model. Character-level models work directly on raw characters, providing a more compact language representation and mitigating out-of-vocabulary problems. They are especially useful for multilingual translation, allowing multiple languages to be modeled using the same character vocabulary. Self-attention models for character-level translation, including a novel convtransformer variant, have shown success in providing compact language representation and addressing out-of-vocabulary issues. Multilingual training with these models can improve overall performance without increasing complexity or requiring separate models for each language pair. In this study, self-attention models, including a novel convtransformer variant, were evaluated for character-level translation. The models were tested on bilingual and multilingual translation to English using French, Spanish, and Chinese as input languages. Results showed that self-attention models performed well for character-level translation, with the convtransformer outperforming the standard transformer in terms of convergence speed and alignment quality. The study also highlighted the efficiency of self-attention models, requiring up to 60% fewer parameters compared to subword-level models. The convtransformer model excels in character-level translation, surpassing the standard transformer by converging faster and producing more robust alignments. Lee et al. (2017) introduced a recurrent encoder-decoder model for character-level translation, showing promising results in multilingual scenarios. Training on multiple source languages without architectural changes improved performance and acted as a regularizer. Multilingual training of character-level models can improve performance without architectural modifications. It is possible for distant languages to be trained together by mapping them to a common character-level representation. Recent studies have shown that character-level models can outperform subword-level models in processing and segmenting input and output sequences. The transformer model, using self-attention instead of recurrence, has achieved state-of-the-art performance in NLP tasks. The convtransformer is a modification of the standard transformer architecture that aims to investigate character-level bilingual and multilingual translation. It uses self-attention for encoding characters and has shown effectiveness in language modeling tasks. The convtransformer is a modification of the standard transformer architecture for character-level bilingual and multilingual translation. It includes a sub-block with three parallel 1D convolutional layers of different context window sizes. The representations are fused using an additional convolutional layer, maintaining the input dimensionality. Unlike previous methods, the convtransformer does not compress the input character sequence, preserving the resolution for both transformer and convtransformer models. In contrast to previous methods, the convtransformer maintains input resolution by using parallel 1D convolutional layers. Experiments are conducted on WMT15 DE\u2192EN and UN datasets for character-level translation evaluation. The convtransformer model maintains input resolution with parallel 1D convolutional layers. Experiments on WMT15 DE\u2192EN and UN datasets for character-level translation evaluation show that multilingual training corpora are constructed from FR, ES, and ZH parts of the UN dataset. The Chinese dataset is latinized using the Wubi encoding method for consistency in character vocabulary. Testing is done on original UN test sets for each language pair. The Chinese dataset is encoded using the Wubi method for consistency. Experiments involve bilingual and multilingual scenarios with different input languages. Character-level models are compared in terms of BLEU performance, with character-level training being slower than subword-level training. In a study by Lee et al. (2017), character-level transformers show strong performance, outperforming subword-level models with fewer parameters. The convtransformer variant performs similarly to the standard transformer. Multilingual experiments demonstrate that the convtransformer consistently outperforms the transformer, with up to 2.6 BLEU improvement on multilingual translation tasks. The convtransformer outperforms the transformer on multilingual translation tasks, with up to 2.6 BLEU improvement. Training on similar input languages leads to improved performance for both languages. Distant-language training can be effective but is most helpful when the input language is closer to the target translation language. The convtransformer is slower to train but reaches comparable performance in fewer epochs, resulting in an overall training speedup compared to the transformer. The convtransformer, although slower to train than the transformer, reaches comparable performance in fewer epochs, resulting in an overall training speedup. Analysis of learned character alignments shows that bilingual models may have greater flexibility in learning high-quality alignments compared to multilingual models. The convtransformer shows comparable performance to the transformer in fewer epochs, with greater flexibility in learning high-quality alignments for bilingual models compared to multilingual models. The alignments are quantified using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) on encoder-decoder attention matrices, showing a drop in correlation when introducing a distant source language during training. In multilingual training, introducing a distant source language results in a drop in correlation for FR and ES, and an even bigger drop for ZH. The convtransformer is more robust to distant languages than the transformer, performing well on character-level translation with fewer parameters. Training on multiple input languages is effective, especially when source and target languages are similar. Our experiments show that self-attention performs well on character-level translation, competing with subword-level models with fewer parameters. Training on multiple input languages is effective, especially for similar languages. Future work will include analyzing additional languages and improving training efficiency for character-level models. Model outputs and alignments are provided for bilingual and multilingual models trained on UN datasets. The experiments demonstrate that self-attention is effective for character-level translation, competing with subword-level models. Training on multiple input languages is beneficial, particularly for similar languages. The alignments produced by bilingual and multilingual models trained on UN datasets show that convtransformer models have sharper weight distributions and better word alignments compared to transformer models. The convtransformer model shows better word alignments for multilingual translation of distant languages compared to the transformer model.
