The Palisades Park Commission is authorized to acquire an open space tract of land from the Sterling Forest Corporation in the Sterling Forest area of the New York/New Jersey Highlands Region. The Commission is also authorized to manage the acquired land to enhance protection of watersheds, outdoor recreation, wildlife habitat, and Appalachian Trail values in the Sterling Forest area of the New York/New Jersey Highlands Region. Additionally, authorization of appropriations is granted. The Sterling Forest Protection Act of 1994 authorizes appropriations for acquiring land described in section 2 and allows for the transfer of funds to the Commission to carry out the Act. This Act may be cited as the \"Sterling Forest Protection Act of 1994\". The Palisades Interstate Park Commission manages 23 parks and historic sites in New York and New Jersey, attracting over 8 million visitors annually. Sterling Forest, a biologically diverse area on the New Jersey border, is crucial for clean drinking water and outdoor recreation in the densely populated northeastern United States. Sterling Forest in New Jersey is a significant watershed area providing clean drinking water for 25% of the state. It is an important recreational asset with diverse habitats and habitat for rare species. Protecting Sterling Forest would enhance the Appalachian National Scenic Trail and provide recreational opportunities. Stewardship costs for the Palisades Park System are covered by New York and New Jersey. The protection of Sterling Forest through the Palisades Interstate Park Commission will involve minimal Federal funds due to stewardship costs being covered by New York and New Jersey. There is a clear Federal interest in acquiring Sterling Forest for permanent protection of its watershed, recreational, wildlife, and open space qualities, which is a cost-effective investment compared to the expenses of protecting drinking water for the region if the forest is developed. The Sterling Forest Reserve in New York will be established to protect watershed, wildlife, and recreational resources. Federal funding will be provided for acquisition costs, and the management will be overseen by the Palisades Interstate Park Commission. Definitions for terms like \"Commission,\" \"Reserve,\" and \"Secretary\" are also provided in the Act.

The Commission must agree to specific terms and conditions before receiving federal funds for land acquisition within the Sterling Forest Reserve. These conditions include managing acquired lands in accordance with the Act, obtaining consent from landowners before using federal funds, and acquiring designated wilderness and conservation easement lands if unable to acquire all lands within the Reserve. The Commission must acquire designated wilderness and conservation easement lands within the Sterling Forest Reserve using Federal funds as specified in the Act.

The Commission will manage lands in the Reserve in accordance with the Act and prepare a general management plan within 3 years. Appropriations are authorized for the Act's implementation, with a limit of $17,500,000 for land acquisition within the Reserve."
