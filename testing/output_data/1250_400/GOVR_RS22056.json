    "content": "Congress has been grappling with the reauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) for over five years. The IHCIA authorizes various specific Indian Health Service (IHS) programs, including health professional recruitment, mental health services, urban Indian health services, and construction of health facilities. Despite authorizations expiring in FY2001, Congress continues to appropriate funds for these programs. Negotiations have led to multiple IHCIA reauthorization bills from the 106th to 109th Congresses. Congress has been working on reauthorizing the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) for over five years. Despite authorizations expiring in FY2001, funds continue to be appropriated for IHS programs. Negotiations have led to multiple IHCIA reauthorization bills from the 106th to 109th Congresses, with ongoing discussions on major changes. The Committee reported on issues in Medicaid, Medicare, and SCHIP on July 12. Congress faces a multi-billion-dollar problem with Indian trust funds, leading to financial claims against the United States. The reorganization of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Office of Special Trustee for American Indians has also been controversial. Trust lands total about 56 million acres, with funds totaling about $3.3 billion. The trust lands for Indian tribes and individuals total about 56 million acres, with funds amounting to $3.3 billion. The Treasury Department manages the accounts, with $2.9 billion in tribal accounts and $400 million in Individual Indian Money (IIM) accounts. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) has faced criticism for its management of trust lands and funds, leading to reforms through the American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994. This act directed the Secretary of the Interior to oversee trust fund balances and created the Office of the Special Trustee (OST) for trust management reforms. The Reform Act of 1994 aimed to improve the management of Indian trust funds and assets, leading to the creation of the Office of the Special Trustee (OST). Legal actions, including the Cobell case, were taken against U.S. officials for mismanagement of funds, prompting a reorganization of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and OST. Congressional discussions are ongoing regarding the settlement of claims related to trust fund and lands mismanagement. In the Cobell case, the district court found that DOI and Treasury breached their trust duties regarding document retention, data gathering, and trust management. DOI proposed a historical accounting method, estimating losses in the tens of millions, while plaintiffs estimated losses of over $100 billion. The court ordered DOI to perform a historical accounting of all IIM trust account transactions. The district court has twice ordered the DOI to perform a historical accounting of all IIM trust account transactions and assets since 1887, estimating compliance costs at $12-13 billion. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit overturned the orders. Congress has addressed the Cobell suit through oversight hearings and provisions in Interior appropriation acts. Congress has long been concerned about the costs of the Cobell lawsuit, which may jeopardize DOI trust reform implementation and reduce spending on other Indian programs. Current costs include ongoing litigation expenses, with possible future costs estimated at $12-$13 billion for a court-ordered historical accounting. Funding sources for these large costs are being considered, including a potential settlement amount proposed by Cobell plaintiffs. The Cobell settlement may cost as much as $27.5 billion, with funding sources including discretionary appropriations and the Treasury Department's \"Judgment Fund.\" Two settlement bills have been introduced in Congress, establishing an IIM accounting-claim settlement fund for payments to claimants. Both bills aim to establish an IIM accounting-claim settlement fund for payments to claimants, create a commission to review Indian trust asset management, allow increased payments for fractionated individual Indian trust interests, and require an annual independent audit of all Indian trust funds. Senate hearings have been held on the bills, with further committee action pending. H.R. 4322 and S. 1439 are bills related to Indian trust management reform. The Senate Indian Affairs Committee marked up an amended S. 1439 with an $8 billion settlement amount, pending negotiations over including IIM land mismanagement claims. The DOI, BIA, and OST have made organizational changes to implement trust management reform since the 1994 Act, including transferring trust fund management to OST in 1996 and creating OST field operations in 2003. In 2003, the DOI reorganized BIA trust management operations, creating OST field operations to oversee trust management for Indian trust beneficiaries. Tribal leaders and Cobell plaintiffs opposed the reorganization, citing lack of consultation and unclear new OST duties. Attempts to stop the reorganization in Congress have failed, with bills proposing changes in DOI and BIA trust management not advancing. S. 1439 and H.R. 4322 aim to reorganize DOI management of Indian trust. S. 1439 and H.R. 4322 propose reorganizing DOI management of Indian trust assets, while previous bills suggesting changes in DOI and BIA trust management have not progressed. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) regulates gambling on Indian reservations and certain lands, with exceptions allowing for gaming on trust lands acquired after 1988 in specific circumstances. Critics argue that these exceptions enable \"reservation shopping\" by tribes. Exceptions to the prohibition on gaming on trust lands acquired after 1988 include tribes without reservations in 1988, newly recognized tribes, restored tribes, and land-claim settlements. Critics argue that these exceptions lead to \"reservation shopping\" and undermine on-reservation economic development. Bills like S. 2078 and H.R. 4893 aim to curb these exceptions by removing the requirement for secretarial and gubernatorial agreement, with some limitations on certain applications filed before 2006. Both H.R. 4893 and S. 2078 aim to restrict exceptions to the prohibition on gaming on trust lands acquired after 1988. H.R. 4893 adds a geographic limitation to lands with a \"nexus\" to the tribe and requires a tribal-local mitigation agreement. S. 2078 retains the land claim exception with limitations. Critics argue that these bills impose new burdens on newly recognized, restored, and landless tribes, and H.R. 4893's mitigation agreement requirement undermines tribal sovereignty. H.R. 4893 and S. 2078 aim to restrict gaming on trust lands acquired after 1988. Critics argue that these bills impose new burdens on tribes, with H.R. 4893's mitigation agreement requirement seen as undermining tribal sovereignty. Native Hawaiians, not considered Indians under federal law, lack a recognized political entity, raising concerns about legal challenges to programs benefiting them. The absence of a recognized Native Hawaiian political entity poses a threat to federal and state Native Hawaiian programs, leading to legal challenges claiming the programs are race-based. Three bills in the 109th Congress aim to establish a process for federal recognition of a Native Hawaiian political entity, leaving questions about governmental powers and lands for future legislation. Proponents argue that Congress has the authority to recognize a Native Hawaiian political entity under its constitutional power over indigenous peoples in the United States. Proponents argue that Congress has the power to recognize a Native Hawaiian political entity due to its constitutional authority over indigenous peoples in the United States. They highlight the special relationship Congress has with Native Hawaiians, citing established programs like the Hawaiian homelands program. They claim that Native Hawaiians did not willingly give up their sovereignty but had it forcibly taken during the 1893 overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Opponents dispute Congress's authority to recognize a Native Hawaiian political entity, arguing that it extends only to Indian tribes, not all indigenous peoples. They also argue against a special responsibility to Native Hawaiians, stating that recognition would be based on race alone. Opponents of recognizing a Native Hawaiian political entity argue that it would be unconstitutional and not based on criteria like geography and community, setting a precedent for other race-based groups. The U.S. Civil Rights Commission also raised concerns about racial discrimination. Some opponents dispute claims of Native Hawaiian sovereignty, stating it ended before 1893. Bills similar to S. 147 and H.R. 309 have been considered in previous Congresses. Bills similar to S. 147 and H.R. 309, which address Native Hawaiian sovereignty, have been extensively considered in previous Congresses. S. 147 was reported by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee in 2005 but failed to proceed in 2006. H.R. 309 was referred to the House Resources Committee and has not been reported. Additionally, the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on the Constitution held a hearing on constitutional issues raised by H.R. 309 in 2005."
