    "content": "Since the mid-1980s, Congress has passed legislation to support older youth in foster care through the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP), providing services like housing. Despite these efforts, research shows that foster youth struggle more than their peers in transitioning to adulthood. Research has shown that compared to their peers, current and former foster youth face challenges in transitioning to adulthood, such as lower rates of higher education, poor health, homelessness, and reliance on public support. Policy makers have focused on providing support for youth aging out of foster care, with efforts to ensure connections to caring adults and continued state support after reaching adulthood. The 110th Congress held hearings on child welfare reforms, including those addressing older youth. The 110th Congress conducted hearings on child welfare reforms, leading to the passage of the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008. Subsequent efforts by the 113th Congress resulted in the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act, which provides protections and promotes normalcy for older youth in foster care. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Obama on September 30, 2014. The law aims to protect older youth in care, promote normalcy for children in foster care, and require child welfare agencies to respond to sex trafficking victims. Implementation challenges include extending foster care to older youth and developing transition plans within 90 days. States may extend care after age 18 by authorizing partial reimbursement for continued support, but cost remains a challenge. Youth must have a transition plan within 90 days of exiting care, with various approaches available. Concerns persist for older foster youth transitioning to adulthood, facing obstacles in securing connections, health insurance, housing, and education. Emancipated youth transitioning from foster care face challenges in forming permanent connections, securing housing and health insurance, and staying connected to work and school. A new national database will provide insight into their outcomes in education, employment, and contact with social services and the criminal justice system. Concerns also exist about youth in foster care being vulnerable to child sex trafficking, with policies in place to serve these victims. Congress may need to monitor state implementation of these policies and identify best practices for serving victims. The report discusses the implementation of federal child welfare policies for transitioning youth from foster care, including monitoring state efforts and identifying best practices for serving victims. It also highlights the decline in the overall number of children in foster care over the past decade, with older children making up a larger share of the caseload. The number of children in foster care has increased over the years, with older children comprising a larger share of the caseload. The percentage of older youth exiting care has followed a similar trend, with a recent decrease in the number of youth emancipating. Research shows that youth in foster care tend to have more negative outcomes in adulthood compared to their peers. Former foster youth who spent their teenage years in foster care tend to experience more negative outcomes in adulthood compared to their peers. A leading study known as the Midwest Evaluation is tracking outcomes of former foster youth in Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin. The study found that former foster youth had more negative educational and employment outcomes compared to their peers in the general population. The most recent results of the Midwest Evaluation study found that former foster youth had more negative educational and employment outcomes compared to their peers in the general population. Former foster youth were less likely to have attained a four-year college degree, had lower current employment rates, and lower mean annual income compared to their peers. Youth in the study reported barriers to enrolling or staying in school, such as financial constraints, employment, childcare responsibilities, and transportation issues. Former foster youth have lower employment rates and mean annual income compared to their peers in the general population. The state child welfare agency is responsible for the care and placement of children removed from their homes. Federal funding, such as Title IV-E foster care, is used to promote the safety and well-being of children in foster care. States must have a written case plan to ensure a permanent home for the child. States participating in the Title IV-B child welfare services program must carry out activities to promote the safety, permanency, and well-being of children in foster care. This includes having a written case plan detailing the child's placement and services for establishing a permanent home. The plan must be reviewed regularly, with specific procedures for older youth in care. For youth aged 14 and older, the plan must include programs for transitioning to adulthood. Additionally, the state child welfare agency must consult with the child in an age-appropriate manner during permanency hearings. For youth aged 14 and older in foster care, the written case plan must include programs and services for transitioning to adulthood. The plan should also list the child's rights regarding education, health, visitation, and court participation, as well as provide necessary identification documents. The child must be consulted in the development and revisions of the case plan and permanency plan, and can choose up to two members for the planning teams. For children in foster care aged 14 and older, they must be consulted in the development and revisions of their case plan and permanency plan. They can choose up to two members for the planning teams, with one individual serving as their advisor and advocate. States must also assist youth in developing a transition plan for housing and other needs upon emancipation from foster care. Efforts are made to find adoptive parents or legal guardians for children who cannot reunite with their parents for a permanent home and family. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program prepares older youth in foster care for independence when they age out of the system. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act made significant changes to federal child welfare statutes, focusing on connections to adults and the state for youth transitioning out of care. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) was passed by Congress in 2014 to address the needs of older youth in foster care and child sex trafficking. It extends foster care for youth aged 18 and older, promotes normalcy for children in care, and requires child welfare agencies to respond to child sex trafficking. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act of 2014 provides protections for older youth in foster care, promotes normalcy for children in care, and requires child welfare agencies to respond to child sex trafficking. Title IV-E of the Social Security Act allows states and tribes to seek federal funds for room and board costs for eligible children in foster care. This funding is available on an open-ended entitlement basis, obligating the federal government to reimburse states for eligible expenditures. Eligibility for Title IV-E foster care includes being in the care of the state, being a citizen or qualified alien, and meeting certain criteria. Title IV-E foster care provides reimbursement to states for eligible expenditures made on behalf of eligible children in foster care. Eligibility criteria include being in state care, being a citizen or qualified alien, and meeting specific age, income, and family structure requirements. The state must make reasonable efforts to secure a permanent home for the child, and a foster care maintenance payment is provided to the licensed foster family or institution where the child is placed. The state or tribal child welfare agency must provide a \"foster care maintenance payment\" on behalf of every Title IV-E eligible child in foster care, covering the cost of food, clothing, shelter, supervision, school supplies, personal incidentals, insurance, visitation travel, and school enrollment travel. Federal reimbursement is only available for children placed in licensed child care institutions or foster homes. Eligible young people in extended care may be placed in independent living settings. States and tribes receiving federal child welfare funds must promote safety, permanency, and well-being for all youth. States and tribes receiving federal child welfare funds must promote safety, permanency, and well-being for all youth in care, regardless of eligibility for federal maintenance payments. Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments are available for eligible children in foster care until age 18, or 19 if still in school. Starting in FY2011, payments can be provided until age 21. Reimbursement can be sought for youth age 18 or older who are Title IV-E eligible and are completing education, in post-secondary or vocational programs, participating in employment-related activities, or employed at least part-time. Title IV-E eligible youth can receive foster care reimbursement if they are completing high school, in post-secondary education, participating in employment-related activities, or employed at least part-time. States can seek reimbursement for older youth with medical conditions preventing participation in these activities. Foster care reimbursement is available for all eligible youth living in licensed foster homes or child care institutions. Federal foster care reimbursement is available for eligible youth living in licensed foster homes or child care institutions. States may also seek reimbursement for youth ages 18 or older who remain in foster care and are placed in a supervised setting for independent living. HHS encourages states to extend foster care assistance to eligible youth until age 21, with a rationale required if extending to a lower age. HHS encourages states and tribes to extend federal foster care assistance to eligible youth until age 21, with a rationale required if extending to a lower age. States and tribes must establish criteria for determining eligibility based on education, employment, or medical conditions. Funding under Title IV-E is contingent upon an approved plan outlining how programs are administered. Tribes must establish criteria for verifying youth in extended care meet conditions, such as education or employment activities. States and tribes can set requirements for extended foster care, like enrollment in post-secondary education. HHS advises providing assistance to youth aged 18 and older broadly. Program instructions address Title IV-E foster care eligibility criteria. The guidance advises states and tribes to provide extended assistance to youth aged 18 and older for foster care eligibility under Title IV-E. Eligibility is based on the youth's circumstances without considering their parents or legal guardians. States are not required to reassess eligibility for these youth. Extended care for youth aged 18 and older in foster care is based on the youth's circumstances without considering their parents or legal guardians. States are not required to reassess eligibility for these youth, who must have entered care via a court order or voluntary placement agreement. Removal criteria for youth in extended care are outlined, including court determinations or voluntary placement agreements as their own guardian. The provision allows youth in extended care to be removed from a home if it is deemed contrary to their welfare, or they can sign a voluntary placement agreement. State and tribal child welfare agencies must follow placement and care rules for older youth, including supervised independent living or placement in a foster family home. HHS does not currently have regulations on living arrangements. The program allows youth in extended care to be placed in supervised independent living settings or licensed foster family homes. HHS does not have regulations for independent living settings at this time, giving states and tribes discretion to develop various options. Examples of eligible settings include host homes, college dormitories, shared housing, and supervised apartments. Child welfare agencies must ensure youth in these settings have connections to caring adults. The program instructions outline eligible settings for reimbursement, such as host homes, college dormitories, shared housing, and supervised apartments. Child welfare agencies must ensure youth in supervised independent living settings form connections with caring adults. Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments can be paid directly to young people in independent living settings. States and tribes must apply case planning and review requirements to youth in extended care in a developmentally appropriate manner. Case plans for youth age 18 and older should address their needs and include joint development with the youth. The program instructions require case planning and review for youth in extended care, focusing on their needs and independence. Permanency plans for older youth should be finalized annually, with a goal of emancipation or independence. Court oversight can determine permanency plans without a hearing. The child welfare agency's efforts to prepare the young person for their goal can be determined by the court overseeing the case without a hearing. States and tribes extending care to ineligible youth are not required to fulfill IV-E requirements, but must continue for children under 18. IV-E eligible youth in foster care are also eligible for Medicaid, which can be extended to those remaining in care after age 18. About half of jurisdictions have amended their plans to extend the maximum age for care. States and tribes extending care to ineligible youth are not required to fulfill IV-E requirements but must continue for children under 18. Nearly half of jurisdictions have amended their plans to extend the maximum age for foster care, with 18 states and the District of Columbia approved to extend care until age 21. Indiana and Nebraska extend care to ages 20 and 19, respectively, while Tennessee, Washington, and West Virginia have approved plan amendments allowing youth to remain in care under specific conditions. States and tribes, except for Indiana and Nebraska, can extend foster care until age 21. Nebraska passed a law in 2013 to extend care to 21, pending HHS review. Tennessee, Washington, and West Virginia allow youth to stay in care under certain conditions, with Tennessee requiring school attendance or participation in a program for employment barriers. Other states considering extending care need to evaluate outcomes, costs, eligible youth, court oversight, and rethinking extended care for older youth. In considering the option to extend care, states and tribes must evaluate factors such as outcomes for youth in care, costs, eligible youth, court oversight, and rethinking care for older youth. Research on youth who emancipate from care is limited, with the Midwest Evaluation study showing that youth who remained in care until age 20 had more positive outcomes than those who emancipated at 18. The study focused on former foster youth in Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin, providing insights into youth outcomes. Iowa and Wisconsin emancipated most foster youth by age 18, offering a comparison for youth outcomes. The study compared outcomes for former foster youth in Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin. Remaining in care until age 21 was associated with higher earnings and delayed pregnancy. Each additional year in care after age 18 led to an increase in average annual earnings. Remaining in care until age 21 was associated with higher earnings and a lower likelihood of pregnancy for former foster youth in Illinois. Youth who stayed in care longer saw an increase in average annual earnings and were more likely to receive transitional living services. However, the benefits seemed to diminish two years after aging out, with no significant difference in college degree attainment compared to their peers. The benefits of remaining in care for former foster youth in Illinois seemed to diminish two years after aging out. By age 23, they were more likely to have completed one year of college but not more likely to have earned a two- or four-year degree. This could be due to losing access to services and supports that helped them pursue educational goals, leading them to focus on meeting basic needs like housing. States face challenges in extending care due to budget constraints. States face challenges in extending care to former foster youth due to budget constraints. In a 2014 review, 17 states cited budget constraints as the main reason for not extending care. The Jim Casey Youth Opportunities Initiative suggests that states convene a planning group, review federal requirements, consider existing supports, reach agreement on key design issues, project costs, and consider next steps when deciding whether to extend care. The advantages of youth remaining in foster care after age 18 are significant, as shown by research studies. Extending foster care or providing transitional living services can offset costs to society, such as welfare payments and prison admissions. Researchers have evaluated the costs and benefits of extending care based on experiences in Illinois. Researchers evaluated the costs and benefits of extending foster care in Illinois, estimating an annual cost of $20,800 or $19,000 if public assistance costs were subtracted. Remaining in care could result in an average return of $2 for every $1 spent, leading to an additional $72,000 earned over the youth's lifetime. The analysis did not consider costs to state child welfare agencies or courts. Extending foster care in Illinois could lead to an average return of $2 for every $1 spent, resulting in an additional $72,000 earned over the youth's lifetime. The analysis did not consider costs to state child welfare agencies or courts, nor did it examine potential societal benefits like higher tax revenues and reduced homelessness. Eligibility for federal foster care maintenance payments varies by state, with just under half of children meeting the criteria. After age 18, most states consider providing foster care to eligible youth. Around half of children qualify for federal foster care maintenance payments, which vary by state. State expenditures for foster care may only be partially reimbursed by the federal government for Title IV-E eligible children and youth. Eligibility criteria include income/assets tests, family structure rules, judicial determinations, and placement in licensed settings. Reimbursement rates are based on a state's Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, ranging from 50% to 73%. The federal government reimburses states for foster care maintenance payments based on the state's FMAP, ranging from 50% to 73%. States may choose to only cover youth who are IV-E eligible due to the high costs involved. Extending care only to certain eligible youth may raise equity concerns. States are expected to cover the full costs for children who do not meet IV-E eligibility criteria. States may extend foster care beyond age 18, but eligibility criteria may vary, potentially leading to different levels of reimbursement and services for youth. HHS advises that states can make remaining in care conditional on certain activities, raising equity concerns if eligibility is restricted based on specific pathways pursued. Federal child welfare law allows states to extend foster care beyond age 18, but eligibility criteria vary. Some states restrict eligibility based on specific activities, which could raise equity concerns if certain pathways are required. This may disadvantage youth who choose not to pursue college or work instead. State courts play a crucial role in overseeing child placement and ensuring appropriate permanency goals, regardless of IV-E eligibility or entry into care. Federal child welfare law mandates state courts to oversee the safety and appropriateness of a child's placement, ensuring a suitable permanency goal regardless of IV-E eligibility or the circumstances of entry into care. Regular case reviews every six months by a judge or administrative panel are required to assess progress and address the reasons for the child's placement. Within 12 months of entering foster care, a permanency plan must be established through a court hearing or administrative body, with ongoing reviews to ensure its appropriateness. After a child is placed in foster care, a permanency plan must be established through a court hearing or administrative body. The plan must be reviewed at least every 12 months for the child's entire stay in care, with consultation with the child in an age-appropriate manner. HHS guidelines state that case review protections apply to all children under 18 and those 18 and older who are IV-E eligible. Children ineligible for IV-E may not be subject to the same court oversight. The Departmental policy allows states to exclude children who have reached the state's age of majority and are not receiving Title IV-E payments from case review and protections. This could result in different levels of services for non-IV-E eligible youth, with potentially less oversight and supervision compared to IV-E eligible youth. This lack of information on non-IV-E eligible youth may hinder policymakers from ensuring all young adults in extended care have their needs met. The American Bar Association recommends that states enact legislation to ensure juvenile court involvement for older youth in care beyond age 18. They also suggest modifying hearings so that older youth are present and involved in their proceedings. The ABA recommends legislation for juvenile court involvement for older youth in care beyond age 18, encouraging their presence and participation in hearings. Stakeholders advocate for reconceptualizing support for foster youth aged 18 and older, acknowledging their anxiety about transitioning from limited decision-making to independence. Foster youth aging out of the system face challenges transitioning to independence. Extended care should be developmentally appropriate, considering trauma and enabling youth to make decisions about their lives based on research on adolescent brain development. Extended care for young adults focuses on trauma-informed support, empowering them to make decisions about their lives based on research on adolescent brain development. It emphasizes the importance of strong social supports, opportunities for growth, and developing healthy relationships. Graduated levels of supervision and case planning may be involved to assist youth in care. Extended care for young adults emphasizes empowering them to have healthy relationships with family, friends, and others. It involves graduated levels of supervision, redesigning case planning, and supporting youth in building social networks. Research focuses on factors that help young people remain in extended care, with a study identifying reasons for youth not staying in care despite state policies. Researchers at the University of Chicago studied why a significant number of youth in certain parts of Illinois do not stay in care despite state policies. In Cook County, over 81% of youth remain in care beyond age 18, compared to the other regions where only 54% do. Factors influencing youth leaving care before age 21 were identified through data evaluation, surveys, focus groups, and interviews. These factors include juvenile courts actively retaining youth, stakeholders lacking a uniform understanding of laws, and resistance from those involved in the case. The study identified factors influencing youth leaving care before age 21 in Illinois, including juvenile courts actively retaining youth, stakeholders lacking a uniform understanding of laws, and resistance from those involved in the case. These factors may be relevant to other states that do not extend care beyond age 18. The age of majority poses challenges in keeping youth in care, leading them to request to leave due to restrictions. States can extend foster care beyond age 18, allowing youth to return if needed. HHS permits states to extend care up to age 19, 20, or 21, as long as eligibility criteria are met. The Government Accountability Office examined the implementation of the Fostering Connections Act in 19 states. States can extend foster care beyond age 18, allowing youth to return if needed up to age 19, 20, or 21. The Government Accountability Office found that all states have policies for young people to leave and re-enter care. In some states, youth can stay in care under voluntary placement agreements, living independently in supervised settings. HHS has not issued regulations on independent living settings yet. HHS has not issued regulations on independent living settings yet, leaving states to establish protocols for supervising older youth in care. Advocates emphasize the importance of young adults in care learning adult skills while still receiving state support. States with foster youth in independent living settings must consider purchasing units or contracting with organizations for oversight. States with foster youth in independent living settings must address various issues such as purchasing or contracting for units, screening residents, determining rent responsibilities, visitation frequency, consequences for lease violations, and support for transitioning back into the community. Youth may receive maintenance payments directly, raising questions about oversight and response to misuse of funds. States with foster youth in independent living settings must address issues such as housing options, oversight of maintenance payments, and support for transitioning back into the community. Challenges include finding appropriate housing and determining how to assist youth pursuing postsecondary education out of state. Youth are allowed to live in various settings but not with their parents or significant others. Independent living settings are not required to be licensed. To support foster youth in independent living settings, states must address housing options and support transitioning back into the community. Challenges include assisting youth pursuing postsecondary education out of state, with restrictions on living arrangements. Monthly federal assistance is generally not available for youth who have left foster care for adoption or kinship guardianship after turning 18, but some states provide subsidies for eligible youth under 21 who are enrolled in school or employed. States and tribes may provide adoption or kinship guardianship subsidies for eligible children who leave foster care after their 16th birthday, as long as they are under 21, enrolled in school, employed, or in a program to promote employment. Assistance can continue up to age 21 for youth with medical conditions or disabilities. States and tribes can extend foster care beyond age 18 to provide adoption and kinship guardianship subsidies to youth age 18 and older, up to the age the state has chosen. The term \"relative\" for kinship guardianship assistance can include biological and legal familial ties, tribal kin, extended family, friends, or other \"fictive\" kin. Conditions can be established for a person to qualify as a child's guardian, such as requiring a child to be in care for more than a six-month period. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) provides support services for youth aging out of foster care, helping them transition to self-sufficiency through employment, education, and emotional support. The program aims to assist youth in obtaining employment, preparing for postsecondary education, and connecting them to mentors and other adults for support. Former foster youth aged 18 to 21 are also supported in achieving self-sufficiency through various services. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) provides support services for youth aging out of foster care, assisting them in obtaining employment, preparing for postsecondary education, and connecting them to mentors and other adults for emotional support. The program also supports former foster youth aged 18 to 21 in achieving self-sufficiency through various services, including housing and education. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) was expanded by the Act (P.L. 113-183) in 2014 to ensure foster children have opportunities for age-appropriate activities. States receive funding based on their foster care population, with a minimum allocation of $500,000. States must provide a 20% match and describe their independent living programs in their Child and Family Services Plan to be eligible for CFCIP funds. These programs offer services like housing, education, counseling, and mentoring to help youth transition to adulthood. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) provides direct services to youth such as housing, career exploration, education services, preventative health activities, counseling, mentoring, and financial management training. States and tribes must outline their independent living program in their Child and Family Services Plan to be eligible for CFCIP funds. The program must ensure statewide coverage and serve children of various ages and stages of independence. Additionally, the Chafee Education and Training Voucher Program (ETV) supports children who have emancipated from care or were adopted from care at age 16 or older. The Chafee Education and Training Voucher Program (ETV) provides vouchers worth up to $5,000 annually for eligible youth aged 18 to 21 for higher education expenses. The program is funded by Congress with approximately $45 million allocated each year. Students must be in good academic standing and making progress towards completing their program to be eligible. The Chafee Education and Training Voucher Program covers tuition, fees, books, supplies, and related expenses for eligible youth aged 18 to 21. States can offer independent living services to youth who left foster care permanently before age 18. These services focus on connecting youth to school, work, and resources until age 21. States have discretion in defining which youth are likely to remain in foster care until age 18 for program eligibility. States currently provide independent living services to youth in foster care until age 21, with discretion in defining eligibility. States must prioritize youth for the program and ensure capacity for additional participants. Transition plans must be developed with the youth's input, covering housing, education, health insurance, mentors, workforce support, and employment services, to be implemented 90 days before the youth's 18th birthday. The transition plan for youth in foster care must be directed by the youth and include options on housing, health insurance, education, mentors, workforce support, and employment services. It must be implemented 90 days before the youth's 18th birthday, with additional requirements under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act for designating a healthcare decision-maker if needed. The transition plan for youth in foster care must be directed by the youth and include options on housing, health insurance, education, mentors, workforce support, and employment services. It is distinct from a case plan and must provide the youth with the option to execute a health care power of attorney. The case plan describes the youth's placement and plan for safe care while in care, while the transition plan focuses on services and supports for when the youth is no longer in state custody. The transition plan for youth in foster care, directed by the youth, includes options for housing, health insurance, education, mentors, workforce support, and employment services. It is different from the case plan, focusing on services and supports for when the youth is no longer in state custody. The plan must specify housing options and be as detailed as the youth desires, not reviewed by a court. Additional guidance is provided in July 2010 program instructions by HHS on P.L. 110-351. The transition plan for youth in foster care, directed by the youth, includes options for housing, health insurance, education, mentors, workforce support, and employment services. It is not reviewed by a court and must specify detailed housing options. Additional guidance is provided in July 2010 program instructions by HHS on P.L. 110-351, encouraging child welfare agencies to engage youth in the transition plan process well in advance. The guidance on developing transition plans for youth in foster care emphasizes engaging youth and stakeholders in the process to achieve permanency with caring adults. Plans should focus on lifelong relationships and not just a checklist of skills. The guidance stresses the importance of engaging youth and stakeholders in the transition planning process to achieve permanency with caring adults. Plans should be developed with the strengths of young people in mind, directed by the youth, and encourage collaboration among service providers and those closest to the youth. States have adopted policies to involve youth in transition planning and provide essential supports, such as documenting youth input and ensuring key documents are included in the plan. Several jurisdictions require youth input to be documented in transition plans, along with ensuring key documents like birth certificates are included. Some states face challenges in transition planning, such as lack of staff training, engaging supportive adults, and finding appropriate housing for youth. Hawaii and Nebraska have developed detailed transition planning processes, including holding \"circles\" in Hawaii to celebrate the young person becoming an adult and plan for their future. In Hawaii and Nebraska, transition planning processes involve youth and others in \"circles\" to celebrate adulthood and plan for the future. Foster Club in Nebraska provides a transition planning kit for older youth, specifying roles, oversight, and a permanency pact for support during the transition. The transition plan team and courts oversee a transition proposal checklist for older foster youth, including a \"permanency pact\" for support during the transition. Concerns remain about challenges faced by youth aging out of foster care, such as difficulty in forming permanent connections, securing health insurance and housing, and staying connected to work and school. Youth aging out of foster care face challenges in forming permanent connections, securing health insurance and housing, and staying connected to work and school. The effectiveness of services they receive during the transition is not well understood, but a new national database may provide insights into their outcomes. Congress is focusing on increasing protections for vulnerable children in foster care, including those at risk of sex trafficking. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act aims to address these issues. The Midwest Evaluation shows that youth who age out of foster care have difficulty maintaining positive relationships with caring adults and often remain in contact with their biological families but may also be estranged from them. The Midwest Evaluation on the Adult Functioning of Former Foster Youth, conducted in September 2014, found that youth who aged out of foster care were more likely to be married and less likely to live with their parents compared to their peers. However, many former foster youth reported not having strong relationships with their biological family members. This suggests that despite federal protections, some former foster youth struggle to maintain close connections with relatives after leaving care. The study found that former foster youth often lack strong relationships with relatives after leaving care, despite federal protections. Child welfare practitioners advocate for policies to improve the transition to adulthood by encouraging long-term connections with caring adults, which can provide support for successful outcomes. Permanency for youth in foster care involves a connection with at least one committed adult for emotional and legal support. Permanency for youth in foster care involves developing lasting connections with caring adults, including teachers or mentors, to provide a safe and stable relationship. Practitioners emphasize the importance of helping youth identify permanent connections and pursue adoptive relationships, while being cautious of potential harm from unsustainable relationships. Practitioners advise caution in fostering lasting connections for youth in care, emphasizing the need for healthy relationships with adults. Permanency planning should be initiated before a youth leaves care, with options including returning home, adoption, guardianship, or placement with a relative. Advocates urge policy makers to prioritize permanency planning through the case planning process. The judge determines the permanency plan for the child, which can include returning home, adoption, guardianship, or placement with a relative. If none of these options are feasible, \"another planned permanent living arrangement\" (APPLA) may be chosen with a compelling reason. APPLA was introduced in the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 to provide a stable and permanent arrangement for children in foster care. APPLA is meant to be a permanent arrangement for a child with a specific adult or couple, not a temporary solution. Concerns have been raised that APPLA is being used as a default permanency goal for some children in foster care, instead of foster care on a long-term basis. The Senate Caucus on Foster Youth has discussed policy changes to improve outcomes for children in foster care. The Senate Caucus on Foster Youth discussed policy changes to improve outcomes for children in foster care, including recommendations to eliminate or restrict the use of APPLA as a permanency goal. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act prohibits children under 16 from having a permanency plan of APPLA. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) prohibits children under 16 from having a permanency plan of APPLA. If a child is assigned APPLA, the state must meet additional requirements for the child during annual permanency hearings and periodic reviews in foster care. The law ensures that the state continues to search for a permanent family, the court re-evaluates the APPLA plan, and the child's input is considered for their desired permanency outcome. The requirements for children with an APPLA designation in foster care ensure that the state child welfare agency continues to seek a permanent family, the court re-evaluates the APPLA plan, and the child's input is considered. The transition plan includes opportunities for mentoring to help youth establish permanent connections in adulthood. Changes to federal child welfare law could assist youth in achieving permanency by amending written case plan requirements to include steps for a permanent living arrangement after emancipation. Changes to federal child welfare law could assist youth in achieving permanency by amending written case plan requirements to include steps for a permanent living arrangement after emancipation. The case plan should also document efforts to find a permanent placement with a family or adult connection for older youth. GAO's 2014 report found that some states require intensive efforts to ensure young people have adult connections during the transition process, with a focus on establishing permanent connections. In Texas, youth receive assistance in identifying caring adults who can support them after leaving care. During the transition process in Texas, youth are assisted in identifying caring adults who can provide support after leaving care. Foster Club's Permanency Pact helps youth connect with adults for lifelong support. Efforts to support permanency include Adoption Opportunity Grants for older youth. The Adoption Opportunity Grants funded projects to support older youth in open adoption and securing permanent connections. Additional federal grants could provide mentoring for current and former foster youth, with legislation proposed to authorize funding for mentoring programs. The Department of Justice has funded mentoring programs for teens in care, with legislation introduced in Congress to authorize permanent funding for grants. State and local child welfare agencies are responsible for promoting the safety and well-being of all children, including child victims of sex trafficking who may come to their attention. Youth in foster care, especially those who run away, are vulnerable to trafficking, and there are limitations in the agencies' capacity to respond to their needs. Youth in foster care, particularly those who run away, are at risk of sex trafficking due to limited response capacity of child welfare agencies. The National Academy of Sciences recommends improving collaboration across various sectors to address child sex trafficking. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) requires state child welfare agencies to develop procedures to identify and provide services for children at risk of sex trafficking. Hearings in the 113th Congress highlighted the challenges and strategies of child welfare agencies in combating child sex trafficking. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) mandates state child welfare agencies to establish procedures to identify and assist children at risk of sex trafficking. These procedures must be developed in consultation with various agencies and organizations, provide training for caseworkers, and be implemented within two years of enactment. State agencies are also required to report child trafficking cases to law enforcement promptly and annually report to HHS on the total number of affected children. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) mandates state child welfare agencies to report child trafficking cases to law enforcement immediately or within 24 hours. Within three years, agencies must report the total number of child victims to HHS annually. HHS is then required to report to Congress and the public within four years. Additionally, HHS must submit a report to Congress summarizing demographic information and state efforts to provide services for child victims of sex trafficking. State efforts to provide specialized services, foster family homes, child care institutions, or other forms of placement for children who are victims of sex trafficking, and related requirements. HHS must establish the National Advisory Committee on Domestic Sex Trafficking within 180 days after the bill's enactment. The committee advises on policies for improving the response to domestic sex trafficking of minors and developing best practices for states. Congress should monitor states' implementation of these requirements. State child welfare agencies must serve only children and youth victims who are already in the system, not those who may come to their attention as victims. Congress may consider the extent to which these agencies should screen in victims. Pending legislation would require state agencies to have procedures to identify and assess reports involving child sex trafficking victims. Pending legislation, including H.R. 5081, would require state child welfare agencies to identify and assess reports involving child sex trafficking victims and train CPS workers to recognize and assess these victims. Children in foster care homes due to abuse and neglect may go missing, with limited federal guidance on serving missing children from care. Some stakeholders advocate for a more uniform response to children missing from care. The Runaway and Homeless Youth program and the Missing and Exploited Children's program do not specifically target services for children in foster care. Stakeholders seek a more uniform response to children missing from care. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act directs state child welfare agencies to develop protocols for locating missing children from foster care. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act requires state child welfare agencies to develop protocols for locating missing children from foster care, including determining factors contributing to the child running away and reporting information to authorities. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) mandates state child welfare agencies to report missing children to the National Center on Missing and Exploited Children and law enforcement. Child welfare agencies must address larger issues contributing to children going missing, following best practice guidelines by the Child Welfare League of America. The policies in place for child welfare agencies include recruiting, retaining, and training a competent workforce, involving key stakeholders in decision-making, examining and addressing deficiencies in foster care facilities, and defining and reporting missing children appropriately to law enforcement agencies. States may need to consider restricting reporting to cases where law enforcement intervention is most beneficial. The issue of reporting missing children from foster care to law enforcement raises questions about the effectiveness of such reporting. Law enforcement agencies may not always respond vigorously to certain types of missing incidents, leading to potential risks for children. Coordination between child welfare agencies, law enforcement, and the courts is crucial in preventing children from going missing. The coordination between child welfare agencies, law enforcement, and the courts is crucial in preventing children from going missing. Federal child welfare policy provides general requirements for collaboration, but more efforts are needed to address children missing from foster care. Reporting systems like AFCARS track children who run away from foster care placements, highlighting the need for better coordination and prevention strategies. Child welfare agencies need to improve tracking of missing children, including those abducted or missing for other reasons. Concerns have been raised about limiting foster youth's participation in normal activities due to safety policies. Child welfare stakeholders are concerned about restrictions on foster youth participating in normal activities due to safety policies. These restrictions include limitations on sleepovers, dating, phone use, obtaining a driver's license, driving, working, school trips, and sports. Youth may need background screenings for these activities, but witnesses argue that teenagers naturally seek independence and may engage in risky behaviors due to changes in brain development during adolescence. Witnesses highlighted that teenagers exhibit more risk-taking behaviors due to changes in brain development during adolescence. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) includes provisions to promote normalcy for youth in foster care, such as the \"reasonable and prudent parenting\" standard. Congress will monitor the implementation of these provisions one year after the law's enactment. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act includes provisions promoting normalcy for youth in foster care, such as the \"reasonable and prudent parenting\" standard. Congress will monitor the implementation of these provisions one year after the law's enactment, including training for foster parents on children's developmental stages and revising licensing standards for foster family homes. The lack of adequate and affordable housing is a major concern for youth aging out of foster care. Studies show varying rates of homelessness among former foster youth, with some couch surfing due to a lack of permanent housing. Individual characteristics, such as financial support and family ties, often impact the housing status of former foster youth. Former foster youth often experience homelessness or couch surfing due to a lack of permanent housing. Individual characteristics, child welfare system involvement, and the housing market all play a role in their housing status. Despite some funding available for room and board, it may not be enough to cover housing costs for many former foster youth. Former foster youth may access housing programs provided by nonprofit organizations, in collaboration with housing developers or property management agencies. These programs offer various housing options such as single-site locations, scattered-site locations, and host homes. Most programs focus on independent living support and require youth to be employed or in school. However, none of these programs have been rigorously evaluated for their effectiveness in preventing homelessness or improving housing stability for young people. Some housing programs for former foster youth focus on independent living support and require employment or school attendance. Evaluation of these programs for preventing homelessness or improving housing stability is lacking. States offering extended foster care face challenges in finding suitable housing options, especially for college students during breaks. California law mandates housing review for emancipated foster youth in college dormitories to ensure basic housing year-round. The Higher Education Act (HEA) addresses housing concerns for emancipated foster youth in college dormitories by authorizing services specifically for them, including temporary housing during breaks in the academic year. HEA also allows funds to establish demonstration projects providing comprehensive support services for students who were in foster care or homeless before age 13. The Higher Education Act (HEA) allows funds for demonstration projects providing support services for students who were in foster care or homeless before age 13. This includes temporary housing during breaks in the academic year. Additionally, federal law enables owners of properties financed with Low-Income Housing Tax Credits to claim units occupied by low-income students who were in foster care as low-income units. The U.S. Government Accountability Office defined disconnected youth as individuals aged 14 to 24 who are not in school or working, lacking support networks. Youth in foster care are at higher risk of becoming disconnected. Those who age out of care have low employment rates and earnings. A study in three states showed that at age 24, only three out of five youth who aged out were employed. The study of youth who emancipated in three states linked child welfare, Unemployment Insurance (UI), and public assistance data to determine their employment outcomes. At age 24, about three out of five emancipated youth were working, with lower earnings compared to their counterparts nationally. These young people also faced challenges in education, experiencing multiple school placements, delays in enrollment, and lack of consistent education advocacy. Foster care alumni, even those remaining in care beyond age 18, were less likely to attend college. Foster care alumni face challenges in education, including delays in enrollment and lack of consistent education advocacy. By age 26, only about 7% of youth who aged out of care in three states attained a degree. Additional supports such as academic, social/emotional, and logistical support may be beneficial. Federal child welfare law addresses the educational needs of youth in foster care, requiring state agencies to consider proximity to the child's school when selecting a placement. The federal child welfare law mandates that state agencies consider a child's school proximity when placing them in foster care. It also requires including education-related records in the child's case plan and ensuring continuity in education by keeping the child in the same school or facilitating immediate enrollment in a new school if necessary. States can claim federal funding for transporting children to their \"school of origin\" at the same rate as foster care maintenance payments. The federal child welfare law mandates immediate enrollment in a new school for foster children, with states able to claim federal funding for transportation. Educational records must be updated and provided to foster care parents, and federal agencies are collaborating to address the education needs of vulnerable youth populations. The U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services and Education convened a summit in November 2011 to address the educational needs of foster youth. Recent legislation aims to improve access to education for children in foster care through amendments to federal education law. For example, S. 1094 would require state education agencies to ensure educational stability for children in foster care. The bill reported by the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions aims to amend federal education law to ensure educational stability for children in foster care. It requires state education agencies to keep foster children in their current school or facilitate immediate enrollment in a new school if necessary. Additionally, the bill mandates policies for transferring school credits for children in care changing schools. Federal law also addresses postsecondary educational needs of foster youth through supportive services under the Higher Education Act. The Higher Education Act provides supportive educational services for foster youth, including Trio programs for youth in foster care and homeless children. These programs aim to identify potential post-secondary students, prepare them for higher education, provide support services, and train individuals who provide these services. The FY2014 appropriations law directs the Department of Education to modify the FAFSA form to include a box for applicants to identify if they are or were in foster care and provide them with information about federal educational resources. The FY2014 appropriations law directs the Department of Education to modify the FAFSA form to include a box for applicants to identify if they are or were in foster care and provide them with information about federal educational resources. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program is a major source of funding for independent living services for youth in care or who have aged out, but little is known about the effectiveness of these services or the outcomes of foster youth after they leave care. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program is the primary funding source for independent living services for youth transitioning out of foster care. A national database called the National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) will provide insights into the lives of former foster youth, but full implementation may take several years. States receive $140 million annually for the program, with a 20% match requirement. Most states use their maximum funding, and some even spend additional funds for independent living services. States receive funding from the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program based on their share of children in care, with a 20% match requirement. A 2008 survey found that 68.9% of states spend additional funds on independent living services beyond the match. Federal funding alone may not be sufficient for states to support their independent living programs effectively. Research on independent living programs is limited, but evaluations have been conducted to assess the impact of these programs. HHS contracted with the Urban Institute to evaluate independent living programs funded by the CFCIP. The evaluation aimed to assess the programs' impact on key outcomes for foster youth. 1,400 eligible youth in California and Massachusetts were randomly assigned to different programs and surveyed at three points over two years. The evaluation of independent living programs funded by the CFCIP in California and Massachusetts found no significant impacts in Los Angeles and Kern County programs, but positive impacts on education outcomes in the Massachusetts Adolescent Outreach Program for Youth in Intensive Foster. The evaluation included surveys, interviews, focus groups, and data analysis on child welfare placement, health, and delinquency history. The Massachusetts Adolescent Outreach Program for Youth in Intensive Foster Care, known as Outreach, aims to help youth achieve various outcomes such as obtaining a high school diploma, continuing education, avoiding risky behaviors, and gaining employment. The program provides tailored services with a focus on empowering youth to make positive decisions about their lives. Social workers oversee a small caseload of approximately 15 youth each, with regular interactions to support the youth. The Outreach program provides tailored services to youth in foster care, emphasizing empowerment and positive decision-making. Social workers oversee a small caseload of approximately 15 youth, offering support with tasks like obtaining driver's licenses, applying for college, and gaining employment. The program aims to help youth transition to adulthood successfully, with outcomes showing higher college enrollment rates and continued enrollment for Outreach youth compared to the control group. Additionally, Outreach youth were more likely to remain in foster care and receive more educational and employment assistance. Outreach youth in foster care showed higher college enrollment rates and continued enrollment compared to the control group. They were also more likely to remain in foster care and receive additional help in educational and employment assistance. The study suggests a strong link between staying in care and educational success. However, the program did not show significant improvements in employment, economic well-being, housing, delinquency, pregnancy, or independent living preparedness. This raises questions about the effectiveness of independent living programs and classroom-based instruction in aiding youth transition to independent living. The evaluation questions the effectiveness of independent living programs in aiding youth transition to independent living. The Outreach program, while showing promise in education and foster care outcomes, did not significantly improve employment, economic well-being, housing, delinquency, pregnancy, or preparedness for independent living. The National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) aims to track outcomes of foster youth but faces challenges with states reporting information. The National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) aims to track outcomes of foster youth by developing outcome measures and collecting data on the services provided to them. States are required to report this information to the database as part of the plan established by P.L. 106-169. The NYTD was established to track outcomes of foster youth by collecting data on services provided to them. States must report information on youth receiving independent living services and track their outcomes at ages 17, 19, and 21, regardless of service receipt. States collect data on the outcomes of current and former foster youth at ages 17, 19, and 21, regardless of whether they receive independent living services. The rule imposes financial penalties on states that do not meet data submission requirements."
