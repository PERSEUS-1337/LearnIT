    "content": "The FCC prepared to auction 62 MHz of radio frequencies in the 700 MHz band to comply with the Deficit Reduction Act. They proposed creating a public-private partnership to build a nationwide broadband network for public safety users by pairing 10 MHz of public safety spectrum with 10 MHz of auctionable spectrum. The FCC proposed a shared network of 20 MHz for a nationwide broadband network by pairing frequency bands with auctionable spectrum. This decision was based on the need for robust communications capabilities and interoperability in public safety, as well as the benefits of sharing spectrum with commercial users. A national license for 10 MHz was assigned to a not-for-profit corporation representing public safety interests. The FCC assigned a national license for 10 MHz to a not-for-profit corporation representing public safety interests. The public safety license was created from 24 MHz originally assigned to public safety. The FCC designated 10 MHz from commercial frequencies to be paired with public safety's 10 MHz to create a shared network. The commercial license, known as the D Block, attracted only one bidder at Auction 73, Qualcomm, Inc., with an opening bid of $472 million. The reserve price of $1.3 billion set by the FCC was not met, leading to the decision not to proceed with the re-auction of the D Block. The FCC did not proceed with the re-auction of the D Block after no other bidders met the reserve price of $1.3 billion. Instead, they initiated a review of rules regarding licensing and partnerships. New auction rules were laid out, offering a nationwide license for the Public Safety Broadband Licensee and commercial licenses either nationally or in smaller regions. The new auction rules for the D Block include modifications from Auction 73, offering a nationwide license for the Public Safety Broadband Licensee and commercial licenses nationally or in 58 regions. Public safety associations want local networks to manage access to the spectrum. Congressional policy debates combining public and private spectrum ownership for national public safety communication support. The FCC and DHS are pursuing separate paths for communication development without aligning goals. The FCC and DHS are pursuing separate paths for developing public safety communications support. Congress is considering funding solutions for the program, including levies on commercial partners or public sector funding. The federal government could temporarily assume the role of the commercial partner to ensure the construction of the network. The federal government could temporarily assume the role of the commercial partner to ensure the construction of a public safety network, with benefits including shared spectrum, new funding sources, and access to additional spectrum during emergencies. Key needs for an effective solution include sufficient spectrum (at least 20 MHz) and a source of funds. The report outlines three key needs for an effective solution: sufficient spectrum (at least 20 MHz) for a nationwide broadband network, a source of funds to cover costs associated with public safety, and a management structure for a public-private partnership. Additionally, it is assumed that commercial partners will utilize the shared network for consumer services. The FCC requires a Public Safety Broadband Licensee, a public-private partnership, and a Network Sharing Agreement for building and managing a network shared by commercial users and emergency personnel. There is debate on why the D Block license was not successfully auctioned and what steps can be taken to assign it. Commercial partners using the shared network for consumer services need incentives to meet higher standards, ignoring the demand for mobile access to data and security requirements from businesses. The D Block license failed to attract a winning bid due to various reasons, including flaws in the auction structure and rules that discouraged potential bidders. Possible solutions include modifying auction rules to eliminate FCC requirements that deter bidders while maintaining the public-private partnership. Another option is to eliminate the network sharing requirement, allowing public safety to negotiate independently for partnerships, and auction the license without public safety requirements. These solutions aim to attract bidders while ensuring the structure of the partnership remains intact. The options to attract bidders for the D Block license include modifying auction rules, eliminating network sharing requirements, empowering public safety for partnerships, and auctioning the license without public safety requirements. These solutions aim to maintain the partnership structure while enabling successful collaboration for public safety interoperability. Federal funds may be used to build a public safety network, requiring congressional authorization for expenditures. Another proposal suggests a different organizational structure for managing a public safety network in collaboration with commercial spectrum-license holders, also requiring congressional action and potential legislation. These solutions are not mutually exclusive and offer various approaches to address the challenges in attracting bidders for the D Block license. The FCC seeks comments on various options for managing a public safety network that shares resources with commercial spectrum-license holders. Congressional action may be needed to authorize expenditures and establish the organizational structure. The FCC intends to re-auction the D Block under new rules to attract bidders and maintain oversight of the public-private partnership. Proposed rule changes could include modifying requirements for the winning bidder or eliminating penalties for failure to negotiate a Network Sharing Agreement. The FCC is considering rule changes for the auction of the D Block, which may involve modifications to requirements for the winning bidder, changes to the network sharing agreement, or re-auctioning the block without encumbrances. Some proposals suggest eliminating the network sharing agreement entirely and offering the D Block as a commercial license. There are recommendations to rework the network sharing agreement to accommodate strong bidders. The FCC is considering changes for the auction of the D Block, including potentially eliminating the network sharing agreement and offering it as a commercial license. Recommendations include re-auctioning the block without encumbrances and using surplus funds from auctions to build a public safety network. FCC Chairman Kevin J. Martin and Commissioner Michael J. Copps prefer a solution using federal funds for a nationwide, interoperable network. Michael J. Copps testified that federal funds are preferred for a nationwide, interoperable public safety network. Without federal support, the FCC is exploring using private sector funds. Recommendations for using spectrum proceeds lack details on fund distribution. A cooperative organization with multiple public safety partners would build an interoperable backbone at 700 MHz for regional, state, and local networks to connect during emergencies. Commercial partners would have a smaller financial commitment, with state and local agencies playing a larger role in network control. The proposed plan involves a cooperative organization with multiple commercial partners for a nationwide public safety network at 700 MHz. State and local agencies would have a significant role in network control, with commercial partners taking the lead in investment and technology decisions. Licenses could be assigned to numerous commercial partners for local markets and rural coverage, with the public safety partner designing the network and setting technology standards. The FCC could potentially play a role in setting standards through rule-making. The proposed plan involves a cooperative organization with commercial partners for a nationwide public safety network at 700 MHz. The public safety partner would lead in designing the network and setting technology standards, with licenses assigned to commercial partners for local markets. Federal funds could be used to build parts of the interoperable backbone, and a federally chartered corporation could ensure broad-based participation of public safety agencies. The federal government could establish a federally chartered corporation to operate a public safety network at 700 MHz, potentially using the existing Public Safety Broadband License and the D Block. This corporation could hire skilled professionals to manage the network and secure funding through appropriations or other means. Congressional oversight would replace FCC regulatory roles in governing the network. The FCC seeks opinions and information on various topics related to creating a broadband network for public safety at 700 MHz, including provisions for using the Public Safety Broadband License, revising the public-private partnership, structuring the auction of the D Block, and service rules. Congress could assist in establishing this network through modifications to spectrum band plans and auction rules. The FCC seeks opinions on creating a broadband network for public safety at 700 MHz, including the negotiation of the Network Sharing Agreement, structuring the D Block auction, relocation costs, service rules, and funding sources. The Public Safety Spectrum Trust planned to borrow $197 million for capital expenditures, excluding operating costs, with potential funding from the Universal Service Fund and Telecommunications Development Fund. The FCC is exploring funding options for the Public Safety Broadband Licensee, including the Universal Service Fund (USF) and the Telecommunications Development Fund (TDF). The USF is funded through telephone bill assessments and may require Congressional amendments for use. The TDF, created in 1996, provides capital to small telecom businesses through FCC-held deposits. This section outlines FCC actions leading up to Auction 73 and potential changes to key provisions. The FCC, through the Telecommunications Development Fund, provides capital to small businesses in the telecommunications industry using interest accrued on deposits held by the FCC. The FCC establishes auction rules, financial requirements for bidders, and service rules for license use. For Auction 73, the FCC expanded service rules to include spectrum sharing between public safety and commercial licensees. The FCC expanded service rules for Auction 73 to include spectrum sharing between public safety and commercial licensees, establishing a regulatory framework for a public-private partnership. This framework sets binding requirements for organization, performance, and compliance to address potential challenges in building and operating a shared network. The regulatory framework for a public-private partnership in public safety communications includes requirements for organization, performance, and compliance for three components: Public Safety Broadband Licensee, Commercial partner, and Network Sharing Agreement. The FCC oversees contracts, compliance, and dispute resolution, ensuring guidelines are met. This framework aims to address challenges in building and operating a shared network. The FCC oversees public safety communications, resolving disputes through litigation or FCC regulations. Congress allocated 24 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz band for public safety use, transitioning from analog to digital TV. Planning began in 1997, with the NCC developing standards and managing licenses through RPCs. The Public Safety National Coordination Committee (NCC) was established in 2003 as a Federal Advisory Committee to the FCC for the 700 MHz band. The band plan has been revised to accommodate narrowband and broadband applications, with channels reassigned for narrowband operations. RPCs are required to submit amended band plans as per FCC regulations. Channels have been reassigned to support narrowband operations in 12 MHz of paired spectrum, at 769 - 775 MHz and 799 - 805MHz. States and localities will administer these channels through regional committees. Networks on narrowband frequencies will be funded by a combination of local, state, and federal funds. Spectrum for broadband communications will be allocated in 10 MHz of frequencies at 763 - 768 MHz and 793 - 798 MHz. Public Safety Broadband Licensee will manage these frequencies and two guard bands at 768 - 769 MHz and 798 - 799 MHz to prevent interference. Some public safety network operators may need to modify equipment for the new band plan. The new band plan includes two guard bands at 768 - 769 MHz and 798 - 799 MHz to prevent interference. Public safety network operators may need to modify equipment, with some costs covered by the commercial D Block licensee. The Public Safety Broadband Licensee will manage the frequencies and guard bands, with requirements focusing on forming a not-for-profit corporation and compliance. The cost of building the national network will be covered by the commercial partner, with potential public sector funding for enhancements. The FCC selected the Public Safety Broadband Licensee based on specific criteria. The FCC selected the Public Safety Broadband Licensee, a not-for-profit corporation with broad representation of public safety entities, to manage the national network using spectrum held by the broadband licensee. The Public Safety Spectrum Trust Corporation was formed by public safety associations to negotiate with the D Block licensee, leading to the award of the nationwide Public Safety Broadband License. The Board of Directors of the Public Safety Broadband Licensee consists of members from designated organizations representing public safety, with two at-large members, creating a board of 13 members. The FCC changed the composition of the Board of Directors of the Public Safety Broadband Licensee, adding three representatives from named organizations, eliminating one representative, and increasing the number of at-large members from two to four. The National Public Safety Telecommunications Council (NPSTC) was eliminated as a named member due to overlap with other associations. PSST, as the selected licensee, would need to file quarterly financial reports with the FCC. The FCC requires the selected licensee, PSST, to file quarterly financial reports and meet specific criteria for governance. The FCC will provide oversight to ensure compliance. Suggestions for reassignment of the D Block license if progress is unsatisfactory were rejected. The FCC reserves the right to reassign the commercial license if necessary. The FCC has reserved the right to re-assign the commercial license if necessary, under specific circumstances detailed in the rule making. The public safety license would be valid for ten years, renewable, with the selected licensee responsible for negotiating a Network Sharing Agreement with its commercial partner and administering access to the network for public safety users. The selected public safety licensee, after meeting initial qualifications, would have additional tasks set by the FCC. Responsibilities include negotiating a Network Sharing Agreement with the commercial partner, administering network access for public safety users, representing their interests, approving equipment specifications, applications, and vendor purchase agreements, coordinating station access to frequencies, overseeing user relocations due to band rebanding, and approving system or equipment links to the broadband network. The FCC oversees the approval of equipment or applications, coordinates station access to frequencies, implements user relocations due to band rebanding, and reviews requests for wideband network construction. They also facilitate negotiations for network sites on public land and provide bidding credits for eligible small businesses in Auction 73 Block D. The FCC ruled that eligible bidders for Block D in Auction 73 would receive a bidding credit of 15% for companies with average revenues of $40 million and 25% for companies with earnings of $15 million. The D Block designates frequencies at 758 - 763 MHz and 788 - 793 MHz, totaling 10 MHz. The reserve price for the D Block was suggested to be $1.33 billion, with a presumed value of $1.7 billion. The winning bidder would need to meet specific requirements before being assigned the license. The FCC set the reserve price for the D Block at $1.33 billion, lower than its presumed value of $1.7 billion. The winning bidder must meet specific requirements, including a Network Sharing Agreement with the Public Safety Broadband Licensee. Negotiations for the NSA would start after the bidder files its long form application, with a deadline of six months for completion. Additionally, a separate agreement grants the Public Safety Broadband Licensee rights in case of network asset sales or D Block license cancellation. The FCC required the winning bidder for the D Block to enter into a Network Sharing Agreement with the Public Safety Broadband Licensee. This agreement included provisions for the licensee to have the right of first refusal in case of network asset sales and the option to purchase assets at fair market value if the D Block license is cancelled. Negotiations for the agreement would be monitored by FCC staff, with detailed monthly reports required after three months. Separate legal entities would need to be formed to hold the D Block license, own network assets, and operate the network. The FCC required the formation of separate legal entities to hold the D Block license, own network assets, and operate the network. These entities must be \"bankruptcy remote\" and approved by the FCC. The commercial partner in the public-private partnership would consist of quasi-independent companies with designated functions. All entities and agreements would be subject to FCC approval. The commercial partner in the public-private partnership would be a corporate structure comprised of quasi-independent companies, each with a designated function. These entities and agreements would be subject to FCC approval. Failure to meet obligations could lead to license revocation and penalties. The D Block license, if canceled, would result in a penalty of 10% of the auction price. The license is valid for ten years and can be renewed if FCC rules are followed. A commercial corporation must build the public safety network using the D Block license and public safety spectrum. FCC benchmarks require the network to reach 75% of the population within four years. The FCC established benchmarks for a population-based build out in the Network Sharing Agreement. The network should reach 75% of the population within four years, 95% within seven years, and 99.3% within ten years. Failure to meet these deadlines could lead to license cancellation. The FCC established benchmarks for population-based build-out in the Network Sharing Agreement, requiring an estimated cost for each area. The D Block licensee must confirm benchmarks are met, or risk license cancellation. Additionally, the licensee must offer a handset with integrated satellite solution for public safety use and ensure robust signal carriage for population coverage requirements. The Network Sharing Agreement serves as the keystone of the public-private partnership, outlining rules for the two licensees to follow. The FCC established requirements for the D Block licensee in the Network Sharing Agreement to ensure service continuity for public safety customers. The agreement serves as the foundation of the public-private partnership, with the FCC reviewing and approving all components. Minimum standards for the network, including broadband mobile voice, video, and data capabilities, must be met to address public safety needs. The FCC established requirements for the D Block licensee in the Network Sharing Agreement to ensure service continuity for public safety customers. The FCC established a list of requirements for the network, including specifications for broadband mobile voice, video, and data, communications interoperability, signal coverage, reliability, capacity during emergencies, and state-of-the-art security and encryption. The FCC requires the D Block licensee to have sufficient capacity to maintain operations for an extended period, meet public safety needs during emergencies without degrading service, use spectrum efficient technologies, provide state-of-the-art security and encryption, prioritize public safety communications in real time, and have capabilities consistent with evolving operational needs. The Public Safety Broadband Licensee has operational control of the network, the right to approve equipment specifications, and purchase subscriber equipment from any vendor. The Public Safety Broadband Licensee has operational control of the public safety network to ensure requirements are met, including approving equipment specifications and purchasing subscriber equipment. The D Block Licensee must provide an integrated handset for public safety use. A common standard for nationwide broadband interoperability is required for all public safety users. FCC rules stipulate guidelines for the Network Sharing Agreement, including fee structures and duration. Service fees, including for priority access during emergencies, must be specified in the agreement. Both licensees must negotiate in good faith. The FCC rules require that service fees, including for priority access during emergencies, must be specified in the Network Sharing Agreement. The two licensees are expected to negotiate \"reasonable rates\" in good faith, with fees structured to protect public safety participants. The D Block licensee should provide terms that align with public safety goals. The FCC expects the D Block licensee to negotiate affordable rates with public safety partners to align with public safety goals. The Network Sharing Agreement may be renewed for up to ten years, corresponding to the D Block license duration, with any modifications requiring FCC approval. The FCC requires approval for modifications to the public-private partnership agreements, including the D Block license renewal. The D Block licensee can access public safety frequencies on a secondary basis, yielding to public safety users when needed. The FCC requires that public safety needs be met immediately by terminating commercial traffic. The D Block licensee must lease spectrum to the Public Safety Broadband Licensee and build a network for public safety use. The D Block licensee is responsible for ensuring no interference with public safety operations and must prioritize first responders on the network. The FCC requires commercial operations in the public safety spectrum band to prioritize first responders automatically with immediate preemption. Public safety has the right to real-time emergency access to the spectrum licensed to the D Block. The FCC revised the band plan to accommodate both narrowband and broadband networks for public safety. The FCC revised the band plan for the 24 MHz allocated to public safety to accommodate both narrowband and broadband networks. Among the FCC decisions for public safety networks in the 700 MHz band are requiring technical adjustments for networks, capping reimbursement costs at $10 million, prohibiting new narrowband systems, and limiting wideband networks. The FCC has set a cap of $10 million for reimbursement to public safety network operators for adjustments. New operations of narrowband systems on 700 MHz public safety networks are prohibited due to rebanding. Wideband network building and use are limited. The new band plan for public safety in the 700 MHz band includes two sets of paired spectrum blocks for narrowband and broadband networks. Some states have started building narrowband networks on the 700 MHz capacity. Frequencies reassigned to the broadband network must be vacated by February 17, 2009. Motorola, Inc. is a key provider in this rule-making process. The FCC has set a $10 million cap for reimbursement to public safety network operators for adjustments related to rebanding. Motorola, Inc. provided a cost estimate of $9.45 million for a rebanding plan proposed by the NPSTC. The FCC ruled that the D Block licensee would cover the costs of rebanding, with a cut-off date of August 30, 2007 for systems and radios to be covered. The FCC established a $10 million cap for reimbursements related to rebanding costs. Systems and radios in operation as of August 30, 2007, would be covered to control costs. The estimated cost was around $6 million, with provisions for additional expenses. The FCC also prohibited new operations on affected frequencies after the cut-off date. Licensees must reach agreements on relocation plans and costs within 30 days. The FCC established a $10 million cap for reimbursements related to rebanding costs, with systems and radios in operation as of August 30, 2007, covered. Licensees must reach agreements on relocation plans and costs within 30 days. The D Block licensee would be responsible for reimbursing only the minimum cost for necessary changes to base stations, mobiles, and portables, and not for any unrelated improvements. The FCC established a $10 million cap for reimbursements related to rebanding costs, with systems and radios in operation as of August 30, 2007, covered. The D Block licensee is responsible for reimbursing only the minimum cost for necessary changes to base stations, mobiles, and portables. The rule making does acknowledge the possibility of reimbursement for the Public Safety Broadband Licensee's rebanding costs. The D Block licensee and public safety licensee must agree on total costs not exceeding $10 million for changes necessitated by rebanding, to be submitted to the FCC as part of the required relocation plan. The FCC requires a negotiated amount for changes due to rebanding to be submitted as part of a relocation plan. The agreed amount must be paid into a trust account by the Public Safety Broadband Licensee before the Network Sharing Agreement is executed. Payments from the trust account can only be made after the D Block license is awarded to the winning bidder. Public safety network operators seeking to operate wideband systems must obtain a waiver from the FCC. The FCC requires public safety network operators to obtain a waiver for wideband operations, which must include various documents and certifications. Waivers are only granted for wideband operations within narrowband frequencies, and devices must be interoperable with the broadband network. Licenses for wideband operations are valid for five years, and the FCC has positioned itself as the protector of public safety interests and interoperable networks. The FCC, in the Second Report and Order, assigned itself the role of champion and protector for public safety interests, emergency communications, and interoperable networks. It extended its authority to oversee and regulate the actions of the Public Safety Broadband Licensee and companies managing the obligations of the D Block license holder. Congressional oversight of the public-private partnership would fall under the jurisdiction of telecommunications committees. The FCC committed to overseeing a network with a potential asset value in the tens of billions of dollars, controlled by the Public Safety Broadband Licensee and governed by its Board of Directors. The FCC oversees a network with a potential asset value in the tens of billions of dollars, controlled by the Public Safety Broadband Licensee. The FCC plans to enforce rules through litigation, license revocation, or other means supported by the Communications Act. Congress provides guidance to FCC commissioners, with bills introduced to address specific issues in creating a shared network. The Public Safety Broadband Authorization Act of 2008 would allocate $1 million for operating expenses. Two bills introduced in the 110th Congress aim to address issues in creating a shared network. The Public Safety Broadband Authorization Act of 2008 would provide funding for operating expenses and promote the establishment of a nationwide public safety communications network. The RESPONDER Act of 2008 would create a trust fund to purchase interoperable radios for the new public safety network. The RESPONDER Act of 2008 (S. 3465, Wicker) aims to create a trust fund to purchase interoperable radios for the new public safety network proposed for channels being released in the transition to digital TV. The Act would allocate net proceeds from the D Block Auction and a percentage of future auctions to the Trust Fund to ensure the procurement of new devices for emergency responders."
