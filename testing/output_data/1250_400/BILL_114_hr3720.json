    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Water Advanced Technologies for Efficient Resource Use Act of 2015\". It includes a section on WaterSense. The WaterSense program established within the EPA promotes water efficient products, buildings, and landscapes to reduce water use, strain on infrastructure, conserve energy, and preserve water resources for future generations through voluntary labeling. The Administrator of the EPA is responsible for promoting WaterSense labeled products and enhancing public awareness through outreach and education. The WaterSense program promotes water-efficient products, buildings, and landscapes to reduce water use and conserve energy. It aims to enhance public awareness through outreach, education, and maintaining performance standards for labeled products. The program also emphasizes the importance of proper installation and maintenance by certified professionals to ensure optimal performance and preserve the integrity of the WaterSense label. The WaterSense program aims to maintain performance standards for labeled products, regularly update criteria, collect data on market shares, estimate water and energy savings, and gather public feedback on establishing or revising categories. The WaterSense program aims to maintain performance standards for labeled products, regularly update criteria, collect data on market shares, estimate water and energy savings, and gather public feedback on establishing or revising categories. It also requires providing notice of changes, explanations, and responses to comments, as well as lead time before new or significant revisions take effect. The WaterSense program requires providing notice of changes, explanations, and responses to comments, as well as lead time before new or significant revisions take effect. It also encourages voluntary approaches to improve water efficiency and lower water use in various sectors. The WaterSense program encourages reuse, reclamation, and recycling technologies in different sectors to improve water efficiency and meet performance standards. $7,500,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2016, increasing to $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2019 and beyond, adjusted for inflation. Federal procurement of water efficient products is mandated under Section 3. In this section, definitions are provided for terms such as \"agency,\" \"WaterSense product or service,\" \"WaterSense program,\" and \"FEMP designated product.\" The terms \"product\" and \"service\" exclude water consuming products for combat missions and those already covered by Federal procurement regulations. The procurement requirements for water-efficient products mandate agencies to purchase WaterSense or FEMP designated products. Installation and maintenance should be done by certified professionals for optimal performance. The installation and maintenance of WaterSense products should be done by certified professionals for optimal performance. Agencies are not required to procure WaterSense products if they are not cost-effective or if no suitable products are available. Agencies must include specifications for water-efficient products in all procurements. The head of an agency must include criteria for WaterSense products and FEMP designated products in procurement specifications. Additional measures for reducing water consumption should also be considered, such as water reuse, leak detection, and waterless products. The head of an agency must consider additional measures for reducing water consumption, including water reuse, leak detection, and waterless products. WaterSense products and FEMP designated products should be clearly identified in federal catalogs and supplied for all relevant categories, unless specified otherwise in writing. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency must issue regulations within 180 days of the enactment of this Act to implement the requirements for using WaterSense or FEMP designated products, unless specified otherwise in writing. SEC. 4. EARLY ADOPTER WATER EFFICIENT PRODUCTS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. The section defines key terms like \"Administrator,\" \"eligible entity,\" \"incentive program,\" and \"residential water efficient product or service\" for a program that offers financial incentives for consumers to purchase water-efficient products and services. The term \"residential water efficient product or service\" refers to products or services for residential properties that are rated for water efficiency by the WaterSense program or an approved incentive program. Categories include faucets, irrigation technologies, water treatment devices, toilets, and showerheads. Products must be third-party certified before being considered water efficient. The WaterSense program certifies residential water efficient products after testing by accredited third-party certifying bodies. States and eligible entities can participate in incentive programs to promote water efficiency. The WaterSense program certifies residential water efficient products. Eligible entities can receive allocations for incentive programs to promote water efficiency by providing financial incentives to consumers. The Administrator determines the amount allocated based on certain criteria. The Administrator determines the amount allocated to eligible entities for incentive programs based on population served, targeted population, effectiveness of the program, and prior year's allocation. Allocated funds can cover up to 50% of the cost of establishing and running the program. Entities allocated funds for incentive programs can use up to 50% of the cost for program implementation. They are encouraged to promote fixture recycling programs. Financial incentives can be issued to consumers meeting program requirements, with the entity determining the incentive amount based on their allocation. The Administrator is authorized to allocate funds for incentive programs to various organizations, considering factors like allocation amount, available tax incentives, consumer behavior change, and consumer expenditures. Appropriations of $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2016, $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2017, $150,000,000 for fiscal year 2018, $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2019, and $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2020 are authorized. SEC. 5. EARLY ADOPTER WATER EFFICIENT PRODUCTS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. This section introduces a new incentive program under the Water Advanced Technologies for Efficient Resource Use Act of 2015, where individuals can receive income incentives for adopting water-efficient products. No double benefits are allowed, meaning any amount excluded under this program cannot be used for deductions or credits. The adjusted basis of property is also reduced by the excluded amount. Sec. 139F introduces an incentive program for early adopters of water-efficient products. The amendments apply to taxable years after the enactment of this Act."
