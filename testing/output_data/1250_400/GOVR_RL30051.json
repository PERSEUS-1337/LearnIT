    "content": "The report discusses key base closure developments from the 105th to the 107th Congress, including the signing of legislation in December 2001 for a new base closure round in 2005. The closures and realignments from previous BRAC commissions have resulted in significant savings. Defense spending trends necessitated further base closures, leading to the initiation of the process in 1997 by the Department of Defense. The Department of Defense initiated the process for additional base closures in 1997 due to the continuing downward trend in defense spending and force structure. Secretary of Defense William Cohen called for two more rounds of closures in 1999 and 2001 to achieve a proper balance between infrastructure and force structure, citing the need for significant savings. The Department of Defense planned to reduce infrastructure by 36% and domestic infrastructure by 21% under the QDR. Secretary of Defense Cohen emphasized the need for new base closures to achieve savings for future readiness and weapons programs. However, there was reluctance in Congress to support new rounds of base closures due to concerns about economic and political repercussions in their districts. The Senate Armed Services Committee narrowly failed to approve two more rounds of base closing in 1999 and 2001. Senator Levin and other senators pledged to push for more base closings to reduce excess infrastructure for new weapons funding. The full Senate later voted against the initiative, opting to delay new base closings until DOD developed accurate cost/savings measurements. The substitute amendment delayed new base closings until DOD developed accurate cost/savings measurements. Senator Byron Dorgan, Senator Trent Lott, and Senator Tom Daschle sponsored the amendment, requiring DOD to submit its report to Congress in a timely manner. Representative Joel Hefley opposed new base closure rounds for at least five years, questioning DOD's savings estimates. The Congressional Budget Office was unable to confirm or assess the estimates. The DOD's estimate of savings from base closures was questioned by some, including the Congressional Budget Office. Despite opposition in Congress, senior DOD officials and the President pushed for new base closures to fund priority weapons programs. The Secretary of Defense and Gen. John Shalikashvili called for new rounds of base closures to fund priority weapons programs. The Defense Reform Initiative included two rounds of base closures in 2001 and 2005, aiming for annual savings of $2.8 billion. Support for base closures also came from the report Transforming Defense in December 1997. The Defense Reform Initiative included two rounds of base closures in 2001 and 2005 to fund priority weapons programs, with annual savings of $2.8 billion. Support for additional closures came from the 1997 report Transforming Defense, urging Congress to expedite the process for further base realignment and closure. President Clinton's actions regarding the closure of Air Force maintenance depots were highly contentious. President Clinton opposed closing two Air Force maintenance depots recommended for closure in 1995, arguing that California and Texas had already suffered disproportionately from previous closure rounds. He directed privatization-in-place to prevent job losses in these states, leading to accusations of political meddling. President Clinton faced opposition for his decision to allow private firms to take over maintenance work at air force bases in California and Texas to prevent job losses. Critics accused him of political meddling and favoring these states for reelection. Legislators from other states opposed the privatization plan, fearing job loss and vulnerability to future base closures. Resentment over Clinton's intervention persisted, leading some Members to block DOD's plans for privatization at specific air force bases. Some Members opposed President Clinton's intervention in privatizing maintenance work at air force bases in California and Texas. Legislation was introduced to block DOD's plans unless certain conditions were met, but the provisions were ultimately removed from the bill after facing opposition from Senators representing the affected states. The depot language was approved by the Senate Armed Services Committee but faced opposition from Senators representing California and Texas, leading to the removal of depot-related provisions from the DOD authorization bill. Efforts to restore depot restrictions were made in the House and Senate but ultimately failed. The depot-related language became a major obstacle in reaching a final agreement on the FY1998 defense authorization bill. The FY1998 defense authorization bill faced a major obstacle in reaching a final agreement due to disagreements over depot maintenance operations. A compromise was reached on October 23, increasing the limit on depot work by private contractors to 50%. The House passed the conference report on October 28, but the Senate did not move to a final vote the next day. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison's attempt to postpone the final vote until January 18, 1998 was denied. On November 6, the Senate reached final agreement and passed the conference report by a vote of 90 to 10. President Clinton signed the bill into law on November 18 (P.L. 105-85). The FY1998 defense authorization act included language (Section 2824) that prohibited DOD from planning new base closures until a report on costs and savings was submitted. The report was due by January-February 1999. The Dorgan Amendment required a report on base closure and realignment, with detailed requirements and a deadline set for January-February 1999. The Department of Defense submitted the report early in April 1998. Secretary of Defense Cohen emphasized the need for new legislation, citing excess base structure, potential savings, and imbalances between force and base structures. The Defense Department highlighted significant imbalances between force and base structures, with reductions in Navy ships and Army soldiers compared to base facilities. Base closure reports showed cost savings exceeding estimates, with expected net savings of $14 billion through 2001 and $5.6 billion annually thereafter. The Defense Department expected significant cost savings from base closures during BRAC's 1988-1995 rounds, with initial estimates of $14 billion through 2001 and $5.6 billion annually thereafter. The Pentagon sought additional savings of $3 billion a year from new closure rounds in 2001 and 2005. The report recommended applying previous base closure commission models and highlighted successful economic recovery in impacted communities. A controversial Air Force memo mentioned White House involvement in encouraging Lockheed Martin Corporation to pursue base closure opportunities. The controversy over base closures escalated with a memo citing White House involvement in encouraging Lockheed Martin Corporation to pursue depot maintenance work at McClellan Air Force Base. Members strongly opposed keeping depot maintenance work at McClellan AFB and Kelly AFB, accusing the Administration of meddling in the closure process. Capitol Hill reacted with widespread resistance to the call for new base closure rounds in 1998, with the House National Security Committee and Senate Armed Services Committee opposing any closings in the near future. Capitol Hill faced strong resistance to the call for new base closure rounds in 1998. The House National Security Committee and Senate Armed Services Committee were opposed to any closings in the near future. The Senate committee narrowly defeated a proposed new round of base closures in 2001. Senators McCain and Levin considered seeking support for a floor amendment but abandoned the initiative due to majority opposition. The Senate voted in support of an amendment to make it harder for the Pentagon to proceed with base closings. In June 1998, the Senate voted on Amendment No. 2981 to the FY1999 defense authorization bill, which aimed to make it more difficult for the Pentagon to close bases. The amendment, sponsored by Senator James Inhofe, would have set new thresholds for base closures and realignments, as well as delayed any base closures for four years after a realignment. The intention was to hinder the Department of Defense from quickly closing bases by reducing the number of civilian employees. Additionally, the amendment expressed congressional opposition to any new rounds of base closures. The Inhofe amendment aimed to delay base closures by setting new thresholds and opposing new rounds of closures until previous actions were completed. The Congressional Budget Office found DOD's estimates of savings consistent with its own, stating that BRAC savings are avoided costs that would have been incurred without BRAC actions. The Congressional Budget Office explained that BRAC savings are essentially avoided costs, not actual expenditures, making it difficult for DOD to measure them accurately. While DOD's report outlined potential savings from future base closures, it lacked analysis on which installations might be closed. Additionally, CBO noted the challenge of predicting the impact on local communities without specific data on affected areas. The General Accounting Office reviewed DOD's report on BRAC closures, giving generally good grades and affirming substantial net savings from previous rounds. However, it emphasized that the report provides a rough estimate of costs and savings, not precise accounting. DOD's data systems do not capture all savings associated with BRAC actions. The GAO affirmed that previous BRAC closure rounds resulted in substantial net savings, but noted that DOD's report provides a rough estimate of costs and savings. DOD's data systems do not capture all savings associated with BRAC actions. The report also highlighted that communities affected by prior BRAC actions are rebounding economically. DOD's legislative proposal for two additional BRAC rounds could serve as a starting point for future legislation. The DOD's report suggests that proposed BRAC rounds in 2001 and 2005 would be conducted similarly to prior rounds. Senator John McCain sponsored a bill calling for two new rounds in 2001 and 2003, citing excess infrastructure capacity and potential cost savings from base closures. This was a significant issue for Congress at the time. Senator McCain sponsored a bill (S. 258) for new BRAC rounds in 2001 and 2003, emphasizing cost savings from base closures. Changes included a later start in 2001 and no privatization-in-place without commission approval. Secretary of Defense Cohen also advocated for further base closures, despite political challenges. Senator McCain sponsored a bill for new BRAC rounds in 2001 and 2003, emphasizing cost savings from base closures. Secretary of Defense Cohen also advocated for further base closures, highlighting the financial benefits and the opposition faced from Congress and constituents. In hearings before the House Armed Services Committee, Secretary of Defense Cohen's request for two more base closure rounds faced resistance. The Senate Armed Services Committee rejected new closure rounds in the FY2000 defense authorization bill. Despite efforts by Senators McCain and Levin, the Senate ultimately voted against base closure initiatives. The Administration sought authority to close bases in 2003 and 2005, but faced strong opposition in Congress. The Administration's FY2000 DOD budget proposal sought authority to close more military bases in 2003 and 2005, but Congress chose not to authorize any new rounds of closures in 2000. Secretary of Defense Cohen emphasized the need to improve the base closing process and stated that failure to close more bases could cost the Pentagon $20 billion. Politics would not be allowed to interfere in future base closure rounds. The Administration's FY2000 DOD budget proposal sought authority to close more military bases in 2003 and 2005, but Congress did not authorize new closure rounds in 2000. Senator McCain and Senator Levin's amendment for new rounds in 2003 and 2005 was rejected in a Senate vote. Senator Levin and Senator McCain introduced a bill for two new closure rounds in 2003 and 2005, supported by the Taxpayers for Common Sense organization. Senator John McCain introduced bill S. 397 for new base closures in 2003 and 2005, supported by Taxpayers for Common Sense estimating $21 billion in Pentagon savings. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison expressed concerns about closing domestic military bases prematurely, citing mistakes in past BRAC decisions. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison expressed concerns about closing domestic military bases prematurely, citing mistakes in past BRAC decisions. The Department of Defense urged Congress to approve another round of base closures and realignments due to excess capacity. The Pentagon proposed a new round of base closings and consolidations under the \"Efficient Facilities Initiative of 2001 (EFI)\" starting in 2003, based on the experience of Brooks Air Force Base in San Antonio, TX. Brooks AFB demonstrated transferring property to the local community as a way to reduce excess infrastructure. The Senate approved a new round of base closures and realignments in 2003, following the Department of Defense's proposal under the \"Efficient Facilities Initiative of 2001 (EFI).\" This initiative was based on the experience of Brooks Air Force Base in San Antonio, TX, which demonstrated transferring property to the local community to reduce excess infrastructure. The Senate committee voted for the new round, with General Henry H. Shelton supporting the decision. The full Senate approved a new round of base closures and realignments in 2003 by a margin of 53 to 47, marking their first success in five years of effort. General Henry H. Shelton and Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld emphasized the need to convert excess capacity into war-fighting ability. Opponents argued that the current war on terrorism and uncertain economy made it the worst time to start closing bases. Opponents of the new round of base closures in 2003 argued that the timing was not ideal due to the ongoing war on terrorism and uncertain economy. Senator John McCain emphasized the importance of trusting military leaders, while the House and Senate leaders faced a stalemate over the issue, delaying the passage of S. 1438. The House and Senate leaders faced a stalemate over base closures, delaying the passage of S. 1438. Senator John McCain warned of a potential veto by the President. A compromise was finally reached on December 10, 2001, and the defense authorization bill was signed into law on December 28, 2001. The compromise retained most of the 1990 BRAC Act language with some important changes. Congress extended the authority for one new round of base closures in 2005, and the Secretary of Defense was required to submit force structure plans. The 2005 base closure and realignment act authorized a new round of closures. The Secretary of Defense was required to submit force structure plans, review all types of installations, and certify the need for closure. The commission was expanded to nine members and allowed the Secretary of Defense to testify on proposed base additions. In 1997, the Department of Defense announced the need for two more closure rounds in 1999 and 2001 to reduce excess infrastructure. Despite initial reluctance from Congress, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld eventually gained approval for a new round in 2001. In 2001, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld successfully gained approval from Congress for a new round of closure, which was scheduled for 2005. Communities near military bases are concerned about the survival of their installations and are implementing defensive and offensive strategies to secure their military units/functions. Range encroachment is a growing concern for many communities as bases are increasingly surrounded by urban growth and other factors. Range encroachment is a serious concern for communities near military bases as urban growth and other factors may de-value installations, making them prime candidates for closure in 2005. The 2005 BRAC timeline outlines the process for base closures, including the President's approval or disapproval and Congress's ability to pass a motion of disapproval."
