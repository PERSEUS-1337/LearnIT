PBGC runs insurance programs for single-employer and multiemployer pension plans, insuring about 25,000 plans in FY2018. They pay benefits to 1.4 million people and provide financial assistance to multiemployer pensions. PBGC maintains separate reserve funds for each program and insures about 25,000 DB pension plans. It pays benefits to 1.4 million people and provides financial assistance to multiemployer pensions. PBGC is a government-owned corporation with a three-member board of directors chaired by the Secretary of Labor. The Director of PBGC is appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. The board of directors, chaired by the Secretary of Labor, administers the corporation. The Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Treasury are other members. The Director of PBGC is appointed by the President with Senate advice. ERISA also establishes a seven-member Advisory Committee for three-year terms. MAP-21 altered governance structures, setting the Director's term at five years and requiring the Board to meet at least four times yearly. PBGC is self-supporting and receives no general revenue appropriations. PBGC, established by ERISA, is self-supporting and receives no general revenue appropriations. It is funded through premiums paid by private-sector employers sponsoring DB pension plans, assets from terminated plans, investment income, and recoveries from underfunded plans. The Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980 requires PBGC's finances to be included in federal budget totals. Sponsors of pension plans pay various premiums to PBGC, including flat-rate per-participant premiums. The Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980 requires PBGC's receipts and disbursements to be included in federal budget totals. Sponsors of private-sector pension plans pay premiums to PBGC, including flat-rate and variable-rate premiums for single-employer plans. Premiums for 2019 include an annual flat-rate premium of $80 per participant and an additional variable-rate premium for underfunded plans. Terminated plans also pay a per-participant premium for three years after termination. The sponsors of underfunded single-employer DB pension plans pay an additional annual premium based on unfunded vested benefits. There is a per-participant limit for this premium. Single-employer termination premium is paid for three years following plan termination. Multiemployer DB pension plans pay a flat-rate premium per participant. PBGC only covers DB plans that meet qualification requirements of the Internal Revenue Code. DC plans like 401(k) and 403(b) plans are not insured by PBGC. Plans must meet IRC Section 401 requirements to receive tax benefits. Employer contributions to qualified pension plans are tax-deductible business expenses. Plans must meet requirements of IRC Section 401 to receive tax benefits. Employer contributions to the plan are tax-deductible business expenses. Pension plans must be established as permanent arrangements, provide definite benefits, not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees, and cover a minimum number of employees. Plans excluded from PBGC insurance include governmental, church, and certain professional plans. PBGC's insurance coverage excludes certain pension plans by law, such as governmental, church, and plans for certain professionals with fewer than 25 participants. PBGC operates separate reserve funds for its single-employer and multiemployer insurance programs. In the single-employer program, PBGC becomes trustee of terminated underfunded plans, while in the multiemployer program, PBGC provides loans to insolvent plans. PBGC operates a trust fund for terminated plans, with participants receiving benefits from PBGC. In multiemployer plans, PBGC provides loans to insolvent plans. Employers can voluntarily terminate single-employer plans, with PBGC notified of the termination. PBGC may involuntarily terminate underfunded plans if the sponsor cannot meet pension obligations. PBGC confirms termination requirements are met for plans with sufficient assets, but does not pay benefits in such cases. Benefit liabilities include all earned benefits, vested and nonvested, early retirement supplements, and subsidies. The plan confirms termination requirements are met by participants, including vested and nonvested benefits. Benefit liabilities are covered by assets, with excess amounts potentially recovered by the employer. An asset reversion is included in the employer's gross income and subject to a nondeductible excise tax. When an underfunded plan terminates in a distress or involuntary termination, the plan goes into PBGC receivership. PBGC becomes the trustee of the plan, takes control of any plan assets, and assumes responsibility for liabilities under the plan. PBGC makes payments for benefit liabilities promised under the plan with assets received from two sources: (1) assets in the plan before termination and (2) assets recovered from employers. The balance, if any, of guaranteed benefits owed to beneficiaries is paid from PBGC's revolving funds. Distress Terminations require the employer to meet specific criteria for termination. When an underfunded plan terminates in distress, PBGC becomes the trustee, taking control of assets and liabilities. Payments for benefits come from plan assets and recovered employer assets. Guaranteed benefits are paid from PBGC's funds. Distress terminations require specific criteria to be met for termination. The Single Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1986 added requirements for plan termination, ensuring employer responsibility for underfunded plans unless strict financial need standards are met. PBGC may involuntarily terminate a plan if minimum requirements are not met, either by agreement or court order. PBGC may terminate a plan involuntarily if minimum funding standards are not met, the plan cannot pay benefits when due, there are unfunded vested benefits, or there is a substantial owner who received a distribution over $10,000. A federal court can also order plan termination to protect participants' interests or avoid unreasonable financial deterioration. Termination is required if the plan cannot pay current benefits. Table 2 shows the number of terminations by single-employer DB pension plans since 1974, with PBGC becoming trustee of 4,769 plans from FY1974 to FY2016. Most terminations result in standard terminations, but distress or involuntary terminations lead to liability for the plan's sponsor and controlled group members. Liabilities are measured as the plan's liabilities minus assets at termination, with joint and several liability for the group. Liabilities are typically payable in cash. The liability for a terminated pension plan is the plan's liabilities minus assets, with joint and several liability for the group. Payment is typically in cash or negotiable securities to PBGC. Failure to pay may result in a lien on the employer's property. PBGC's ability to recover assets is limited if the plan sponsor is in bankruptcy. PBGC's benefits depend on statutory limits, plan assets, and recoveries from the employer. When an underfunded pension plan terminates, PBGC's ability to recover assets is limited. PBGC guarantees retirement benefits that were vested at the plan's termination date, excluding benefits solely due to termination. Only monthly installment retirement benefits are guaranteed, with early retirement benefits also covered if they meet certain conditions. Contingent benefits are guaranteed if the triggering event occurs before plan termination. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 phased in PBGC guarantees for contingent benefits over five years. The maximum pension guarantee for workers aged 65 in plans terminating in 2019 is $67,295 annually, adjusted for wage growth. Benefits may decrease if received before age 65 or if provided in a different form than equal monthly payments. The PBGC's annual maximum benefit for individuals starting benefits at ages 60, 65, or 70 varies based on the type of annuity chosen and age at which benefits begin. Reductions in the maximum guarantee occur for benefits starting before age 65, with percentages decreasing over time. Benefits provided in forms other than straight-life annuities also impact the maximum guarantee, depending on the type of benefit and survivor's benefits. The PBGC's maximum benefit decreases for individuals starting benefits before age 65, with reductions of 4% for the first 5 years, 2% for the next 5 years, and 2% for the next 10 years. Only basic benefits are guaranteed, including benefits at normal retirement age, early retirement, disability benefits, and survivor benefits. Vested benefits are insured, with an average monthly benefit of $606 in FY2015. Over 80% of PBGC recipients in single-employer plans received their full benefits, with an average reduction of 28% for those whose benefits were reduced. Terminated plan assets are allocated to pay benefits based on a priority schedule. Assets of a terminated plan are allocated to pay benefits according to a priority schedule established by statute. Some nonguaranteed benefits are payable before certain guaranteed benefits. PBGC pays participants a portion of their unfunded, nonguaranteed benefits based on a ratio of assets recovered from the employer. In the case of multiemployer plans, PBGC insures plan insolvency rather than plan termination. A plan is insolvent when its available resources are not sufficient to pay the plan benefits for the plan year in question. PBGC provides financial assistance to insolvent multiemployer plans by offering loans that are rarely repaid. Repayment terms are regulated, and only one plan has repaid any assistance. PBGC guarantees benefits to multiemployer plans with a different ceiling than single-employer plans, based on a formula tied to years of service. PBGC provides financial assistance to insolvent multiemployer plans through loans, with only one plan having repaid any assistance. The benefit guarantee limit for participants in multiemployer plans is determined by a formula based on years of service. PBGC estimated that 79% of participants in plans receiving financial assistance received their full benefit, but only 49% would in plans needing assistance in the future. Among ongoing plans, the average benefit is almost twice as large as in terminated plans, indicating potential benefit reductions for plans needing PBGC financial assistance in the future. PBGC's net financial position at the end of FY2018 was -$51.4 billion, with assets of $112.3 billion and liabilities of $163.7 billion. PBGC's main assets include its trust fund and revolving funds. PBGC's net financial position at the end of FY2018 was -$51.4 billion, with assets of $112.3 billion and liabilities of $163.7 billion. The trust fund contains assets of pension plans, while the revolving funds include premiums from plan sponsors. PBGC has had a deficit since FY2002, mainly due to economic weaknesses in industries like steel and airlines. The single-employer program had a deficit of $23.3 billion by the end of 2004. The PBGC's single-employer program had a deficit of $23.3 billion by the end of 2004, but showed a surplus in FY2018 due to increased employer premiums. The multiemployer program has reported deficits since FY2002 and is projected to become insolvent in FY2025. Approximately 825,000 participants received monthly payments from PBGC in FY2015, with an average monthly payment of $536. Approximately 825,000 participants received monthly payments from PBGC in FY2015, with an average monthly payment of $536. The median monthly payment was $279. Among retiree payees, the average monthly benefit was $606, and among beneficiary payees, it was $307. Around 40,000 participants received a lump-sum payment in FY2015, with an average amount of $2,054. The net financial position of PBGC's single-employer program improved over the years, showing a surplus of $2.44 billion in FY2018, attributed to factors like investment income and increased premium income. In FY2018, PBGC's single-employer program had a surplus of $2.44 billion, attributed to factors like investment income and increased premium income. The multiemployer program's financial condition worsened, with a deficit of $53.8 billion in FY2018, down from $65.1 billion in FY2017. The deficit in the multiemployer insurance program increased from $8.3 billion in FY2013 to $42.4 billion in FY2014, and $65.1 billion in FY2017, decreasing to $53.8 billion in FY2018. PBGC's budgetary cash flows are based on premium income, interest income, benefit outlays, and trust and revolving funds. Trust fund assets are from pension plans PBGC becomes trustee of, while revolving funds contain plan sponsor premiums and trust fund transfers for benefits. Transfers of assets to the trust fund do not appear in the budget. The PBGC manages assets from terminated pension plans in a nonbudgetary trust fund, with investments totaling $70.2 billion in FY2018. The trust fund assets are allocated 30% for equities and 70% for fixed income. PBGC also has revolving funds funded by plan sponsor premiums, returns on investments, and transfers for benefits. Only three out of seven authorized revolving funds are currently in use. ERISA authorized the creation of seven revolving funds for PBGC, but only three are currently in use. These funds contain premiums from pension plan sponsors, investment returns, and transfers from the trust fund to pay benefits. The assets of the revolving funds totaled $33.2 billion in FY2018 and are invested exclusively in U.S. Treasury securities. Stakeholders have criticized recent premium increases as they are considered federal revenue. The PBGC's funds include outlays for benefit payments and administrative expenses, with receipts from premiums, interest, and reimbursements. Recent premium increases have been criticized for potentially offsetting federal spending and discouraging employers from maintaining pension plans. PBGC's FY2017 Projections Report estimated a deficit in the multiemployer program by FY2025, while projecting a surplus in the single-employer program. PBGC projected a $26 billion surplus for the single-employer program in 10 years, which emerged from deficit by FY2018. However, there is a high likelihood of the multiemployer program becoming insolvent before the end of FY2025, with a 99% chance of insolvency by 2026 due to several large pension plans. The multiemployer program's potential exposure to financial assistance is estimated at $53.8 billion, and current premium levels may not be sufficient to provide continued support. Once resources are depleted, insolvent plans may need to reduce benefits to sustainable levels through premium collections only. The Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 allows insolvent plans to reduce benefits to sustainable levels through premium collections only, potentially improving PBGC's financial condition. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 created a joint select committee to address concerns of stakeholders regarding benefit suspensions and plan partitions. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 established a Joint Select Committee on Solvency of Multiemployer Pension Plans to address concerns of stakeholders. The committee was tasked with improving the solvency of multiemployer pension plans and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, but did not release recommendations by the deadline. Historical data on premium levels for single-employer and multiemployer programs is provided in tables A-1 and A-2."
