The Senate and House debated the effect of this spending on the federal deficit. The House and Senate debated the effect of supplemental spending on the federal deficit in the Pigford II case. Different versions of H.R. 4899 included varying amounts of rescissions and mandatory savings to offset proposed spending. Congressional rules require spending to fit within set totals for discretionary and mandatory spending. The House amended H.R. 4899 on July 1, 2010, including $12.2 billion in rescissions and $4.5 billion in mandatory savings to offset $81.8 billion in proposed spending. Congressional rules require spending to fit within set totals for discretionary and mandatory spending. The final version of H.R. 4899 designated almost all discretionary spending as emergency, exempting it from budget caps. Federal budget rules distinguish between discretionary and mandatory spending. The President's supplemental request includes $64.4 billion in spending, with $46.3 billion as discretionary and $18.1 billion as mandatory. Emergency supplemental appropriations are seen as bypassing budgetary discipline. Congress decides on emergency spending designation based on defined criteria. In dealing with supplemental appropriations, Congress debates increasing spending above current levels and the impact on the deficit. The decision to approve additional spending requires consideration of increasing the budget deficit or offsetting it by cutting federal spending or increasing revenues. Congress follows rules and procedures to address these policy options. Congress must decide whether to increase the budget deficit or offset additional spending by cutting federal spending or increasing revenues. Rules and procedures guide Congress in considering all spending and revenue legislation, including supplemental appropriations bills. These rules include constraints set by the budget resolution and other budget rules like pay-as-you-go rules and the Statutory PAYGO Act of 2010. Congress could exempt spending from these constraints by designating it as an emergency or overseas deployment. Alternatively, points of order could be waived during consideration of the supplemental appropriation measure. Congress must decide whether to increase the budget deficit or offset additional spending by cutting federal spending or increasing revenues. Rules and procedures guide Congress in considering all spending and revenue legislation, including supplemental appropriations bills. Constraints set by the budget resolution and other budget rules like pay-as-you-go rules and the Statutory PAYGO Act of 2010 apply. Congress could exempt spending from these constraints by designating it as an emergency or overseas deployment. Points of order could be waived during consideration of the supplemental appropriation measure. Throughout consideration of H.R. 4899 from late March to late July 2010, various agencies and plaintiffs have cited deadlines for when the supplemental funding would be needed. In a letter dated June 4, 2010, Admiral Thad Allen and Secretary Janet Napolitano urged Congress to raise the cap on funds from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund for response activities due to insufficient funding within two weeks for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The Coast Guard could reach the $150 million cap by June 18, 2010, without tapping into other funding sources. The Coast Guard could reach the $150 million annual cap on the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund by June 18, 2010, prompting Congress to pass a bill raising the cap to $1 billion for the Deepwater Horizon Spill. The Department of Defense received $129.6 billion in bridge funds for FY2010 war funding. The Department of Defense received $129.6 billion in bridge funds for FY2010 war funding, with Secretary of Defense Gates requesting an additional $33 billion for troops deploying to Afghanistan. The Army, Navy, and USMC could cover war operations through August 2010, with concerns raised about lack of progress. The Army and Marine Corps could run out of funding in August 2010, leading to potential furloughs for civilians and unpaid active duty military. Secretary of Defense Gates expressed concerns about the lack of progress on supplemental funding and urged passage by July 4 to avoid disruptions to base budget programs. The Army and Marine Corps could face funding shortages in August 2010, potentially leading to furloughs for civilians and unpaid active duty military. The services still had available funds in their War Bridge Operation and Maintenance accounts, with the Army having $15.3 billion and the Marine Corps having $1.2 billion. Monthly spending was expected to increase by 20%, allowing the Army and Marine Corps to rely on appropriated war bridge funds through August. The Army and Marine Corps faced potential funding shortages in August 2010, with available funds in their War Bridge Operation and Maintenance accounts. Monthly spending was expected to increase by 20%, allowing them to rely on appropriated war bridge funds through August. Services tapped base budget funding to finance war funding temporarily, lasting through the end of July and into August. FEMA limited fund releases for claims to make the Disaster Relief Fund last longer. In order to make the Disaster Relief Fund last longer, FEMA limited fund releases for claims, delayed interagency reimbursements, and recovered funds from previous years. Despite earlier estimates of insolvency by June, FEMA had a balance of $952 million in the Disaster Relief Fund as of June 7, 2010, which could last through August 2010 if spending continued at the normal rate of $350 million per month. FEMA limited fund releases for immediate needs, with a backlog of $1.4 billion in projects awaiting payment. Congress did not enact the $1.15 billion appropriation for the Pigford II court case settlement by the mid-April 2010 deadline. The Pigford II court case settlement deadline was not met by Congress, with a backlog of $1.4 billion in projects awaiting payment. The settlement is a priority for the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the White House. The deadline for the Cobell suit settlement is August 6, 2010, with uncertainty about further extensions. Congress raised concerns about evaluating spending on the Afghan War, preventing corruption in foreign aid for Afghanistan and Iraq, monitoring Haiti relief funds, and determining emergency domestic spending. The Administration requested $5.1 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) due to anticipated fund depletion by May or June 2010. FEMA sent guidance in February 2010 to reduce expenditure rates in response to the expected shortage. FEMA projected the Disaster Relief Fund would run out in May or June 2010, prompting measures to limit expenditures and delay payments for certain projects. Congress raised questions about FEMA's budgeting practices and delays in requesting disaster relief funds earlier. The Obama Administration criticized previous administrations for unrealistic budgeting practices in the FY2010 request for the Disaster Relief Fund. Congress provided $1.6 billion, $400 million below the request. In FY2011, the Administration requested $1.9 billion for the DRF, citing 59 disasters in 2009 and 18 in progress. The Obama Administration requested $1.9 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund in FY2011, citing 59 disasters in 2009 and 18 in progress. The need for additional funding is due to arbitration rulings, including those related to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Congress may need to consider higher funding levels to avoid future supplemental requests. The Obama Administration requested $1.9 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund in FY2011 due to numerous disasters. Congress may need to consider higher funding levels to avoid future supplemental requests. FEMA provided limited information to justify the need for supplemental funding, citing an arbitration ruling awarding $475 million to the Charity Hospital in New Orleans. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 provides $5.1 billion for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 provides $5.1 billion for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund, with $396 million allocated for various disaster relief efforts. The Senate Appropriations Committee expressed dissatisfaction with the timeliness of information provided by OMB regarding funding requirements. The Senate Appropriations Committee (SAC) criticized OMB for delays in providing information on disaster relief funding. The FY2011 request is expected to fall short by $1-2 billion for previous disasters like Hurricane Katrina. H.R. 4899 includes funding for various agencies: $100 million for HUD, $227 million for Army Corps of Engineers, $49 million for Commerce, and $18 million for Agriculture. The final version of H.R. 4899 allocates funding for various federal projects, including flood control, coastal emergencies, recovery projects for the Mississippi River, drought relief, economic development assistance, and emergency forest restoration. It also stipulates a federal cost share of no less than 90% for flood damage recovery in Rhode Island and Tennessee. FEMA is directed to create an interagency taskforce to address community concerns related to flood map updates. Additionally, the DOD and State Department/USAID FY2010 supplemental requests provide funding for deploying troops to Afghanistan and economic assistance to support military operations. The FY2010 supplemental requests provide funding primarily to deploy additional troops to Afghanistan and for economic assistance to support military operations. The Obama Administration requested a supplemental appropriation of $33 billion for FY2010 to deploy 30,000 troops to Afghanistan. The additional troops aim to reverse a deteriorating security situation, target the insurgency, secure key population centers, and train Afghan forces to transfer responsibility to them by July 2011. As of June 1, almost 94,000 troops were in Afghanistan, with the remainder expected to arrive by September. The U.S. is deploying additional troops to Afghanistan to address security concerns and train Afghan forces for a transfer of responsibility by July 2011. Troop levels have increased from 46,000 in May 2009 to 98,000 by this fall, with a total of 30,000 troops added in two separate increases approved by Presidents Bush and Obama. The FY2011 budget includes funding for an additional 4,000 support troops. The troop levels in Afghanistan increased from 46,000 in May 2009 to 98,000 by the fall of that year, with additional increases planned. NATO allies also increased their troop levels to 48,000 by March 2010. The total number of foreign troops in Afghanistan is expected to reach about 148,000, with Afghan security forces totaling 243,000. The Defense Department requested $33 billion for additional troops in Afghanistan, training Iraq Security Forces, and fuel costs, with total war spending in FY2010 rising to $160 billion. In FY2010, additional funds were allocated for troops in Afghanistan, training Iraq Security Forces, and fuel costs in DOD's budget. Total war spending increased to $160 billion, with $99 billion for Afghanistan and $61 billion for Iraq. The total war funding for Afghanistan and Iraq in FY2010 was $314.1 billion and $706.2 billion respectively. If the FY2011 request is approved, the total war funding would rise to $427.7 billion for Afghanistan and $752 billion for Iraq. The cost of Iraq has increased to $752 billion with the pending FY2011 request. President Obama's new strategy in Afghanistan includes a review in December 2010, with a potential minor drawdown in July 2011. Secretary Gates mentioned that the transition process could take several years. The U.S. drawdown in July 2011 may be minor, with Secretary Gates and Admiral Mullen emphasizing a transition process based on conditions on the ground. General Petraeus described the initiative as an 18-month campaign, to be evaluated in September 2011. Concerns were raised in Congress about the timing of the evaluation and the long-term future of U.S. military involvement. Amendments to increase congressional participation in decision-making were debated and rejected. Amendments were debated and rejected to increase congressional participation in decision-making about the U.S. military commitment in Afghanistan. Amendment No. 3 proposed cutting off all funding for Afghanistan, Amendment No. 4 aimed to limit DOD funding to troop withdrawal, and Amendment No. 5 required a new National Intelligence Estimate with a timetable for troop redeployment. Concerns arose after the operation in Marjah, Helmand Province, with mixed reports on Taliban presence. The defeat of an amendment by a vote of 162 to 260 raised concerns about the situation in Afghanistan, particularly after the operation in Marjah, Helmand Province. The $33 billion DOD supplemental request included $30 billion for Afghanistan, with funds allocated for various purposes such as military operations, force protection, training of Afghan security forces, and equipment reconstitution. The $33 billion DOD supplemental request includes funds for military operations, force protection, training Afghan security forces, equipment reconstitution, military intelligence, national intelligence, military construction, and defeating Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). Some policymakers estimate the cost of deploying 30,000 more troops at $1 million per troop, but this average does not account for the different types of activities and programs being requested. Functional categories have been developed by DOD to describe the request, ranging from \"Operations\" to Coalition Support Funds for Pakistan's counter-terror operations. The DOD's supplemental request includes funds for various activities such as military operations, force protection, training Afghan security forces, and defeating IEDs. Functional categories have been developed to describe the request, with different categories increasing at varying rates. DOD estimates for deploying 30,000 troops to Afghanistan differ from CBO's estimates, with the per troop cost being $875,000 according to DOD and $467,000 according to CBO. The DOD's FY2010 cost estimates for deploying 30,000 troops to Afghanistan show a per troop cost of $875,000, which is almost double CBO's estimate of $467,000. The high operations costs in the supplemental request are attributed to setting up facilities in southern Afghanistan. In 2009, $5 billion of DOD's Operation and Maintenance funding was transferred due to concerns about accurate budgeting for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. In 2009, $5 billion of DOD's Operation and Maintenance funding was transferred due to concerns about accurate budgeting for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. DOD's estimates for deploying 30,000 troops to Afghanistan in FY2010 may be high, as obligations reported are only 22% of the total requested amount. Monthly spending would need to double in the next seven months to use all funds, indicating that DOD's estimates may be somewhat inflated. To fully utilize the allocated funds for deploying 30,000 troops to Afghanistan in FY2010, monthly spending would need to more than double in the next seven months. The Department of Defense (DOD) requested an additional $2.6 billion to accelerate training and expand the Afghan Security Forces Fund (ASFF). Concerns were raised about the need for all the additional funds, the achievability of DOD's plan, and oversight issues. The new plan aims to increase Afghan Security forces to 243,000 by October 2010 and 305,600 by FY2011. The new plan aims to increase Afghan Security forces to 243,000 by October 2010 and 305,600 by FY2011. The Afghan Army would grow from 97,000 in November 2009 to 134,000 in October 2010 and 171,000 in October 2011, a 76% increase in two years. The Afghan Police would grow from 93,800 in November 2009 to 109,000 this October and to 134,000 in October 2011, a 43% increase over two years. NATO partners endorsed these increases in January 2010. DOD's additional $2.6 billion request is to sustain the growth of the Afghan Army and provide infrastructure and equipment. Congress has appropriated $25.5 billion for the Afghan Security Forces so far. The Department of Defense (DOD) is requesting an additional $2.6 billion to support the growth of the Afghan Army to exceed 134,000 soldiers, increase pay, and provide infrastructure and equipment. Congress has already allocated $25.5 billion for Afghan Security Forces. General McChrystal proposed doubling the Afghan Army and Police to 400,000, but this goal is seen as aspirational and not endorsed by the Obama Administration. Training for Afghan Security forces is managed by DOD and the State Department, with support from U.S. military personnel, NATO coalition teams, and private entities. General Mullen described the goal of expanding the Afghan Army as aspirational and not endorsed by the Obama Administration. Training for Afghan Security forces is managed jointly by DOD and the State Department, with involvement from U.S. military personnel, NATO coalition teams, and private contractors. However, there have been numerous challenges in carrying out this training, including high attrition rates, leadership deficiencies, logistical limitations, and security threats such as corruption and attacks on recruits and police officers. Coordination issues between DOD, State Department, and NATO coalition training efforts, as well as reliance on private contractors, have also been persistent problems. The spring 2010 hearings on Afghan police training highlighted various problems, including difficulties in coordinating training efforts, reliance on private contractors with performance issues, shortages of personnel to manage contracts, and insufficient oversight. Despite additional trainers sent by DOD and requests for more from NATO allies, there are reported shortages, leading to concerns about reliance on contractors. Senator Levin raised concerns about a shortfall in trainers for the Afghan army and police, as noted in DOD's April 1, 2010 report. Senator Levin raised concerns about a shortfall in trainers for the Afghan army and police, as noted in DOD's April 1, 2010 report. Members may want to know how many trainers are needed and how the current ramp-up is affected by shortfalls in personnel availability. These shortfalls could hamper the training of Afghan security forces. The plan to speed up training of the Afghan police could have been affected by a sustained bid-protest, delaying contract award. DOD still has almost $3.6 billion in funding available from FY2009 and FY2010, with an additional six months available for FY2010 even without the requested $2.6 billion in the supplemental. In FY2009 and FY2010, DOD had almost $3.6 billion in funding available. DOD obligated funds at a rate of $540 million a month in FY2010. Some Members question the need for emergency war supplementals. DOD's original FY2010 request was enacted in the DOD Appropriations Act. The emergency designation for the supplemental request is debated. The emergency designation for the FY2010 supplemental request is debated, with some arguing that certain parts of DOD's request, such as funding for training in the Iraqi Security Forces Fund and offsetting fuel increases, may not be directly related to new deployments and could be considered part of DOD's regular FY2011 appropriation request. Congress has become less willing to fund Iraqi security forces, and the necessity of certain funding allocations, like the $1 billion for the ISFF, could be challenged. The $1 billion for the ISFF is argued to be necessary for modernization efforts in Iraq, despite potential challenges to its emergency designation. Additionally, $2 billion for fuel costs in DOD's base budget could be seen as unnecessary. The $1.7 billion for equipment reset is also debated, with concerns about the gradual impact of additional combat operations on war-worn equipment in Afghanistan. The $1.7 billion allocated for equipment reset, to replace war-worn equipment, is debated due to concerns about the gradual impact of additional combat operations in Afghanistan. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 provided DOD with $32.9 billion, $148 million less than the DOD request, with adjustments made for various accounts including military personnel, operation and maintenance, and contingency construction projects. The Senate version of H.R. 4899 included adjustments to military personnel, operation and maintenance, and procurement accounts, ultimately adopted by the House and enacted. Both versions approved funding for training Afghan and Iraq security forces. The final version also required assessments of threats from Guantanamo detainees but dropped a provision for $300 million for the Office of Economic Adjustment. The final version of the bill approved funding for training Afghan and Iraq security forces, included assessments of threats from Guantanamo detainees, and allocated $529 million for military construction, with $521 million for Afghanistan. This raised concerns about whether DOD is building temporary facilities or permanent bases in Afghanistan. Congress allowed for a \"long-term presence\" but prohibited \"permanent stationing\" of U.S. troops in Afghanistan. The DOD requested $521 million for war-related construction in Afghanistan, raising concerns about permanent bases. Congress allowed for a \"long-term presence\" but prohibited \"permanent stationing\" of troops. The construction aims to support the deployment of 30,000 additional U.S. troops with basic infrastructure like roads, runways, and quarters. Army and Air Force projects are split evenly, focusing on southern provinces. The construction in Afghanistan aims to expand airfield capacity for increased airlift and combat operations, increase logistics capacity, and provide necessary infrastructure. The supplemental request was split evenly between Army and Air Force projects, with Army projects focused in southern provinces and Air Force projects planned in various provinces to support airlift and special operations forces. Army construction includes waste management systems, fuel storage facilities, utilities infrastructure, gravel roads, and a command headquarters at Forward Operating Base Tombstone. Air Force construction includes a runway and associated apron. The construction projects in Afghanistan include facilities such as perimeter security, helicopter aprons, and airstrips at various locations across the country. Congress has raised concerns about the long-term implications of this spending on military construction in Afghanistan. The U.S. has a long-term troop commitment in Afghanistan, with Congress aiming to prevent the establishment of permanent military bases in the country. This is reflected in the FY2010 National Defense Authorization Act and the FY2009 Supplemental Appropriation. The FY2009 Supplemental Appropriation prohibits the establishment of permanent military bases in Afghanistan but allows for long-term presence support through Operation & Maintenance funds. The distinction between projects for permanent stationing and long-term presence is unclear, leading to occasional denial of funds for projects signaling permanency. The funding for facilities to support permanent stationing of U.S. troops is banned, but facilities for a long-term presence are permitted. The distinction between the two types of projects is unclear, leading to occasional denial of funds for projects signaling permanency. Congress has granted flexibility to use Operation & Maintenance funds for urgent military operational requirements of a temporary nature since FY2004. Since FY2004, Congress has allowed the use of Operation & Maintenance funds for urgent military operational requirements of a temporary nature. The authority was renewed annually until FY2009, with a cap of $100-200 million and restrictions on construction at long-term presence military installations. In 2009, the law was amended to permit $200 million for projects in U.S. Central Command and $300 million for construction in Afghanistan. The FY2010 NDAA extended the authority with a $500 million total limit for Central Command projects. The FY2010 NDAA extended the authority to use O&M funding for military construction, with a $500 million total limit for projects in Central Command. DOD added $409 million from O&M accounts for construction in Afghanistan in FY2009, nearly doubling the total construction investment to $1.4 billion. If DOD used the full $500 million in O&M available for military construction in Afghanistan in FY2010, the total would reach $2.4 billion, almost doubling the prior seven-year investment. DOD significantly increased construction investment in Afghanistan, with plans to reach $2.4 billion in FY2010. Key bases like Bagram Air Base and Kandahar Air Base received substantial funding, indicating DOD's commitment to the region. Additional legislative proposals could further increase military construction funding in Afghanistan. The DOD requested $248 million for a total of $1.6 billion if approved, with significant funding allocated to bases like Kandahar Air Base and Forward Operating Base Tombstone/Bastion. A new proposal would allow DOD to use O&M funds for unspecified military construction projects up to $3 million each in support of contingency operations until September 30, 2012, with no total limit on spending. The DOD proposed raising the per project cap for minor construction projects to $3 million for contingency operations worldwide. There would be no limit on the total amount of O&M funds that could be used for military construction. Quarterly reporting to congressional defense committees would be required within 60 days. Concerns were raised about the urgency of the $521 million supplemental request given the available budget authority of $2.1 billion from previous acts. DOD has $2.1 billion in unobligated funds for military construction projects in Afghanistan. In FY2009, $607 million was obligated, but in FY2010, the average monthly obligation fell to $26 million. To use all funds by the end of the fiscal year, DOD would need to increase monthly obligations to $300 million. $700 million must be obligated by September 30, 2010, and $1.4 billion by September 30, 2011. To spend FY2009 funds, DOD would need to increase the monthly obligation rate to $100 million. The Department of Defense has $2.1 billion in unobligated funds for military construction projects in Afghanistan. To meet obligations, DOD would need to increase monthly obligations significantly. The FY2010 supplemental request could be considered part of DOD's FY2011 war request for better assessment. Total funding for military construction in H.R. 4899 was $657 million, including $649 million for war-related construction in Afghanistan. The supplemental request for military construction projects in Afghanistan was part of the FY2011 war request. Total funding in H.R. 4899 was $657 million, with $649 million allocated for war-related construction in Afghanistan. The Senate added $127.5 million above the request to accelerate projects funded by the Air Force using O&M monies for contingency-related projects. The Military Construction budget request should include known contingency construction requirements. The FY2010 Supplemental request addressed foreign economic assistance for Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan. The bill did not include funding for a new Soldier Readiness Processing Center at Fort Hood, TX. The FY2010 Supplemental request addressed specific foreign economic assistance and operational requirements for Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan. The total budget request for war-related programs was $4.46 billion, with $1.8 billion allocated to the State Department for personnel and infrastructure. The Foreign Operations segment, totaling $2.6 billion, aimed to support U.S. security, economic growth, social services, and democratization objectives in these countries.

It addresses the urban-rural imbalance in the country, focusing on decentralization to strengthen local governance and infrastructure. The supplemental request for Haiti's development strategy aims to address the urban-rural imbalance by decentralizing resources and services. This includes meeting the immediate needs of displaced populations in less developed areas and strengthening local governance, infrastructure, and agriculture. Scientists are assisting in selecting less vulnerable areas for development, but officials warn of the high cost and potential issues with forcibly relocating populations. Experts emphasize the need for targeted poverty reduction programs and building the capacity of Haitians to eventually take over projects. Aid organizations in Haiti face challenges balancing effectiveness and efficiency in poverty reduction programs. Capacity building is crucial, but it requires more time, funding, and personnel than short-term contracts allow.

The House passed a bill with substantial funding to prevent layoffs of teachers, law enforcement officials, and firefighters, as well as provide additional Pell Grants. Funding for these proposals was not included in the final version of H.R. 4899, but may be included in other bills. The Senate passed an amendment to provide $10 billion for the Education Jobs Fund and increase federal Medicaid reimbursements to free up additional funds for states. The bill is offset over ten years. The House plans to consider a bill that would provide funding to prevent teacher layoffs and increase federal Medicaid reimbursements. The bill is offset over ten years and aims to free up additional funds for states to retain law enforcement and firefighters. President Obama and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan emphasized the need for federal funds to prevent teacher layoffs, but a budget request for funds was not made. The final version of the bill did not include funds to prevent teacher layoffs as it was not included in the Senate version passed by the House. The House initially included $10 billion for the Education Jobs Fund to save or create 140,000 education jobs, but later adopted the Senate version which cut funding for Race to the Top grants, Teacher Incentive Fund, and Charter School Program. The Administration threatened to veto the bill due to potential damage to school reform efforts. An estimate from the American Association of School Administrators warned of potential layoffs of 275,000 teachers and school staff, leading to increased pupil-to-teacher ratios. In 49 states, around 275,000 teachers and school staff face potential layoffs in the 2010-2011 school year without additional funding. The American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA) provided some relief, but pupil-to-teacher ratios may still increase. The proposed Education Jobs Fund aims to distribute funds to states quickly to prevent layoffs, with states needing to meet maintenance of effort requirements to receive funding. The HAC majority draft bill would distribute funds to states within 45 days of enactment for schools before the fall opening. States must meet maintenance of effort requirements to receive funds, with additional requirements for Texas. The final version of H.R. 4899 did not include supplemental funding for the COPS hiring program. The proposed funding was dropped from the House-amended version approved on July 1, 2010. This funding would have helped law enforcement agencies facing budget shortfalls, but may only provide a temporary solution if tax revenues do not rebound. The House-amended version of H.R. 4899, approved on July 1, 2010, proposed supplemental funding for law enforcement agencies facing budget shortfalls. However, the funding was later receded from by the House on July 27, 2010. The $1.179 billion proposed might not be sufficient to meet the demand for hiring funds, as seen in previous applications for COPS funding. Additionally, there were no funds allocated for firefighter hiring and retention in the enacted version of the bill. In a May draft, HAC proposed $500 million for the SAFER program, which provides grants to fire departments for hiring and maintaining firefighters. The House July-amended version did not allocate funds for this program. Proponents argue that budget shortfalls may reduce firefighter staffing levels, while opponents believe current funding levels are sufficient. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 includes $32 million for the Department of Agriculture to address credit shortages in the farm loan program and rural housing loan guarantee program due to high demand for government loans since 2008. This funding offsets $50 million from a mandatory bioenergy program.

Funding for the Department of Energy's Loan Guarantee Program was not included in the FY2010 supplemental. The FY2010 supplemental bill included funding for various programs such as WIC, rural development, and the Natural Resources Conservation Service. The Administration's FY2011 request for DOE's Loan Guarantee Program is pending, with hopes to accelerate clean energy projects. The House version included $180 million for innovative energy technology projects, supporting nuclear power facilities and renewable energy projects. The House version of the FY2010 supplemental bill included $180 million for the DOE Loan Guarantee Program to support innovative energy technology projects, with $90 million for advanced nuclear power facilities and $90 million for renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. This funding could potentially support up to $18 billion in loan guarantee authority. The DOE requested additional loan guarantee authority for nuclear power projects and appropriated credit subsidy costs for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects. The Loan Guarantee Program was established in 2005 to support energy technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with the first significant funding in FY2009 through the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act. The American Reinvestment and Recovery Act in FY2009 provided $6 billion for commercial renewable energy projects. $2 billion was later re-programmed for the Cash-for-Clunkers program. The House version of H.R. 4899 did not include $4.95 billion for the Federal Pell Grant Program. Additional funding of $5.7 billion may be needed for FY2011. The Federal Pell Grant Program received a baseline discretionary maximum award level of $4,860 in AY 2011-12. An additional $5.7 billion in funding may be provided in the annual FY2011 appropriation for the program. The program, authorized by Title IV of the HEA, is the largest federal source of grant aid for postsecondary education, benefiting approximately 8.3 million undergraduate students in FY2010. The Federal Pell Grant Program, funded through discretionary appropriations, benefits 8.3 million undergraduate students. In FY2010, the Administration requested $600 million for border security, with $399 million for DHS and $201 million for DOJ. This includes funding for new Border Patrol agents, unmanned aerial detection systems, ICE agents, CBP officers, and CBP canine teams to enhance border enforcement operations along the Southwest border. In FY2010, $297 million would be used to hire 1,000 new Border Patrol agents, $37 million for two new unmanned aerial detection systems, $53 million for 160 new ICE agents, $6.5 million for 30 new CBP officers, and $6 million for 20 new CBP canine teams to improve border enforcement operations along the Southwest border. Additionally, $201 million of DOJ funding would increase the presence of Federal law enforcement in the Southwest border districts by adding ATF Gunrunner Teams, FBI Hybrid Task Forces, DEA agents, equipment, operational support, attorneys, immigration judges, and support for detention and incarceration costs for criminal aliens. Funding would also support Mexican law enforcement operations with ballistic analysis, DNA analysis, information sharing, technical capabilities, and technical assistance. The FY2010 Supplemental, P.L. 111-212 did not include funding for border security, but H.R. 5875 passed with $701 million for border security. Both the Administration and H.R. 5875 allocated $201 million to DOJ for border security efforts. The Administration also requested $118 million for activities related to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The Administration requested $118 million in discretionary supplemental appropriations primarily for activities related to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, including funding for an Oil Spill Relief Employment Assistance program, Department of the Interior activities, and National Emergency Grants. The government allocated funds for various activities related to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, including an Oil Spill Relief Employment Assistance program, additional inspections by the Department of the Interior, economic mitigation by NOAA, enforcement actions by the Department of Justice, research by NOAA, economic assistance grants by the Economic Development Administration, and other related activities. The government allocated $94 million for oil-spill related programs, including research, economic assistance, and environmental impact studies. This funding includes grants for economic recovery plans, studies on long-term impacts, and enhanced seafood inspection technologies. The government allocated $94 million for oil-spill related programs, including research, economic assistance, and environmental impact studies. This includes funding for an employment assistance program, NOAA fisheries disaster relief, stock assessment of Gulf fisheries, and a study on the long-term effects on the ecosystem in the Gulf. The House approved $50 million for employment assistance and $12 million for a National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill. Additionally, the Army Corps of Engineers can use a portion of discretionary funds for dredging to mitigate oil spill impacts. The Administration requested $17.9 billion for additional mandatory spending, including benefits for veterans exposed to Agent Orange and settling the Cobell case about Indian land trusts. The Administration requested $17.9 billion in additional mandatory spending, including benefits for veterans exposed to Agent Orange, settling the Cobell case about Indian land trusts, and discrimination claims of black farmers. The Secretary of the Department of Veterans' Affairs has authority to determine service-connected health problems for veterans exposed to hazardous substances like Agent Orange. This spending is not counted as new federal spending for budget enforcement purposes. The Administration proposed additional mandatory spending of $17.9 billion for benefits related to Agent Orange exposure, settling the Cobell case, and discrimination claims of black farmers. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs has authority to determine service-connected health problems for veterans exposed to hazardous substances like Agent Orange. This spending may not be subject to budget procedural constraints like PAYGO rules. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs has the authority to establish presumptions of service connection for conditions related to Agent Orange exposure, such as Parkinson's disease, ischemic heart disease, and hairy cell/B cell leukemia for Vietnam veterans. The estimated cost for these new presumptions is $13.4 billion in FY2010, benefiting approximately 86,000 veterans. Additionally, some veterans may receive retroactive benefits or an increase in disability ratings. The VA estimates that approximately 86,000 veterans will receive retroactive benefits for new presumptive conditions related to Agent Orange exposure. Disability compensation payments will begin once final regulations are published, with an estimated cost of $13.4 billion in FY2010. The Secretary of the VA has the authority to compensate veterans based on the new presumptions, with potential differences in estimated costs between CBO and OMB. The CBO estimated that $5 billion, not $13.4 billion, would be needed in FY2010 for additional veterans benefits related to Agent Orange. Differences in estimates are due to uncertainties about regulations and processing times. H.R. 4899 includes the $13.4 billion, with a provision delaying payments until after Congressional review. Claims related to Agent Orange will not impact veterans' disability compensation amounts. The Administration requested $4.6 billion for these claims. The Administration requested $4.6 billion to settle two longstanding cases against the government: $1.15 billion for the Pigford Black Farmers Discrimination Case; and $3.4 billion for the Cobell Indian Trust Litigation Settlement. Claimants argue that settlements could be voided if funds are not appropriated by a certain date, but deadlines have been extended. The FY2010 budget supplemental requested $1.15 billion to settle the Pigford II discrimination case brought by 70,000 black farmers. The FY2010 budget supplemental requested $1.15 billion for the Pigford II discrimination case brought by 70,000 black farmers against the U.S. Department of Agriculture. A settlement was announced on February 18, 2010, but funds were not appropriated by the deadline. The settlement is final and non-appealable, with a provision stating that claimants could void the settlement if funds were not allocated by March 31, 2010. The Administration also requested $3.4 billion for the Cobell Indian Trust Litigation Settlement in FY2010. The Administration requested $3.4 billion in FY2010 supplemental appropriations to settle litigation over mismanagement of individual Indian trust fund accounts in the Cobell v. Salazar case. $1.4 billion would be distributed to plaintiffs, $2 billion for land interests consolidation, and $60 million for education scholarships. The settlement requires legislative authorization by August 6, 2010, with the deadline recently extended for a fifth time. The Cobell lawsuit arose from Interior's inability to accurately account for payments into and from Individual Indian Monies trust accounts. The Cobell lawsuit stemmed from Interior's inability to accurately account for payments into and from Individual Indian Monies (IIM) trust accounts. The settlement may be supported by both parties to end years of costly litigation. Some Indian organizations and plaintiffs oppose the settlement, while others approve. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 does not include the requested $4.6 billion appropriation for the Cobell settlement. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 does not include the $4.6 billion appropriation for the Cobell settlement. Some Indian organizations and plaintiffs oppose congressional approval of the settlement, while others approve. House and Senate rules require offsetting direct spending for settlements, which may be proposed in a separate bill by Senator Reid. The final version of H.R. 4899 did not include provisions for the Cobell and Pigford II court settlements, which were dropped from the bill. Senator Reid may propose passing these provisions in a separate bill or attaching them to other legislation. Funding for the settlements would require offsets or savings in mandatory programs under PAYGO provisions. Additionally, the bill did not include $4.68 billion in mandatory savings over ten years from provisions aimed at reducing government medical care expenditures. These provisions would increase rebates states receive from drug manufacturers and give the FTC more authority to limit deals between brand name and generic drug makers. The amended House version of the supplemental appropriations act aimed to amend Medicaid law by including more forms of drugs in the calculation of Average Manufacturer Price (AMP). This would help ensure that Medicaid rebates for prescription drugs are consistently calculated, but certain forms of outpatient drugs were initially omitted from the AMP definition. Additionally, the bill would give the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) more authority to limit deals between brand name and generic drug makers to reduce drug expenditures for federal programs. The House proposed amending Medicaid law to include injected, infused, and inhaled forms of outpatient drugs in the calculation of Average Manufacturer Price (AMP) for Medicaid rebates. This change was estimated to reduce federal Medicaid expenditures by $2.1 billion over 10 years, but the Senate did not accept this provision. The Senate did not accept the provisions to add additional drug forms to the definition of AMP that was included in the House amended version. A provision in S.Amdt. 4567 seeks to stop pay-to-delay arrangements in the pharmaceutical industry. Since the Hatch-Waxman Act in 1984, the FDA can approve generic drugs after the patent period ends, allowing for lower prices. Pay-to-delay agreements between brand-name and generic drug companies delay generic entry, increasing costs for consumers and the government. The Hatch-Waxman Act in 1984 allows FDA approval of generic drugs after patent expiration, leading to lower prices. Pay-to-delay agreements between brand-name and generic drug companies delay generic entry, increasing costs for consumers and the government. Proposed provisions aim to make such agreements unlawful, potentially reducing federal budget deficits by $2.68 billion over 2010-2020. The Senate did not accept the Preserving Access to Generic Drugs provisions included in the July House amended version, which aimed to reduce federal budget deficits by $2.68 billion over 2010-2020. The enacted version also did not include $538 million for initiatives to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse in federal programs. These funds were intended for various federal agencies to prevent improper payments and illegal activities. The $538 million in Waste, Fraud, and Abuse (WFA) funding in the House July amended version was allocated for enhanced tax enforcement by IRS and the HHS Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Account. Funds would be used for Medicare Advantage, Medicare drug benefits, Medicaid, and the State Children's Health Insurance Program, as well as for the HHS Office of the Inspector General and the Department of Justice for fraud and abuse investigations. Additionally, funds would support continuing disability reviews for Social Security Disability Insurance beneficiaries and eligibility redeterminations for Supplemental Security Income recipients. The House allocated $60 million to the Department of Justice for HHS fraud and abuse investigations, $38 million for SSA disability reviews, and $5 million for DOL reemployment reviews. The funds were not emergency designated and would be available until September 2011 for DOL, SSA, and IRS, and until September 30, 2012 for HHS. CBO estimated a $538 million increase in the federal deficit in 2010 with no estimated savings. The Administration also proposed expanding Coast Guard funds from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund for response activities. The Administration proposed to increase federal budget deficits by expanding Coast Guard funds from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund for response activities and setting up a new unemployment assistance program for those not eligible for other benefits. This would involve a 1 cent increase in the tax per barrel of oil to replenish the trust fund. The Administration's proposal includes a tax increase per barrel of oil to replenish the trust fund and a new unemployment benefit program for those affected by the spill. The proposal authorizes mandatory appropriations as \"advances\" from the trust fund, with later withdrawals not requiring appropriations. The Coast Guard would be authorized to make advances from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund to respond to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The Administration's proposal includes $125 million in mandatory appropriations, with $150 million in spending offset by $25 million recovered from responsible parties. The Coast Guard would be authorized to make advances of $100 million from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, with a proposed cap increase to $1.5 billion for total expenditure. The Office of Management and Budget estimates $1.575 billion would be available for obligation by the end of FY2010. The Office of Management and Budget estimates $1.575 billion would be available for obligation by the end of FY2010. The proposed increase in the limitation on annual advances from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund would apply exclusively to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill to enhance federal emergency response capabilities. The Coast Guard would be required to notify Congress of any advanced funds for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill within 7 days. The final version of H.R. 4899 included provisions for the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund that were the same as those in legislation, P.L. 111-191 (S. 3473), which raises the cap to $1 billion. The legislation P.L. 111-191 (S. 3473) raised the cap to $1 billion for the Deepwater Horizon spill, allowing $100 million withdrawals with 7-day notifications to Congress. CBO estimated $50 million in FY2010 offset by reimbursements in FY2012. The amount available to the Coast Guard would depend on the number of advances drawn from the trust fund, up to the $1 billion cap. Reimbursements would depend on liability enforcement under the Oil Pollution Act. The final version of H.R. 4899 did not include the proposed new mandatory unemployment compensation program. Congress addressed the Administration's $64.3 billion request for supplemental spending for FY2010 multiple times between March 24, 2010, and July 27, 2010. The House and Senate passed H.R. 4899 with various spending allocations, including disaster relief, war funding, and Haiti relief and reconstruction. The Senate passed H.R. 4899 on May 27, 2010, with $59.3 billion in spending for various purposes including disaster relief, war funding, and Haiti relief. The House later adopted the Senate version on July 1, 2010, with additional funds for education, Pell Grants, and summer youth employment, totaling $81.8 billion in spending. The Senate passed H.R. 4899 on May 27, 2010, with $59.3 billion in spending for disaster relief, war funding, and Haiti relief. The House later adopted the Senate version on July 1, 2010, with additional funds for education, Pell Grants, and summer youth employment, totaling $81.8 billion in spending. The House receded from the July 1 version and adopted the Senate May 25 version on July 27, 2010. The President signed the bill on July 29, 2010, P.L. 111-212, which included $5.1 billion in new budget authority. The Senate version of H.R. 4899, passed on May 25, 2010, addressed most elements in the Administration request but did not include funding for the Cobell and Pigford II court settlements. It included funding for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund, war-related activities, Haiti relief, Deepwater Horizon oil spill response, and benefits for Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange. Additional funds were allocated for U.S. disaster relief programs and foreign aid, totaling $59.3 billion. The total spending was $4.1 billion below the Administration's request. The Senate debated H.R. 4899 from May 25-May 27, 2010, focusing on proposed amendments to address border security, Gulf oil spill response, supplemental spending, national disasters, and Afghanistan withdrawal. The total spending for foreign aid and disaster relief programs was $59.3 billion, offset by $300 million in rescissions, resulting in a total of $58.9 billion. The Senate version was $4.1 billion below the Administration's request, excluding funding for court settlements. The Senate debated H.R. 4899 from May 25-May 27, 2010, focusing on proposed amendments to address border security, Gulf oil spill response, supplemental spending, national disasters, and Afghanistan withdrawal. Senators proposed additional funding for National Guard personnel to address security concerns on the border. Various measures were suggested to respond to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, including relief for small businesses. Amendments were also proposed to cut federal funding to finance additional spending in the deficit. Senator Menendez proposed an amendment requiring oil polluters to pay the full cost of oil spills. Senators McCain and Coburn proposed amendments to cut federal funding to finance additional spending in the deficit. Senator Inouye questioned the realism of proposals to rescind unobligated balances and cap federal salaries. Six individual amendments were rejected, including McCain's proposal for $250 million for National Guards and Kyl's proposal for $200 million to prevent illegal crossings at the southwest border. In the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, various amendments were proposed and withdrawn after failing to receive the necessary votes. These included amendments to appropriate funds for border security, redeploy troops from Afghanistan, and cut spending in the supplemental bill. Amendments by Senators Kyl, Cornyn, Feingold, and Coburn were either withdrawn or rejected by the Senate. The Senate considered multiple amendments, including a Coburn amendment to cut $59 billion in the supplemental bill over 10 years by freezing federal civilian salaries and reducing government travel. After cloture was invoked, 16 amendments were adopted in a Managers' amendment, and the bill was passed by a vote of 67 to 28. The Senate Appropriations Committee had previously reported H.R. 4899 with $58.9 billion in funding. On July 1, 2010, the House passed an amended version of H.R. 4899 with additional funding for domestic programs and rescissions. The House adopted a rule to govern floor consideration and approved the Senate's May version of the bill. The House adopted a rule on July 1, 2010, by a vote of 215 to 210, which included procedures for consideration and the Senate's May version of the bill. The rule also authorized funding for court cases, a summer jobs program, set funding levels, and made changes to transportation grant formulas and tax rules for biofuel producers. Additionally, the House passed House Amendment No. 2, which included extra funding for domestic programs. Republican members argued for confining spending to specific areas. During the debate on July 1, 2010, Republican members argued for confining spending to specific areas like FEMA disaster assistance, war funding, new VA benefits, and settling court cases. Democratic members justified additional domestic spending to prevent layoffs, provide credit for farmers, energy projects, and students facing lending difficulties. The House amended the bill to include $10.0 billion for the Education Job. The House debated on additional funding, including $10.0 billion for Education Job Funds, $5.0 billion for Pell Grants, and funds for border security, Medicare/Medicaid integrity, nuclear energy, oil spill recovery, agricultural loans, and mine safety efforts. They also allocated $2.5 billion for non-defense DOD spending and $300 million for base closure transportation. The House July-amended version of the funding bill included $67 million for assistance and $20 million for other activities, with additional funds for mine safety efforts, non-defense DOD spending, base closure transportation, and a Soldier Readiness Center at Fort Hood. It also included larger offsets from rescissions and savings in mandatory programs compared to the Senate version. The House July-amended version of H.R. 4899 included $12.2 billion in rescissions, with funds from various sources like DOD funding, highway contract authority, pandemic flu funds, American Recovery Act funding, and Education Department funding for initiatives like \"Race to the Top.\" Some rescissions are controversial, while others are not, depending on the likelihood of the budget authority being obligated before expiring. The House's amended version of H.R. 4899 included $12.2 billion in rescissions from various sources, such as DOD funding, highway contract authority, pandemic flu funds, American Recovery Act funding, and Education Department funding for initiatives like \"Race to the Top.\" The Office of Management and Budget stated that the President would veto any version of the bill that undermined his abilities as Commander-in-Chief in Afghanistan or included $800 million in rescissions to the Administration's education initiative. Additionally, the House rejected amendments restricting war funding in Afghanistan. The House rejected three amendments related to war funding in Afghanistan on July 1, 2010. The first two amendments failed by wide margins, while the third one, which required funds to be used in line with the President's policy for troop withdrawal, also failed to pass. The Congress failed to approve an amendment requiring the President to submit a withdrawal plan for Afghanistan by April 4, 2011. The amendment also called for a new national intelligence estimate and recommendations for increased oversight of contractors. The proposal was defeated by a vote of 162 to 260. Additionally, the House leadership removed funding proposals for the COPS program and Firefighter Assistance grants before the vote."
