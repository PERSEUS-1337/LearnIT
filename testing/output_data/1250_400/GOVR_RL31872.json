    "content": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, are defined as powered aerial vehicles that do not carry a human operator, can fly autonomously or be piloted remotely, and can carry a lethal or nonlethal payload. They are used in military operations and have advantages and disadvantages compared to manned aircraft. The military use of UAVs in recent conflicts has highlighted the advantages and disadvantages of unmanned aircraft. UAVs offer advantages such as eliminating the risk to a pilot's life and having capabilities not bound by human limitations. They may also be cheaper to procure and operate than manned aircraft. However, the lower procurement cost must be weighed against the greater risk of crashes, and the minimized risk should be considered against the dangers of unmanned vehicles sharing airspace with manned assets. The growth in UAV employment is attributed to advancements in navigation and communication technology. The employment of UAVs has grown due to advancements in technology. UAVs have a century-old history in aviation, with the first use in combat during the Vietnam War. The Israeli Air Force pioneered UAVs in the late 1970s and 1980s. The AQM-34 Firebee UAV was used for surveillance and later modified to carry payloads and weapons. Israel's successful use of UAVs in the 1980s influenced the US to acquire UAV capabilities, leading to increased funding in the Reagan Administration. The Pioneer UAV, acquired from Israel, provided valuable intelligence during Operation Desert Storm. The Gulf War highlighted the potential of UAVs, with the Air Force's Predator quickly evolving to add new capabilities. The Pioneer UAV, acquired from Israel, proved valuable during Operation Desert Storm by providing intelligence for Navy battleships. Post-Gulf War, the Air Force's Predator quickly evolved to add new capabilities, debuting in the Balkans conflict for surveillance missions. The US inventory now includes five major UAVs, reflecting growing support in Congress with increased annual investment in unmanned aerial vehicles. Investment in UAVs has increased annually, with the Pentagon requesting $1.6 billion for FY2006. Congress has played a proactive role in UAV program management, directing joint program offices and requiring a UAV roadmap from DOD. In some instances, Congress has advocated for a more aggressive approach to fielding UAVs, such as weaponizing the Predator and Hunter in 1996. The pace of UAV development has accelerated, with expanded missions and applications. Congress is concerned about cost-efficiency, effectiveness, and interoperability of UAV efforts. There are questions about potential duplication of effort, responsiveness to congressional direction, and shifting investment priorities between manned and unmanned capabilities. Investment priorities may shift as UAVs are integrated into the U.S. inventory, potentially replacing manned aircraft. Congress is tasked with assessing the cost-effectiveness and capabilities of UAVs, considering the possibility of transferring missions from manned to unmanned aircraft. The flexibility and unanticipated applications of UAVs suggest a future where unmanned platforms play a larger role in military operations. The integration of UAVs into the U.S. inventory may lead to the replacement of manned aircraft for various missions. Congress may need to consider replacing a significant portion of manned aircraft with unmanned platforms. Personnel issues, recruitment, retention, and industrial base concerns arise with the widespread deployment of UAVs. The future role of manned aircraft in combatting threats is debated among those who believe UAVs will replace them and those who argue for their continued necessity. As companies focus more on developing unmanned aircraft, concerns arise about the erosion of skills and technologies for manned aircraft design. The debate continues on whether UAVs will replace manned aircraft in the future, with questions about controlling the spread of UAVs and balancing exports with security concerns. Congress may need to evaluate the pace of UAV development, the diversity of designs, and the incorporation of UAVs into future military capabilities. The diversity of UAV designs and applications is accelerating, with Congress needing to evaluate the management of UAVs. UAV programs range from combat-tested to not yet tested, with varying sizes and ranges. The total UAV inventory has significantly increased, including second-generation derivatives and non-traditional vehicles. The UAV inventory has significantly increased, with 604 UAVs including second-generation derivatives and non-traditional vehicles. The rise in inventory is attributed to the growing demand for UAVs to conduct various missions beyond intelligence and surveillance. The increase in DoD's UAV inventory is largely due to rising demand for UAVs to conduct diverse missions beyond intelligence and surveillance. Predator B and modified Predator As have strike capabilities, while the Joint-Unmanned Combat Air Systems (J-UCAS) target air defenses. UAVs are also used for mine detection, border patrol, medical resupply, and force perimeter protection. DOD's UAV research and development funding has grown significantly, with R&D funding in FY2006 more than double the total procurement funding for UAVs. R&D funding for UAVs has grown significantly due to the growth industry, cost-effectiveness, and advancements in technology. The increase in UAV production is likely to continue, with UAVs complementing manned aircraft rather than replacing them. The pace of UAV production is expected to either continue or accelerate in the future, as recommended by the Defense Science Board. The Defense Science Board recommends accelerating the introduction of UAVs into the force structure, with plans to grow UAV operations in the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve. General John Jumper emphasized a faster pace of production for UAVs, raising questions about the appropriateness of current and anticipated UAV development. Congress has criticized the Department of Defense for a slow rate of UAV acquisition in the past. General John Jumper emphasized the need for increased production of UAVs, specifically the Predator, prompting questions about the pace of UAV development. Congress has previously criticized the Department of Defense for slow UAV acquisition and encouraged faster incorporation of certain capabilities. Some in the 109th Congress have advocated for increased procurement and use of UAVs for non-military roles. Some in the 109th Congress advocate for increased procurement and use of UAVs for non-military roles, while expressing concerns about DoD's growing enthusiasm leading to potential issues in the future. Critics worry that an overly ambitious pace could impact the quality and efficiency of UAV programs, making congressional oversight more challenging. Representative Curt Weldon cautions against aggressively fielding new vehicles prematurely, emphasizing the need to address fundamentals for consistent design and fielding of unmanned air systems. Representative Curt Weldon warns against the premature fielding of new UAVs, emphasizing the importance of addressing fundamentals to ensure consistent design and fielding. Some services are purchasing expensive UAVs using unauthorized funding, leasing UAV services for combat operations, and reducing congressional oversight by incorporating UAV projects into larger program requests. The Global Hawk's ambitious pace is cited as an example of the challenges faced due to crowded production schedules and aggressive funding strategies. The Global Hawk program faces challenges due to crowded production schedules and aggressive funding strategies, leading to \"immaturity\" of critical technologies. A deceleration in pace and management changes are recommended to maintain quality and efficiency. Congress seeks assurances on taxpayer spending for UAV programs. Many in Congress want assurances that tax-payer dollars are well-spent on UAV programs, with Section 142 of the FY2006 Defense Authorization Act requiring written approval for new unmanned aerial vehicle systems procurement. Congressional focus on DoD's administrative processes and acquisition effectiveness for UAV development has increased in recent years. The Air Force's KC-767 tanker aircraft lease and the Army's Future Combat System have drawn scrutiny to the mechanics of DoD's acquisition process. The management of DoD's development and acquisition programs has received heightened attention in Congress. Congressional scrutiny is focused on the mechanics of DoD's acquisition process, particularly regarding UAV acquisition authority and cost issues. UAVs are being acquired at an accelerated rate for various applications, leading to concerns about duplication of effort and cost growth. Some fear that centralization of UAV efforts may stifle competition and innovation. The cost of UAVs is a management issue, with some UAVs rivaling manned aircraft in cost. The Global Hawk program is estimated to cost $6.5 billion for 51 aircraft, with cost growth attributed to factors like mission creep and inconsistent management practices. Adding multiple sensors increases weight and cost, driving up expenses. Plagued by mission creep and inconsistent management practices, the Global Hawk program's costs have escalated due to the addition of multiple sensors, larger wings, and more powerful engines. Originally designed for one primary sensor, the requirement changed to carry two or more sensors, increasing the UAV's price. The Joint Unmanned Combat Air System (JUCAS) has also seen cost increases as it evolved into a larger aircraft with a heavy payload, despite a budget cut of over $1 billion and a shift in management from DARPA to the Air Force. These changes may reduce the total number of aircraft procured but can raise the cost per aircraft due to a lack of coherent direction. The JUCAS budget was cut by over $1 billion and management was shifted from DARPA to the Air Force. These changes may reduce the total number of aircraft procured but can increase the cost per aircraft. The frequent changes in management of UAV programs highlight the challenges in establishing a comprehensive UAV management system. The Joint Program Office (JPO) faced criticism in Congress and was replaced by the Defense Airborne Reconnaissance Office (DARO) in 1993. DARO was disbanded in 1998 due to further criticism and problems with UAV programs. Since then, there has been no single procurement focal point for DOD UAV efforts. Since DARO's disbandment in 1998, there has been no centralized procurement focal point for DOD UAV efforts. The Joint UAV Planning Task Force was established in 2001 by the OSD to enhance joint coordination of UAV programs across military services. Led by the Pentagon's acquisition chief, the task force aims to standardize payload development, establish uniform interfaces, and promote a common vision for future UAV-related efforts. Dr. Glenn Lamartin of the OSD emphasized the task force's role in instituting requirements, satisfying joint needs, and providing structure to individual programs. The Joint UAV Planning Task Force, established in 2001 by the OSD, aims to standardize UAV programs across military services. Led by the Pentagon's acquisition chief, Dr. Glenn Lamartin, the task force is empowered to institute requirements, satisfy joint needs, and provide structure to individual programs. Despite concerns with UAV acquisition management, the task force has published three UAV Roadmaps to help achieve a common vision. Additionally, other management mechanisms have been initiated, such as the U.S. Joint Forces Command leading experimentation in UAV interoperability and flexibility. Several management mechanisms have been initiated in addition to the UAV Task Force, including the creation of the UAV Interoperability Working Group and the establishment of the UAV Special Studies Group by the Joint Requirement Oversight Council. In 2005, there were reports of potential management restructuring with the consideration of appointing one of the services as the executive agent for UAV programs. In 2005, the Department of Defense considered appointing a service as the executive agent for UAV programs, but later abandoned the idea in favor of two smaller organizations focusing on interoperability. The Joint UAV Overarching Integrated Product Team addresses major interoperability issues, while the Joint UAV Center of Excellence coordinates efforts to improve UAV applications. Management initiatives have aimed to increase system uniformity and interoperability. The DoD has implemented management initiatives to improve UAV system uniformity and interoperability. Recent organizational changes have led to concerns over UAV management, with the establishment of the Joint UAV OIPT and Joint UAV COE seen as steps in the right direction. The GAO's testimony in March 2005 criticized the DoD for lacking oversight in UAV development, prompting the creation of these management groups. The GAO's testimony to the House Armed Services Subcommittee highlighted the need for oversight in UAV development within the DoD. The creation of management groups like the Joint UAV COE aims to address this issue, although questions remain about the final authority in the process. The GAO highlighted the need for oversight in UAV development within the DoD. Questions remain about the final authority in the process, with Congress possibly needing to address these issues in the future. The Joint UAV Task Force has released roadmaps to guide the future roles, technological progress, and investment needs for UAVs. The GAO called for a binding strategic plan from the Department of Defense to outline inter-service goals and investment priorities for UAVs. The 2005 UAS Roadmap reiterated the need for a strategic plan for UAV development, focusing on oversight and guidance in areas such as standards and interoperability solutions. It does not authorize specific UAVs or prioritize requirements but identifies future technology windows for new capabilities. The Roadmap lacks an authoritative blueprint for the future of UAV development, leading to discrepancies between the DoD's approach and the GAO's vision for a strategic UAV plan. The 2005 UAS Roadmap provides guidance on incorporating new capabilities into UAS based on warfighters' needs. The Roadmap lacks a definitive blueprint for UAV development, leading to discrepancies between the DoD and GAO's views. Congress may revisit GAO recommendations to evaluate the Roadmap's mandate for integrating UAVs into future warfighting capabilities. Developing a coordinated DOD-wide UAV investment strategy is crucial to avoid duplication and maximize resources. Congress plays a role in arbitrating between competing UAV investments and impacting DOD's investment plan. Key questions include how UAV costs are quantified. Developing a coordinated DOD-wide UAV investment strategy is crucial to avoid duplication and maximize resources. Congress plays a role in arbitrating between competing UAV investments and impacting DOD's investment plan. Key questions include how UAV costs are quantified, the balance between UAVs and manned aircraft spending, and how cost should be balanced with capability. Quantifying UAV cost is complex, with flyaway cost and program acquisition unit cost being common measurements. The cost of UAVs can be measured by flyaway cost and program acquisition unit cost (PAUC). Flyaway cost includes prime mission equipment, systems engineering, program management, and allowances for engineering changes. PAUC is the total acquisition-related appropriations divided by the total quantity of fully configured end items. The difference between Global Hawk's PAUC and flyaway cost shows a significant gap. UAV costs can be misleading as they operate as part of a system with ground control stations and crews. The cost of UAVs can be misleading due to the wide discrepancy between flyaway cost and program acquisition unit cost (PAUC). Analysts comparing UAV costs to manned aircraft need to consider the supporting elements and operational infrastructure. Budgeting conventions also complicate monitoring UAV costs, as they can be found in different accounts in service budget documentation. The Army includes UAV funding requests in \"Other Procurement, Army,\" which contains a variety of items. UAV costs are sometimes covered in the Intelligence budget, complicating cost analysis. Congress may need to balance spending between UAVs and manned aircraft. UAV funding is projected to exceed $18 billion from 2001-2010, far surpassing the previous decade's $3.5 billion. If the upward trend in UAV funding continues through 2010, the DoD is projected to have spent over $18 billion on UAVs from 2001-2010, far exceeding the $3.5 billion spent in the previous decade. Funding for UAVs is expected to increase, with the Joint Unmanned Combat Air System budget breaking $1 billion by FY2011. UAV funding will remain under 10% of total military aviation spending, representing only three percent of all military aviation funding. The DoD's UAV funding is projected to exceed $18 billion from 2001-2010, with an increase expected in the Joint Unmanned Combat Air System budget. Despite cost savings touted by UAV advocates, critics argue that savings are often negligible due to expenses related to ground control stations and UAV aircrew. The overall cost of UAV systems may not be cheaper than manned aircraft. The cost savings of not having a pilot in the cockpit of UAVs may not always translate to overall cost savings, as expenses related to ground control stations and UAV aircrew can offset the initial savings. UAVs also have higher attrition and lower reliability rates compared to manned aircraft, leading to potentially higher operation and maintenance costs. However, UAV ground control stations can operate multiple UAVs simultaneously, partially balancing out the cost advantage. Studies have shown that replacing manned aircraft with UAVs may not result in significant savings in procurement costs. The cost comparison between manned and unmanned aircraft shows that there may not be significant savings in procurement costs. Concerns have been raised about the rising price of UAVs, including both high-tech and less technologically ambitious models. The Department of Defense faces the challenge of balancing cost with capability in funding both manned and unmanned vehicles. The rising cost of UAVs, including high-tech and less technologically ambitious models, is a concern for the Department of Defense. Sensor costs are a significant factor contributing to the overall cost of UAVs, with sensors making up a large portion of the vehicle's flyaway cost. This cost increase is driven by growing demand and limited competition in the UAV sensor market. The rising cost of UAVs, driven by increasing sensor costs, is a concern for the Department of Defense. To address this, there are two schools of thought for UAV employment: one is to field many smaller, less expensive UAVs controlled through a highly interconnected network, and the other is to equip UAVs with self-protection devices to make them less expendable. The Combat System integrates various UAVs like the Raven, Shadow, and Fire Scout with other weapons platforms. Two approaches are debated: using multiple inexpensive UAVs with a robust network or fewer, more expensive UAVs like the Global Hawk. Both approaches have faced delays and funding cuts due to management and technology issues. The key question is where to invest for maximum UAV effectiveness. The Global Hawk and J-UCAS programs have faced cost increases and management struggles, leading to funding cuts. The key issues for UAV effectiveness are interoperability, reliability, force multiplication/autonomy, and engine systems. Lack of interoperability is a major concern, as seamless communication between UAVs and ground components is crucial for future battlefield operations. Michael Wynne highlighted the importance of resolving interoperability issues to prevent the Department of Defense from losing interest in UAVs. The future plans for UAV usage in larger battlefield operations require seamless communication between UAVs and ground components to enhance situational awareness and effectiveness. Advancing interoperability of UAVs is a critical part of the Department of Defense's investment plans, aiming to integrate an interface for situational awareness among different categories of UAVs. The Department of Defense is focusing on advancing interoperability among UAVs through inter-communication between similar UAVs in four categories: situational awareness, payload transfer, weapons coordination, and air vehicle control. Despite the established framework, technology development has been slow. The House of Representatives has taken steps to encourage inter-platform communication in the FY2006 Defense Authorization Act. The House of Representatives version of the FY2006 Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 1815) aims to enhance inter-platform communication by requiring all tactical unmanned aerial vehicles to be equipped with the Tactical Common Data Link. The 2005 Unmanned Aircraft Systems Roadmap plans to expand this communication system to all large UAVs as well, emphasizing the need for investment in efficient development. The need for a Common Data Link communications system for UAVs, including large UAVs, is crucial for achieving interoperability. Limited bandwidth poses a challenge for expanding UAV applications, especially in times of war. The military may not have enough bandwidth to support multiple UAVs simultaneously, highlighting the necessity for a more robust information transfer system in the future. The military faces bandwidth challenges in supporting multiple UAVs simultaneously, hindering effective use. The Transformation Satellite Communications (TSAT) project aims to provide unlimited data transfer capacity for UAV operations. The Transformation Satellite Communications (TSAT) project aims to provide unlimited data transfer capacity for UAV operations. The project, also known as \"the internet in the sky\", is facing funding cutbacks and is expected to be deployed between 2015 and 2016. One solution to alleviate bandwidth challenges is to operate UAVs from a manned stand-off aircraft, reducing reliance on satellites for communication. Operating UAVs from a manned stand-off aircraft can help alleviate bandwidth challenges by reducing reliance on satellites for communication. This setup also addresses pilot manpower and retention issues, allowing pilots to \"fly\" while operating the UAV. Experimentation is ongoing in controlling UAV sensor payloads from the air, and reliability upgrades are a high priority for UAVs to prevent mishaps that could impede their widespread fielding. The 2005 UAS Roadmap highlights high UAV mishap rates compared to manned aircraft. The Defense Science Board notes that advancements in system design have reduced manned aircraft mishap rates over the years. However, some UAVs, like Predator and Global Hawk, were rushed into combat before reaching full operational capability, leading to potential mishaps. The mishap rates of developmental UAVs like Predator and Global Hawk were higher due to being rushed into combat before full operational capability. The DSB's report suggests that investments in emerging technologies and advanced materials could reduce UAV mishap rates significantly. Investments in emerging technologies like self-repairing \"smart\" flight control systems, auto take-off and recovery instruments, and heavy fuel engines aim to enhance UAV reliability. Advanced materials such as high temperature components, lightweight structures, shape memory alloys, and cold weather tolerance designs are also expected to improve survivability in adverse environments. The goal is to reduce the operator-vehicle ratio from 2:1 to enable one ground operator to pilot multiple UAVs simultaneously, increasing autonomy and interoperability in the industry. The end goal for UAV manufacturers is to reduce the 2:1 operator-vehicle ratio and increase autonomy so that one operator can control multiple vehicles. This advancement could significantly enhance UAVs as a force-multiplier on the battlefield, but it will require significant investments in control technologies. The logical approach to achieving this goal is to first invest in autonomous flight capabilities to reduce the workload for operators. The goal for UAV manufacturers is to reduce the 2:1 operator-vehicle ratio and increase autonomy for one operator to control multiple vehicles. To achieve this, investing in autonomous flight capabilities is crucial. The Global Hawk and Scan Eagle have automate flight capabilities, but their actual autonomy is debatable. The OSD quantifies UAV autonomy on a scale of one to ten, with the Global Hawk currently at 2.5. The aim is to reach an ACL of at least eight for maximum use with a single pilot. J-UCAS plans to achieve autonomous flight levels of six. The Global Hawk UAV currently has an ACL of 2.5, with plans to increase it to six for autonomous flight. The goal is to develop \"see and avoid\" technology to increase the standard ACL for UAVs to four. Inter-UAV communication and interoperability are crucial for autonomous flight capabilities. The Air Force is already working on advancements to allow one operator to control multiple UAVs. The Air Force is working on advancements to enable one operator to control a network of intelligence collecting drones. The goal is to consolidate tasks and upgrade sensor capabilities for multiple UAVs, with a focus on developing heavy fuel engines as a top priority for investment. The Defense Science Board urged DoD to invest in the rapid development and acquisition of heavy fuel engines for UAVs like Predator, Shadow, Hunter, and Fire Scout due to lack of commercial demand. The military has established a need for heavy fuel burning engines, but industry has been slow to respond. Heavy fuel engines could improve UAV performance, climb faster, operate at higher altitudes, and reduce servicing time. The incorporation of heavy fuel engines onto UAVs could enhance performance, reduce servicing time, and lower operation costs. However, challenges exist in designing a light and small engine for medium-sized UAVs like Shadow, Pioneer, and Predator. Initial acquisition costs may be higher, impacting production expenses. The heavy fuel engine increases initial acquisition costs for UAVs, posing production cost challenges. Developers struggle to design a light engine for lighter UAVs. An alternative being explored is a fuel cell that could double efficiency and reduce detection. Air Combat Command sponsors the project, aiming for a flight test in 2010. Questions arise about DoD's coherent plan for UAV roles and applications in the growing industry. The DoD faces questions about its coherent plan for UAV roles and applications in the growing industry. Most UAVs are currently used for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions, with some diversification in missions observed in recent years. The DoD is experiencing rapid growth in UAV programs, with a shift towards more ISR missions. Concerns arise about potential duplication of aircraft and the Services' reluctance to compromise on unique operational requirements. Questions are raised about the need for new UAVs when existing models like the Global Hawk are available. ISR UAVs share similar sensors but differ in altitude, communications range, and flight endurance. The development of UAVs is under scrutiny for potential duplication of aircraft, with questions raised about the necessity of new UAV programs when existing models like the Global Hawk are available. ISR UAVs have similar sensors but vary in altitude, communications range, and flight endurance. Congress may need to determine when a new UAV program is justified to avoid unnecessary duplication. Critics question the need for multiple UAVs with similar performance capabilities, suggesting a consolidated inventory could suffice. Proponents argue that varied platforms meet specific mission needs, considering factors like landing/takeoff capabilities, durability, and cost. The role of UAVs in combat has grown significantly, with the first public acknowledgment of their use in 2002. The role of UAVs in combat missions has increased significantly in recent years. Various UAV models are now equipped with different munitions for offensive applications. Using UAVs for air-to-ground attacks provides advantages such as loitering over the battlefield without risking flight crew. However, cost and effectiveness comparisons between manned and unmanned aircraft must be carefully considered to determine the optimal use of UAVs in combat operations. Using UAVs for combat operations offers advantages such as loitering over the battlefield without risking flight crew. Cost and effectiveness comparisons between manned and unmanned aircraft must be carefully considered to determine optimal use. The cost per pound of munitions delivered is higher for UAVs like the MQ-9 Predator B compared to manned aircraft like the F-16 Falcon, which can also carry a larger payload and perform more missions. UAVs may be more valuable in niche circumstances where manned aircraft are at extreme risk. Using UAVs for combat operations may be more cost-effective than using manned aircraft like the Predator B, especially in niche circumstances where manned aircraft are at extreme risk. UAVs are also useful for missions such as electronic attack, psychological operations, and delivering medical supplies on the battlefield. Additionally, UAVs are being considered for homeland defense and security missions by agencies like the Coast Guard and U.S. Border Patrol. Congressional support exists for using UAVs for border security. Interest is growing in using UAVs for various domestic roles beyond defense. The Coast Guard and U.S. Border Patrol plan to deploy UAVs for coastal surveillance and border protection. Congressional support exists for using UAVs like the Predator for border security. UAVs are also being considered for law enforcement surveillance, following trucks with hazardous cargo, and measuring radiation in the atmosphere. The GoldenEye 100 UAV is expected to serve as a small-package transport for local law enforcement use. The Energy Department is developing UAVs for various roles, including measuring radiation in the atmosphere. The GoldenEye 100 UAV is expected to serve as a small-package transport for law enforcement use. UAVs may also be used for search and rescue in sparsely populated areas and for disaster relief efforts. UAV advocates emphasize the need for FAA regulations to allow UAVs to play a role in homeland security. The FAA is working to integrate UAVs into national airspace by reconciling safety requirements with UAV capabilities. The Air Force has received authorization for airspace operations, and efforts are being made to upgrade UAV collision avoidance systems. The schedule for integration may be contentious, but collaboration between the FAA and Department of Defense is ongoing to ensure safe UAV operations. The group will collaborate with the Department of Defense to facilitate safe UAV operations and flight requirements. There are concerns about integrating UAVs into national airspace, with a study highlighting the urgent need for access. NASA's decision to cancel funding for a partnership to incorporate UAVs was criticized by advocates. In the future, large UAVs could potentially take on aerial refueling tasks currently done by manned aircraft. In the future, large UAVs could potentially take on aerial refueling tasks currently done by manned aircraft. DOD is experimenting with outfitting UAVs for air-to-air combat missions, with reports of a Predator engaging in such combat with an Iraqi fighter aircraft. In the future, UAVs may be used for air-to-air combat missions, as demonstrated by a Predator engaging in combat with an Iraqi fighter aircraft. This development could lead to more aggressive missions for unmanned aircraft, although other platforms like manned aircraft, blimps, and space satellites also have their advantages and disadvantages. Some of the country's largest defense contractors are competing to develop unmanned blimps that may float for months at a time at 70,000 feet, carrying 4,000 pounds of payload. OSD's 2005 UAS Roadmap includes a section on lighter-than-air blimps and tethered \"aerostat\" platforms, important for various roles like psychological operations and border monitoring. These platforms could offer services similar to border surveillance UAVs with lower fuel dependency, although they lack maneuverability and speed compared to UAVs like the Global Hawk. Major UAV manufacturers aim to have an operational system by 2010 for various homeland security missions. Some major UAV manufacturers aim to develop operational systems by 2010 for homeland security missions. Space satellites offer benefits but can be cumbersome to task due to competing national priorities. UAVs like Global Hawk are being considered as substitutes for low-orbiting satellite constellations due to high space launch costs. Critics are concerned that mass UAV production may replace manned aircraft in large numbers. The high costs of spacelaunches have led to consideration of UAVs like Global Hawk as substitutes for low-orbiting satellite constellations. Critics worry that mass UAV production may replace manned aircraft, impacting pilot skills and combat operations. The Air Force is working to encourage pilots to view UAV piloting as a major mission and retain rated pilots by offering incentives. The Air Force is offering incentives to retain rated pilots who fly UAVs, aiming to redefine the concept of piloting UAVs as a major mission. The impact of increased UAV use on recruitment and retention varies among the services, with the Army facing recruitment challenges while the Air Force and Navy are actively reducing their number of uniformed personnel. The Air Force, Navy, and Army are all dealing with different challenges related to personnel recruitment and retention. The Air Force requires Predator and Global Hawk operators to be pilot-rated officers, while other services do not have this requirement. The increased use of UAVs may attract individuals who are interested in flying but lack physical qualifications for manned aircraft. Flying armed UAVs may be more appealing to some personnel than flying manned aircraft. The Air Force believes that flying UAVs, especially armed ones, may attract individuals who wish to fly but lack physical qualifications for manned aircraft. Flying UAVs offers a unique opportunity to \"fly\" and may be a compromise for those who want to avoid the hardships of flying manned aircraft. Additionally, UAVs like Global Hawk that operate autonomously do not require a pilot, making them technologically sophisticated. The Air Force believes that UAVs, especially armed ones, may attract individuals who wish to fly but lack physical qualifications for manned aircraft. UAVs like Global Hawk that operate autonomously do not require a pilot, making them technologically sophisticated. As UAV autonomy matures, the policy of requiring pilot-rated officers to operate UAVs may be reviewed by Congress. Increased UAV employment could potentially boost enlistment in other specialties if perceived as effective in missions. Congress faces defense industrial base issues regarding foreign suppliers and subsidies for U.S. firms. The potential recruitment of individuals attracted to UAVs for improved force protection and CAS capabilities may lead to fewer concerns about combat hazards. Congress grapples with defense industrial base issues, including dependency on foreign suppliers, subsidies for U.S. firms, and promoting competition. Concerns arise that increased focus on UAVs could diminish funding for manned aircraft programs and erode technical expertise in designing combat aircraft, a distinct U.S. advantage that should be safeguarded. Some are concerned that the rise of UAVs may lead to a decrease in funding and expertise for manned aircraft programs, potentially harming the U.S. industrial base. However, others argue that the industry is naturally shifting towards advanced UAVs, with the Joint Strike Fighter possibly being the last manned tactical fighter. There are fears that focusing solely on UAVs could lead to a loss of crucial skills and technologies needed for manned aircraft, potentially weakening U.S. dominance in tactical aircraft design. Some argue that focusing solely on unmanned aircraft design could lead to a loss of crucial skills and technologies needed for manned aircraft, potentially weakening U.S. dominance in tactical aircraft design. However, proponents believe that there is commonality between manned and unmanned combat aircraft, and major defense contractors are shifting towards unmanned aircraft design to stay competitive. The rise of UAVs in warfare has led major defense contractors like Boeing and Northrop Grumman to shift towards unmanned aircraft design to stay competitive. The global UAV market is growing rapidly, with projections showing a significant increase in expenditures from $2.1 billion in 2005 to $5 billion in 2014. Maintaining a strong presence in the global UAV market is seen as crucial for the U.S. defense industrial base. The global UAV market is projected to grow significantly, with expenditures expected to increase from $2.1 billion in 2005 to $5 billion in 2014. Capturing this market share is crucial for U.S. companies to remain competitive, as other countries like European, Russian, Israeli, Chinese, or South African companies may take advantage if they do not. This growth presents policy issues related to UAV proliferation and export controls, which have been discussed in Congress. The global growth of UAVs raises concerns about proliferation and export controls, as UAV components can easily be diverted for military use by various countries or non-state actors. This poses challenges for policymakers due to the difficulty in controlling UAV proliferation and the potential threat if armed. The proliferation of UAVs and cruise missiles is a concern due to their accessibility to various countries and non-state actors. They are seen as cost-effective weapons that could potentially become a \"poor man's air force.\" The George W. Bush Administration expressed worries about the military effectiveness of UAVs in the wrong hands, especially in relation to potential attacks with weapons of mass destruction. Foreign companies gaining access to advanced technologies could further enhance the capabilities of future UAVs. Foreign companies are gaining access to key technologies that could enhance future UAV capabilities, raising concerns about potential UAV proliferation. Policy makers may need to address issues related to UAV exports and the dissemination of critical UAV technologies. Balancing military aid to allies with concerns about weapon system proliferation is another complicating factor. UAVs can be effective for ISR and enabling the discriminating use of military force. The section discusses the potential benefits of UAVs for ISR and reducing collateral damage, as well as the concerns about UAV proliferation and the need for tighter controls on their spread. It also addresses the program status and funding of prominent UAV programs pursued by the Department of Defense. The section addresses the program status and funding of prominent UAV programs pursued by the Department of Defense, focusing on small man-portable UAVs that are gaining popularity with ground forces and competing for congressional attention and funding. The MQ-1 Predator, developed by General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, is a popular medium-altitude, long-endurance UAV with integrated surveillance and armament capabilities. It has enjoyed accelerated development schedules and increased procurement funding due to its high-profile use in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Predator has paved the way for the development of other related UAVs for various missions. The MQ-1 Predator, developed by General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, facilitated the development of several closely related UAVs designed for various missions. The Predator is a medium-altitude, long-endurance UAV with a 450-lb surveillance payload for reconnaissance and target acquisition. Operated by the Air Force and CIA, it can remain on station for 24 hours at 10,000 to 15,000 feet altitude. The Predator UAV, used by the Air Force and CIA, is equipped with surveillance cameras, a Multi-Spectral Targeting System, and synthetic aperture radar for reconnaissance and target acquisition.
