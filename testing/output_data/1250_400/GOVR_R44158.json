Technological advancements have modernized irrigated agriculture, but come with costs like infrastructure, federal programs, and potential impacts on water users and the environment. Irrigation water use is measured by withdrawals and consumption, with withdrawals being the amount applied to lands and consumption referring to water taken in by plants or evaporated without returning to water sources. Irrigation water use in the United States is primarily measured by water withdrawals and consumption. Withdrawals refer to the amount of water applied to lands for crop and pasture growth, while consumption is the water taken in by plants or evaporated without returning to water sources. Despite being the second-largest source of water withdrawals in the US, irrigation withdrawals have decreased by 23% since 1980, with a 9% drop nationally from 2005 to 2010. The decline in withdrawals may not necessarily lead to a decrease in water consumption due to improved irrigation efficiency. Changes in irrigated land vary by region, with only four western states seeing an increase since 2003, while several eastern states have seen significant growth. Since 2003, changes in irrigated land across the United States have varied by region. Four western states have seen an increase in irrigated acres, while the rest have seen a reduction. In contrast, several eastern states, including Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Tennessee, have experienced a significant increase in irrigated acres. Farmers have shifted from gravity irrigation to pressurized sprinklers and microirrigation, especially in 17 western states. Irrigated land in the West increased by 1.7 million acres from the 1980s to 2013, while applied irrigation water declined by over 1.37 million acre-feet. The trend of declining water application began in 1998. Since 1984, irrigated land in eastern states has grown by over 8.7 million acres, primarily using groundwater withdrawals. This increase is attributed to factors such as increased commodity prices, yield, drought episodes, and low-cost access to groundwater. Groundwater withdrawals have been the main source for irrigation in eastern states, with withdrawals peaking in 2008. The increased irrigated acres in the East are due to factors like increased commodity prices, yield, drought episodes, and low-cost access to groundwater. This expanded use of groundwater has led to a decline in aquifer levels and raised environmental concerns. Irrigation efficiency refers to the beneficial use of applied irrigation water, influenced by factors like irrigation system performance, water application uniformity, and crop response. Evapotranspiration rates, influenced by climate conditions, determine crop water needs. Efficient irrigation systems are crucial for maximizing crop production and conserving water. Factors like evapotranspiration rates, climate conditions, and water conveyance systems play a key role in determining irrigation efficiency. However, studies have shown that in some cases, efficient irrigation systems may lead to increased water consumption and crop yield. For example, increasing water conservation subsidies for drip irrigation in the Upper Rio Grande Basin resulted in higher water consumption, crop yield, and irrigated acreage. Efficient irrigation systems may lead to greater water consumption, especially with increased water conservation subsidies for drip irrigation. While microirrigation is more efficient than gravity irrigation, the latter typically consumes less water. However, gravity irrigation can return unused water to surface or groundwater sources. Despite efforts to limit increased water consumption, efficient irrigation technologies may encourage farmers to grow more water-intensive crops. Efficient irrigation technologies may not necessarily result in less water consumed overall, as they could encourage farmers to grow more profitable, water-intensive crops. Irrigation systems are classified into pressure systems and gravity systems, with precision technologies increasingly being integrated to increase efficiency. Best management practices for irrigation focus on improved conveyance, scheduling, and application methods on farms. Efficient irrigation technologies, including best management practices (BMPs) identified by USDA's NRCS, aim to improve water management on farms. BMPs for irrigation encompass conveyance, scheduling, and application methods. Pressure systems, such as sprinkler and microirrigation systems, are commonly used to pump water through tubing or pipes for crop irrigation. Pressure systems, including sprinkler and microirrigation systems, are commonly used for crop irrigation. These systems make up roughly 58-65% of irrigation systems in the United States and are more efficient than gravity systems. Major pressure systems include center pivot, linear move tower, solid set, slide roll, big gun, hand move, and drip systems. While operational labor requirements may be low, initial investment costs can be high. An irrigation water management plan is essential for managing the timing and application of water through these systems. Micro sprinklers are efficient irrigation systems that can be used for most crops, although they require high initial investment costs. An irrigation water management plan is necessary to control water timing and application, reduce soil erosion, and maximize plant growth. This plan may include various irrigation Best Management Practices (BMPs) such as microirrigation, sprinkler irrigation, ditch lining, and land leveling. Sprinkler systems like center pivot, side roll, and linear move tower irrigation spray water over crops for adequate soil moisture. Microirrigation includes low-pressure systems like surface drip, micro sprinkler, and sub-surface drip irrigation. Sprinkler systems and microirrigation are efficient methods for providing soil moisture to crops. Microirrigation includes low-pressure systems like surface drip, micro sprinkler, and sub-surface drip irrigation, which apply water directly to the root zone of crops. LEPA systems enhance center pivot irrigation by reducing evaporation losses and energy consumption. Gravity systems divert water to flood over crops via land-forming measures like canals, ditches, basins, and furrows. Controlled flooding methods increase irrigation efficiencies. Gravity systems, comprising 35 to 42% of US irrigation systems, use land-forming measures to flood crops. While controlled flooding methods increase efficiency, uncontrolled flooding does not. Gravity systems have lower efficiency than pressure systems, with medium initial costs and high labor requirements. Land leveling reshapes fields to ensure uniform water application, increasing efficiency and preventing soil or crop water logging. Furrow irrigation systems are suitable for row crops like potato and corn. Land leveling reshapes fields to ensure uniform water application, increasing efficiency and preventing soil or crop water logging. Irrigation ditch lining limits water loss during transit to the crop area. Tailwater recovery systems reuse excess water from gravity irrigation to prevent water contamination and waterlogging of crops. Tailwater recovery involves reusing excess water from gravity irrigation to prevent water contamination and waterlogging of crops. An irrigation reservoir stores water for irrigation, with its size depending on water availability and crop needs. Precision technologies like satellite data and drones have improved irrigation efficiency, reducing costs and increasing crop yield. Technology companies are increasingly offering services to help farmers maximize profits. Precision technologies, such as satellite data, sensor networks, data analytics, and drones, have increased irrigation efficiency and reduced input costs while boosting crop yield. Technology companies are now heavily involved in the agricultural sector, providing services to help farmers maximize profits. The SMAP satellite project, launched by NASA and USDA, gathers soil moisture data globally without the need for terrestrial sensors. This data can help governments and agricultural producers make informed decisions on irrigation water usage. Drones are also utilized for aerial imagery and data collection to improve irrigation practices. The use of precision technologies like drones, sensor networks, and data analytics has improved irrigation efficiency. Data collected from these technologies can inform decisions on when and how much irrigation water to apply. Information from regional weather networks can track crop evapotranspiration and help establish an accurate irrigation schedule. Remote monitoring systems can wirelessly transfer real-time information to adjust irrigation operations. The use of precision technologies like drones, sensor networks, and data analytics has improved irrigation efficiency by tracking crop evapotranspiration and establishing accurate irrigation schedules. Remote monitoring systems wirelessly transfer real-time information to adjust irrigation operations. Poly-pipe in furrow irrigation, optimized with computer software, reduces water waste. Implementing irrigation BMPs increases efficiency, reduces production costs, and allows for higher value crops and extended growing seasons. Irrigated yields are typically double that of non-irrigated crops. Irrigation BMPs enhance production by allowing water to flow to crops only when needed, reducing costs and preventing overwatering issues. The controlled environment of an irrigation system also enables the precise application of nutrients and pesticides, potentially reducing costs and improving efficiency. Irrigation technologies vary across the United States, influenced by factors such as cost, crop type, climate, soil, labor, and technology requirements. Some irrigation BMPs allow synthetic nutrients and pesticides to be mixed with water for cost-effective and precise distribution. Implementation choices of irrigation technologies in the United States are influenced by factors like cost, crop type, climate, soil, and water availability. The adoption of efficient irrigation systems by agricultural producers is often driven by potential economic gains rather than water conservation. Growers of high-value crops are more likely to invest in costly drip irrigation systems compared to growers of low-value crops. Financing irrigation system improvements can be a challenge for some producers, as reported in the USDA's 2013 Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey. According to USDA's 2013 Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey, growers of high-value crops are more inclined to adopt costly drip irrigation systems, while growers of low-value crops are less likely to invest in efficient irrigation systems due to financial constraints. The cost of developing a water supply, such as drilling wells or building storage facilities, can also impact the choice of irrigation system. High-efficiency pressure systems are commonly used in areas heavily reliant on groundwater due to the higher costs associated with establishing a water supply from groundwater compared to surface water sources. The cost of establishing a water supply from groundwater impacts a producer's decision to adopt efficient pressure systems. High-efficiency systems are common in groundwater-reliant areas, while surface water areas tend to use gravity irrigation due to lower costs. Drought-prone areas relying on surface water are more likely to adopt efficient systems. Crop type also influences irrigation system choice, with perennial tree crops better suited for drip irrigation and close-growing crops like rice benefiting from gravity irrigation. Many US farmers struggle to utilize more efficient systems. Tree crops are better suited for drip irrigation systems to prevent fruit decay, while close-growing crops like rice benefit from gravity irrigation. Many US farmers face challenges in adopting more efficient irrigation systems due to crop type, physical field conditions, and climate limitations. Soil type and local climate conditions also play a role in determining the most appropriate irrigation system for crop production areas. Soil type, climate conditions, and labor-technology trade-offs influence the selection of irrigation systems for crop production areas. Soil surveys help in designing efficient irrigation systems based on soil characteristics. Gravity irrigation is labor-intensive but suitable for clay soils, while sandy soils require sprinkler or microirrigation methods. Automated systems like sprinklers and drip irrigation require fewer labor inputs compared to gravity systems. The labor-technology trade-off is crucial when choosing an irrigation system. Gravity systems are labor-intensive but require fewer technological inputs, while automated sprinkler and drip systems need less labor but more technical knowledge. Water quality and quantity also impact irrigation choices, with sediment-heavy water best suited for gravity irrigation. The Clean Water Act addresses water quality concerns in various water bodies.

Federal government provides financial and technical assistance, research, and monitoring for agricultural producers, including support for irrigation BMPs adoption through conservation programs. Financial and technical assistance, research, and monitoring are provided by USDA agencies to support irrigation BMPs adoption through conservation programs. Farm bill programs like EQIP, CSP, and AMA offer funding and technical support to agricultural producers implementing conservation practices. Between 2009 and 2014, $1.2 billion in funding for irrigation BMPs went towards sprinkler and microirrigation systems, with states in the West like California and Texas receiving the highest amounts. Three southeastern states also ranked in the top 10 for funding. Between 2009 and 2014, $1.2 billion in funding for irrigation BMPs was allocated towards implementing sprinkler and microirrigation systems. California and Texas received the most funding, with three southeastern states also in the top 10. Groundwater depletion in the High Plains, Mississippi Embayment, and Central Valley aquifers is a concern, with uncertainty if irrigation BMP funding is helping to reduce depletion. The Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) provides financial and technical assistance for irrigation BMPs.

CTA does not provide financial assistance but can help qualify for other programs. USDA provides information resources through ARS, ERS, and NIFA for irrigation research and management. The USDA provides information resources through ARS, ERS, and NIFA for irrigation research and management. ARS focuses on improving irrigation management, ERS conducts economic and policy studies on irrigation water use, and NIFA administers funding for agriculture-related science and research programs. Few national-level monitoring and reporting efforts exist for irrigation. The USDA supports agriculture research at state universities through NIFA-funded grant programs related to irrigation. National-level monitoring and reporting efforts for irrigation are limited, with NASS and USGS providing the most comprehensive data on irrigation water use in the United States. NASS conducts the Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey every five years, while USGS produces a water use assessment every five years that includes irrigation trends. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) conducts a national assessment of irrigated agriculture in the US every five years. The assessment evaluates water use trends, including irrigation practices like sprinkler systems, microirrigation, and irrigation pipelines. These practices qualify for funding from the NRCS EQIP program. Sprinkler systems, microirrigation, irrigation pipelines, pumping plants, land leveling, water wells, and water control structures are essential components of irrigation systems for crop cultivation. These systems help in providing adequate soil moisture, cooling crops, protecting from frost, and controlling dust. Proper planning and evaluation are necessary to ensure efficient water use and prevent negative impacts on the environment and neighboring resources. Water Well \u2014 Code 642 is used to extract groundwater and should consider potential interference with neighboring wells and impacts on nearby resources. Structure for Water Control \u2014 Code 587 regulates water flow and includes various structures like flashboard risers and check dams.
