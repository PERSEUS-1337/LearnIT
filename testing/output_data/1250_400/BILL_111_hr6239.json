    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Prevention of Frivolous Ethanol Lawsuits Act of 2010\". The Congress finds that increasing the blending limit of ethanol into gasoline for vehicles requires ensuring it won't harm emission control systems or engine performance, as concerns exist about potential negative effects on engines and interstate commerce. The Federal Trade Commission has proposed labeling requirements for fuels with ethanol blends exceeding current limits to warn consumers of potential harm to some vehicles. Testing is ongoing on newer vehicles to assess effects of higher ethanol blends, but data is lacking for older vehicles and nonroad engines. Executive branch has authority to increase blending limit. The executive branch has the authority to increase the current blending limit of ethanol into gasoline, and is currently in the process of making a decision on this issue. Congress should address potential negative impacts on interstate commerce resulting from a potential increase in the blending limit. SEC. 3.

A covered entity is defined as an entity involved in the manufacture, sale, or distribution of fuel or products using renewable fuel. An enforcement action includes various legal proceedings such as criminal prosecution, injunctions, civil monetary proceedings, product recalls, and investigator disqualification proceedings.
