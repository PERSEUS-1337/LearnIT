Congress acknowledges the strong link between diet and health, with diet-related diseases starting early in life. Increased caloric intake is a key factor contributing to the rise in obesity rates in the United States. Obesity is associated with various health risks and has significant economic costs. The prevalence of meals prepared or eaten outside the home has increased over the past two decades, impacting overall caloric intake and food spending habits. Over the past 2 decades, there has been a significant increase in meals eaten outside the home, with a third of calories and half of food dollars spent on restaurant food. Excess saturated fat intake is a major risk factor for heart disease, leading cause of death in the US. Increased sodium intake is linked to high blood pressure, a risk for cardiovascular disease. The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 requires food manufacturers to provide nutrition information on packaged foods, but restaurant foods are exempt unless a nutrient content or health claim is made. About 75% of adults use food labels on packaged foods, leading to healthier diets. Consumers find it challenging to limit calorie intake at restaurants due to limited nutrition information available. Consumers want nutrition information provided at restaurants to make educated decisions about their food choices and reduce obesity rates. SEC. 3.
