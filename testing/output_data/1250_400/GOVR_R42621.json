    "content": "Some in the 112th Congress wanted to cut international affairs spending, including foreign aid programs, to reduce the federal budget deficit. However, others believed a strong foreign affairs budget was crucial for national security and foreign policy interests. Congress delayed passing the FY2013 Department of State appropriations, eventually passing a continuing resolution until March 27, 2013. The Budget Control Act of 2011 led to delays in passing appropriations bills, including State-Foreign Operations, until after the new fiscal year. A continuing resolution was passed to fund the government until March 27, 2013. Legislation (H.R. 933) was passed to fund federal programs for the remainder of FY2013, signed into law on March 26, 2013. The State-Foreign Operations appropriation supports international affairs programs and activities, including foreign assistance, State Department operations, and international broadcasting. The State-Foreign Operations appropriations bill funds international affairs programs, foreign assistance, State Department operations, and international broadcasting. It includes Function 150 programs but not all international affairs programs. Some programs funded through other appropriations bills are also considered international affairs. A chart illustrating the bill's organizational structure is provided in the report. Abbreviations of terms used are listed in the appendix. The State-Foreign Operations appropriations bill funds international affairs programs, foreign assistance, State Department operations, and international broadcasting. President Obama signed the FY2013 Defense and Military Construction/VA, Full Year Continuing Resolution, P.L. 113-6 on March 26, 2013, which funds most State-Foreign operations accounts for the remainder of FY2013 at the FY2012-enacted level. The Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2013, H.J.Res. 117 (P.L. 112-175) funded the government until March 27, 2013. It provided 0.612% more than FY2012 levels for State and Foreign Operations non-OCO funded activities. OCO-designated activities were funded at the FY2012-enacted level. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved its FY2013 State-Foreign Operations appropriations bill (S. 3241/S.Rept. 112-172) with a total of $52.3 billion.

The Senate allocated $53.02 billion for the State-Foreign Operations subcommittee in FY2013, which was 3% less than the Administration's request. The Obama Administration's FY2013 budget proposal included $54.9 billion for State-Foreign Operations, with $8.2 billion for war-related Overseas Contingency Operations. This represented a 2.6% increase over the estimated FY2012 funding level.

The State Department and Related Agencies portion of the international affairs budget request included funding for State Department operations, International Organizations, International Peacekeeping activities, International Broadcasting, National Endowment for Democracy, and U.S. Institute of Peace. The State Department accounts would have seen a 4.5% boost in FY2013 to a total of $18.8 billion, with $14.1 billion for Administration of Foreign Affairs. The FY2013 request focused on supporting key efforts like the military-to-civilian transition in Iraq. The FY2013 State Department budget request of $18.8 billion included $14.1 billion for Administration of Foreign Affairs, supporting key efforts like the military-to-civilian transition in Iraq and ongoing State Department-led efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The State Department has taken over responsibilities in Iraq after the departure of U.S. military forces in late 2011. The State Department has become the lead agency for all U.S. programs in Iraq after the departure of U.S. military forces in late 2011. For FY2013, the Administration requested 23% less funding than the estimated FY2012 level for State Operations in Iraq, reflecting the intent to \"normalize\" the U.S. presence in Iraq. This included $2.7 billion, with cost-saving measures such as a planned reduction in the State Department presence in Iraq by the fall of 2012. The FY2013 budget request for State Department operations in Iraq included cost-saving measures such as reducing staff presence and security contracts. The House appropriations bill allocated $2.8 billion for operations in frontline states, while the Senate Appropriations Committee provided $2.1 billion for State Department operations in Iraq. This budget request was the first to reflect reforms outlined in the QDDR. The FY2013 budget request for State Department operations in Iraq included reforms outlined in the QDDR, such as establishing a new Bureau of Energy Resources and elevating the Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism. Funding for Counterterrorism missions increased from $3.2 million in FY2011 to $19 million in the FY2013 request. The Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations was subsumed in the renamed Bureau of Counterterrorism, with increased funding from $3.2 million in FY2011 to $19 million in the FY2013 request. The Bureau requested funds for 12 new positions, in addition to existing staff. The Bureau of Energy Resources also sought 22 additional positions in the FY2013 budget request. The Bureau of Energy Resources requested 22 new positions in the FY2013 budget at a cost of $5.4 million to enhance its capacity and engage more broadly on U.S. global energy priorities. The House Appropriations Committee did not include the additional funding, while the Senate Appropriations Committee did not mention the Bureau. Funding within the D&CP could support these new hires. The Administration's FY2013 budget included $5.4 million and 22 new positions for the Bureau of Energy Resources. The FY2013 request for the Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations (CSO) saw an 86% increase in funding, with a restructuring to reduce staffing levels by 64 positions. The Civilian Response Corps (CRC) model was also modified to fund experts only when deployed, reducing the number of members by 76. The House Appropriations Committee's FY2013 proposal continued to provide authority for the Secretary of State to transfer up to $35 million for Conflict and Stabilization Operations. The FY2013 budget reorganization reduced the number of CRC members by 76. The House Appropriations Committee allowed the transfer of funds for Conflict and Stabilization Operations. The Senate proposal authorized transfers from Diplomatic & Consular Program funding. The Administration requested $2.5 billion for additional human resources, including $24.9 million to hire 121 new positions. The FY2013 request for additional human resources D&CP was $2.5 billion, with $24.9 million allocated to hire 121 new positions. This was part of State's efforts to fill staffing gaps and support new programs under the \"Diplomacy 3.0\" initiative. Secretary Clinton aimed to increase Foreign Service Officers by 25% by 2014, but with the proposed funding, State would have reached an 18% growth since 2008. Additionally, $81.4 million was requested for the final phase of Overseas Comparability Pay implementation for FSOs. The Administration requested $81.4 million for the final phase of Overseas Comparability Pay (OCP) for Foreign Service Officers (FSOs) to address a 23.1% cut in basic pay for employees transferring abroad. This issue could impact diplomatic readiness through increased attrition and recruitment challenges. Congress approved prior OCP adjustments to reduce the pay differential, and the FY2013 request aimed to bring the comparability pay level to the Washington, DC, locality pay rate. The House Appropriations Committee recommendation included no funding for hiring above attrition. Congress approved two prior OCP adjustments since 2009, reducing the pay differential by nearly 70%. The FY2013 request aimed to bring comparability pay level to Washington, DC, locality pay rate. House and Senate Appropriations Committees did not include overseas comparability pay authority or funding in FY2013 proposal. In October 2011, UNESCO voted to admit Palestine as a full member, sparking a U.S. policy debate. In FY2013, the U.S. did not include overseas comparability pay authority or funding in its proposal. The U.S. opposes Palestinian statehood outside of negotiations with Israel, withholding funding to UNESCO after Palestine's admission. The Administration sought $80 million for UNESCO contributions in 2012, but the House committee withheld U.S. contributions to UNESCO. The House committee report stated that U.S. contributions to UNESCO for 2012 would be withheld, along with funding for the Palestinian Authority if they gain full membership in the United Nations. The Senate legislation also did not recommend funding for UNESCO and included restrictions on U.S. funding to UNESCO and other U.N. entities granting membership to the Palestinian Authority. Both proposals included less funding than requested for International Organizations and Programs account. The Foreign Operations budget, managed by USAID and the State Department, includes U.S. contributions to international organizations like UNESCO and major financial institutions. It also covers funding for agencies such as the Millennium Challenge Corporation and the Peace Corps. The Foreign Operations budget includes U.S. contributions to international organizations and financial institutions, such as the World Bank and the U.N. It also funds agencies like the Export-Import Bank and supports foreign assistance initiatives like the Global Health Initiative and funding for war-related states.

Congressional debate focused on funding levels, restrictions on international family planning programs, and aid conditions for certain countries and entities. The use of foreign assistance as a democracy promotion tool received scrutiny following popular uprisings in the region. The FY2013 budget request included funding for various initiatives like the Global Health Initiative, Food Security Initiative, and Global Climate Change Initiative. There was also a call for funding for war-related states like Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, as well as a new regional funding account for political transitions in the Middle East and North Africa. The use of foreign assistance as a democracy promotion tool received scrutiny following popular uprisings in the region, leading to the proposal of a $770 million Middle East and North Africa Incentive Fund (MENA IF) to support U.S. engagement in the evolving situation. The Administration proposed a $770 million Middle East and North Africa Incentive Fund (MENA IF) in its FY2013 budget request to support democracy in the region. The fund would have included $65 million for the Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) and $5 million for regional activities. The remaining $700 million would have been unallocated for various purposes like humanitarian relief, peacekeeping activities, and loan forgiveness. Some Members of Congress expressed concerns about the proposed fund. The Administration proposed a $770 million Middle East and North Africa Incentive Fund (MENA IF) in its FY2013 budget request to support democracy in the region. The fund would have included $65 million for the Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) and $5 million for regional activities. Some Members of Congress expressed concerns about the proposed fund, citing worries about giving the Administration too much discretion and Congress too little oversight. The House committee bill allocated $175 million within the Economic Support Fund (ESF) account and $25 million in the Foreign Military Finance account for \"Middle East Response,\" with $75 million left unallocated. In contrast, the Senate committee report included $1 billion for MENA IF, with increased funding for MEPI to $70 million. Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan were highlighted as strategic in the Global War on Terror. The Senate committee report included $1 billion for MENA IF, with increased funding for MEPI to $70 million. Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan are top U.S. aid recipients due to their strategic significance in the Global War on Terror.

The Administration allocated $1 billion for the Police Development Program (PDP) in Iraq, transitioning it to State Department authority. Despite doubts about its effectiveness, the program was deemed vital for U.S.-Iraqi relations. The House legislation supported the PDP but required the Administration to report on program revisions. The House legislation expressed support for the Police Development Program (PDP) in Iraq, but did not provide specific funds. The Senate Appropriations Committee did not include funding for the PDP, citing Iraqi disinterest and inadequate planning. The Administration requested $2.5 billion for Afghanistan in FY2013, with a significant portion designated for infrastructure and justice sector programs. In FY2013, funding for Afghanistan totaled $1.2 billion, with a focus on infrastructure and justice sector programs. The House legislation required security certification for aid workers.

The House legislation did not specify an aid level for Pakistan but prohibited assistance if Pakistan is uncooperative in anti-terrorism efforts. The Senate bill included $842.3 million for Pakistan, with new conditions on aid, including withholding $33 million in Foreign Military Financing until Dr. Shakil Afridi is released from prison. The Senate bill included new conditions on aid to Pakistan, withholding $33 million in Foreign Military Financing until Dr. Shakil Afridi is released from prison. The budget request for the Administration's Global Health Initiative was reduced by approximately $300 million compared to the FY2012 enacted level, marking the end of a decade-long growth trend in global health funding. The FY2013 budget request included decreases in global health funding for most areas, except for an increase in funding for international family planning and a significant increase for the Global Fund. Both the House and Senate proposed more funding than the request, with the Senate proposing 8% more than requested. The Obama Administration's Feed the Future initiative remained a priority, with a request for $1.1 billion in Foreign Operations funds for related programs. The FY2013 budget request included $1.7 billion for the Global Fund, 8% more than requested. Feed the Future initiative, a priority for the Obama Administration, requested $1.1 billion for related programs. The initiative aims to address global hunger by working multilaterally and leveraging resources. The House proposal supported Feed the Future goals without specifying funding, while the Senate recommended $1.2 billion for agricultural and food security, including $200 million for the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program. The FY2013 budget request included $1.7 billion for the Global Fund, 8% more than requested.

The Administration requested $643 million for family planning and reproductive health activities. The Senate showed strong support for multilateral climate change funds, allocating $139.4 million for the GEF, $100.0 million for the Strategic Climate Fund, and $300.0 million for the Clean Technology Fund, exceeding the Administration's request. Congressional debate on family planning and reproductive health activities has been ongoing for over three decades, focusing on policy issues such as the \"Mexico City policy\" and U.S. funding of the UNFPA. The Mexico City Policy, requiring foreign NGOs receiving USAID family planning assistance to certify they would not promote abortion, has been rescinded and reissued by past Administrations. The FY2013 House legislation proposed codifying this policy, while the Senate bill did not. Previous Administrations suspended grants to UNFPA over coercive family planning practices in China. The George W. Bush Administration halted U.S. contributions to UNFPA from FY2002 to FY2008, while President Obama resumed funding in 2009. The George W. Bush Administration suspended U.S. contributions to UNFPA from FY2002 to FY2008 due to a State Department investigation in China. President Obama resumed funding in 2009, with a proposed $39 million for UNFPA in FY2013. The House proposed $461 million for family planning and reproductive health, excluding UNFPA, while the Senate proposed $700 million, including $44.5 million for UNFPA. Both bills included the Kemp-Kasten amendment. The Administration suggested dissolving the AEECA account in FY2013, with a funding cut of 18% from FY2012. The Administration proposed dissolving the AEECA account in FY2013, with a funding cut of 18% from FY2012. The House and Senate legislation merged AEECA funds with ESF, GHP, and INCLE accounts, without signaling diminished support for the region or the Coordinator of U.S. Assistance to Europe and Eurasia. Funding for AEECA programs would come from ESF, GHP, and INCLE accounts in FY2013 and beyond, with no minimum funding level specified for AEECA-eligible countries. During the Cold War, foreign aid and diplomatic programs focused on anti-communism and other U.S. policy interests. After the Cold War, objectives shifted to stopping nuclear proliferation, curbing drug trafficking, promoting peace in the Middle East, and countering trafficking in persons. Following 9/11, programs emphasized national security goals. After the Cold War, U.S. foreign aid objectives shifted to focus on stopping nuclear proliferation, curbing drug trafficking, promoting peace in the Middle East, and countering trafficking in persons. Following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, national security goals became a key emphasis in foreign aid and diplomatic programs. President Bush's National Security Strategy in 2002 established global development as a third pillar of U.S. national security, alongside defense and diplomacy. Foreign assistance budget justifications began highlighting the war on terrorism as a top priority, with a focus on aiding \"front-line\" states. Reconstruction programs in Afghanistan and Iraq exemplified the use of foreign aid as a tool for national security. Diplomatic efforts also prioritized diplomatic security. The Bush Administration focused on using foreign aid as a tool of national security, with large reconstruction programs in Afghanistan and Iraq. Efforts also included diplomatic security and promoting American views in Muslim communities. Aid was increased to combat HIV/AIDS globally through PEPFAR, and a new approach to development assistance was explored with the creation of the MCC. The Obama Administration continued these initiatives, including MCC, global health funding, and assistance to frontline states like Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. The Obama Administration continued Bush's foreign aid initiatives, including MCC, global health funding, and assistance to frontline states like Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. Funding for these initiatives was requested within Overseas Contingency Operations in regular appropriations bills. The first Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review was completed in 2010, naming USAID as the leading agency for development assistance. Reforms for the Department of State were implemented, including the establishment of the Bureau of Energy and elevating the Office of the Coordinator for Stabilization and Reconstruction. In the FY2012 budget proposals, significant changes were proposed for funding the frontline states. In FY2012, the Department of State implemented reforms including the establishment of the Bureau of Energy and elevating the Office of the Coordinator for Stabilization and Reconstruction. The use of OCO funds was extended to cover temporary costs in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, with Congress expanding the designation to include additional accounts and countries. The OCO designation became more significant with the Budget Control Act of 2011, allowing war-related funding to be separate from core budget caps. The OCO designation, established in FY2012, allows for funding of war-related activities separate from core budget caps. However, OCO funds are subject to automatic across-the-board reductions under the Budget Control Act of 2011. The Obama Administration criticized the use of emergency supplemental funds for foreign operations, pledging to request funds through the regular budget process. The Obama Administration criticized the use of emergency supplemental funds for foreign operations, pledging to request funds through the regular budget process starting in FY2010. This led to a sharp increase in base funding in FY2010, with supplemental international affairs funds still requested for activities in Haiti, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan. FY2011 was the only year in the last decade where all international affairs funding was part of the base budget before the OCO approach was adopted in FY2012. For FY2013, $8.24 billion, about 15% of the international affairs request, was designated as OCO. For FY2013, the Administration requested $8.24 billion, or 15% of the international affairs budget, to be designated as Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). This amount was 5% less than the previous year and 26% less than what Congress enacted. The House and Senate bills had differing OCO designations, with the Senate bill allocating $2.3 billion, 72% less than requested, due to no funding for the Iraq Police Development program. State Department-Foreign Operations funding had been increasing until 2011, with exceptions in FY2004 for Iraq and Afghanistan reconstruction funds. State Department-Foreign Operations funding trended upward until 2011, with a spike in FY2004 for Iraq and Afghanistan reconstruction. Funding leveled off in FY2012 and FY2013 due to deficit reduction efforts. State-Foreign Operations appropriations over the past decade are shown in Table 2 and Figure 3, while appropriations for the State Department are shown in Table 3 and Figure 4. In the past decade, State Department and related agencies funding has increased steadily, with a spike in foreign aid in 2004. However, State Department funding lagged behind. Recent years have seen a steeper increase in funding, reflecting efforts to increase human resource capacity. Foreign aid funding levels off in FY2012 and FY2013, while State Department funding continues to rise. Israel and Egypt historically received the largest amounts of U.S. aid. Foreign aid funding levels off in FY2012 and FY2013, with Israel and Egypt historically receiving the largest amounts of U.S. aid. Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan have also been top recipients, with temporary OCO appropriations included in their funding. Israel topped the list at $3,100 million in Foreign Military Financing (FMF), followed by Afghanistan at $2,505 million, with a portion designated as OCO. The FY2013 foreign aid request includes temporary OCO appropriations for Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. Israel, Afghanistan, and Pakistan were the top aid recipients, with Iraq moving up to fourth place. Aid to Africa would have decreased by 10%, while aid to the Near East and South Central Asia would have increased. In FY2013, U.S. foreign aid requests included increases for the Near East and South Central Asia regions, with a focus on support for the Arab Spring and war-related costs in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Aid to Africa primarily targets health programs, while the Western Hemisphere saw a decline in funding for Colombia. Europe and Eurasia experienced a 14% decrease due to progress in the region, and aid to East Asia and Pacific remained consistent. Congress has shown interest in various aid sectors like education and health. Aid to East Asia and Pacific in FY2013 remained low and consistent with past levels. The Administration's budget requests for key interest areas showed declines in funding for most sectors compared to FY2012, including major initiatives like Food Security and Global Climate Change. The Administration's FY2013 budget requests for key interest areas showed declines in funding for most sectors compared to FY2012. Two major initiatives, Food Security and Global Climate Change, had reduced funding requests. Other sectors with decreased funding included Sustainable Landscapes, Neglected Tropical Diseases, Nutrition, Maternal and Child Health, Higher Education, Clean Energy, and Basic Education. Increased funding was emphasized for Gender Funding and Science, Technology, and Innovation."
