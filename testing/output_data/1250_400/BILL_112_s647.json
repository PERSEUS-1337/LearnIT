    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Montana Mineral Conveyance Act\" and includes findings. Congress finds that the Secretary of the Interior conveyed mineral rights in coal tracts near the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation to the State of Montana, resulting in substantial public revenues for the State. Despite the economic challenges faced by the Northern Cheyenne tribal community, they do not benefit significantly from these revenues. The Northern Cheyenne Tribe faces economic challenges and lacks revenue sources to address development impacts. In 2002, the Tribe sued the Secretary over the conveyance of Federal coal tracts to the State, citing violations of Federal laws and the trust responsibility to the Tribe. The suit was later withdrawn with prejudice. The Northern Cheyenne Tribe withdrew a lawsuit with prejudice, citing violations of Federal laws and the trust responsibility to the Tribe. The Tribe retains claims against the United States for failing to acquire mineral rights on Reservation land.
