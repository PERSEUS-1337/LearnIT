    "content": "The \"Violence Against Children Act of 2003\" may be cited as such. Congress finds that children under 18 account for a significant portion of crime victims, with high rates of sex crimes and kidnapping. They are also more likely to be victims of violent crime compared to adults. Many crimes against children go unreported, leading to long-lasting negative effects such as delayed development and substance abuse. Lack of resources hinders local agencies from adequately protecting children and families in need. Failure to pay child support is considered a form of neglect. Most local agencies lack resources to protect children and families in need, leading to issues like inadequate education, healthcare, and housing for neglected children. Failure to pay child support contributes to children living in poverty. TITLE I--ENHANCED FEDERAL ROLE IN CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN\n\nSEC. 101. ENHANCED PENALTIES.
