    "content": "The codification of effective dates for claims under laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs is addressed in Section 1. The definitions of key terms related to claims for benefits under laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs are outlined in Section 5100 of title 38, United States Code. This includes defining terms such as 'claimant,' 'claim,' 'formal claim,' and 'informal claim.' The term 'reasonably raised claim' refers to evidence of entitlement to a benefit under laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs that is not explicitly raised in a claim but is logically placed at issue with a sympathetic reading. The term 'reasonably raised claim' means evidence of entitlement to a benefit under laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs that is not explicitly raised in a claim but is logically placed at issue. In the context of veterans' benefits, informal claims can be made before filing a formal claim. The Secretary must provide an application form for a formal claim upon receipt of an informal claim. Informal requests for claim increases or reopening are treated the same as formal claims. The date of receipt for benefit applications is determined by the date of an informal communication related to the benefit. The Secretary must consider an informal communication as the filing date for benefit applications, as long as the formal application is submitted within 180 days of receiving necessary forms. Failure to submit within this timeframe will result in the application being considered filed on the date the completed form is submitted. Additionally, the Secretary is required to identify, address, and adjudicate reasonably raised claims in veterans' benefits. The Secretary is mandated to identify, address, and adjudicate reasonably raised claims in veterans' benefits, even those related to separate conditions not part of a formal claim, as outlined in the new section 5103B of Chapter 51. The amendments made by this Act regarding the treatment of reasonably raised claims will be effective on the date of enactment and will apply to claims submitted on or after that date."
