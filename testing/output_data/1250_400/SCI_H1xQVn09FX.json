    "content": "Efficient audio synthesis is a challenging machine learning task due to human perception sensitivity to global structure and waveform coherence. GANs can generate high-fidelity and locally-coherent audio by modeling log magnitudes and instantaneous frequencies with sufficient frequency resolution. Extensive empirical investigations on the NSynth dataset show that GANs outperform WaveNet baselines in generating audio faster and more efficiently. Neural audio synthesis faces challenges in modeling temporal scales over a wide range. Autoregressive models like WaveNet focus on fine-scale details but have slow sampling speeds. Efforts to speed up generation introduce overhead. On the other hand, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown success in generating high-resolution audio efficiently. Neural audio synthesis faces challenges in modeling temporal scales over a wide range. Autoregressive models like WaveNet focus on fine-scale details but have slow sampling speeds. On the other hand, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown success in generating high-resolution audio efficiently, with potential for domain transformations similar to images. However, adapting image GAN architectures for audio waveform generation has not achieved the same level of fidelity. Frame-based techniques for audio waveform estimation struggle to maintain phase coherence due to the mismatch between audio periodicity and output stride. Transposed convolutional filters and STFTs aim to cover all frequencies and phase alignments, with STFT allowing for phase unwrapping to calculate instantaneous radial frequency. GAN researchers have made strides in image modeling but face challenges in achieving the same fidelity in audio waveform generation. The NSynth dataset focuses on individual notes from musical instruments, aligning and cropping the data to emphasize fine-scale details like timbre and fidelity. Similar to CelebA for images, NSynth aims to provide a common reference for improving audio generation models. NSynth dataset BID9 2 consists of individual notes from musical instruments, aligned and cropped for fine-scale details like timbre and fidelity. It includes attribute labels for conditional generation and has been explored with various models like autoregressive WaveNet and VAEs with perceptual priors. Adversarial training and noncausal convolutional generation are introduced to improve audio waveform generation. This work introduces adversarial regularization for domain transfer in audio waveform generation. It focuses on maintaining the regularity of periodic signals over short to intermediate timescales, crucial for human perception. The synthesis network must learn appropriate frequency and phase combinations to produce coherent waveforms. The synthesis network faces a challenge in learning frequency and phase combinations to generate coherent waveforms. Phase precession, similar to STFT, occurs when filterbanks overlap. A new approach inspired by the phase vocoder involves unwrapping the phase to observe a constant derivative representing the instantaneous angular frequency. The unwrapped phase reveals the instantaneous angular frequency, showing the true signal oscillation. Generating log-magnitude spectrograms and estimating IF spectra with GANs can produce coherent audio. Keeping harmonics from overlapping is crucial for synthesizing coherent waveforms. In synthesizing coherent audio with GANs, generating log-magnitude spectrograms and phases directly can produce more coherent waveforms. Estimating IF spectra leads to even more coherent audio. Keeping harmonics from overlapping is important by increasing STFT frame size and switching to mel frequency scale. GANs can outperform WaveNet baseline on the NSynth dataset and generate examples much faster. Global conditioning on latent and pitch vectors allows GANs to generate smooth timbre interpolation and consistent timbral identity across pitch. The study focuses on the NSynth dataset, containing 300,000 musical notes from 1,000 different instruments. The study focuses on the NSynth dataset, which contains 300,000 musical notes from 1,000 different instruments. The dataset is highly diverse in timbres and pitches, with labels for pitch, velocity, instrument, and acoustic qualities. Training was done on acoustic instruments and fundamental pitches ranging from MIDI 24-84. The dataset was split into a new 80/20 train/test split for generating audio spectra using progressive training methods.

The dataset is diverse in timbres and pitches, with labels for pitch, velocity, instrument, and acoustic qualities. Training was on acoustic instruments and fundamental pitches from MIDI 24-84. A new 80/20 train/test split was created for generating audio spectra using progressive training methods like BID16. The model samples a random vector z from a spherical Gaussian and uses transposed convolutions to upsample and generate output data x = G(z). Gradient penalty and pixel normalization are used for continuity. Both progressive and nonprogressive training variants were tried, showing comparable quality. The architecture involves using a gradient penalty for Lipschitz continuity and pixel normalization. Progressive training shows slightly better convergence time and sample diversity. The method includes conditioning on musical pitch information for independent control of pitch and timbre. An auxiliary classification loss is added to the discriminator to predict pitch labels. STFT magnitudes and phase angles are computed using TensorFlow. To further enhance the model, an auxiliary classification loss is incorporated to predict pitch labels. STFT magnitudes and phase angles are computed using TensorFlow, with a frame size of 1024 and 256 stride, resulting in spectral images of size (256, 512, 2). Magnitudes are log-transformed and scaled to match the tanh output nonlinearity, while phase angles are also scaled. Additionally, models with higher frequency resolution are achieved by doubling the STFT frame size and stride, resulting in spectral images of size (128, 1024, 2). The text discusses the creation of \"instantaneous frequency\" (\"IF\") models with high frequency resolution and \"IF-Mel\" variants for separating lower frequencies. Comparison is made against WaveGAN for waveform generation, with similar performance achieved by the models without progressive training. WaveGAN, the current state of the art in waveform generation with GANs, is adapted to accept pitch conditioning and retrained on a subset of the NSynth dataset. Strong WaveNet baselines are created by adapting the architecture to accept the same one-hot pitch conditioning signal as the GANs. The 8-bit WaveNet model is found to be more stable and outperforms the 16-bit model. The 8-bit WaveNet model outperforms the 16-bit model in waveform generation with GANs. Evaluation of generative models includes human evaluation for audio quality due to the sensitivity of human perception to phase irregularities. Amazon Mechanical Turk was used for comparison tests on examples from all models. The study focused on training networks to synthesize coherent waveforms, with human perception being sensitive to phase irregularities. Amazon Mechanical Turk was used for comparison tests on examples from all models. Evaluation metrics included Number of Statistically-Different Bins (NDB) and Inception Score (IS) to measure diversity and quality of generated examples. The evaluation metrics used in the study included Number of Statistically-Different Bins (NDB) and Inception Score (IS) to measure diversity and quality of generated examples. Inception Score evaluates GANs by calculating the mean KL divergence between imageconditional output class probabilities and the marginal distribution. The metric \"IS\" was modified to use features from a pitch classifier trained on spectrograms. Additionally, Pitch Accuracy (PA) and Pitch Entropy (PE) were used to address issues with distinct pitches and pitch variety in generated examples. The study used various evaluation metrics including Inception Score (IS) with features from a pitch classifier, Pitch Accuracy (PA), Pitch Entropy (PE), and Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID) to assess the quality and diversity of generated examples. Results showed a clear trend of decreasing quality as output representations moved from IF-Mel, IF, Phase, to Waveform. Human evaluation was the most discerning measure of audio quality. The study compared different model and representation variants for audio generation, with human evaluation showing a clear trend of decreasing quality from IF-Mel to Waveform. High frequency resolution improved sample diversity, with WaveNet baseline receiving the worst scores. Autoregressive sampling led to a lack of diversity in generated sounds. The study compared different model and representation variants for audio generation, showing a trend of decreasing quality from IF-Mel to Waveform. High frequency resolution improved sample diversity, with WaveNet baseline receiving the worst scores. Autoregressive sampling led to a lack of diversity in generated sounds, reflected in metrics like NDB, FID, and classifier metrics. The classifier metrics of IS, Pitch Accuracy, and Pitch Entropy show that high-resolution models generate examples with similar accuracy to real data. However, due to mode collapse and other issues, there is little discriminative information to gain about sample quality from differences among high scores. The metrics do indicate that low frequency models and baselines are less reliably generating classifiable pitches. It is recommended to listen to the accompanying audio examples for a better understanding. The audio examples at https://goo.gl/magenta/gansynth-examples show waveform differences between WaveGAN, PhaseGAN, and IFGAN models. Real data and IF models have coherent waveforms, while PhaseGAN has phase irregularities and WaveGAN is irregular. Rainbowgrams depict the phase coherence of different GAN variants. In FIG1, phase coherence of various GAN variants is visualized. Real data and IF models show consistent waveforms, while PhaseGAN has discontinuities and WaveGAN is irregular. Rainbowgrams illustrate the harmonics' phase coherence, highlighting the differences between the GAN models. WaveNet autoencoders like BID9 learn local latent codes for generation but have limitations. Interpolating waveforms results in mixing sounds, with WaveNet showing issues like oscillation and whistling. In contrast, IF-Mel GAN has a spherical gaussian prior for global interpolation. The GAN model with a spherical gaussian prior allows for global interpolation, resulting in high-fidelity audio examples during waveform interpolation. Unlike WaveNet autoencoders, which exhibit natural failure modes like oscillation and whistling, the IF-Mel GAN produces smooth perceptual changes and realistic sounds throughout the interpolation process. The GAN model with a spherical gaussian prior enables high-fidelity audio interpolation, ensuring smooth perceptual changes and realistic sounds. Timbre morphs smoothly between instruments while pitches remain consistent, creating a unique instrument identity in latent space. The GAN model with a spherical gaussian prior enables high-fidelity audio interpolation, ensuring smooth perceptual changes and realistic sounds. The timbral identity of the GAN remains intact, creating a unique instrument identity in latent space. The training and generation process can be done in parallel for the entire audio sample, making it significantly faster than autoregressive models like WaveNet. This opens up the possibility for real-time neural network audio synthesis. The IF-Mel GAN is significantly faster than the WaveNet baseline, making audio synthesis around 53,880 times faster. This allows for real-time neural network audio synthesis on devices, expanding the range of expressive sounds. Compared to speech synthesis, music audio generation is relatively under-explored, with potential for further research on adversarial audio synthesis. Adapting GANs for variable-length conditioning or recurrent generators is a future research direction. Music audio generation is less explored compared to speech. Previous work on autoregressive models for music synthesis showed slow generation. Recent advances in GAN literature include modifications to loss functions for improved training stability and architectural robustness. Progressive training and architectural tricks have also been proposed to enhance generation quality. The NSynth dataset was likened to the \"CelebA of audio\" and used WaveNet autoencoders for interpolating musical instrument timbres. In a curriculum, discriminator learning improves generation quality within limited training time. Architectural tricks further enhance quality in models. NSynth dataset, dubbed \"CelebA of audio,\" used WaveNet autoencoders for timbre interpolation. BID23 incorporated adversarial domain confusion loss for timbre transformations. BID5 achieved faster sampling speeds by training a regression model for pitch and instrument labels. GANs show high-quality audio generation by controlling audio representation. The study demonstrates high-quality audio generation with GANs on the NSynth dataset, surpassing WaveNet baseline fidelity and generating samples much faster. Further research is needed to validate and expand to different types of natural sound. Possible applications include domain transfer and addressing mode collapse and diversity issues common in GANs for audio. Issues of mode collapse and diversity in GANs for audio are addressed by combining adversarial losses with encoders or regression losses. Different learning rates and weights were tested, with a learning rate of 8e-4 and classifier loss of 10 performing the best. Both networks use box upscaling/downscaling and pixel normalization. The discriminator includes a pitch classifier and appends the standard deviation of minibatch activations. The generators use pixel normalization, and the discriminator appends the standard deviation of minibatch activations. Real data is normalized before passing to the discriminator. GAN variants are trained for 4.5 days on a single V100 GPU with different batch sizes. Progressive models train on 1.6M examples per stage, with a total of 11M examples for progressive models. The WaveNet baseline also uses an open source Tensorflow implementation. The training process involves using 5M examples, with progressive models training on 1.6M examples per stage over 7 stages. The WaveNet baseline utilizes a Tensorflow implementation with a decoder consisting of 30 layers of dilated convolution. The conditioning stack operates on a one-hot pitch conditioning signal distributed in time and is added to the output of each layer. The 8-bit model uses mulaw encoding for the audio. The conditioning stack in the WaveNet model consists of 5 layers of dilated convolution followed by 3 layers of regular convolution, all with 512 channels. A 1x1 convolution is applied to each layer of the decoder and added to the output. The model uses mulaw encoding for the 8-bit audio model and a quantized mixture of 10 logistics for the 16-bit model. WaveNets converged in 150k iterations over 2 days using 32 V100 GPUs with synchronous SGD training."
