The DOD and military services have spent millions on alternative fuels, with the Navy proposing a significant investment. This report provides an overview of DOD's alternative fuels policy and purchases, as well as the status of testing platforms for alternative fuel blends. The DOD and military services have spent funds on testing, certification, and demonstrations of alternative fuels, with DOD purchasing approximately $17.3 billion in petroleum fuels in FY2011. The report provides an overview of DOD's alternative fuels policy, purchases, testing platforms for alternative fuel blends, and the Navy's biofuel production initiative under the Defense Production Act. It also discusses recent legislative actions related to DOD alternative fuels efforts. The FY2012 National Defense Authorization Act assigned oversight of DOD's alternative fuels initiatives to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Operational Energy Plans and Programs, streamlining policy and investments for alternative fuels development within the military departments and the Office of the Secretary of Defense. The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Operational Plans and Programs leads DOD's alternative fuel activities, oversees investments, issues guidelines, and encourages collaboration with other federal agencies. The goals of DOD alternative fuels policy are to ensure military readiness, improve battlespace effectiveness, and increase fuel source options for operational commanders. Considerations for investments include resilience against supply disruptions, dampening petroleum price volatility, and increasing expeditionary effectiveness. DOD's alternative fuels policy aims to enhance battlespace effectiveness and provide multiple reliable fuel sources. Investments must meet criteria such as being cost-competitive, drop-in fuels, and produced from non-food crop feedstock. The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Operational Energy Plans and Programs oversees budget certification for alternative fuel activities. DOD investments in alternative fuel activities must be certified as part of the annual operational energy budget certification process. The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Operational Energy Plans and Programs reviews proposed budgets to ensure they align with the operational energy strategy. The annual operational energy report now includes alternative fuels initiatives, with future investments subject to a rigorous evaluation process. Alternative fuels development follows three phases: Certification, Field Demonstration, and Review by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Operational Energy Plans and Programs. Phase 2 involves field demonstrations of new fuels, reviewed by various defense offices. Phase 3 focuses on purchasing operational quantities of alternative fuels, with competition based on meeting requirements at best value. Each military service has set goals for alternative fuels, with the Army aiming to increase the use of renewable/alternative energy. The Army aims to increase the use of renewable/alternative energy, with specific goals for energy sources by 2028. The Air Force has set a goal to acquire 50% of its domestic aviation fuel requirements from alternative sources by 2016. Additionally, they aim to test and certify all aircraft on a 50:50 alternative fuel blend by 2012. The Air Force aims to test and certify all aircraft on a 50:50 alternative fuel blend by 2012, with a goal to acquire 50% of its domestic aviation fuel requirements from alternative sources by 2016. The Navy has set ambitious goals to deploy a \"Great Green Fleet\" strike group running entirely on alternative fuel blends by 2016 and to meet 50% of its total energy consumption from alternative sources by 2020. The Navy aims to meet 50% of its total energy consumption from alternative sources by 2020. To achieve this, they plan to reduce liquid fuel usage afloat and replace approximately 8 million barrels of petroleum with unblended alternative fuels. DLA Energy has procured 1.9 million gallons of alternative fuels for the military since 2007, with DOD spending $48 million to test and certify alternative fuels for service fleets. The DOD has spent $48 million to test and certify alternative fuels for service fleets. Various types of alternative fuels have been purchased by the services, including Fischer-Tropsch fuels, biofuels, and hydrotreated jet and diesel biofuels. The Air Force and Navy have purchased different types of alternative fuels, such as alcohol-to-jet fuels and direct-sugar-to-hydrocarbons fuels. Section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 prohibits federal agencies, including DOD, from entering into contracts for alternative fuels with high greenhouse gas emissions. The DOD has purchased alternative fuels like Fischer-Tropsch fuels, biofuels, and hydrotreated jet and diesel biofuels. Section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act prohibits high greenhouse gas emissions in fuel contracts. DOD's position is that this provision does not apply to bulk fuel purchases. The Army, Navy, and Air Force are testing alternative fuel blends for fleet-wide use. The Army, Navy, and Air Force are testing alternative fuel blends for fleet-wide use, including Fischer-Tropsch synthetic paraffinic kerosene and hydrotreated renewable jet. The Army aims to certify these fuels by 2014 and is also working on obtaining Air Force certification for H-60 Black Hawk helicopters. The Army plans to complete testing of tactical ground equipment systems for alternative fuels by the end of FY2014. The Army, Navy, and Air Force are testing alternative fuel blends for fleet-wide use. The Air Force has certified Fischer-Tropsch fuel blends for its fleets and is testing biofuels like HEFA fuels. The Navy has tested HEFA 50:50 biofuel blends for aircraft. The Air Force has also tested alcohol-to-jet fuels, with the first flight on an ATJ-conventional fuel blend in 2012. The Navy tested HEFA 50:50 biofuel blends for ships. In April 2010, the Navy tested HEFA 50:50 biofuel blends for aircraft, including the \"Green Hornet\" F/A-18. Testing for ships is almost complete, with certification expected in early 2013. Fischer-Tropsch fuels testing will be finished by the end of 2013. The Navy is also exploring other alternative fuels like alcohol-to-jet and pyrolysis oils. In June 2011, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed to support the development of a sustainable biofuels industry. The MOU calls for government investment to support the development of a sustainable commercial biofuels industry, specifically advanced drop-in biofuel plants and refineries. The Navy and Department of Energy plan to fund this initiative with $340 million in federal funds for capital investment and production, with additional support from the Department of Agriculture. Total government funding for the project is anticipated at $510 million over three years. The government will provide $340 million for capital investment and production, with industry cost-sharing. An additional $171 million will come from the Department of Agriculture for biofuel feedstocks. Total government funding for the project is expected to be $510 million over three years, with contributions from the Navy, Department of Energy, and Department of Agriculture. Awards for biofuels production facilities will be given in two phases, with Phase 1 focusing on planning and preliminary designs, and Phase 2 on construction. Government funding of $210 million will be awarded in two phases for biofuels production facilities. Phase 1 will have five awards of up to $6 million each for planning and designs, expected in March 2013. Phase 2 will award up to three grants of $70 million each for construction and testing. Requirements include 50% cost share, domestic production of biofuels, compliance with Energy Security Act, use of renewable feedstock, cost-competitive fuel, and a production capacity of at least 10 million gallons a year. Funding includes $100 million from DOD and $70 million for Navy's biofuels production initiative. The FOA funding level of $210 million includes $100 million from DOD, $70 million for the Navy's biofuels production initiative, and $40 million from DOE. It does not include $171 million of USDA funding for bio-based jet fuel production. The Commodity Credit Corporation has the authority to borrow up to $30 billion for this purpose. The USDA and the Commodity Credit Corporation have the authority to increase the use of agricultural commodities for bio-based jet fuel production. Legislative activity in 2012 focused on expanding or limiting DOD's ability to purchase alternative fuels and invest in production capability. H.R. 4310 contained provisions exempting DOD from certain requirements and limiting the purchase of more expensive alternative fuels. The Senate passed S. 3254 without restrictions on DOD's ability to purchase alternative fuels or invest in biofuels production. Amendments removed restrictive provisions from the bill. The FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act prohibits DOD from using funds for biofuel refinery construction without matching funds from the Defense Production Act. The FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 4310 / P.L. 112-239) prohibits the Department of Defense from using funds for biofuel refinery construction without matching contributions from the Department of Energy and Department of Agriculture. The Navy requested $70 million for advanced drop-in biofuels production in FY2013. The USDA requested funds for a domestic biofuel industry through the Commodity Credit Corporation. The House Appropriations Committee declined to fund the $70 million requested for biofuel production, while the Senate recommended funding the overall Defense Production Act Fund at $189 million. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2013 includes $63.5 million in funding for biofuels. The Department of Defense, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (H.R. 933/P.L. 113-6) appropriated $223.5 million for the Defense Production Act Fund, an increase of $134.3 million. However, funding for advanced drop-in biofuels was reduced by $10 million to $60 million. Additionally, $20 million was allocated for research on reducing emissions from coal to liquid fuels in the Air Force's Research & Development. The conferees did not include a provision for the Energy Independence and Security Act as proposed by the House. The conferees allocated $20 million for research into lowering emissions from coal to liquid fuels in the Air Force's Research & Development, aiming to make this technology a competitive alternative energy resource. The Secretary of the Air Force must inform congressional defense committees before using the funds. The Department of Energy requested to transfer funds into the Defense Production Act Fund for FY2013. The House-passed version of the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act does not include this authorization, while the Senate version allows up to $100 million transfer. DOE's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy was funded at $1.8 billion under the Department of Defense appropriations. The Department of Energy's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy received approximately $1.8 billion in funding under the Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013. Congress is considering oversight questions regarding the Department of Defense and services' alternative fuels initiatives, including benefits over conventional fuels, funding allocation, and coordination efforts to prevent duplication. The Navy's $510 million investment in advanced biofuels is supported by analysis from the Navy, DOE, and USDA. The Navy's $510 million investment in advanced biofuels is being questioned for coordination with other agencies and potential duplication of efforts. The Department of Defense's efforts to jumpstart a domestic biofuels industry are led by the Navy, raising concerns about oversight and coordination among military services. The role of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Operational Energy Plans and Programs in overseeing alternative fuel goals and investments is being scrutinized for effectiveness and impact on military services' initiatives. The curr_chunk discusses the oversight authority of ASD(OEPP) in alternative fuels testing and certification, coordination activities, and potential overlap with other federal agencies. It also mentions the FY2012 Department of Defense Appropriations Act allocating $150 million for DPA Title III funding. The FY2012 Department of Defense Appropriations Act allocated $150 million for DPA Title III funding, supporting biofuels initiatives and encouraging longer contract terms for biofuels procurement. The Senate Appropriations Committee report emphasized the need for long-term contracts to ensure adequate biofuels production. The Department of Defense is encouraged to fund multi-year contracts for biofuels products to maximize efficiencies of scale and ensure adequate production. The House Appropriations Committee supports long-term contracts for biofuels to benefit the armed forces and the nation. The Department of Energy requested authority for extended multi-year contracts for biofuel products in FY2013. The Department of Energy requested authority for extended multi-year contracts for biofuel products in FY2013, but the House Appropriations Committee declined to fund and authorize this initiative. The Committee recommended $203,000,000 for Biomass and Biorefinery Systems R&D, $3,000,000 above fiscal year 2012 and $67,000,000 below the budget request. The House Appropriations Committee declined to fund the Department of Energy's joint initiative with the Navy and the Department of Agriculture for biofuels production. The Committee recommended $203,000,000 for Biomass and Biorefinery Systems R&D, directing the Department to focus on technologies for producing fuels and electricity from biomass and crops that are not used as food. The Department of Energy has not justified funding for the Defense initiative, with no recommendation for funding and legislative language. The Senate Appropriations Committee allows for funds to be transferred to the Defense Production Act Fund for biofuel production. The report supports the joint biofuel production initiative by DOD, DOE, and USDA. The FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 4310 / S. 3254) includes provisions supporting the collaboration between the Navy, Department of Agriculture, and DOE to develop innovative technologies for jet and diesel fuels for military uses. The Act also exempts the Department of Defense from the alternative fuel procurement requirement. The provisions of H.R. 4310 exempt the Department of Defense from the alternative fuel procurement requirement and impose limitations on the funds available for the production or purchase of alternative fuels. The Secretary of Defense is allowed to purchase limited quantities of alternative fuels for fleet certification purposes. The Secretary of Defense may purchase limited quantities of alternative fuels for fleet certification purposes, even if the cost exceeds traditional fossil fuels. S. 3254 does not restrict the Department of Defense's ability to procure or produce biofuels. Amendments affecting biofuel procurement were removed from the Senate version of the bill. The Senate passed amendments sponsored by Senators Udall and Hagan, which removed provisions limiting the Department of Defense's procurement of biofuels. These amendments struck sections from the bill that would have restricted the purchase of alternative fuels exceeding the cost of traditional fossil fuels and prohibited the Department from entering into contracts for biofuels refinery infrastructure without specific authorization. The Senate passed amendments removing restrictions on the Department of Defense's procurement of biofuels. These amendments struck sections from the bill prohibiting contracts for biofuels refinery infrastructure without specific authorization. The Senate passed amendments removing restrictions on the Department of Defense's procurement of biofuels, allowing for the purchase of alternative fuels as long as their cost does not exceed that of traditional fossil fuels. The amendments aim to facilitate engine or fleet certification for 50/50 blends of alternative fuels. The Secretary of Defense may purchase limited quantities of alternative fuels for engine or fleet certification for 50/50 blends using competitive procedures to ensure the best purchase price. Construction of biofuels refineries by the Department of Defense is prohibited unless specifically authorized by law. The Department of Defense is prohibited from using funds for the production or purchase of alternative fuels if the cost exceeds that of traditional fossil fuels, except for testing purposes. In 2011, the Defense Logistics Agency purchased 450,000 gallons of biofuels for $12.0 million, the largest government purchase of biofuel, to demonstrate the capability of using alternative fuels. The Department of the Navy made the largest government purchase of biofuel in 2011 to showcase the Carrier Strike Group's ability to use alternative fuels. Despite the higher cost, it was justified as a research initiative. The Vice Chief of Naval Operations highlighted the impact of fuel price increases on readiness accounts. The committee supports efforts to reduce fuel demand through new technologies but acknowledges the strain on defense budgets. The committee supports Department of Defense initiatives to reduce fuel demand through new technologies but is concerned about using operation and maintenance funds for higher biofuel costs in RDTE efforts. They direct the Secretary of Defense to provide guidance on the difference between operational use of alternative fuels and RDTE initiatives. (Pages 80-81) H.R. 4310 / P.L. 113-6 Section 315 of the enrolled FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act limits Department of Defense funds for biofuel refinery construction under the Defense Production Act of 1950. The National Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 4310 / P.L. 112-239) limits Department of Defense funds for biofuel refinery construction until matching contributions are received from the Department of Energy and Department of Agriculture. The House Appropriations Committee allocated $70,000,000 for advanced drop-in biofuel production in the 2013 fiscal year. The House Appropriations Committee allocated $70,000,000 for advanced drop-in biofuel production in the 2013 fiscal year, but the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended an additional $100 million for the Defense Production Act fund in FY2013.
