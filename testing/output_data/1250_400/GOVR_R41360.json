    "content": "One of the most controversial issues in U.S. foreign assistance is restrictions on funding for abortion and family planning activities abroad. The debate revolves around whether recipients of U.S. aid perform abortions or engage in coercive practices with U.S. funds, and the impact of withholding funds on population growth and reproductive health services in developing countries. Congressional debates on these issues have been ongoing since the Roe v. Wade ruling in 1973. Members of Congress have introduced legislation to prohibit abortion in the U.S. and attach provisions to appropriations measures. The 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling protects a woman's right to choose abortion. Congressional debates on abortion funding have expanded to include foreign assistance, leading to restrictions on international abortion and family planning activities. President Reagan implemented the \"Mexico City policy\" in 1984, requiring foreign NGOs receiving USAID family planning assistance to certify they do not perform abortions. During the 115th Congress, debates continued on international abortion restrictions, including the Mexico City policy. President Reagan implemented the policy in 1984, requiring foreign NGOs receiving USAID family planning assistance to certify they do not perform or promote abortion. The policy has been rescinded and reinstated by various Administrations, most recently by President Trump in 2017. Members of Congress have debated renewing, modifying, or removing language on abortion and family planning in State-Foreign Operations legislation. During the 115th Congress, debates continued on international abortion restrictions, including the Mexico City policy. Some Members sought to renew, add, modify, or remove language addressing these issues in State-Foreign Operations legislation. Legislation aiming to make the Mexico City policy permanent law was also introduced. Federal funding for abortion and family planning activities in foreign assistance remains controversial, with ongoing congressional interest. This report examines key legislative and executive branch policies that restrict U.S. funding of abortion or voluntary family planning activities abroad. Legislation, such as the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, establishes different types of foreign aid programs and restrictions, including those related to abortion and family planning. Various provisions, like the \"Helms amendment,\" impact U.S. funding for these programs. Congress has amended the FAA since 1961 to modify foreign aid authorization laws. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 authorizes different types of foreign assistance, including development, military, and security aid. Congress has not comprehensively reauthorized most programs in the FAA since 1985, leading to debates and disagreements on controversial issues. Annual appropriations measures have become increasingly significant in influencing how U.S. foreign aid is disbursed, often including family planning or abortion-related restrictions. In recent years, Congress has considered appropriations measures that set spending levels for foreign assistance, with many including family planning or abortion-related restrictions. The links among these requirements and restrictions are complex, with some amendments added for emphasis or to apply to additional categories of aid. Various restrictions and requirements may stand alone or seek to clarify existing ones, such as the Leahy and Livingston amendments. The Leahy and Livingston amendments clarify and amend existing restrictions on U.S. funding of abortion. The Helms amendment prohibits the use of U.S. foreign assistance funds for abortions or coercion. It was introduced in 1973 by Senator Jesse Helms to address concerns about federal funds being used for abortions overseas. The Helms amendment, introduced in 1973, prohibits the use of U.S. foreign assistance funds for abortions or coercion overseas. It applies to all foreign assistance activities authorized by the Foreign Assistance Act (FAA) and has been periodically enacted in foreign operations appropriations measures since FY1980. The Helms amendment, introduced in 1973, prohibits the use of U.S. foreign assistance funds for abortions or coercion overseas. It applies to all foreign assistance activities authorized by the Foreign Assistance Act (FAA) and has been periodically enacted in foreign operations appropriations measures since FY1980. The amendment also includes a provision that prohibits the use of funds for involuntary sterilizations or coercion of sterilizations. This provision has been included in both the FAA and State-Foreign Operations appropriations acts since 1978. The FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act includes a restriction on Peace Corps funding for abortions, with exceptions for cases of rape, incest, or endangerment to the mother's life. The Peace Corps covers the cost of medical evacuation for volunteers seeking abortions in locations where it is legally permissible. The Biden amendment prohibits the use of funds for biomedical research related to abortion or involuntary sterilization in foreign assistance activities. This provision has been included in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act. The Biden amendment prohibits the use of funds for abortion-related biomedical research in foreign assistance activities. The Siljander amendment prohibits the use of funds for lobbying for or against abortion in foreign operations appropriations acts. The FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act prohibits the use of funds for lobbying for or against abortion. In 1985, Congress enacted a provision to fund family planning projects that offer a range of services to reduce reliance on abortion in developing nations. This provision has been included in annual foreign operations appropriations legislation. DeConcini's provision, included in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, mandates that family planning projects in developing nations must offer a variety of services to reduce reliance on abortion. This requirement has been in place since 1985 and applies to all family planning assistance funded through the act. Additionally, the FY1986 Foreign Assistance Act prohibits funds from being used in countries or organizations that violate certain amendments related to family planning. The Helms, Biden, and involuntary sterilization amendments prohibit the use of funds for any country or organization that violates abortion or involuntary sterilization provisions. This provision is included in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act and applies to all foreign assistance activities authorized under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. The Kemp-Kasten amendment, introduced in 1985, also restricts funds from being used by organizations or programs that violate certain family planning provisions. The Kemp-Kasten amendment, introduced in 1985, prohibits funds from being used by organizations or programs supporting coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. It was included in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act and applies to foreign assistance activities. The provision was adopted due to concerns about the UNFPA's program in China. The Kemp-Kasten amendment, introduced in FY1985, prohibits funding for organizations involved in coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. The provision has affected UNFPA, with the US withholding funding in 16 out of 34 years due to concerns about its program in China. The Trump Administration determined in March 2017 that UNFPA supports such practices, leading to the current lack of US funding. The Obama Administration supported U.S. funding for UNFPA, emphasizing the President's commitment to international family planning and women's health. Currently, the U.S. is not providing funding to UNFPA under Kemp-Kasten due to concerns about its program in China. Congress has imposed conditions on U.S. funding for UNFPA, including restrictions on funds for China programs and the segregation of U.S. contributions. The Global Health Programs account receives funds for family planning, maternal, and reproductive health activities. UNFPA is prohibited from using funds for a country program in China and must keep U.S. contributions segregated. UNFPA cannot fund abortions to receive U.S. funding. The Secretary of State must report on funds withheld for China programs. Representative Bob Livingston introduced an amendment in 1986 to prevent discrimination against organizations. The Livingston amendment introduced in 1986 prohibits discrimination against organizations based on their religious or conscientious commitment to offer only \"natural\" family planning. It is related to the DeConcini amendment, which states that the United States shall only fund family planning projects that offer a range of family planning methods and services. This ensures that the United States cannot discriminate against organizations that support natural family planning. The Livingston amendment, related to the DeConcini amendment, ensures that the US funds family planning projects offering a range of methods. It prevents discrimination against organizations supporting natural family planning. The Leahy amendment clarifies the Helms amendment on abortion funding restrictions. The Leahy provision clarifies the Helms amendment on abortion funding restrictions by allowing the provision of information or counseling about all pregnancy options without violating the amendment. It has been included in various forms in foreign operations appropriations since its inception. The Tiahrt amendment prohibits the provision of information or counseling about pregnancy options in foreign operations appropriations legislation. It was enacted in FY1999 and has been included in subsequent fiscal years. The Tiahrt amendment restricts funding for voluntary family planning projects in foreign operations appropriations. It prohibits quotas, incentives, or denial of benefits based on family planning decisions. The Tiahrt amendment restricts funding for voluntary family planning projects in foreign operations appropriations, ensuring that no denial of benefits occurs based on family planning decisions. Family planning acceptors must receive comprehensive information on chosen methods' health benefits and risks, with experimental contraceptive drugs and devices provided only in scientific studies. The Tiahrt amendment aims to prevent funding for family planning projects that violate certain requirements, such as offering financial incentives for sterilization quotas. This was prompted by reports of forced sterilizations in rural Peru with little information on alternative contraception methods, leading to complications and even death. USAID issued guidance to ensure compliance with the Tiahrt requirements in voluntary family planning projects. The Tiahrt amendment was implemented to prevent funding for family planning projects that violate certain requirements, such as offering financial incentives for sterilization quotas. USAID issued guidance to ensure compliance with the amendment, and violations were reported in Peru, Guatemala, and the Philippines. An audit in 2007 found no further violations, and the amendment was included in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act. The Tiahrt amendment was included in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, ensuring no violations. The Mexico City policy, also known as \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance,\" restricts U.S. family planning assistance to foreign NGOs involved in voluntary abortion activities. The policy has been implemented and reversed by the executive branch, with Republicans supporting it and Democrats opposing it. The Trump Administration reinstated and expanded the policy to include all global health assistance, sparking controversy in U.S. foreign assistance. The Mexico City policy, first issued by President Reagan in 1984, restricts U.S. family planning assistance to foreign NGOs involved in abortion activities. Under the policy, U.S. funds cannot be used for abortions or involuntary sterilizations, but recipients can use their own resources for such activities. The policy has been a controversial issue in U.S. foreign assistance, with Republicans supporting it and Democrats opposing it. The Trump Administration recently reinstated and expanded the policy to include all global health assistance. Recipients of USAID grants could use their own resources and funds from other sources for abortion-related activities, with separate accounts for U.S. money to comply with restrictions. The Mexico City policy, initiated by President Reagan, required foreign NGOs to certify they would not promote abortion for family planning. President George H. W. Bush maintained the policy, President Clinton rescinded it in 1993, and President George W. Bush reinstated and expanded it in 2001 and 2003. Exceptions were made for cases of rape, incest, maternal life-threatening conditions, and postabortion care. President Bush expanded the Mexico City policy in 2003 to include all assistance for voluntary population planning by foreign NGOs. President Obama revoked the policy in 2009, citing overly broad conditions. President Trump reinstated the policy in 2017, expanding it to include global health assistance. President Trump reinstated and expanded the Mexico City policy in January 2017 to include global health assistance, renaming it \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance\" (PLGHA). The policy directs that U.S. taxpayer dollars do not fund organizations supporting coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization in international health programs totaling $8.8 billion. The \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance\" policy applies to $8.8 billion in funding for international health programs, excluding assistance to governments and humanitarian activities. The policy includes exemptions for certain cases and was reviewed by the Trump Administration in May 2018. The Trump Administration reviewed the implementation of the \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance\" policy in May 2018. The report acknowledged challenges and identified the need to improve understanding of the policy's intent and compliance. A further review of implementation is planned for December 15, 2018. The USAID issued Policy Determination 3 (PD-3) on voluntary sterilization (VS) in September 1982 to ensure that services funded by the U.S. government protect individuals' needs and rights. Requirements include informed consent and ready access to other family planning methods. The USAID issued Policy Determination 3 (PD-3) in 1982 to ensure that voluntary sterilization services funded by the U.S. government protect individuals' needs and rights. VS services must be provided with informed consent and ready access to other family planning methods. No incentive payments are allowed, and reasonable payments for extra expenses related to VS are permitted. Policy Determination 3 (PD-3) by USAID in 1982 ensures that voluntary sterilization services funded by the U.S. government protect individuals' needs and rights. Reasonable payments for extra expenses related to voluntary sterilization are allowed for various parties involved in the process."
