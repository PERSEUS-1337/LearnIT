This allows for manipulation of image attributes without changing the object's identity. The model successfully synthesizes images with and without specific attributes, achieving competitive scores on facial attribute classification tasks. The model synthesizes images with and without specific attributes, achieving competitive scores on facial attribute classification tasks. Latent space generative models like GANs and VAEs learn a mapping from latent encoding space to data space, allowing for attribute manipulation in image synthesis. Latent space generative models allow for attribute manipulation in image synthesis, such as editing existing images or synthesizing avatars. Research has focused on class conditional image synthesis, including fine-grained categories like different dog breeds. A new approach aims to solve the problem of image attribute manipulation by manipulating the latent space. The text discusses the proposal of latent space generative models for synthesizing images with attribute manipulation, focusing on faces of celebrities. The model aims to edit specific attributes of an image while keeping other elements similar, requiring a latent space representation that separates object categories from attributes. The proposed model learns a factored representation for faces, separating attribute information from the rest of the facial representation. The paper proposes a new model for learning a factored representation for faces, separating attribute information from the rest of the facial representation. It includes a novel cost function for training a VAE encoder, extensive quantitative analysis of loss components, competitive classification scores, and successful editing of the 'Smiling' attribute in over 90% of test cases. The paper introduces a new model for learning facial representations, achieving competitive classification scores and successful editing of the 'Smiling' attribute in over 90% of cases. Latent space generative models like Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are discussed, with a focus on VAE's encoder-decoder structure and training process. Variational autoencoders (VAEs) consist of an encoder and decoder, often implemented as neural networks with learnable parameters. VAEs are trained to maximize the evidence lower bound (ELBO) on log p(x), where p(x) is the data-generating distribution. The encoder predicts \u00b5\u03c6(x) and \u03c3\u03c6(x) for a given input x, and new data samples are synthesized by drawing latent samples from the prior and passing them through the decoder. VAEs offer both a generative model and an encoding model, useful for image editing. New data samples are synthesized by drawing latent samples from the prior and passing them through the decoder. VAEs offer a generative model and an encoding model for image editing. GANs, on the other hand, consist of a generator and a discriminator trained in a mini-max game to synthesize sharper images. The discriminator, C \u03c7, is trained to classify samples from the generator, G \u03b8, as 'fake' and samples from the data-generating distribution, p(x), as 'real'. The generator aims to confuse the discriminator by synthesizing samples that are indistinguishable from real ones. The vanilla GAN model lacks a straightforward method to map data samples to latent space, but a combination of VAE and GAN allows for faithful reconstruction of data samples through adversarial training on high-dimensional distributions. The approach involves combining a VAE with a GAN for attribute editing, using a discriminator to ensure high-quality data samples. Unlike a vanilla VAE or GAN, this model can synthesize samples resembling those in the training data, potentially from multiple categories. Conditional VAEs and GANs offer a solution for synthesizing class-specific data samples, allowing for category-conditional image synthesis. One approach involves appending a one-hot label vector to the encoder and decoder inputs, but for small label vectors, the label information may be ignored. Another approach presented involves the encoder outputting both a latent vector and an attribute vector, minimizing a classification loss between the true attributes and the predicted attributes. In conditional VAEs, incorporating attribute information can lead to unpredictable changes in synthesized data samples. This suggests that the attribute one wishes to edit is partially contained in the latent vector rather than solely in the label. In conditional VAEs, modifying the attribute vector for a fixed latent vector can result in unpredictable changes in synthesized data samples. Information about the attribute to be edited is partially contained in the latent vector rather than solely in the attribute label. A proposed process called 'Adversarial Information Factorization' aims to separate the information about the attribute from the latent vector using mini-max optimization involving the encoder, auxiliary network, and the attribute. The proposed process 'Adversarial Information Factorization' aims to separate information about attributes from the latent vector using mini-max optimization involving the encoder, auxiliary network, and the attribute. The process involves training an auxiliary network to predict attributes accurately while updating the VAE encoder to output values that cause the auxiliary network to fail. The proposed approach involves training the VAE encoder to separate attribute information from the latent vector by updating it to output values that deceive the auxiliary network. This factorization method is integrated into a VAE-GAN model to improve image quality, with the main contribution being an adversarial method to extract label information from the latent encoding. The proposed approach involves training the VAE encoder to separate attribute information from the latent vector by updating it to output values that deceive the auxiliary network. Additionally, the encoder acts as a classifier, outputting an attribute vector along with a latent vector. The parameters of the decoder are updated with gradients from a loss function, and the encoder parameters can be updated by minimizing a function with additional regularization coefficients. An additional network and cost function are proposed for training an encoder used for attribute manipulation. The proposed approach involves training a VAE encoder to separate attribute information from the latent vector by deceiving an auxiliary network. An additional network and cost function are proposed for training the encoder for attribute manipulation, incorporating a GAN architecture for classification. The proposed approach involves training a conditional VAE-GAN with an auxiliary network to factor out attribute information from the latent vector. This Information Factorization cVAE-GAN (IFcVAE-GAN) is trained to deceive the auxiliary network by encoding images with desired attributes for manipulation. The Information Factorization cVAE-GAN (IFcVAE-GAN) is trained to manipulate image attributes by encoding images with desired attributes, such as 'Smiling' and 'Not Smiling'. This approach involves a 'switch flipping' operation in the representation space, allowing for easy attribute manipulation. Quantitative and qualitative results are presented to evaluate the model, including an ablation study and facial attribute classification using a deep convolutional GAN architecture. The study involves using a deep convolutional GAN architecture for facial attribute classification and incorporating residual layers to improve classification results. The model is evaluated qualitatively for image attribute editing, with a focus on reconstruction quality and the proportion of edited images. Two types of cVAE-GAN models are discussed: a naive cVAE-GAN and an Information Factorization cVAE-GAN. The study discusses using deep convolutional GAN architecture for facial attribute classification and incorporating residual layers for improved results. Two types of cVAE-GAN models are compared: a naive cVAE-GAN and an Information Factorization cVAE-GAN. The evaluation focuses on reconstruction quality and the proportion of edited images with desired attributes. The model successfully edits images, with smaller reconstruction errors indicating better quality and larger classification scores suggesting better control over attribute changes. The study evaluates a cVAE-GAN model's ability to edit images for facial attributes, with a focus on reconstruction quality and attribute control. Results show successful editing for 'Smiling' and 'Not Smiling' attributes, with the model failing without the proposed L aux term. Including a classification loss on reconstructed samples is explored, a novel approach in the VAE literature. The study explores the effect of a classification loss on reconstructed samples in a cVAE-GAN model for attribute editing. The approach aims to maximize information between input and output labels but does not factorize attribute information effectively. The inclusion of IcGAN in the model's ablation study shows similar reconstruction error but performs less well in attribute editing tasks. The model aims to learn a representation for faces where identity and facial attributes are separated, achieved by minimizing mutual information between the two encodings. The model proposed in the study aims to separate the representation of a person's identity from specific facial attributes by minimizing mutual information between the two encodings. This approach shows promising results in facial attribute classification, outperforming a state-of-the-art classifier in some categories. The model effectively separates identity from facial attributes, outperforming a state-of-the-art classifier in some categories. It demonstrates the ability to manipulate attributes in images, highlighting limitations of other models focused on attribute synthesis rather than reconstruction and editing. The work of Bao et al. focused on synthesizing images with desired attributes, highlighting the need for models that learn a factored latent representation while maintaining good reconstruction quality. The model achieved good reconstruction by adjusting weightings on the KL and GAN loss terms. The model, IFcVAE-GAN, improved upon the naive cVAE-GAN BID3 by achieving better reconstruction quality and successfully synthesizing images with the desired 'Not Smiling' attribute at a 98% success rate. This was achieved by adjusting weightings on the KL and GAN loss terms and using specific hyper-parameters. The IFcVAE-GAN model outperformed the naive cVAE-GAN in synthesizing images with the 'Not Smiling' attribute at a 98% success rate. Comparisons showed that both models had similar reconstruction errors, but only the IFcVAE-GAN model was able to generate images of faces without smiles. The IFcVAE-GAN model demonstrated superior performance in synthesizing images without smiles compared to the cVAE-GAN model. The model successfully manipulated facial attributes and achieved high-quality reconstructions. The IFcVAE-GAN model factors attributes from identity, uses an auxiliary classifier, and achieves competitive scores on facial attribute classification. It incorporates adversarial training to factorize attribute label information from the latent representation. Comparisons are made with other approaches like Schmidhuber FORMULA3 and BID16. Our model, unlike others, predicts attribute information and can be used as a classifier. We minimize mutual information between latent representations and labels through adversarial information factorization. Our work is similar to cVAE-GAN but focuses on manipulating single attributes in images. Changing categories is easier than changing attributes, which require targeted changes with minimal impact on the rest of the image. Our model focuses on manipulating single attributes in images, unlike other models that work on category conditional image synthesis. We highlight the difference between category conditional image synthesis and attribute editing, showing that what works for one may not work for the other. Our work focuses on attribute editing in images, emphasizing the need to factor label information out of the latent encoding for successful editing. We utilize latent space generative models for semantically meaningful changes in images. Our approach differs from image-to-image models, which aim to learn a single latent representation for images in different domains. In image-to-image domain adaptation, a single generative model is used to edit attributes by changing a unit of the encoding. The approach involves factorization in the latent space to achieve a disentangled representation. The method minimizes mutual information to exploit regularities in the data and learn a disentangled representation. This novel perspective focuses on learning representations of images through supervised factorization of the latent space. Our approach involves a supervised factorization of the latent space to learn a disentangled representation of images. By modeling images with separate representations for object identity and attributes, such as facial expressions, we can modify attributes without affecting the object's identity. This is achieved through our Information Factorization conditional VAE-GAN model, which encourages the separation of attribute information from identity representation. Our proposed model, Information Factorization conditional VAE-GAN, separates attribute information from object identity representation through adversarial learning. It enables accurate attribute editing without impacting identity and outperforms existing models for image synthesis and facial attribute classification. Our approach to learning factored representations for images is a significant contribution to representation learning. Our approach to learning factored representations for images is a novel and important contribution to representation learning. Ablation studies demonstrate the need for L aux loss and show that increased regularization reduces reconstruction quality. Results show that small amounts of KL regularization are required for good reconstruction, while models trained without L gan achieve slightly lower reconstruction error but produce blurred images. Our model, based on the GAN architecture of BID27, requires small amounts of KL regularization for good reconstruction. Training without L gan results in slightly lower reconstruction error but produces blurred images. Despite omitting L gan or L KL loss, our model can still accurately edit attributes, although with poor visual quality. The main contribution lies in factoring attribute information from the latent representation. Other models, such as variational autoencoder BID28 BID14 variants BID5, also learn factored representations. Evaluation involves training a linear classifier on latent encodings for Facial Attribute Classification, comparing our classifier E y,\u03c6 to one trained on latent representations from a DIP-VAE. Several variational autoencoder models, including BID28, BID14, and BID5, are trained to learn representations that can be evaluated using a linear classifier for Facial Attribute Classification. The performance of the classifier E y,\u03c6 is compared to a linear classifier trained on latent representations from a DIP-VAE, known for learning disentangled representations from unlabelled data."
