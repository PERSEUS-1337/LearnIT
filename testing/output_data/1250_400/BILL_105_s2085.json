    "content": "The Act titled \"Fairness for Small Business and Employees Act of 1998\" is also known as the \"Truth in Employment\" Act. It includes findings related to employment practices. Congress finds that trust and civility in labor-management relationships are crucial for a productive workplace and economy. The practice of \"salting\" by union organizers has become a form of aggressive harassment, threatening the balance of collective bargaining rights. Union organizers are increasingly seeking employment with nonunion employers to organize employees or cause economic harm, impacting the rights of employers. Employers should not discriminate against employees based on their views on collective bargaining, but they should expect job applicants to be focused on using their skills to benefit the employer's business. The purposes of this title are to preserve the balance of rights between employers, employees, and labor organizations, protect workers' rights to organize, and prevent pressure on employers to hire individuals who disrupt the workplace. SEC. 103 of the National Labor Relations Act amends Section 8(a) to protect employer rights by stating that employers are not required to hire individuals who seek employment primarily to further another employment or agency status. This does not affect the rights of bona fide employee applicants to self-organization, join labor organizations, bargain collectively, or engage in concerted activities for mutual aid or protection. TITLE II--FAIR HEARING\n\nSEC. 201. FINDINGS.\n\nCongress finds that bargaining unit determinations require case-by-case adjudication for accuracy. The National Labor Relations Board has a history of holding hearings to determine single location bargaining unit appropriateness. A blanket rule limiting factors considered detracts from labor relations stability goals.\n\nSEC. 202. PURPOSE.\n\nThe purpose is to ensure the National Labor Relations Board conducts a specific analysis to determine the appropriateness of a single location bargaining unit based on all relevant facts.\n\nSEC. 203. REPRESENTATIVES AND ELECTIONS. SEC. 203. REPRESENTATIVES AND ELECTIONS. Amends the National Labor Relations Act to require a hearing to determine the appropriateness of a bargaining unit that includes employees from multiple facilities of an employer if there is no agreement between parties. Factors considered include functional integration, centralized control, common skills, and bargaining history. Congress finds that small businesses and labor organizations face disadvantages when dealing with actions from the National Labor Relations Board. The Equal Access to Justice Act has not effectively helped level the playing field. Therefore, this title aims to award fees and costs to small entities when they prevail against the National Labor Relations Board to ensure they are not deterred from seeking review or defending against actions brought by the Board. The purpose of this title is to award fees and costs to small businesses and labor organizations when they prevail against the National Labor Relations Board. This is to ensure that they are not deterred from seeking review or defending against actions brought by the Board, reduce the disparity in resources, expertise, and hold the Board more accountable for its enforcement actions. The National Labor Relations Act is amended to include a new section regarding awards of attorneys' fees and costs. The National Labor Relations Act is amended to allow employers or labor organizations with fewer than 100 employees and a net worth of not more than $1,400,000 to be awarded fees and expenses as prevailing parties in administrative and court proceedings conducted by the Board. The amendment allows employers or labor organizations with fewer than 100 employees and a net worth of not more than $1,400,000 to be awarded fees and expenses as prevailing parties in court proceedings involving the Board. SEC. 303 of the National Labor Relations Act applies to agency and court proceedings initiated after the enactment of this Act."
