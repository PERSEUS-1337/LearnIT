These medications are prescribed to treat various mental health conditions, but there is limited evidence on their safety and efficacy in children. Congress is closely monitoring the use of psychotropic medications in foster children, as federal law requires states to have a plan for overseeing their prescription drug use. Children in foster care have higher mental health needs and are more likely to receive psychotropic medications. Congressional oversight and efforts by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services aim to ensure appropriate use of these medications for children in care. State monitoring of psychotropic medication use for foster children is also discussed. Placement in foster care occurs when a judge determines that a child's home is not safe for them. During FY2015, approximately 671,000 children spent time in foster care due to neglect, abuse, or behavioral issues. Foster care is meant to be temporary until reunification with parents or permanent placement is arranged, prioritizing the safety and well-being of children. During FY2015, 671,000 children were in foster care, with 243,000 leaving the system. Nearly 428,000 children remained in care by the end of the fiscal year. The national foster care caseload has been declining for over a decade. Children in foster care have higher mental health needs due to abuse or neglect before entering care. Children in foster care have higher mental health service needs due to abuse or neglect before entering care, leading to difficulty regulating emotions and interpreting cues. A national survey found that a significant percentage of children in foster care are at risk of behavioral or emotional problems, with rates much higher than the general population. Children in foster care, especially those in group homes or institutions, have a higher risk of emotional and behavioral problems compared to the general population. Around 61%-70% of children in these settings are at risk, while only 7%-11% of all children in the same age range have similar issues. Medicaid-eligible children in foster care are increasingly diagnosed with mental health disorders like attention disorders, anxiety, autism, bipolar disorders, conduct disorders, depression, and schizophrenia. This trend has been observed from 2002 to 2007. Children in foster care, particularly those in group homes or institutions, have a higher risk of emotional and behavioral problems compared to the general population. Medicaid-eligible children in foster care showed an increase in diagnoses of mental health disorders such as attention disorders, conduct disorders, and depression from 2002 to 2007. The most common diagnoses varied by age group, with older children more likely to be diagnosed with certain conditions. Rates of major mental health diagnoses among children in foster care increased from 2002 to 2007, with the most common being conduct disorders and depression. National standards recommend mental health screenings and assessments for children in foster care, with Medicaid providing diagnostic and treatment services. Each state designs its own Medicaid plan for medical assistance, including mental health services. Children in foster care are eligible for Medicaid, which provides diagnostic and treatment services for their mental health needs. Medicaid plans vary by state but must adhere to federal requirements. The Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) program ensures that children receive all necessary health services, including mental health assessments and treatments. The EPSDT program ensures that children receive all necessary health services, including mental health assessments and treatments. This includes services provided by psychiatrists, psychologists, or clinical social workers, as well as prescription drugs. Children with mental health challenges may benefit from psychosocial treatment like counseling and case management. Children with mental health challenges may benefit from psychosocial treatment like counseling and case management. Certain interventions such as behavioral and cognitive-behavioral therapy have been found to be effective for children with disruptive behaviors. Additionally, activities like anger management and social skills training can help children who have experienced trauma. Psychotropic medications may be prescribed to children in foster care when psychosocial treatment alone is not effective. Psychotropic medications may be prescribed to children in foster care when psychosocial treatment alone is not effective. However, there may be an over-reliance on medication due to a lack of timely access to effective behavioral health care for children in care. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have noted the need for more evidence-based psychosocial therapies for children with complex mental health needs. The over-reliance on medication for children in care may be due to a lack of timely access to effective behavioral health care. Children in foster care are more likely to receive mental health supports compared to those who remain in their own homes after an investigation of abuse or neglect. Medicaid claims data shows an increase in the use of psychosocial mental health interventions among children in foster care who are taking antipsychotic medication. Children in foster care are more likely to receive mental health supports compared to those who remain in their own homes after an investigation of abuse or neglect. Research on Medicaid claims data shows an increase in the use of psychosocial mental health interventions among children in foster care who are taking antipsychotic medication. However, studies have shown that not all children in foster care who need mental health services receive them, with some not receiving any specialty mental health services or psychotropics. Between 16% and 33% of children in out-of-home care may be using psychotropic medication on any given day. Between 16% and 33% of children in out-of-home care may be using psychotropic medication, with rates varying based on factors like age, placement setting, and length of involvement with the child welfare agency. Children in foster care receive psychotropic medication at a much higher rate compared to children generally, with those on Medicaid due to foster care status receiving medication at a significantly higher rate. Children in non-relative foster family homes are not more likely than child-welfare involved children in their own homes to be prescribed psychotropic medication. Research shows that children in foster care, including those in non-relative foster family homes, have varying rates of psychotropic medication use. State practices play a significant role in prescribing these medications, with children in foster care receiving them at higher rates compared to the general population. The study found variation in psychotropic medication use among children in foster care based on Medicaid eligibility from 2002 to 2007. There was an increase in antipsychotic medication use, with 45 states showing a relative increase, two states a decrease, and one state no change. In 2007, the annual rate of antipsychotic medication use among children in foster care ranged from 2.8% to 21.7% in each state. A review of Medicaid claims data for children in foster care showed an increase in antipsychotic use from 2005 to 2008, followed by a slight decrease by 2010. Non-foster care children with Medicaid coverage and privately insured children had lower levels of antipsychotic use, with a slight increase in usage among privately insured children from 2005 to 2009. The second National Survey on Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW II) examined psychotropic medication use among children in foster care, funded and administered by HHS. The survey included children who were prescribed psychotropic medications and those who were placed in foster care. Children in the NSCAW II survey were either living with their biological/adoptive parents or in foster care. The children's ages ranged from 2 months to 20 years at different follow-up times. Those living with their parents were less likely to be on psychotropic medication compared to those in foster care, especially those in congregate care. Children in foster care were more likely to be taking psychotropic medications compared to those living with their own parents. The use of psychotropic medications increased over time for children in foster care, with about one out of three children in care taking psychotropics at the 36-month follow-up. At the 36-month follow-up, one out of three children in foster care were taking psychotropic medications, with higher prevalence in group foster care settings compared to foster family homes and formal kin care. The rate of psychotropic medication use among children in different placement settings 18 months after the initial investigation of child abuse or neglect varied. Children in group settings had the highest rate of psychotropic use (67.4%), followed by children in other foster care settings (15.9% to 23.8%), children in their own homes (10.9%), and informal kin care (11.9%). At 36 months, children in group settings still had the highest rate (52%), followed by other foster care settings (16.5% to 36.1%), children in their own homes (12.5%), and informal kin care (16.5%). Children in foster care group homes or residential settings had the highest rate of taking more than one psychotropic medication, with about half of them (48.6%) taking two or more drugs. At 36 months following the initial investigation, children in group settings were significantly more likely to be using three or more psychotropic medications compared to children in other settings. Children in foster care group homes or residential settings had the highest rate of taking multiple psychotropic medications, with about half of them (48.6%) taking two or more drugs. At 36 months following the initial investigation, children in group settings were significantly more likely to be using three or more psychotropic medications compared to children in other settings. Youth ages 11 to 17 were most likely to be using psychotropic medications at each follow-up wave, followed by youth ages 6 to 10, youth ages 18 and older, and youth ages 1.5 to 5 years. The research literature has characterized patterns of prescribing psychotropic drugs to foster children as \"too many, too much, and too young.\" The research literature has characterized patterns of prescribing psychotropic drugs to foster children as \"too many, too much, and too young.\" Polypharmacy, defined as concurrent use of three or more psychotropic medication classes, was consistent at about 5.2% to 5.9% annually among all children in foster care. Data from the NSCAW II study indicate that children in foster care prescribed psychotropics had an average of 1.9 medications per child. Data from the NSCAW II study shows that children in foster care were prescribed an average of 1.9 psychotropic medications per child. Concerns have been raised about the use of multiple antipsychotic medications, as it can lead to greater adverse effects with only marginal benefits. There are also worries about dosages exceeding recommendations for foster children, especially since the safety and efficacy of these medications for children are limited. Concerns have been raised about the use of psychotropic medications for children in foster care, with worries about dosages exceeding recommendations and very young children being prescribed these drugs. Studies have shown an increase in prescribing rates for ADHD and antipsychotic medications with each year of age among children in foster care. Studies have shown an increase in prescribing rates for ADHD and antipsychotic medications with each year of age among children in foster care. Concerns have been raised about the use of psychotropic medications for infants and young children in foster care, as there are no established mental health indications for their use and they can lead to serious health effects. The lack of psychosocial services available for children in care may contribute to the higher likelihood of them receiving psychotropic medications. The use of psychotropic medications in children in foster care has increased, particularly antipsychotics, despite a decrease in overall prescribing rates. Factors contributing to this trend include limited research on efficacy, pharmaceutical marketing, and a lack of mental health providers with expertise in treating trauma. The use of psychotropic medications in children in foster care has raised concerns among policymakers and stakeholders due to limited research on their safety and effectiveness. Studies on antipsychotics show insufficient evidence for their use in addressing mental health disorders in children, including those in foster care. Little to no evidence is available for conditions like disruptive behavior disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders, and anorexia nervosa. The analysis found insufficient evidence on the safety and effectiveness of psychotropic medications for child mental health disorders, especially among foster youth. Studies had a high risk of bias and short durations, making it challenging to evaluate long-term outcomes. Despite concerns about harmful health outcomes, some children in foster care may benefit from these medications for managing symptoms related to complex trauma. Some children in foster care may benefit from psychotropic medication for managing symptoms related to complex trauma, despite concerns about harmful health outcomes. Stimulants, particularly for ADHD, have been well researched and found to effectively reduce core symptoms. Children in foster care are more likely to have a mental health diagnosis than children generally. Higher levels of psychotropic drug use may be appropriate due to the increased prevalence and severity of mental health issues in this population. Children in foster care have a higher likelihood of mental health diagnoses compared to children in general. This population may require higher levels of psychotropic medication due to the increased prevalence and severity of mental health conditions. Congress has shown interest in overseeing prescription medication use for children in foster care, including holding hearings on enrollment in clinical drug trials. The hearing examined the enrollment of foster children in clinical drug trials and the oversight of prescription drug use for children in foster care. Congress required state child welfare agencies to consult with medical professionals for assessing and treating children in foster care. The issue of oversight of psychotropic medication use for these children was discussed in congressional hearings in 2007 and 2008. In 2008, Congress expanded requirements for states to consult with medical professionals on the health and well-being of children in foster care. States must develop a coordinated strategy and oversight plan to ensure access to health care, including mental health services and oversight of prescribed drugs. In 2011, further amendments were made to include protocols for the use of psychotropic medication for children in foster care. In 2011, the Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act amended requirements for states to develop a coordinated strategy for children in foster care, including protocols for psychotropic medication use. A Government Accountability Office study found that state programs lacked comprehensive oversight for prescribing psychotropic medications to foster children. The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry developed best practice guidelines for oversight of psychotropic medications for children in foster care. A Government Accountability Office report found that six state programs did not fully implement these guidelines, leading to potential risks for caregivers. Recommendations were made for HHS to endorse guidance on monitoring psychotropic medications in foster care. Witnesses discussed the need for increased cooperation and communication between HHS and state Medicaid programs. Witnesses at a hearing discussed the role of HHS and state Medicaid programs in improving cooperation and communication for monitoring psychotropic medications in foster care. A 12-year-old former foster youth shared his experience with multiple mental health diagnoses and side effects from psychotropic medications. In April 2013, the Senate Finance Committee held a roundtable to address issues related to psychotropic medication use in foster care and highlight alternative trauma response strategies. The Committee convened a roundtable discussion with Senate staff and child welfare stakeholders to address issues associated with the prescription of psychotropic medications for children in foster care and highlight alternative trauma response strategies. Current and former foster youth shared their experiences with psychotropic medication, noting that therapy helped them transition from medications. Child welfare stakeholders discussed the prevalence of psychotropic medication use among youth subpopulations and the roles of schools, the mental health system, and foster parents in determining whether youth should be prescribed medications. In May 2014, the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources held a hearing on the use of psychotropic medications. In May 2014, the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources held a hearing on the use of psychotropic medications among children in foster care. Witnesses included officials from HHS, GAO, a researcher, and Dr. Phil McGraw. GAO focused on their work from 2011 to 2014 related to psychotropic medication prescription among children in care. The GAO examined prescribing rates of psychotropic medication among children in foster care from 2011 to 2014. They found varying quality in documentation supporting the use of psychotropics, particularly in dosage amounts and concurrent use of multiple medications. GAO recommended that HHS issue guidance to states regarding oversight of medication to third-party managed care organizations administering Medicaid benefits for children in foster care. HHS issued guidance to state child welfare and Medicaid agencies on oversight of psychotropic medication use among children in care, but did not address the role of third-party MCOs. A subsequent report by GAO in January 2017 examined how seven states monitor psychotropic use among foster children, finding that states developed various practices to support mental health diagnoses and treatment, including guidelines on prescribing psychotropic medications. State officials in seven states developed guidelines for better mental health support for children in foster care, including initial screenings and monitoring after medication is prescribed. Factors like collaboration among agencies and gradual implementation were key. GAO did not assess effectiveness or compliance with policies. States use various measures to evaluate outcomes, such as physician prescribing practices. GAO did not examine state compliance with policies or controls for required practices. State officials use various measures to evaluate outcomes, including physician prescribing practices and monitoring child outcomes. HHS has not convened meetings with stakeholders for oversight of psychotropic medication use in children in care. GAO recommended cost-effective ways for HHS to convene state stakeholders for collaboration on medication oversight. HHS has implemented federal requirements for monitoring psychotropic medication use. HHS has implemented federal requirements for monitoring psychotropic medication use among children, with several federal agencies working together to promote interagency cooperation and publicize best practices. The Obama Administration proposed expanding funding for oversight of psychotropic medications in its annual budgets. States under the Stephanie Tubbs Jones Child Welfare Services Program must develop a coordinated strategy and oversight plan for ensuring access to psychotropic medications. The Stephanie Tubbs Jones Child Welfare Services Program requires states to develop a coordinated strategy and oversight plan for ensuring access to health care, including mental health services, for children in foster care. This plan must be developed collaboratively between the state child welfare agency and the state Medicaid agency, in consultation with health care experts and child welfare services experts. It should include a schedule for health screenings, monitoring and treating health needs, and updating and sharing medical information for children in care. The federal child welfare law requires states to develop a plan for health care access for children in foster care, including screenings, monitoring, treatment, and sharing medical information. It also mandates oversight of prescription medications and consultation with medical professionals for appropriate treatment. Additionally, states must ensure continuity of health care services and transition planning for children aging out of foster care. The federal child welfare law mandates oversight of health care access for children in foster care, including medical records, immunizations, medication information, and transition planning for children aging out of foster care. States report their policies on psychotropic medications through annual updates to the Child and Family Services Plan. The federal child welfare law mandates oversight of health care access for children in foster care, including medical records, immunizations, and medication information. States report their policies on psychotropic medications through annual updates to the Child and Family Services Plan, which includes screening, evaluation, consent to treatment, medication monitoring, mental health expertise, and information sharing protocols. The federal child welfare law mandates oversight of health care access for children in foster care, including psychotropic medication protocols. The most recent five-year CFSP is for FY2015-FY2019, focusing on monitoring and appropriate use of psychotropic medications. HHS convened an interagency working group in 2011 to address research on psychotropic medication use among foster children and support state efforts in implementing requirements. The working group aims to expand evidence-based screening, diagnosis, interventions, oversight, and research on medications and psychosocial treatments for children in foster care. Led by ACF, the group focuses on improving mental health services for foster children. The working group, led by the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), aims to expand evidence-based screening, diagnosis, interventions, oversight, and research on medications and psychosocial treatments for children in foster care. It includes representatives from other HHS agencies such as CMS and SAMHSA, which administer Medicaid and provide block grant funding for non-Medicaid covered treatment services. In November 2011, ACF, SAMHSA, and CMS released a letter addressing these issues. In November 2011, ACF, SAMHSA, and CMS released a letter addressing the management of prescription medication use for children in foster care, emphasizing collaboration between state agencies to improve health and raise awareness about psychotropic use among children in foster care. In November 2011, ACF, SAMHSA, and CMS released a letter emphasizing collaboration between state agencies to improve health and raise awareness about psychotropic use among children in foster care. The agencies provided guidance through webinars and information memoranda, including data, research, and practices for monitoring medication use. They also held question and answer sessions for state child welfare and mental health leaders to enhance oversight and monitoring. In August 2012, HHS convened state directors to address the use of psychotropic medication among children in foster care. In August 2012, HHS (ACF, SAMHSA, and CMS) convened state directors of child welfare, Medicaid, and mental health agencies to address the use of psychotropic medications for children in foster care and the mental health needs of children who have experienced trauma. The summit, \"Because Minds Matter,\" aimed to enhance collaboration on oversight of psychotropic medications and implementation of changes. States outlined activities, challenges, partners, and timelines for improvement. Multiple presentations were given on psychotropic oversight and related topics. Since the \"Because Minds Matter\" summit in August 2012, HHS has made progress in overseeing psychotropic medications. ACF provided guidance to state child welfare agencies on monitoring psychotropic medication use, emphasizing coordinated planning, shared decision-making, medication monitoring, mental health expertise, and information sharing. States are required to report on the implementation of these elements for children in foster care. ACF issued guidance to state child welfare agencies on improving behavioral outcomes for children who have experienced abuse or neglect, focusing on the impact of maltreatment on brain development and social-emotional well-being. They also published guides on medication questions for youth in foster care and mental health issues for child welfare staff and foster parents. Additionally, ACF awarded funds to support projects for youth in child welfare with mental health needs. ACF awarded funds to support projects for youth in child welfare with mental and behavioral health needs. SAMHSA provided funding for developing guidelines on prescribing medications for children and youth, focusing on clinical practice, monitoring, and research. SAMHSA funds a medical director position to work with child and adolescent psychiatrists on psychotropic medication oversight. CMS issued a bulletin to states on monitoring psychotropic medication use in vulnerable populations, including children in foster care. States are required to have Drug Utilization Review programs in place for Medicaid beneficiaries. In 2015, CMS assisted state Medicaid agencies in improving the appropriate use of antipsychotic medications for children in foster care. States are required to have Drug Utilization Review programs to oversee drug prescribing for Medicaid beneficiaries, with examples of oversight methods including automated system \"edit checks\" and multidisciplinary teams. Additionally, CMS added a new measure to core measures for states to voluntarily use in improving healthcare delivery to children receiving Medicaid. CMS, ACF, and SAMHSA issued joint guidance in July 2013 to emphasize the importance of providing psychosocial interventions to children who have experienced complex trauma, particularly those in foster care. The guidance highlighted the need for proper screening, assessment, and treatment to prevent improper prescription of psychotropic medications. The guidance emphasized the importance of providing psychosocial interventions to children in foster care to prevent improper prescription of psychotropic medications. President Obama's FY2017 budget proposed a joint initiative to reduce reliance on psychotropic medications for children in foster care and improve their well-being through performance-based incentive payments to state Medicaid agencies. Obama's FY2017 budget proposed a five-year joint initiative between CMS and ACF to reduce reliance on psychotropic medications for children in foster care. This involves providing incentive payments to state Medicaid agencies for improved care coordination and delivery of evidence-based psychosocial interventions. States can also apply for grant funding under the Title IV-E Foster Care program to implement alternative psychosocial interventions. ACF will support activities to build capacity for providing these interventions and ensure fidelity to the models. The program aims to build state capacity and infrastructure for implementing alternative psychosocial interventions, with a focus on child welfare funding. Research has highlighted the role of states in overseeing the use of psychotropic medication for children in foster care, including issues like obtaining consent and monitoring procedures. Surveys have been conducted to understand state policies related to psychotropic medications oversight, but none have specifically addressed the federal provision added in 2011. Surveys conducted in 2009 and 2010 assessed state policies on overseeing psychotropic medication use for children in foster care. More than half of the states rated this issue as a high concern. At the time, 26 states had a written policy, 13 were developing one, and 9 had no policy in place. Researchers found that states had varying approaches to overseeing psychotropic medication use for children in foster care, with some using \"red flag\" markers to identify safety and quality issues. However, there was little evidence that these approaches were systematically studied to improve outcomes. Concerns have been raised about the availability of policies and procedures in response to psychotropic medication use. Researchers found that states had varying approaches to overseeing psychotropic medication use for children in foster care, with concerns raised about the availability of policies and procedures. A 2014 study reviewed policies from 16 states but found many were underdeveloped and lacked essential criteria for protecting children. Despite this, states have started to address oversight of psychotropic medication more systematically. States have taken steps to systematically address oversight of psychotropic medication use among children in foster care. Working groups from child welfare, Medicaid, and mental health agencies convened as part of an HHS summit. Some states collaborated with the Center for Health Care Strategies to improve oversight, defining common terms and measures on medication utilization and developing best practices. Individual goals were established, and protocols implemented in areas such as gaining consent. The Center for Health Care Strategies, with support from SAMSHA, is providing technical assistance to states on oversight of psychotropic medications among foster youth. States have implemented protocols in areas such as gaining consent, obtaining real-time data on medication use, reviewing \"red flags,\" and tailoring monitoring processes to local needs. The National Survey of Child and Adolescent Wellbeing II examined psychotropic medication use among children involved in child welfare due to abuse or neglect investigations. The National Survey of Child and Adolescent Wellbeing II analyzed psychotropic medication use among children in child welfare due to abuse or neglect investigations. Data was collected at baseline in 2008-2009 and follow-ups at 18 and 36 months post-investigation. The study included children aged 18 months to 17 years, some of whom were in foster care settings. Table A-1 displays psychotropic medication use by age and foster care status at initial survey, 18-month, and 36-month follow-ups. Statistical analysis revealed no significant differences in medication use between children in foster care and those not in foster care initially. However, at the 18-month and 36-month follow-ups, children in foster care were more likely to be using psychotropic medications. Children in foster care were more likely to be using psychotropic medications at the 18-month and 36-month follow-ups compared to those not in foster care. Statistical significance was found for children ages 6 to 10 at the 18-month follow-up, and for children ages 11 through 17 at the 18-month and 36-month follow-ups. No statistical significance was found for children under age 6 in any of the surveys."
