    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The State of California prioritizes improving occupational health and safety for family child care providers to protect both providers and the children in their care from hazards. Family child care providers face risks such as toxic chemicals, illness, stress, and physical hazards. It is crucial for them to receive training to prevent injuries and illnesses on the job. The director must annually publish a list of licensed child day care facilities, excluding small family day care homes, detailing their services and licensed capacity. The department will protect the privacy of small family day care homes by not including their names and addresses on the lists. To protect the privacy of small family day care homes, the department will not include their names and addresses on lists, except for necessary licensing purposes and providing information to specific agencies and programs. The entity selected to provide trainings required by Section 1596.864 includes family day care organizations and specialized health care service plans licensed under the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975. The department, in consultation with the Child Development Division of the State Department of Education, will adopt regulations regarding the confidentiality of information on small family day care homes. These regulations will ensure referral only to licensed homes in good standing with the department. Violators may be denied access to information on small family day care homes and reported to the appropriate authorities. Section 1596.864 of the Health and Safety Code defines \"family child care provider\" as either a licensed family day care home provider or a person providing child care under a publicly funded program. Publicly funded child care programs include various early learning and care subsidies but exclude the K-12 public education system. Family child care providers are required to attend a two-hour training on occupational health and safety risks specific to their profession. The State Department of Social Services may establish a schedule for completion within four years or three months of becoming a provider. The training includes identifying and minimizing risks such as chemical hazards, infectious diseases, and physical hazards. The training for family child care providers covers risks like chemical and biological hazards, infectious diseases, and physical hazards. It includes small and large group discussions, learning from professionals, presentations by relevant organizations, and feedback opportunities. The Department of Industrial Relations selects a training entity with experience in occupational health and safety for family child care providers. The Department of Industrial Relations selects an entity through a competitive process to provide occupational health and safety training for family child care providers. The selected entity must have experience in training providers and updating them on health and safety matters. The curriculum for the training sessions will be developed with input from providers and approved by the Division of Occupational Safety and Health. The State Department of Social Services will administer the contract with the training entity. The State Department of Social Services will oversee the contract for training family child care providers. The training will be coordinated with other requirements to reduce provider burden. Monthly lists of attendees and those required to attend will be provided to the training entity for updates on health and safety issues. Providers can request to have their personal information removed from the lists. The department and training entity must comply with the Dymally-Alatorre Bilingual Services Act, providing training materials in non-English languages. This section becomes effective on July 1, 2017. No reimbursement is required for local agencies or school districts due to the creation of new crimes or infractions. Child care providers paid through an alternative payment program can file complaints with the State Department of Education if they believe the program contractor violated laws or regulations. The complaint process follows the Uniform Complaint Procedures outlined in the California Code of Regulations. Alternative payment programs covered include the California Alternative Payment Program, CalWORKs Stage 2 and 3 Programs, and the Migrant Alternative Payment Program. Alternative payment programs, such as the California Alternative Payment Program, CalWORKs Stage 2 and 3 Programs, and the Migrant Alternative Payment Program, are operated by contractors reimbursed under specific contract types. The operation of these programs is dependent on the enactment of an appropriation in the annual Budget Act or another statute."
