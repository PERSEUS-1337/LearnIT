FINDINGS. Congress finds that the threat of terrorists acquiring and using a nuclear weapon is urgent and poses a significant risk to national and global security. Efforts to secure nuclear stockpiles and prevent nuclear smuggling have made progress, but more actions are necessary to reduce the threat of nuclear terrorism. The White House's National Strategy for Combating Terrorism highlights the grave danger of weapons of mass destruction in the hands of terrorists. UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan warns that a nuclear terror attack would have devastating consequences on a global scale. UN Security Council Resolution 1540 emphasizes the importance of combating this threat through all available means. United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 (2004) emphasizes the need for all countries to adopt and enforce laws prohibiting non-state actors from acquiring and using nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons for terrorist purposes. The Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency warns of the urgent need to prevent a terrorist attack using a nuclear weapon. The Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Dr. Mohammed El Baradei, warns of the urgent need to prevent a terrorist attack using a nuclear weapon, describing it as a \"race against time.\" Sense of Congress on the prevention of nuclear terrorism. The sense of Congress is that the threat of nuclear terror is the most horrific the US faces. A comprehensive approach is needed to reduce this danger, including efforts to eliminate terrorist groups seeking nuclear weapons, secure nuclear weapons globally, and prevent terrorist manufacturing or transportation of nuclear explosives. The prevention of a nuclear terrorist attack on the US should be a top priority for the President. Within a comprehensive strategy to prevent nuclear terrorism, it is crucial to secure all nuclear weapons and special nuclear material worldwide. The President should prioritize preventing a nuclear terrorist attack on the United States and accelerate programs to combat nuclear smuggling. The International Atomic Energy Agency plays a vital role in coordinating international efforts to protect nuclear materials. Legislation by Senators Lugar, Domenici, and Nunn has led to groundbreaking programs to prevent nuclear weapons from falling into the hands of terrorists. The National Security Act of 1947 is amended to include a new section for a senior advisor to the president for the prevention of nuclear terrorism.
