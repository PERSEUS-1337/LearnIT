    "content": "The \"Great Lakes Nutrient Removal Assistance Act\" aims to address water pollution in the Great Lakes System by focusing on nutrient removal technology as a key solution. Congress recognizes the importance of limiting phosphorus loads to control algal growth and emphasizes the need for a coordinated strategy to improve nutrient discharge. The Act establishes a Nutrient Removal Technology Grant Program to support the implementation of effective and cost-efficient methods for reducing harmful nutrients in the Great Lakes System. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to establish a Nutrient Removal Technology Grant Program for Great Lakes States and municipalities to install technologies reducing total nutrients in wastewater discharge. Priority is given to facilities where nutrient removal technologies would have the greatest impact. The Administrator gives priority to eligible facilities for nutrient removal technologies based on producing the greatest nutrient load reductions, environmental benefits to the Great Lakes System, and meeting nutrient objectives outlined in the Great Lakes Water Quality Protocol of 2012. Great Lakes States or municipalities can apply for grants under this subsection as prescribed by the Administrator. Great Lakes States or municipalities can apply for grants under the Great Lakes Water Quality Protocol of 2012 for installing nutrient removal technologies at eligible facilities, with the Administrator potentially granting up to 55 percent of the installation costs. The Great Lakes Water Quality Protocol of 2012 defines eligible facilities as municipal wastewater treatment plants with a capacity of at least 500,000 gallons per day within the Great Lakes System. $100,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2016 for this purpose. \"In addition to other authorized amounts, $100,000,000 is allocated annually from 2016 to 2020 for eligible facilities in the Great Lakes System. The Administrator can use up to 4% for administrative costs.\""
