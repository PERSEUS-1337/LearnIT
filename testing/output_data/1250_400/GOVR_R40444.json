    "content": "Eligibility for health benefits under CHIP is available to different groups through various federal authorities and mechanisms. This includes children, pregnant women, parents, and childless adults who may be covered under the CHIP state plan or special waiver authority. States can define a targeted low-income child as someone under 19 without health insurance, with income levels up to 200% of the federal poverty level. States have the flexibility to expand eligibility for all children under 19, but higher-income CHIP children may see reduced federal payments under CHIPRA. CHIPRA reduces federal CHIP payments for higher-income CHIP children, using the regular Medicaid FMAP for those with family income over 300% of poverty. States can cover these children under Medicaid or create a separate CHIP program. Medicaid rules apply for Medicaid coverage, while Title XXI rules apply for separate CHIP programs. Title XXI rules apply when states provide coverage to targeted low-income children through separate CHIP programs, with federal CHIP funds covering program costs. States with approved state CHIP plans receive federal allotments based on a distribution formula. Targeted low-income children covered under a CHIP-financed Medicaid expansion are entitled to benefits as per Medicaid law, while no individual entitlement exists for those covered under separate CHIP programs. States can expand Medicaid for targeted low-income children by creating new eligibility groups authorized in Title XXI. States can cover targeted low-income children under Medicaid by creating new eligibility groups authorized in Title XXI or by establishing separate CHIP programs. The latter option reduces administrative burden by utilizing existing Medicaid eligibility pathways. States have flexibility in determining eligibility factors such as geography, age, income, and resources for targeted low-income children. States have flexibility in determining eligibility factors for targeted low-income children under separate CHIP programs, including geography, age, income, resources, residency, disability status, access to other health insurance, and duration of CHIP eligibility. Prior to CHIPRA, states could cover adult pregnant women through waivers, CHIP state plan amendments, or family coverage options. States have the flexibility to provide health benefits coverage, including prenatal care and delivery services, to unborn children of adult pregnant women through CHIP state plan amendments. In FY2008, there were 364,161 unborn children enrolled in CHIP, with California having the highest enrollment. CHIPRA added a new state option to cover pregnant women under CHIP through a state plan amendment. In FY2008, 364,161 unborn children were enrolled in CHIP, with California having the highest enrollment. CHIPRA added a new state option to cover pregnant women under CHIP through a state plan amendment, with certain conditions to be met by states. Eligibility restrictions for pregnant women under CHIP include being uninsured and ineligible for state employee health coverage, with coverage extending through the postpartum period. States can temporarily enroll pregnant women for up to two months until eligibility is formally determined. The period of coverage for pregnant women under CHIP is from pregnancy through the postpartum period. States can temporarily enroll pregnant women for up to two months until eligibility is formally determined. Benefits include all services available to CHIP children, prenatal, delivery, and postpartum care. Infants born to these pregnant women are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP up to age one year. Legal immigrants arriving in the United States after August 22, 1996, were ineligible for Medicaid or CHIP benefits for their first five years here. CHIPRA clarified that states can offer postpartum services to legal immigrants who were previously ineligible for Medicaid or CHIP benefits for their first five years in the United States. The law requires consideration of the sponsor's income and resources for legal immigrants, and the sponsor is financially responsible for the individual. States have the option to waive the five-year bar for pregnant women and children who are lawfully residing in the United States and are otherwise eligible for coverage under Medicaid or CHIP. CHIPRA allowed states to waive the five-year bar for Medicaid or CHIP coverage for pregnant women and children who are lawfully residing in the United States and are eligible. The provision also ensured that the cost of care would not count against an individual's sponsor. States must redetermine eligibility every 12 months and individuals must provide further documentation if their initial legal residence documentation is no longer valid. Under current law, Section 1115 of the Social Security Act gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services broad authority to modify aspects of the CHIP programs, including expanding eligibility to populations not otherwise eligible. Certain states have covered adults with CHIP funds through waivers, initially effective for five years and subject to renewal every three years. Waiver renewals for states with adult coverage have not been approved since 2007, leading to some states transitioning adult populations out of CHIP coverage. Waiver renewals for states with adult coverage under CHIP have not been approved since 2007, leading to some states transitioning adult populations out of CHIP coverage. As of January 7, 2009, 4 states have CMS authority to use CHIP funds to extend coverage to certain childless adult populations, and 7 states have such authority to cover parent populations. CHIPRA terminates CHIP coverage of nonpregnant childless adults by the end of calendar year 2009. States with existing childless adult waivers that were in effect during FY2009 are permitted to apply for Medicaid waivers to continue coverage for these individuals. CHIPRA requires budget neutrality standards for succeeding fiscal years to be tied to waiver spending in the preceding fiscal year. Coverage of parents is permitted for states with CHIP parent coverage waivers that were in effect during FY2009. Beginning in FY2012, allowable spending under the waivers will be subject to a set-aside amount from a separate allotment and will be matched at the state's regular Medicaid FMAP unless certain coverage benchmarks are met. In FY2013, states meeting the benchmarks will receive an amount between the regular and enhanced FMAPs for parents. Waiver spending under the set-aside for parents with family income exceeding eligibility thresholds as of February 4, 2009 is prohibited. CHIPRA also includes provisions to facilitate access and enrollment in Medicaid and CHIP. CHIPRA includes provisions for outreach and enrollment in Medicaid and CHIP, authorizing $100 million in grants for outreach campaigns. Funds will be directed towards a national enrollment campaign, outreach for Native American children, and initiatives targeting rural areas and underserved populations. Grant proposals addressing cultural and linguistic barriers to enrollment will also be prioritized. Additionally, CHIPRA requires states to describe procedures for reducing administrative barriers to enrollment for children and pregnant women in Medicaid and CHIP. CHIPRA allows states to use \"Express Lane\" agencies to determine eligibility for children under 19 (or up to 21) for Medicaid or CHIP. States can also implement automatic enrollment through Express Lane eligibility. Under CHIPRA, states can use Express Lane agencies to determine eligibility for children under 19 (or up to 21) for Medicaid or CHIP. States have the option to rely on an applicant's reported income from state tax records. CHIPRA also eliminates the requirement for signatures on Medicaid or CHIP applications under penalty of perjury. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA) mandated proof of citizenship and identity for Medicaid applicants. CHIPRA allowed states to use Social Security Numbers for verification and added citizenship documentation requirements for CHIP. States have varying income eligibility limits for CHIP, with New Jersey having the highest at 350% of the FPL. The highest state-reported upper income eligibility limit for children in CHIP is 350% of the FPL in New Jersey. Eleven states and the District of Columbia have CHIP coverage above 250% FPL. An additional 11 states have income thresholds greater than 200% FPL but less than or equal to 250% FPL. Twenty-two states have upper income limits at 200% FPL. Six states set maximum income levels below 200% FPL. CHIP enrollment reached nearly 7.4 million children in FY2008, with about 5.3 million covered in separate state programs and 2.1 million targeted low-income children under Medicaid. Waiver authority under CHIP has been used to expand coverage for adult populations, with 12 states reporting enrollment of about 335,000 adults in FY2008, majority being parents. In FY2008, 12 states reported enrollment of about 335,000 adults in CHIP, with most being parents. The number of CHIP-enrolled adults decreased from FY2006 and FY2007 due to changes in adult coverage waivers. Some states had more adult CHIP enrollees than children. States may cover low-income children under Medicaid or create a separate CHIP program. States with Medicaid-expansion CHIP programs must provide mandatory Medicaid benefits and optional services. States have the option to cover low-income children under their Medicaid program, create a separate CHIP program, or use a combination of both approaches. Medicaid-expansion CHIP programs must offer mandatory Medicaid benefits and optional services. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 allows states to enroll children in new benchmark plans, similar to separate CHIP programs. Children under age 21 are entitled to benefits through the EPSDT Program, including well-child care and medical services. The EPSDT Program ensures that low-income children receive essential healthcare services, including well-child care, immunizations, and screenings. States can choose from three benefit options for separate CHIP programs, such as benchmark benefit packages or equivalent coverage. Benchmark benefit packages for CHIP programs include three plan options: Blue Cross/Blue Shield, state employee health coverage, or HMO coverage with the largest enrollment. Equivalent coverage must include basic benefits like hospital services, physician care, lab services, and well-child care with immunizations. Additional services must cover at least 75% of the benchmark plan's actuarial value. The CHIP program includes inpatient and outpatient hospital services, physicians' surgical and medical services, lab and x-ray services, well-baby and well-child care with immunizations. Benchmark-equivalent coverage must also include prescription drugs, vision services, and hearing services. Abortions are only covered in specific circumstances. All 50 states, the District of Columbia, and five territories have CHIP programs with different approaches. CHIPRA made changes to coverage of mental health and substance abuse. Among the states, 18 use separate state programs and 26 use a combination approach for CHIP. Benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans are based on state employees' health plans, while secretary-approved plans are modeled after Medicaid. CHIPRA brought changes to mental health and substance abuse coverage, ensuring that financial requirements and treatment limitations for these benefits are no more restrictive than for medical and surgical benefits. EPSDT services are included in state CHIP plans. CHIPRA made modifications to dental care under CHIP, requiring dental services to be a benefit under separate CHIP programs. These services include preventive care, restoration of oral health, and treatment for emergency conditions. States have the option to provide dental services through benchmark dental benefit packages. Additionally, the law includes provisions for dental education for parents of newborns and dental services through federally qualified health centers. The new law requires dental services to be a benefit under separate CHIP programs, including preventive care, restoration of oral health, and treatment for emergency conditions. States can offer dental services through benchmark benefit packages and provide dental education for parents of newborns. Detailed information on children's dental care must be reported, and a study on access to dental care under Medicaid and CHIP will be conducted by the GAO. CHIPRA provided a state option to offer dental-only supplemental coverage to children enrolled in employer-sponsored coverage, using qualified mid-level providers to improve access. States can set the upper income level for this new benefit up to the level applicable under their separate CHIP programs. States can offer dental-only supplemental coverage to children under CHIPRA, with certain conditions. This includes implementing the highest income eligibility, not limiting applications or imposing enrollment caps, and providing benefits to all eligible children. States cannot offer more favorable dental coverage for children with dental-only supplemental coverage compared to those eligible for full CHIP benefits. Additionally, states have the option to waive eligibility waiting periods for children with dental-only supplemental coverage. States have the option to waive eligibility waiting periods for children with dental-only supplemental coverage under CHIPRA. Medicaid allows premium assistance programs for employer plans if they are cost-effective and comprehensive for the state. This includes ensuring that CHIP minimum benefits are provided and cost-sharing ceilings are met. Medicaid allows premium assistance programs for employer plans if they are cost-effective and comprehensive for the state. States must provide \"wrap-around\" benefit coverage for Medicaid-covered services not included in private plans. Most states operate CHIP or Medicaid premium assistance programs under waivers to meet requirements. CHIPRA created a new state plan option for providing premium assistance and required outreach, education, and enrollment assistance for eligible families. States can offer premium assistance for Medicaid and CHIP-eligible children and/or parents. Under CHIPRA, states have the option to offer premium assistance for Medicaid and CHIP-eligible children and/or parents with access to employer-sponsored insurance. The premium assistance subsidy covers the difference in out-of-pocket premiums for children versus only covering the employee. Individuals eligible for CHIP and employment-based coverage can choose regular CHIP over the premium assistance program. CHIPRA allows CHIP eligible individuals to enroll in an employer's plan, with the premium assistance subsidy covering the difference in out-of-pocket premiums for children. A wrap-around is required for employer plans that do not meet CHIP benefit requirements. No cost-effectiveness test is needed for child coverage using premium assistance. States offering premium assistance must conduct outreach, and can establish an employer-family premium assistance purchasing pool. CHIPRA allows states to establish employer-family premium assistance pools for eligible individuals. The law also streamlines coordination between public and private coverage, making the loss of Medicaid/CHIP eligibility a qualifying event for purchasing employer-sponsored coverage. Cost-sharing refers to out-of-pocket payments made by beneficiaries of a health insurance plan. The provision in CHIPRA allows states to establish employer-family premium assistance pools for eligible individuals and streamlines coordination between public and private coverage. Cost-sharing refers to out-of-pocket payments made by beneficiaries of a health insurance plan, including monthly premiums, deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance. States can impose cost-sharing for some beneficiaries and services under CHIP, with exemptions for targeted low-income children under Medicaid. DRA provided states with new options for premiums and service-related cost-sharing for children under CHIP Medicaid-expansion programs. The DRA provided states with new options for premiums and service-related cost-sharing for children under CHIP Medicaid-expansion programs. Cost-sharing can be imposed on children in families with income above 100% FPL, with limits on the amount based on income levels. Preventive services for children are exempt from cost-sharing, and special rules apply to prescription drugs and emergency room copayments. The DRA allows states to impose cost-sharing on Medicaid and CHIP enrollees, with limits based on income levels. Preventive services for children are exempt from cost-sharing. Special rules apply to prescription drugs and emergency room copayments. Premiums or enrollment fees may be imposed for CHIP participation, with limits based on family income. Providers may deny care for failure to pay cost-sharing. In separate state programs, premiums for families are limited by federal Medicaid regulations. Cost-sharing is capped for lower-income families and slightly higher for those with income between 100%-150% FPL. Families above 150% FPL may face cost-sharing up to 5% of family income, with preventive services exempt. States must inform families of limits and provide a way to stop payments once reached. Preventive services are exempt from cost-sharing for all CHIP families regardless of income. This includes newborn physician visits, routine physical exams, lab tests, immunizations, dental services, and data collection improvements under CHIPRA 2009. The law aims to enhance reporting on child health quality measures and encourage states to voluntarily report on pediatric care quality under CHIP and Medicaid. The law directs the Secretary of HHS to develop child health quality measures, reporting formats, and procedures for states to report on pediatric care quality under CHIP and Medicaid. Reporting requirements for states' annual CHIP reports include data on eligibility criteria, access to care, and premium assistance. A study on children's access to care under Medicaid and CHIP will be conducted by GAO. CHIPRA established the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission (MACPAC) to review policies affecting children's benefits access and quality of care. Regular reports to Congress will include recommendations for improving access and quality of care for children under Medicaid and CHIP. Additionally, the Secretary of HHS is required to conduct a federal evaluation of 10 states with approved CHIP plans. The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (CHIPRA) requires regular reports to Congress detailing findings on access and quality of care for children under Medicaid and CHIP, along with recommendations for improvement. The Secretary of HHS is mandated to conduct a federal evaluation of 10 states with approved CHIP plans, focusing on factors like outreach strategies, cost-sharing effects, and disenrollment/retention issues. Federal financing of CHIP includes appropriations, reallocation of funds, and other factors like matching rates and caps. The federal financing of the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) includes total appropriations for states' annual allotments, reallocation of funds, and other factors like matching rates and caps on expenses. The funding levels varied over fiscal years, with a total of approximately $40 billion appropriated for FY1998 to FY2007. The funding dropped in FY2002-FY2004, known as the \"CHIP dip,\" due to budget constraints. The 110th Congress passed bills to reauthorize CHIP, providing funding for FY2008 through FY2012. The 110th Congress passed bills to reauthorize CHIP, providing funding for FY2008 through FY2012. President George W. Bush vetoed both bills, leading to the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 appropriating funds for CHIP allotments for FY2008 and FY2009. CHIPRA provided a national appropriation for CHIP allotments totaling $68.9 billion from FY2009 to FY2013. CHIPRA provided a national appropriation for CHIP allotments totaling $68.9 billion from FY2009 to FY2013. The allotment of the annual federal CHIP appropriation among the states is determined by a formula set in law, based on survey estimates of low-income children and uninsured children. Prior to CHIPRA, the territories received 0.25% of the national appropriation, with the remainder divided among the states. The CHIP allotments are determined by a formula based on low-income and uninsured children. Each state's allotment is adjusted by a geographic factor and limited by floors and ceilings. Allotments are separate funding accounts available for two years, with payments taken from the earliest active account. The FY2009 federal CHIP allotments are the largest of three state-specific amounts. The FY2009 federal CHIP allotments for states are determined by a formula based on low-income and uninsured children, adjusted by a geographic factor, and limited by floors and ceilings. Allotments are available for two years, with payments taken from the earliest active account. The largest of three state-specific amounts will be increased by 10% and serve as the state's FY2009 federal CHIP allotment, as long as the national appropriation is adequate. For FY2010, the allotment for a state will be calculated based on four amounts multiplied by the applicable growth factor. For FY2010 and beyond, states' CHIP allotments will be calculated based on four amounts multiplied by the growth factor for the year. Allotments will be rebased for FY2011 and FY2013, and for FY2012, the allotment will be calculated based on the previous year's allotment and Contingency Fund spending. Unspent allotments are redistributed to other states at the end of the period. The allotment for a state (or territory) is calculated based on FY2011 allotment and any FY2011 Contingency Fund spending, multiplied by the state's growth factor. Unspent allotments are redistributed to other states at the end of the period. BBA 97 stipulated rules for redistribution of unspent funds, with the Secretary determining how funds are redistributed to qualifying states. In FY2006, additional funds were appropriated to cover projected shortfalls in 12 states. In FY2007, $147 million in unspent FY2004 original allotments was available for redistribution. In FY2007, $147 million in unspent FY2004 original allotments was available for redistribution to states facing CHIP funding shortfalls. A bill was passed to specify how the funds would be redistributed, delaying shortfalls until the end of March 2007. Additionally, there was a provision for an initial redistribution of up to half of unspent FY2005 original allotments to further delay shortfalls. The CHIP provisions of NIHRA allowed for the redistribution of unspent FY2005 funds to states with CHIP funding shortfalls. A total of $138 million was projected to be provided to shortfall states, delaying any funding shortfalls until May 2007. Additionally, P.L. 110-28 appropriated up to $650 million to cover shortfalls in 10 states for the remainder of FY2007. The Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007 allocated $650 million to cover federal CHIP fund shortfalls in 10 states for FY2007. Redistribution of unspent FY2005 and FY2006 allotments to states with projected shortfalls in FY2008 and FY2009 was also mandated, with additional appropriations to prevent funding shortfalls. The MMSEA appropriated up to $275 million for states' shortfalls through March 31, 2009, preventing federal CHIP funding shortfalls for the second half of FY2009. CHIPRA created a Child Enrollment Contingency Fund to prevent states from experiencing federal CHIP fund shortfalls, with direct payments to shortfall states not exceeding 20% of the national allotment amount. The Contingency Fund provides payments to states for CHIP children above target enrollment levels, capped at 20% of the national allotment. CHIP is a federal-state matching program with a state's share of expenditures for Medicaid determined by the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP). The enhanced FMAP for CHIP reduces a state's share by 30% compared to the regular FMAP. The enhanced FMAP for CHIP ranges from 65% to 83.09%, and all CHIP assistance for low-income children is eligible for this enhanced FMAP. The enhanced FMAP for CHIP ranges from 65% to 83.09%, with a ceiling of 85% and a floor of 65%. Federal spending for CHIP administrative expenses is capped at 10%, including activities like data collection and outreach. Federal CHIP bonus payments are available to states that increase Medicaid child enrollment. Under CHIPRA, federal CHIP bonus payments are available to states that increase Medicaid child enrollment and implement specific outreach and enrollment activities. The funding for these payments includes an initial $3.225 billion appropriation in FY2009 and unspent national allotment and redistribution amounts."
