    "content": "Identifying analogies across domains without supervision is a key task for artificial intelligence. Recent advances in cross domain image mapping focus on translating images across domains, but visual fidelity often falls short for matching samples. This paper introduces AN-GAN, a matching-by-synthesis approach that outperforms current techniques in finding exact analogies between datasets. The cross-domain mapping task involves domain alignment and learning the mapping function, which can be iteratively solved to achieve quality comparable to full supervision. Humans excel at making analogies between domains without prior supervision, using previous knowledge to establish strong priors in new situations.

Humans excel at making analogies between domains without prior supervision, using previous knowledge to establish strong priors in new situations. Recent advances in AI focus on identifying analogies across domains without supervision. AN-GAN, a matching-by-synthesis approach, outperforms current techniques in finding exact analogies between datasets. The methods learn a mapping function T AB that takes images from two different domains A and B without explicit correspondences and maps them to their likely appearance in the other domain. This is achieved by utilizing distributional and cycle constraints. The task of analogy identification involves finding pairs of examples in the two domains related by a fixed non-linear transformation. However, the translated images may lack high visual fidelity for exact matching due to the absence of exemplar-based constraints. In this work, the focus is on analogy identification across domains using exemplar-based constraints to improve visual fidelity. The method shows effectiveness in finding correspondences even when exact analogies are not present in sample sets, resulting in better visual quality compared to mapping functions. The approach involves a two-step training process for domain mapping, enhancing accuracy. The method focuses on finding analogies between datasets without supervision, improving visual quality by retrieving examples instead of mapping them. It involves a two-step training process for domain mapping, using a fully supervised method to fit a translation function between domains. The approach is related to image matching methods and unsupervised style-transfer techniques. Identification in this paper is closely related to image matching methods, specifically unsupervised style-transfer and image-to-image mapping. Various approaches have been proposed for image matching, including pixel-and feature-point based matching and the use of deep neural networks. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have also made significant advancements in image synthesis. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have revolutionized image synthesis, allowing for the creation of realistic images. Image to image translation work often utilizes GANs to generate visually accurate results. Unsupervised mapping for image translation involves no supervision beyond sample images from the two domains, showing recent advancements in this field. The created image in image mapping is based on an input image, not random noise. Unsupervised mapping uses sample images from two domains without supervision. Supervised mapping, with matching pairs of input and output images, can be trained directly using GANs. Successful completion of the algorithm generates correspondences between domains for potential use in supervised mapping methods. The algorithm uses a U-net architecture to find matches between source and target images without supervision. It aims to identify analogies between two sets of images in different domains A and B. The iterative approach maps images from the source domain to the target domain and searches for matches in the target domain. Our goal is to find matching indexes between images in domains A and B using an iterative approach. A GAN-based distribution approach is used to map images from domain A to domain B, optimizing the distribution alignment to appear identical. The mapping function T AB is trained to map images from domain A to domain B, with a discriminator D trained to distinguish between the distributions. The loss function for training T and D is a binary cross-entropy loss. The distribution-constraint alone was found to be insufficient in many datasets, leading to the addition of constraints such as circularity and distance invariance. The popular cycle approach trains one-sided GANs in both the A \u2192 B and B \u2192 A directions, ensuring that an image translated to B and back to A recovers the original. This two-sided cycle loss function yields mapping functions between domains A and B, providing matching between samples and synthetic images in the target domain. The previous section discussed the cycle approach in training GANs for mapping between domains A and B. The current section introduces a method for exact matches between domains by finding matching indices for every image pair. This allows for training a fully supervised mapping function for high-quality results. The current section introduces a method for exact matches between domains A and B by finding matching indices for every image pair. This involves training a fully supervised mapping function for high-quality results. The optimization process involves a relaxed binary programming approach with an entropy constraint to encourage sparse solutions. The method introduced aims to achieve exact matches between domains A and B by training a fully supervised mapping function. An entropy constraint is added to encourage sparse solutions in the optimization process. The relaxed formulation can be optimized using SGD, and by increasing the significance of the entropy term, exact correspondences can be recovered. The training scheme involves iteratively updating variables for N epochs, leading to excellent results. AN-GAN is a cross domain matching method that uses exemplar and distribution based constraints to achieve good performance. The optimization problem includes distributional loss, cycle loss, and exemplar loss. The method also adversarially trains discriminators D A and D B. Initially, all matches are set to equal. The AN-GAN optimization problem involves training discriminators D A and D B adversarially. Initially, all matches are set to equal likelihood. The method includes exemplar loss, with an initial burn-in period and specific iterations for optimization. The exemplar loss learning rate is decayed after 20 epochs. Hyper-parameters are shared between mapping directions to inform likelihood of matches. In experiments, hyper-parameters are fixed and shared between mapping directions to inform likelihood of matches. Euclidean or L1 loss functions were not perceptual enough, but Laplacian pyramid loss and perceptual loss function provided improvement. VGG features are extracted for each image, with different numbers of feature maps used depending on image resolution. L1 loss on pixels is also used to consider colors. Our method extracts VGG features for images, using different numbers of feature maps based on resolution. L1 loss on pixels is utilized for color consideration. The perceptual loss function is defined for image matching experiments on public datasets, comparing against existing methods. Our approach involves evaluating cross-domain matching using unsupervised methods on public datasets. We compare our method with existing solutions such as nearest neighbor matching using L1 loss on raw pixels and VGG feature loss. Additionally, we explore the performance of CycleGAN with L1 and VGG loss for nearest neighbor computation in the target domain. The VGG features are subsampled to reduce computational cost. The method involves training CycleGAN with L1 and VGG loss for nearest neighbor computation in the target domain. The evaluation is done on public datasets including Facades, Maps, Zappos50K, and Amazon handbags. Edge images are automatically detected using HED for the datasets. The original dataset contains 1096 training images of shoes from the Zappos50K dataset and 137k images of Amazon handbags. Edge images were automatically detected using HED. The datasets were down-sampled to 2k images each for memory complexity. The method was compared with five others for exact correspondence identification. Results showed that matching using pixels or deep features between domains cannot solve the task. The performance metric is the percentage of images with exact matches between domains A and B. Results show that matching using pixels or deep features cannot solve the task due to domain differences. CycleGAN and perceptual features improve matching performance, with perceptual features outperforming pixel matching. Exhaustive search was too computationally expensive, requiring feature subsampling. Perceptual features performed better than pixel matching, and an \u03b1 iterations step was run on mapped images. The method used VGG features for image retrieval tasks, finding exhaustive search computationally expensive and requiring feature subsampling. Perceptual features outperformed pixel matching, and a method matching linear combinations of mapped images was less sensitive to outliers. The exemplar loss alone did not converge, so distributional auxiliary losses were used to aid optimization, leading to successful analogy finding. The optimization problem with the exemplar loss did not converge, so distributional auxiliary losses were used to aid optimization. The AN-GAN method achieved significantly better performance for all datasets by optimizing the mapping function. In experiments with a percentage of matches unavailable between domains, the task was to identify correct matches for samples with matches in the other domain. In this scenario, a percentage of samples in domain A and B do not have matches in the opposite domain. The task is to identify correct matches for samples with matches in the other domain. The evaluation metric is the percentage of images with exact matches. Results show that the method can handle scenarios where not all examples have matches, with comparable results even when 25% of samples do not have matches. AN-GAN achieved a 90% match rate with up to 75% of samples in some datasets.

AN-GAN achieved a 90% match rate in the experiment, even when exact analogies were not available. A two-step approach was suggested for training a mapping function between unaligned datasets, resulting in 97% alignment accuracy for the Facades dataset. For the Facades dataset, a self-supervised mapping function using Pix2Pix achieved 97% alignment accuracy. The method outperformed CycleGAN and approached fully-supervised quality. Results were also shown for edges2shoes and edges2handbags datasets, demonstrating similar performance to fully supervised methods and outperforming CycleGAN. Our self-supervised method outperforms CycleGAN and approaches fully-supervised quality in image mapping. Results on edges2shoes and edges2handbags datasets show competitive performance with full-supervision. Additionally, our method shows improved performance in point cloud matching tasks. Our method excels in point cloud matching tasks, achieving alignment between reference and target 3D objects with close correspondences. Experiments on the Bunny benchmark demonstrate success rates for various rotation angles, using a specific architecture with a fully connected network and a linear affine matrix for transformation. The success rate comparison with CycleGAN is shown in Tab. 5, with success defined as achieving an RMSE. Our method outperforms the baseline results in point cloud matching tasks, achieving alignment accuracy with a specific architecture. We introduced an algorithm for cross domain matching with an exemplar constraint to improve performance, especially for large transformations. Our method is effective for low dimensional transformations and settings without exact matches. The algorithm introduced for cross domain matching with an exemplar constraint significantly outperformed baseline methods in various datasets for full and partial exact matching. It offers a new perspective on domain translation by aligning domains and training a supervised mapping function between them. Future work involves exploring matching across different modalities like images, speech, and text, requiring the development of new distribution matching algorithms."
