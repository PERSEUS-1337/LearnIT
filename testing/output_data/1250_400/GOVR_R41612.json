President Obama made alleviating global hunger a priority, leading to the launch of the Feed the Future initiative in 2010 with a $3.5 billion pledge over three years. The initiative aims to promote agricultural development, increase food production, and improve food security and nutrition, especially for vulnerable populations. The Feed the Future initiative, launched in 2010 with a $3.5 billion pledge over three years, aims to promote global agricultural development, increase food production, and improve food security and nutrition, especially for vulnerable populations. There is a call for more innovative approaches and increased engagement from local populations and the private sector to achieve sustainable global food security objectives. The global food security initiative needs more innovative approaches with increased buy-in from local populations and engagement from the private sector to effectively achieve its objectives. Congress plays a central role in funding and oversight of agricultural development programs, administered by various U.S. agencies and international organizations. The 112th Congress may consider legislation to authorize and fund aspects of the food security initiative. The 112th Congress may consider legislation to authorize and fund aspects of the food security initiative, including support for agricultural development assistance, international agriculture research, and food security safety net assistance. Legislation to revise the authorizing statute for U.S. foreign assistance may also be relevant. The prospects for consideration of increases to U.S. foreign assistance funding are uncertain due to the change in House leadership and the federal budget deficit situation. The primary objectives of this report are to provide a context for the state of food insecurity in the world, overview the Obama Administration's global hunger and food security initiative, Feed the Future, and discuss issues related to the U.S. global food security initiative. The global food insecurity situation has worsened due to food price and economic crises, with over 1 billion people undernourished in 2009. The number of chronically hungry people is estimated to be 925 million in 2010, down from 1.023 billion in 2009. The 112th Congress may consider legislation to support agricultural development and address global food security issues. The number of chronically hungry people decreased from 1.023 billion in 2009 to 925 million in 2010 due to global food and economic crises. FAO data shows a slow but steady increase in undernourished people over the past decade. Investment in agriculture led to a decline in hunger in the 1980s and 1990s, but a decrease in official development assistance for agriculture caused an increase in hungry people from 1995-2006. The recent food and economic crises have reversed the declining trend in undernourishment. The recent food and economic crises have reversed the declining trend in hunger reduction globally, except in Latin America and the Caribbean. The proportion of undernourished people increased from about 16% to 17% in 2008, slowing progress towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals. Developing countries bear the brunt of undernourishment, with Asia and the Pacific, sub-Saharan Africa, and other regions facing significant challenges. The 2010 hunger report by FAO estimated that 578 million people in Asia and the Pacific, 239 million in sub-Saharan Africa, 53 million in Latin America and the Caribbean, 37 million in the Near East and North Africa, and 19 million in developed countries suffer from chronic undernourishment. The global hunger figure in 2010 decreased by 9.6% from 2009, with significant improvements in Asia but smaller drops in sub-Saharan Africa. Sub-Saharan Africa still has the highest rates of food insecurity, with one out of three people undernourished. The 2010 Global Health Index (GHI) showed improvement globally, with a 14% decrease in sub-Saharan Africa compared to 1990. The 2010 Global Health Index (GHI) shows improvements in various countries, with significant progress in Southeast Asia and Latin America. South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa have the highest GHI scores, but South Asia has made more progress since 1990. The causes of hunger differ between the regions, with South Asia affected by low nutritional, educational, and social status of women, while sub-Saharan Africa faces challenges like low government effectiveness and political instability. According to IFPRI, the causes of hunger in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa differ. In South Asia, low nutritional, educational, and social status of women contribute to underweight children, while in sub-Saharan Africa, factors like low government effectiveness, conflict, political instability, and high rates of HIV/AIDS lead to high child mortality. Most countries in these regions have high GHI scores, with slow progress in reducing them. Conflict and political instability have worsened hunger in some countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Between 1990 and 2010, some countries in sub-Saharan Africa saw an increase in their Global Hunger Index (GHI) scores due to conflict and political instability, as well as high rates of HIV/AIDS. Countries like The Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, Comoros, Guinea-Bissau, and Liberia experienced a rise in hunger levels. In Swaziland, HIV/AIDS and inequality have undermined food security despite higher national incomes. In Zimbabwe, economic collapse has led to more underweight children and child mortality. On the other hand, countries like Angola, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mozambique, Nicaragua, and Vietnam made significant progress in improving their GHI scores during the same period. The economic collapse in Zimbabwe has led to an increase in underweight children and child mortality. Ghana, Angola, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Nicaragua, and Vietnam made significant improvements in their Global Hunger Index scores between 1990 and 2010. President Obama pledged $3.5 billion over three years to address global hunger at the G8 Summit in Italy. The Global Partnership for Agriculture and Food Security was launched to mobilize at least $20 billion to combat hunger and poverty. The G8 summit leaders and other countries announced the Global Partnership for Agriculture and Food Security to combat hunger and poverty, with a goal of mobilizing $20 billion over three years. They committed to five principles for a food security initiative, focusing on sustainable production and rural economic growth. The initiative aims to support comprehensive strategies, country-owned plans, donor coordination, multilateral institutions, and sustained commitments. Social protection mechanisms and emergency assistance like food aid are also emphasized. The G8 leaders pledged to provide sustainable funding to enhance world production capacity and reverse the trend of decreasing official development assistance for agriculture. The initiative aims to support country and regional agricultural strategies through country-led coordination processes, consistent with the Accra Agenda for Action. Developing countries have committed to take control of their own futures, while donors have pledged to coordinate better among themselves. The AAA was agreed upon by developing and donor countries, focusing on country-led strategies and implementation plans. In sub-Saharan Africa, the G8 endorsed the CAADP to target resources to country priorities. CAADP aims to improve food security, nutrition, and increase smallholder farmers' incomes by raising agricultural productivity and increasing public investment in agriculture. The L'Aqulia declaration also supports the Comprehensive Framework for Action of the U.N. High Level Task Force on. The L'Aqulia declaration aims to improve food security, nutrition, and increase smallholder farmers' incomes by raising agricultural productivity and increasing public investment in agriculture. It leverages the Comprehensive Framework for Action (CFA) of the U.N. High Level Task Force on the Global Food Security Crisis, focusing on immediate and longer-term actions to address global food prices. The CFA includes enhancing emergency food assistance, boosting smallholder farmer food production, adjusting trade and tax policies, and expanding social protection systems for sustained food availability growth. The L'Aquila declaration focuses on improving food security and increasing smallholder farmers' incomes by enhancing emergency food assistance, boosting food production, adjusting trade policies, and expanding social protection systems. The G20 Summit endorsed the initiative and called for the establishment of a World Bank Food Security Trust Fund to finance investments in agricultural productivity in low-income countries. Additional commitments were made by countries like Belgium, Finland, Norway, and Switzerland, but have not been fully realized yet. The United States also collaborated with private sector actors to support these efforts. At the G8 Summit, countries like Belgium, Finland, Norway, and Switzerland pledged $2 billion to the Global Partnership for food security, bringing the total to $22 billion. The United States worked with private sector actors to coordinate food security efforts. FAO convened a World Summit on Food Security in Rome in 2009, where global leaders endorsed the Global Partnership and renewed commitments to reduce hunger by half by 2015. FAO reported that agricultural output needs to increase by 70% to feed a population of over 9 billion by 2050. At the G8 Summit, countries pledged $2 billion to the Global Partnership for food security. FAO reported that agricultural output needs to increase by 70% to feed a population of over 9 billion by 2050. The U.S. State Department issued a Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative Consultation Document in 2009, leading to the launch of the \"Feed the Future\" Initiative in 2010. The initiative aims to address global food security through a consultative process involving various stakeholders. The Feed the Future (FtF) initiative was developed through a consultative process involving various stakeholders globally. It builds on principles for sustainable food security and has key objectives of accelerating inclusive agriculture sector growth and improving nutritional status in specific countries. FtF focuses on interventions to improve agricultural productivity, expand markets, develop policies, services, and infrastructure for smallholder farmers. The Feed the Future (FtF) initiative aims to improve agricultural productivity by providing technologies and inputs adapted to local conditions, expanding markets for agricultural commodities, and developing policies and infrastructure for smallholder farmers. Progress will be measured through changes in agricultural production and income levels of farmers. The initiative also aims to strengthen links between agriculture and improved nutrition outcomes by coordinating with host governments and other partners. The FtF initiative aims to strengthen links between agriculture and improved nutrition outcomes by coordinating with host governments and other partners. Progress will be measured through changes in the prevalence of stunted and wasted children, and underweight women. The initiative also includes investments in regional programs, strategic partnerships with countries like Brazil, India, and China, and global research and innovation. It does not explicitly include traditional U.S. food aid funding but maintains a commitment to providing emergency and humanitarian food assistance. Currently focusing on 20 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean. The FtF initiative, excluding traditional U.S. food aid funding, focuses on 20 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean. These countries were selected based on criteria such as chronic hunger, agricultural-led growth potential, and government commitment. Investments will occur in two phases, with Phase 1 countries preparing their country investment plans. Assistance includes capacity-building, technical support, stakeholder consultations, and resource identification. Phase 1 countries are in the process of developing their country investment plans (CIPs), with key assistance including capacity-building, technical support, stakeholder consultations, and identifying actions to improve the policy environment. Phase 2 countries have completed their CIPs, which include priority areas, financial projections, defined targets, beneficiary analysis, and a commitment of resources to foster agricultural development and improved nutrition. The initiative aims to partner with selected countries to assist in developing and implementing CIPs. The Feed the Future initiative aims to partner with countries to develop and implement Country Investment Plans (CIPs) for rapid agricultural development and improved nutrition. The FY2011 budget request includes $1.64 billion for Feed the Future activities, representing a 40% increase from previous allocations. Additionally, $200 million for nutrition activities are funded through the Global Health and Child Survival account as part of the food security effort. The U.S. State Department notes that $200 million for nutrition activities funded through the Global Health and Child Survival account are part of the food security effort. The FY2011 request for Feed the Future is 40% greater than the estimated FY2010 allocation, with a significant portion going towards a multilateral trust fund for global food security at the World Bank. The FY2010 estimate does not include food and agriculture-related supplemental appropriations for Haiti, which focus on emergency food aid and debt cancellation. The Administration's FY2011 budget request for Feed the Future is only a portion of the foreign assistance requested for food and agriculture activities. Additionally, the Administration is requesting $4.2 billion for humanitarian and emergency assistance in FY2011. The Administration's FY2011 budget request for Feed the Future is only a portion of the foreign assistance requested for food and agriculture activities. Separately, an additional $4.2 billion is requested for humanitarian and emergency assistance in FY2011, including funds for Food for Peace Title II, Migration and Refugee Assistance, International Disaster Assistance, and Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance. There have been discussions during the 111th Congress about the need to reform U.S. foreign aid capabilities to better address national security challenges and development needs. The discussion revolves around the need to reform U.S. foreign aid capabilities to address 21st-century national security challenges and development needs. Criticisms include inefficiency, lack of coordination, and not aligning with national security interests. The Obama Administration initiated the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) in 2009 to revamp U.S. development policy, led by the State Department. Despite delays, the findings were released in 2010 as \"Leading Through Civilian Power.\" The Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) was initiated by the Obama Administration in 2009 to reform U.S. foreign aid capabilities. Despite delays, the findings were officially released in 2010 as \"Leading Through Civilian Power,\" outlining strategies to elevate American \"civilian power\" to better advance national interests and be a better partner to the military. Additionally, a Presidential Study Directive on Global Development Policy (PSD-7) was launched in August 2009 to review the roles and comparative advantages of U.S. government agencies involved in global development. The PSD-7, launched in August 2009, authorized a U.S. government-wide review of global development policy to determine the roles and advantages of agencies involved. The process, led by key officials, aims to enhance U.S. development policy effectiveness by prioritizing economic growth and democratic governance. The draft of PSD-7 titled \"A New Way Forward on Global Development\" emphasizes elevating development as a key pillar of U.S. foreign policy, sparking enthusiasm in the development community. The Administration's development approach prioritizes economic growth and democratic governance, creating a new government structure that elevates development as a key pillar of U.S. foreign policy. The QDDR will contribute to the PSD, assessing how its results fit into broader interagency approaches. The PSD-7 process has been delayed, with uncertainty on whether final outputs will be publicly released. President Obama's Global Development Policy Directive emphasizes development as a core pillar of American power. President Obama announced a new Presidential Policy Directive on Global Development in September 2010, highlighting Global Food Security as one of the key initiatives. The directive called for development, diplomacy, and defense to work together for national security. In November 2010, the USAID Administrator established a new Bureau for Food Security (BFS) to lead food security efforts and implement the Feed the Future initiative. BFS will coordinate with various agencies and expand partnerships with the private sector and NGOs. The Bureau for Food Security (BFS) at USAID will drive food security efforts and coordinate with various agencies, including the State Department, Millennium Challenge Corporation, and USDA. The 112th Congress faces issues on agricultural development, global food security, and U.S. foreign aid reform. Congress is considering FY2011 appropriations for agricultural development within the Feed the Future Initiative, with a proposed funding bill of $52.81 billion. Congress is currently considering FY2011 appropriations for agricultural development and food security within the Feed the Future Initiative. The House and Senate proposed funding bills with varying amounts, both lower than the Obama Administration's request. The House bill included $1 billion for food security and agricultural development, while the Senate bill allocated $1.3 billion for these programs. However, none of the appropriations bills for FY2011 were enacted by Congress. The Senate bill for FY2011 appropriations was $344 million below the Administration's request for food security and agriculture development programs under the Feed the Future initiative. Congress did not enact any of the 12 regular appropriations bills for FY2011, instead funding the federal government through continuing resolutions. The current fiscal situation and shift in congressional leadership may lead to further debate on funding priorities. The G8 L'Aquila commitment to the Global Partnership, totaling $22 billion over three years, faces skepticism in meeting the pledge. The G8 L'Aquila commitment to the Global Partnership, totaling $22 billion over three years, faces skepticism in meeting the pledge. Concerns have been raised about the lack of strong leadership at USAID, with key positions remaining unfilled. The Obama Administration faced criticism for delays in appointing key positions at USAID, leading to a leadership vacuum. This allowed other federal agencies to take on roles traditionally held by USAID, raising concerns about divided development approaches and undermining USAID's authority and resources. The Center for Global Development highlighted the absence of USAID in significant foreign policy challenges. Senior government officials have expressed worries about the decline in staff capacity at USAID. Several senior government officials, including Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and former USAID Administrator Peter McPherson, have raised concerns about the severe decline in staff capacity at USAID over the past few decades. Secretary Gates highlighted the imbalance between military and civilian elements of national security, attributing it to a lack of capacity rather than willingness. This decline in capacity can be traced back to the 1990s when key instruments of U.S. power abroad were reduced, such as freezing the hiring of new Foreign Service officers and a significant drop in permanent staff at USAID. During the 1990s, key U.S. power instruments abroad were reduced, including freezing Foreign Service officer hiring and a significant drop in USAID staff. This led to detrimental impacts on USAID, such as reduced on-the-ground effectiveness and loss of technical expertise. USAID shifted from an implementation agency to contracting out a large portion of its foreign aid program. The loss of on-the-ground effectiveness and technical expertise at USAID due to staff cuts has led to the closing of overseas missions. USAID now contracts out a large portion of its foreign aid program, resulting in less coherence and effectiveness. The agency struggles with managing numerous small agricultural development projects due to staff shortages. Efforts are being made to rebuild in-house technical capacity, with the hiring of additional agriculture foreign-service officers. Since the launch of the Feed the Future initiative, USAID has hired nearly 40 additional agriculture foreign-service officers to address rebuilding its technical capacity. Land-grant universities have been involved in creating counterpart institutions in developing countries since the 1950s. The role of capacity building at USAID has been declining since the 1990s, leading to reduced support for agricultural research and weaker institutional capacity in partner countries. USAID's post-graduate training decreased by over 90% between 1989 and 2005, leading to reduced support for agricultural research and weaker institutional capacity in developing countries. Despite recognizing the importance of long-term institutional building, USAID has not restored funding, scope, and duration of training and capacity-building programs, especially in agriculture. Concerns exist about the insufficient institutional capacity in both the United States and developing countries, particularly in Africa, to effectively implement agricultural programs. Some questions exist about the institutional capacity in the United States and developing countries, particularly Africa, to implement agricultural research and market development programs. Sub-Saharan Africa lacks a strong scientific foundation for modern agriculture, with governments and donors hesitant to invest in science and technology. Various U.S. agencies, including USAID, State Department, USDA, MCC, Treasury Department, and USTR, are involved in agricultural development and food security assistance, requiring better interagency coordination. The need for interagency coordination in agricultural development and food security assistance has been widely discussed. The Chicago Council on Global Affairs recommended creating an Interagency Council on Global Agriculture within the Executive Office of the President to provide leadership and maintain consistent priorities among U.S. government agencies. The Government Accountability Office highlighted coordination problems between USDA, USAID, and other agencies in providing food aid and development assistance. The Government Accountability Office has reported coordination problems between USDA, USAID, and other agencies in providing food aid and development assistance. The Feed the Future initiative aims for a \"whole-of-government\" approach, but there are concerns about fragmentation and lack of coordination across government agencies. USAID is designated as the lead implementation agency, but details on coordination with other entities are unclear. Funding implications of the initiative have not been clearly outlined by the Administration. Bills in Congress also emphasize the need for interagency coordination in addressing global hunger. The United States aims for a whole-of-government approach in addressing global hunger, but coordination with other key government entities remains unclear. Bills in Congress highlight the need for interagency coordination, while efforts to harmonize aid strategies with other donors and aid agencies continue. The United States plays a leading role in coordinating international aid programs with countries like Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, and the European Union. The United States aims to make international aid more effective by coordinating with other donors like Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, and the European Union. This includes discussions within international bodies like the United Nations and the Development Assistance Committee. Global summits have also played a key role in donor coordination and establishing international development goals. The US aligning with other donors has implications for its bilateral assistance. The United States aligns with other donors to increase aid predictability and flexibility, supporting initiatives like the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) and the global food security initiative. Some argue for faster aid reform progress, while others prioritize U.S. strategic interests in foreign assistance activities. Some argue for faster aid reform progress, while others prioritize U.S. strategic interests in foreign assistance activities. Concerns have been raised about country-led planning diminishing donor control and oversight, as well as the capacity of developing countries to carry out accountability measures. Civil society sectors fear the process may become government-led, excluding their involvement. Some civil society sectors argue that country-led planning may become government-led, potentially excluding their involvement. Questions arise about coordinating U.S. food aid with Feed the Future activities in focus countries and how food aid can support FtF objectives. The Administration's FY2011 request includes $1.69 billion for Food for Peace Title II food aid, a larger component of U.S. food security assistance than FtF. Key concerns include adverse effects of nonemergency or development food aid projects on FtF activities. The curr_chunk discusses the coordination of U.S. commodity food aid with Feed the Future activities in focus countries, as well as the integration of cross-cutting initiatives such as gender, global health, and climate change into country plans. It also raises questions about the resources needed, metrics to track progress, and coordination with other USG initiatives. The curr_chunk discusses the coordination of Feed the Future (FtF) with other USG initiatives like PEPFAR and GCCI. It highlights the work on FtF results framework and indicators, but raises questions about monitoring responsibility, timeline for results, achievement of MDG1, and reporting frequency to Congress."
