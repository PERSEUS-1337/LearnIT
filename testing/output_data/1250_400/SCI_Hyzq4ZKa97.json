    "content": "In this study, a new metric called NetScore is introduced to evaluate deep neural networks for practical on-device edge usage. NetScore aims to assess the balance between accuracy, computational complexity, and network architecture complexity. The study compares NetScore, top-1 accuracy, and information density metrics across 60 different deep convolutional neural networks for image classification on the ImageNet dataset. The study compares NetScore, top-1 accuracy, and information density metrics across 60 different deep convolutional neural networks for image classification on the ImageNet dataset. The evaluation results serve as a reference guide for practitioners in the field, highlighting the challenges in designing practical deep neural networks that balance accuracy and complexity. In designing deep neural networks, striking a balance between accuracy and complexity is crucial. The information density metric is commonly used to measure accuracy relative to network size, but it does not consider computational requirements for network inference. To address this, a new metric called NetScore is introduced to assess the balance between accuracy, computational complexity, and network efficiency. This metric aims to improve network model search and design by providing a quantitative evaluation of these factors. In this study, NetScore is introduced as a new metric to evaluate the balance between accuracy, computational complexity, and network efficiency in deep neural networks. The study sets \u03b2 = 0.5 and \u03b3 = 0.5 to provide a reference guide for practitioners. The deep convolutional neural networks evaluated include AlexNet BID22."
