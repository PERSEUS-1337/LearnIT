    "content": "Title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section called \"Physical Education for Progress Act.\" This part aims to provide grants and contracts to local educational agencies to enhance physical education programs for students from kindergarten to 12th grade. The findings of Congress highlight the importance of physical education for children's development, health, self-esteem, and overall well-being. It emphasizes the benefits of physical education in improving cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, flexibility, weight regulation, bone development, and promoting an active lifestyle. Additionally, it addresses the increasing prevalence of obesity among children in the United States and the significant economic costs associated with obesity-related diseases. The percentage of young people overweight has doubled in 30 years. Low activity levels contribute to obesity in US children. Obesity-related diseases cost over $100 billion annually. Inactivity and poor diet cause 300,000 deaths yearly. Physically fit adults have reduced heart attack and stroke risks. Children are not active enough, with less than 1 in 4 getting daily vigorous activity. Surgeon General and CDC recommend daily physical education for K-12 students. Congress passed Resolution 97 in 1987 encouraging physical education. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend daily physical education for all K-12 students. Despite a resolution passed in 1987, little progress has been made in providing quality physical education programs. It is essential for students to have the opportunity to participate in physical education to develop health-related fitness and adopt healthy lifestyles. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to local educational agencies for physical education programs for K-12 students, including equipment, curriculum development, and staff training. Applications and program requirements are outlined. Local educational agencies must submit applications to the Secretary outlining plans to enhance physical education programs in schools to meet national goals and state standards. The goals include fitness education, motor skills instruction, and cognitive development for students. Physical education programs aim to enhance students' physical, mental, and social development through motor skills, cognitive concepts, social skills, and nutrition education. Teachers are required to stay updated on research and trends in the field. Extracurricular activities like team sports and ROTC are not considered part of the curriculum for physical education programs. The Secretary ensures equitable distribution of grants and contracts between urban and rural educational agencies, as well as between agencies serving large and small student populations. Funding applications can include participation of home-schooled and private school students. Reporting is required for continued funding. \"Annual reports are required for continued funding of grants or contracts under this program, demonstrating progress towards goals. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress detailing program success and recommendations for improvement. Administrative costs are limited to 5% of funds, and the federal share must supplement, not supplant, existing funds.\" The text outlines limitations on administrative costs, with not more than 5% of grant funds allowed for this purpose. It also specifies that the federal share of project costs cannot exceed 90% in the first year and 75% in subsequent years. Additionally, funds must supplement, not replace, other available federal, state, and local funds for physical education activities. Authorization of appropriations is set at $30,000,000 for 2000, $70,000,000 for 2001, and $100,000,000 for each year from 2002 to 2004."
