    "content": "The \"State Infrastructure Banks Act of 1995\" allows states to use State infrastructure banks for financing transportation projects, providing more freedom in developing low-cost support for public-private transportation partnerships. The \"State Infrastructure Banks Act of 1995\" defines key terms such as Secretary, State, and State infrastructure bank. State infrastructure banks are created at the State or multi-State level to finance transportation projects. Congress grants consent to States to establish State infrastructure banks and enter into interstate compacts to promote regional investment in transportation infrastructure. State infrastructure banks can provide loans, issue debt, and offer assistance to entities for eligible transportation projects under federal laws. The banks can fund all or part of the construction costs for qualifying projects. State infrastructure banks, established under the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, can provide loans or assistance for transportation projects. Assistance may include credit enhancements, capital reserves, bond financing, interest rate subsidies, and other approved leveraging tools. Participating States must meet certain requirements to qualify as a State infrastructure bank. State infrastructure banks must maintain an investment grade rating on debt issuances or have sufficient insurance. Investment income generated must be credited to the bank and used for loans to transportation projects, invested in Treasury securities or other approved instruments to enhance project leveraging. The State infrastructure bank must ensure that loan repayments can be credited back to the bank or used for the intended purpose. Loans will bear interest determined by the bank, with repayment starting within 5 years of project completion and not exceeding 30 years in total. The State infrastructure bank must ensure timely repayment of loans within 30 years, limit loan amounts, and provide annual status reports to the Secretary. The Secretary must oversee disbursements and establish guidelines for the bank. Contributions from Title 23 apportionments are also specified. The State infrastructure bank must ensure timely loan repayment within 30 years, limit loan amounts, and provide annual status reports to the Secretary. Contributions from Title 23 apportionments allow a State to transfer up to 15% of Federal funds to the bank. The deposit of Federal apportionments into the bank does not create any obligation on the part of the United States. The deposit of Federal apportionments into a State infrastructure bank does not create any obligation on the part of the United States. Sections 3335 and 6503 of title 31, United States Code, do not apply to funds used as a capital reserve under this Act. States can contribute up to 2 percent of Federal funds deposited into the bank for administering costs."
