    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science Act of 2015\". Congress acknowledges the importance of crowdsourcing and citizen science. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 has allowed Federal agencies to use incentive prizes and challenges, resulting in benefits such as paying only for success, setting ambitious goals, involving a broader group of people, bringing diverse perspectives, and maximizing cost-effectiveness. Granting agencies direct authority to use crowdsourcing and citizen science will remove ambiguity and encourage their appropriate use to advance agency missions. Crowdsourcing and citizen science can improve government services with lower resource investments, connect citizens to agency missions, and acquire data at a greater extent and frequency. Citizen science benefits include promoting open government, acquiring data at a greater extent, addressing community concerns, advancing scientific research, improving science literacy, and furthering science diplomacy. The benefits of citizen science include improving science literacy, promoting science diplomacy, building trust between citizens and scientists, and providing incentives for participants such as attribution, learning new skills, and connecting with others. Potential participants in citizen science are motivated by receiving attribution, learning new skills, connecting with others, and contributing to solving meaningful problems in science for the benefit of society. SEC. 3. CROWDSOURCING AND CITIZEN SCIENCE. In this section, \"citizen science\" involves individuals and organizations collaborating in the scientific process, while \"crowdsourcing\" is a method to obtain services or content from a group. The term \"Director\" refers to the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and \"Federal agency\" is defined as a government agency. Crowdsourcing is a method of obtaining services or content by soliciting voluntary contributions from individuals or organizations, especially online. The terms \"Director,\" \"Federal agency,\" \"Participant,\" and \"Related entity\" are defined within this context. The terms \"participant\" and \"related entity\" are defined in the context of crowdsourcing and citizen science projects. Federal agencies are authorized to utilize crowdsourcing and citizen science approaches for their missions, accepting voluntary services subject to regulations. Federal agencies can accept voluntary services for crowdsourcing or citizen science projects, as long as they are not financially compensated and do not displace any government employees. Agencies must advertise and promote projects to encourage participation, and participants must consent and adhere to terms of use. Federal agencies engaged in crowdsourcing or citizen science projects must promote and make public their projects to encourage broad participation. Each agency can determine the level of consent, registration, or acknowledgment required from participants, and must disclose privacy, intellectual property, data ownership, compensation, and other terms of use clearly to participants. Consent can be obtained in various ways by the agency or agencies involved. Federal agencies conducting crowdsourcing or citizen science projects must clearly disclose privacy, intellectual property, data ownership, compensation, and other terms to participants. Consent can be obtained electronically or in writing, and projects involving human subjects must adhere to regulations. Data collected should be made open and available to the public in machine-readable formats. Federal agencies conducting crowdsourcing or citizen science projects must disclose data usage, ownership, availability, and publication rights to participants. They should also make technologies and intellectual property developed through these projects open to the public. Federal agencies conducting crowdsourcing or citizen science projects must make technologies, applications, code, and derivations of intellectual property developed through the projects open to the public. Participants must agree to assume all risks and waive claims against the Federal Government, except for willful misconduct. Federal agencies must ensure participants adhere to scientific integrity and ethics policies. Federal agencies coordinating citizen science projects must ensure participants adhere to scientific integrity and ethics policies. They may enter into partnerships with private or public sector entities for administrative duties and can use appropriated funds for activities. In carrying out crowdsourcing and citizen science activities, Federal agencies can use funds from Congress or other entities, including private sector, government agencies, and public institutions of higher education. Special consideration cannot be given in return for funding. Assistance from the General Services Administration must be provided within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The General Services Administration will provide assistance within 180 days to facilitate crowdsourcing and citizen science activities. Federal agencies should consult guidance provided by the Director. A report is required within 2 years of the Act's enactment. The Director encourages Federal agencies engaged in crowdsourcing or citizen science to consult guidance provided by the Director. A report on activities under this subsection is required every 2 years. Each report includes a summary of projects conducted in the past 2 fiscal years. The report on crowdsourcing and citizen science projects conducted by Federal agencies includes descriptions of project goals, participation rates, resources used, and allocation of obligations and expenditures. The report includes details on how resources were used, allocation of obligations and expenditures, ways projects advanced agency missions, project results, data quality methods, and savings or costs incurred by the Federal Government from crowdsourcing and citizen science projects. The report summarizes the challenges faced by Federal agencies in conducting crowdsourcing and citizen science projects, including steps taken to address these challenges and recommendations for future action. It also includes information on the use of these methods by all Federal agencies, including partnerships and collaborations. The report includes recommendations for future administrative or legislative action, a summary of crowdsourcing and citizen science methods used by Federal agencies, and any other relevant information.
