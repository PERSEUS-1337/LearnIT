    "content": "The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA), amended by the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), regulates \"federal election activity,\" including voter registration drives, voter identification, get-out-the-vote drives, and public communications that refer to federal candidates. Candidate and party committees can only use regulated federal funds for such activities. The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA) regulates \"federal election activity\" such as voter registration drives and public communications referring to federal candidates. Candidate and party committees can only use regulated federal funds for these activities. The FEC exempted Internet communications from federal campaign finance regulation, leading to a lawsuit by Representatives Shays and Meehan against the FEC in 2004. In 2004, Representatives Shays and Meehan sued the FEC in U.S. district court to challenge the regulations on Internet activities. The court agreed with the BCRA sponsors, overturning the FEC's rules on political communications online. The court found that excluding Internet communications from the definition of \"public communication\" was inconsistent with Congress's intent in the BCRA. It left it to the FEC to determine what constitutes \"general public political advertising\" online. The court found that the FEC failed to provide legislative history to justify ignoring the plain meaning of the statute. While not all Internet communications are considered \"general public political advertising,\" some clearly are. The court upheld the definition of \"generic campaign activity\" as a \"public communication\" but criticized the FEC for not giving adequate notice in their 2002 NPRM. The court also ruled that Internet communications exempted from \"public communications\" couldn't be considered \"coordinated communications\" under FECA. The Shays court found that Internet communications exempted from \"public communications\" couldn't be considered \"coordinated communications\" under FECA, leading to a remand of the case to the FEC for further action. In response, the FEC published an NPRM seeking comments on amending the definition of \"public communication\" to align with the court's ruling. The court remanded the case to the FEC for further action in response to the district court's decision in Shays v. FEC. The FEC published an NPRM seeking comments on amending the definition of \"public communication\" to include paid Internet advertisements. Proposed rules aimed to ensure proper financing and disclosure of Internet communications by political committees without restricting individual citizens' freedom to discuss candidates and elections online. The FEC approved new regulations in March 2006 to ensure proper financing and disclosure of Internet communications by political committees, citing the Shays v. FEC court decision. The regulations aim to leave individual blogs free from regulation as long as they are not done for a fee. The FEC approved regulations in 2006 to regulate Internet communications by political committees, excluding individual blogs unless done for a fee. Paid Internet advertising on another person's website is considered a \"public communication,\" subject to limitations and source disclosure. The FEC regulations approved in 2006 treat paid Internet advertising on another person's website as a \"public communication,\" subject to limitations, source restrictions, and disclosure requirements under FECA. Paid Internet ads must include disclaimers if they advocate for a specific election. The fees for political ads on websites are subject to contribution limits, source restrictions, and disclosure requirements. Disclaimers are required on all political committee websites for paid Internet ads advocating for a federal candidate. Payments to bloggers by candidates must be disclosed on candidate statements. Coordinated Internet ads with a candidate or party committee are considered in-kind contributions. Coordinated Internet advertisements placed on websites for the purpose of influencing federal elections are considered in-kind contributions subject to FECA regulations. Individual or volunteer activities on the Internet to influence elections are exempt from FECA regulation. Media exemptions apply to news stories, commentaries, and editorials distributed online. During the consideration of BCRA in Congress, there was a debate on exempting Internet communications from FECA regulation. Various bills were proposed in the 109th Congress to exempt all online communications from regulation under FECA, but they did not pass. During the 109th Congress, proposals were made to exempt Internet communications from FECA regulation. Bills like H.R. 1606, H.R. 4194, and H.R. 4900 aimed to address concerns about circumventing FECA regulations through online speech. However, these bills faced challenges in passing, with H.R. 1606 failing to receive the necessary votes for passage. The House Administration Committee ordered H.R. 1606 to be reported favorably, but the vote was postponed pending FEC regulatory action. During the 110th Congress, there was a delay in House floor action on proposed regulations for political communications on the Internet. Bills like H.R. 894 and H.R. 5699 aimed to extend disclaimer requirements to online communications and exempt certain Internet services from regulation. However, no major legislative action was taken on the regulation of online political communications during this time. H.R. 5699 proposed exempting uncompensated Internet services from regulation for individuals and corporations primarily engaged in Internet activities. Blogs and electronic publications would also be exempted as part of the general media exemption. This bill was referred to the Committee on House Administration during the 110th Congress."
