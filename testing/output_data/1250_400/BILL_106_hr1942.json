FINDINGS.\" The Congress finds that free trade agreements improve income and prosperity by increasing competition and lowering costs. APEC member economies aim for free and open trade by 2020.

Bilateral trade talks can positively impact multilateral and regional trade negotiations by expanding common areas of agreement on trade disciplines.
