The House and Senate Appropriations Committees had reported Agriculture appropriations bills for FY2018, with the House passing a consolidated bill that included agriculture. The enacted FY2018 Agriculture appropriation is $23.3 billion, a $2.1 billion increase from FY2017.

The Agriculture appropriations bill funds USDA and FDA, excluding the U.S. Forest Service. It includes mandatory and discretionary spending, with discretionary amounts being the primary focus. Discretionary spending is controlled by annual appropriations acts and receives most attention during the appropriations process. The budget process treats discretionary and mandatory spending differently. Discretionary spending is controlled by annual appropriations acts and receives most attention during the appropriations process. Mandatory spending is controlled by budget rules during the authorization process. In FY2018 Agriculture appropriations, discretionary appropriations were 16% of the total, while mandatory spending comprised 84%. The largest discretionary spending items are for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children. In FY2018 Agriculture appropriations, discretionary appropriations were 16% of the total, while mandatory spending comprised 84%. The main mandatory spending items are for programs in the 2014 farm bill, such as SNAP, child nutrition, crop insurance, and farm commodity programs. Other discretionary spending items include WIC, rural development, agricultural research, FDA, foreign food aid, farm assistance program salaries, food safety inspection, conservation, and animal and plant health programs. The USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) operates on a line of credit, while SNAP requires an annual appropriation. Agriculture appropriations have fluctuated over time, with increases since FY2013. Historical comparisons may require adjustments for inflation. Discretionary spending for Agriculture appropriations peaked in FY2010 and declined through FY2013. The stacked bars in Figure 3 show discretionary spending authorized for each appropriations title since FY2008. Prior to FY2018 enactment, the discretionary spending authorized for each appropriations title since FY2008 is shown in Figure 3. The Trump Administration released its FY2018 budget request in 2017, proposing a 21% reduction for USDA and FDA. The Administration's budget outline overlapped with Congress finishing FY2017 appropriations. The Trump Administration proposed a 21% reduction in funding for USDA and FDA in its FY2018 budget request. Congress reminded the agencies not to presuppose program funding outcomes and to wait for final decisions on fiscal year 2018 funding levels. The Administration's full budget request was released on May 23, 2017, with some OMB proposals not aligning with USDA's request. The Trump Administration requested $15.82 billion for Agriculture appropriations, $5.3 billion less than in FY2017. The Trump Administration proposed a 21% reduction in funding for USDA and FDA in its FY2018 budget request. Some OMB proposals were not consistent with the USDA request. For Agriculture appropriations, the Administration requested $15.82 billion, $5.3 billion less than in FY2017. Congressional appropriations committees evaluated the request and began considering their own bills in the summer of 2017. The House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee marked up its FY2018 bill on June 28, 2017, and the full Appropriations Committee passed an amended bill on July 12, 2017. The House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee marked up its FY2018 bill on June 28, 2017, and the full Appropriations Committee passed an amended bill on July 12, 2017, with a $20 billion discretionary budget authority. The House-passed FY2018 Agriculture appropriation reduced funding for rural development, nutrition assistance, farm and conservation programs, department administration, and research compared to FY2017. The House-passed FY2018 Agriculture appropriation bill aimed to reduce funding for various programs compared to FY2017, including rural development, nutrition assistance, farm and conservation programs, department administration, and research. The Senate Appropriations Committee also allocated $20.53 billion for FY2018, with the Senate-reported bill proposing $352 million less than FY2017 without CFTC. The Senate-reported bill (S. 1603, S.Rept. 115-131) on July 20, 2017, proposed a discretionary total of $20.53 billion, $352 million less than FY2017 without CFTC. It would have made fewer reductions compared to the House-passed bill, reducing rural development by $119 million and agricultural research by $57 million while increasing foreign food aid by $140 million. Additionally, it would have made $220 million more in reductions compared to the House-passed bill through rescissions and changing mandatory programs. The first continuing resolution for FY2018 (Division D of P.L. 115-56) lasted until December 8, 2017, maintaining FY2017 funding levels with exceptions and anomalies for the agriculture appropriation. This included a slight across-the-board reduction and increased funding for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program. The second and third continuing resolutions (P.L. 115-90 and P.L. 115-96) extended funding provisions and anomalies until January 19, 2018. The third CR also waived PAYGO rules for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to prevent sequestration of mandatory spending. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-123) extended the continuing resolution multiple times, preventing government shutdowns and providing disaster assistance for agriculture. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA; P.L. 115-123) authorized supplemental appropriations for agriculture, including assistance for crop and livestock losses from 2017 hurricanes and wildfires. It also revised agriculture programs, changed farm bill statutes, and raised discretionary spending caps. The BBA added $3.6 billion in disaster assistance for FY2018, including block grants to states, conservation funding, and rural water and wastewater support. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA; P.L. 115-123) provided $3.6 billion in disaster assistance for FY2018, including block grants to states for losses from 2017 hurricanes and wildfires, conservation funding, and rural water and wastewater support. Additionally, the BBA added $1.4 billion of mandatory funding to the 10-year baseline for the expected successor to the current farm bill, including funding for dairy programs, permanent disaster assistance programs, and cotton. The BBA offsets some of these additions by extending sequestration on mandatory accounts under the Budget Control Act for two more years.

It also added $1.4 billion in mandatory funding for the expected successor to the farm bill.

Table 3 compares the FY2018 appropriation to prior years and different proposals. The FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act compares agency funding and programs to House-passed, Senate-reported, and Administration proposals. Sequestration is a process of automatic budget reductions triggered when spending exceeds statutory goals. Bipartisan Budget Acts in 2013, 2015, and 2018 have raised discretionary budget caps to avoid sequestration. The Bipartisan Budget Acts in 2013, 2015, and 2018 have raised discretionary budget caps to avoid sequestration on discretionary spending. However, sequestration continues to apply to certain accounts of mandatory spending and has been extended multiple times to offset discretionary spending or for other budgetary purposes. Congress has extended sequestration on nonexempt mandatory accounts multiple times, with the latest extension until FY2027 in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. Some farm bill mandatory programs are exempt from sequestration, such as nutrition programs and the Conservation Reserve Program. Crop insurance is mostly exempt, while farm commodity programs and conservation programs have been subject to sequestration. The ruling states that most crop insurance is exempt from sequestration, while farm commodity programs, disaster assistance, and conservation programs are subject to it. Nonexempt mandatory spending in agriculture faces a 6.6% sequestration rate, resulting in a reduction of about $1.3 billion in FY2018.
