    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Raw Sewage Overflow Community Right-to-Know Act\" and includes findings related to the issue. Congress finds that there are millions of cases of waterborne diseases in the US annually, caused by inadequately treated sewage containing harmful pathogens. Swimming in contaminated waters leads to millions of Americans getting sick each year, resulting in significant economic losses. Many sewer systems lack routine monitoring for early detection. The economic impact of swimming-related illnesses in the United States is significant, with annual losses estimated at $28 billion. Better monitoring and reporting of sewer overflows could prevent millions of Americans from getting sick each year. Public health authorities are not always notified of sewer overflows that pose a threat to public health. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\nDefines \"sanitary sewer overflow\" as an overflow, spill, release, or diversion of wastewater from a sanitary sewer system, excluding combined sewer overflows and wastewater backups caused by building blockages. Includes overflows reaching waters of the United States, those that do not, and backups caused by sewer blockages. \n\nSEC. 4. MONITORING, REPORTING, AND PUBLIC NOTIFICATION OF SEWER OVERFLOWS. Section 402 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to require publicly owned treatment works to implement measures for timely detection and notification of sanitary sewer overflows to protect public health. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act now mandates that publicly owned treatment works must promptly notify the public and relevant authorities of any sanitary sewer overflow that poses a significant risk to human health. Notifications must be made within 24 hours of awareness, with written reports detailing the incident submitted within 5 days. Publicly owned treatment works must report sanitary sewer overflows to the Administrator or State within 5 days, detailing the overflow's magnitude, suspected cause, steps taken to prevent recurrence, and impact mitigation. They must also include all overflows in their monthly discharge monitoring report and report the total number of overflows in a calendar year. Publicly owned treatment works must report sanitary sewer overflows to the Administrator or State within 5 days, detailing the overflow's magnitude, suspected cause, steps taken to prevent recurrence, and impact mitigation. They must also include all overflows in their monthly discharge monitoring report and report the total number of overflows in a calendar year, including details of each incident. States receiving reports must annually summarize reported sanitary sewer overflows to the Administrator. SEC. 5. ELIGIBILITY FOR ASSISTANCE.\n\nAmends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to include requirements for monitoring, reporting, and notifying the public of sanitary sewer overflows.\n\nSEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\nAuthorizes $2,200,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2004 to 2008 for the Act."
