    "content": "Rising procurement costs for Navy ships are a concern for Navy officials and Congress. The Congressional Budget Office estimates higher funding levels are needed for the Navy's shipbuilding plan. Congress must decide how to address these rising costs, which could impact Navy capabilities and the shipbuilding industry. Options include increasing funding and changing how ships are funded in the budget. Congress must decide on options to address rising Navy ship procurement costs, which could impact future Navy capabilities, funding requirements, and the shipbuilding industrial base. Options include increasing annual ship-procurement funding, changing funding methods in the budget, utilizing multiyear procurement, adjusting acquisition strategies, reducing shipyard fixed overhead costs, improving yard efficiency, building ships with less equipment, and exploring construction in foreign shipyards. Another option is to shift to designs with lower unit procurement costs if needed. The report focuses on reducing Navy ship procurement costs by shifting to designs with lower unit procurement costs. It discusses notional options for lower-cost attack submarines, aircraft carriers, larger surface combatants, and smaller surface combatants. Congress may consider the advantages and disadvantages of this shift, as recent reports have proposed lower-cost designs for various types of Navy ships. Recent reports have proposed lower-cost designs for Navy ships, including attack submarines, aircraft carriers, and surface combatants. Suggestions include reducing ship size and shifting from nuclear to conventional propulsion to lower procurement costs. The Navy is considering cost-saving strategies for its ships, such as shifting from nuclear to conventional propulsion, using commercial-like hulls, and employing a common hull design for multiple ship classes. These changes could significantly reduce procurement costs for various Navy vessels. The Navy is considering cost-saving strategies for its ships, such as using commercial-like hulls and a common hull design for multiple ship classes. This approach avoids the cost of designing a new hull for each new class of ship and improves production economies of scale. The strategy can be applied to various ship classes, including destroyers, cruisers, and amphibious ships. Lower-cost ship options presented utilize these approaches. The CSBA report suggests using a common hull design for different types of ships, like the Navy's LPD-17 class amphibious ship. Lower-cost ship options are discussed, which may be less capable than current designs. For example, potential lower-cost options for the Virginia (SSN-774) class nuclear-powered submarine include AIP-equipped non-nuclear-powered submarines and reduced-cost \"Tango Bravo\" nuclear-powered submarines. The report discusses potential lower-cost options for the Virginia (SSN-774) class nuclear-powered submarine, including AIP-equipped non-nuclear-powered submarines and reduced-cost \"Tango Bravo\" nuclear-powered submarines. The Navy plans to maintain a fleet of 313 ships, including 48 SSNs, with procurement averaging about 2.2 boats per year to support the planned force. Consideration is given to shifting to lower-cost designs to prevent a reduction in the SSN force to fewer than 30 boats by 2030. The report discusses lower-cost options for the Virginia class nuclear-powered submarine, including AIP-equipped non-nuclear-powered submarines and reduced-cost \"Tango Bravo\" nuclear-powered submarines. The Navy plans to maintain a fleet of 313 ships, including 48 SSNs, with procurement averaging about 2.2 boats per year. Consideration is given to shifting to lower-cost designs to prevent a reduction in the SSN force to fewer than 30 boats by 2030. The OFT report proposed new ship designs for the Navy, including air-independent propulsion (AIP) submarines to supplement the Virginia-class boats. AIP submarines could be acquired alongside Virginia-class boats, with the possibility of substituting four AIP submarines for one Virginia-class submarine in carrier strike groups. The estimated cost for an AIP submarine is around $600 million to $750 million each, potentially higher for U.S. Navy standards. The Navy is exploring the possibility of acquiring air-independent propulsion (AIP) submarines alongside the Virginia-class boats. The estimated cost for an AIP submarine is around $600 million to $750 million each, potentially higher for U.S. Navy standards. New technologies may allow for the design of a new, less expensive SSN equivalent to the Virginia class under the Tango Bravo program. The Navy and DARPA are pursuing the development of new technologies under the Tango Bravo program to enable design options for a reduced-size submarine with equivalent capability as the Virginia Class design. The focus is on reducing platform infrastructure and production costs, while increasing payload volume by overcoming technology barriers in shaftless propulsion, external weapons, conformal alternatives to existing arrays, and simplifying submarine systems. The Navy and DARPA are working on the Tango Bravo program to develop new technologies for a smaller submarine with Virginia-class capabilities at a lower cost. This includes advancements in shaftless propulsion, external weapons, conformal arrays, and simplified systems to reduce crew workload. The goal is to potentially design a submarine with 75% of the Virginia class procurement cost, allowing for two submarines per year within available resources. This alternative could involve starting design work on a new \"Tango Bravo\" SSN to supplement Virginia-class procurement. Design work on a new \"Tango Bravo\" SSN submarine with capabilities similar to the Virginia-class is being considered as an alternative to procuring AIP submarines. The Navy is exploring options for a lower-cost submarine design, including a medium-sized conventionally powered carrier based on different hull designs. The goal is to have the first Tango Bravo submarine ready for procurement in a few years. The Navy is considering lower-cost options for carriers, including medium-sized conventionally powered carriers based on different hull designs. The current large nuclear-powered aircraft carriers have a full load displacement of about 100,000 tons and can embark an air wing of 75 CTOL airplanes and helicopters. The next aircraft carrier, CVN-78, is estimated to cost $10.5 billion and is part of the new CVN-21 class. The Navy is considering lower-cost options for carriers, including medium-sized conventionally powered carriers based on different hull designs. The next aircraft carrier, CVN-78, is part of the new CVN-21 class with a procurement cost estimated at $10.5 billion. CVN-78 is planned to enter service in 2015, followed by CVN-79 in 2019 and CVN-80 in 2026. Other options include designing a medium-sized carrier based on the LHA-6 design or a commercial-like hull design, as well as a small, high-speed conventionally powered aircraft carrier. The Navy is exploring lower-cost carrier options, including medium-sized conventionally powered carriers based on different hull designs. The CSBA report suggests procuring CVN-21-class carriers to maintain a force of 10 large carriers and acquiring four medium-sized carriers based on the LHA(R) design. These carriers could displace about 40,000 tons, cost around $3 billion each, and carry a VSTOL F-35 JSF air wing. The OFT report recommends a medium-sized carrier based on a commercial-like hull design developed in 2004 for the MPF(F) analysis of alternatives. The OFT report recommends procuring a medium-sized carrier with a full load displacement of about 57,000 tons. It would carry a notional air wing of 36 manned aircraft, including 30 Joint Strike Fighters and 6 MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, along with 15 unmanned air vehicles. The report suggests substituting two of these carriers for each of the Navy's current large carriers to maintain the same number of manned aircraft at sea. Alternatively, a small, high-speed carrier displacing 13,500 tons is also recommended. The OFT report recommended a small, high-speed carrier displacing 13,500 tons with a surface effect ship (SES)/catamaran hull. It would carry a notional air wing of 10 manned aircraft, 8 JSFs, 2 MV-22s, and 8 UAVs, with a maximum speed of 50 to 60 knots. This carrier would be larger than Thailand's 11,500-ton carrier but smaller than Spain's 17,000-ton carrier or the UK's existing 20,600-ton carriers. The OFT report recommended a small, high-speed carrier displacing 13,500 tons with a surface effect ship (SES)/catamaran hull. It would carry a notional air wing of 10 manned aircraft, 8 JSFs, 2 MV-22s, and 8 UAVs, with a maximum speed of 50 to 60 knots. This carrier would be larger than Thailand's 11,500-ton carrier but smaller than Spain's 17,000-ton carrier or the UK's existing 20,600-ton carriers. The report also discussed potential designs for a large, conventionally powered carrier displacing about 100,000 tons, similar to the Kitty Hawk and John F. Kennedy carriers. A medium-sized nuclear-powered carrier based on the LHA(R) hull design might displace about 40,000 tons and cost more than $3 billion. It could embark two dozen VSTOL JSFs and be similar to France's Charles de Gaulle carrier. The Naval War College developed a conceptual design for a small, high-speed VSTOL carrier with a displacement of 4,000 tons, a maximum speed of 60 knots, and an air wing of seven VSTOL JSFs and two helicopters. Ship size, propulsion type, and hull type create a matrix of aircraft carrier options, including large nuclear-powered carriers and potential alternatives. Medium-sized carriers of 40,000 to 70,000 tons could operate VSTOL or CTOL aircraft, while small carriers would likely be limited to VSTOL aircraft. Small carriers, due to their shorter length, would likely be limited to VSTOL aircraft. The Navy procured nine nuclear-powered cruisers between FY1957 and FY1975, ranging from 9,000 to 17,500 tons. There are no examples of ships combining nuclear propulsion with a commercial-like hull. Design options include the 14,500-ton DDG-1000 destroyer/CG(X) cruiser and potential lower-cost options around 11,000 tons. The Navy plans to procure DDG-1000 destroyers and CG(X) cruisers, with the CG(X) based on the DDG-1000 design but larger and more expensive. The first two DDG-1000s will have a full-load displacement of about 14,500 tons, making them larger than any U.S. Navy destroyer or cruiser since the nuclear-powered cruiser Long Beach (CGN-9) in FY1957. The Navy plans to procure DDG-1000 destroyers and CG(X) cruisers, with the CG(X) based on the DDG-1000 design but larger and more expensive. The DDG-1000 would have a full-load displacement of about 14,500 tons, making it larger than any U.S. Navy destroyer or cruiser since the nuclear-powered cruiser Long Beach (CGN-9) in FY1957. The Navy estimates that the first two DDG-1000s would cost about $3.3 billion each, with a total of 7 planned for procurement as part of the proposed 313-ship fleet. The Navy plans to procure a total of 7 DDG-1000 destroyers as part of its proposed 313-ship fleet. Options for a reduced-cost surface combatant include an 11,000-ton cruiser-destroyer, a 6,000-ton frigate, and a lower-cost gunfire support ship based on the LPD-17 amphibious ship hull design. Another option is a new-design ship of about 11,000 tons, which could serve as a replacement for the CG(X) program or both the DDG-1000 and CG(X) programs. The Navy is considering a smaller cruiser-destroyer (SCD) as a replacement for the CG(X) program or both the DDG-1000 and CG(X) programs. The SCD would incorporate advanced technologies, have reduced crew size, lower procurement costs, and carry a payload smaller than the DDG-1000 or CG(X) but larger than current Aegis cruisers or destroyers. It could be land-attack oriented with two Advanced Gun Systems or air- and missile-defense focused with CG(X) radar capabilities. The Navy is considering a smaller cruiser-destroyer (SCD) as a replacement for the CG(X) program or both the DDG-1000 and CG(X) programs. The SCD could carry two Advanced Gun Systems (AGSs) and preserve CG(X) radar capabilities. Another option suggested is a smaller, less expensive frigate called the FFG(X) that might displace about 6,000 tons with a unit procurement cost of about $800 million. The FFG(X) could perform non-gunfire missions and be viewed as a replacement in the surface combatant force. A 6,000-ton FFG(X) could potentially replace the Navy's FFG-7 class frigates and DD-963 class destroyers, offering a middle ground in size. It may be equipped with modern mission equipment and perform non-gunfire missions. Another option is a lower-cost gunfire support ship based on the LPD-17 amphibious ship, potentially carrying one or two AGSs on a modified hull design. A lower-cost gunfire support ship based on the San Antonio (LPD-17) amphibious ship could potentially have one or two AGSs on a modified hull design. The estimated cost for an initial AGS-armed LPD-17 is around $1.9 billion, with subsequent ships costing approximately $1.5 billion each. The Navy's current plan includes procuring 55 Littoral Combat Ships (LCSs) as part of its proposed 313-ship fleet, with each LCS being a small, fast surface combatant using modular weapon systems. The Navy's proposed 313-ship fleet includes 55 Littoral Combat Ships (LCSs), small fast surface combatants with modular weapon systems. The procurement cost of each LCS sea frame is aimed to be $220 million, with an estimated average ship procurement cost of $387 million. An alternative proposed by the OFT report is a 1,000-ton surface combatant with similar capabilities to the LCS. The OFT report recommended procuring a 1,000-ton surface combatant with a maximum speed of 40 to 50 knots and standard interfaces for mission packages. An alternative was a 100-ton surface combatant with a maximum speed of 60 knots. These ships would be supported in theater by larger ships recommended by OFT. The potential lower-cost ship designs can be assessed for cost, capability, technical risk, and impact on the shipbuilding industrial base. The potential lower-cost ship designs can be assessed in terms of cost, capability, technical risk, homeporting arrangements, and impact on the shipbuilding industrial base. Developing and designing a large Navy ship can cost billions of dollars, and switching to a new, lower-cost design could incur substantial additional costs. It may only save money in the long run if the lower-cost design is procured in large numbers to outweigh the upfront development costs. The potential lower-cost ship designs can save money in the long run if procured in large numbers to outweigh upfront development costs. Using similar technologies can reduce the cost of developing a new design through the learning curve process, where shipyard labor hours decrease as workers become more familiar with the design. The cost of building a ship design decreases as shipyard workers become more familiar with it through the learning curve process. If a lower-cost design can be procured at a greater annual rate, it can benefit from spreading fixed overhead costs and achieve cost-reducing benefits more quickly than the currently planned design. The lower-cost ship design can benefit from greater spreading of shipyard's fixed overhead costs and move down the learning curve more quickly, reducing life-cycle O&S costs which can sometimes involve increasing procurement costs. Personnel costs can be reduced by automating functions and reducing crew size. Reducing a ship's life-cycle O&S cost can involve design features that increase procurement cost, such as automating functions to reduce crew size. Maintenance costs may require using more durable materials or increasing space for easier access. Alternative ship designs may have lower procurement costs but higher life-cycle O&S costs. In considering ship design, reducing life-cycle O&S costs may involve features that increase procurement costs, such as automation and easier maintenance access. Nuclear-powered ships have upfront costs for fuel cores, with a core for a submarine costing $158 million and for a carrier costing $300 million, designed to last for a specific portion of the ship's expected life. The upfront cost of a nuclear-powered ship includes a fuel core, costing $158 million for a submarine and $300 million for a carrier. The core is designed to power the ship for a specific portion of its expected life, resulting in no fuel-related O&S costs over the ship's lifetime. This difference in accounting for fuel costs reduces the overall cost difference between nuclear-powered and conventionally powered ships. The cost difference between nuclear-powered and conventionally powered ships is influenced by the price of oil. Higher oil costs make nuclear power more cost-effective. In some cases, the total ownership cost of a nuclear-powered ship could be less than that of a conventionally powered ship, especially if oil prices are high. Nuclear-powered ships have higher end-of-life disposal costs due to the need to defuel and seal the reactor compartment. The end-of-life disposal cost of a nuclear-powered ship is higher due to the need to defuel, cut out, and seal the reactor compartment. This process could cost around $30 million to $35 million for a submarine and roughly $570 million for a carrier. Lower-cost ship designs are generally less capable than higher-cost counterparts, except for the Tango Bravo SSN which may be equal in capability to the Virginia-class design. Factors affecting capability include ship payload, detectability, survivability, mobility, and the value of ship numbers in naval operations. The reduced-cost Tango Bravo SSN, utilizing advanced technologies from the Navy-DARPA program, may match the capability of the Virginia-class design. Ship payload, detectability, survivability, mobility, and ship numbers are key factors in naval operations. As ship size decreases, payload decreases proportionately, impacting overall capability. Propulsion efficiency plays a role, with larger ships requiring less horsepower per ton, allowing for more payload space. As ship size increases, the amount of horsepower needed decreases, leaving more room for payload. A smaller carrier may have a smaller air wing weight compared to a larger carrier, but the larger carrier can generate more sorties per day due to its larger capacity. A larger carrier can generate more sorties per day due to its larger capacity, while reducing ship size can limit equipment capabilities and increase total procurement costs. The total cost of putting combat-related equipment to sea can increase as ship size decreases, leading to higher total procurement costs for a fleet. However, new technologies and precision-guidance technology for weapons can allow for greater payload fraction and reduced weapon size without compromising the ship's capability. Improvements in precision-guidance technology for weapons allow for smaller warheads to do the same damage as larger ones, reducing the need for larger ships. Larger ships may argue they are not more detectable and can withstand hits better than smaller ships. Supporters of larger ships and those built to military survivability standards argue that they are better able to withstand hits from weapons compared to smaller ships or those with commercial-like hulls. On the other hand, proponents of smaller ships argue that larger ships are more costly to make less detectable and that a fleet of smaller ships can overwhelm the enemy's target-tracking capabilities. They also point out that even large ships built for survivability can still be sunk, concentrating too much capability in each individual platform. Supporters of smaller ships argue that a fleet of smaller ships can overwhelm the enemy's target-tracking capabilities and have superior overall fleet survivability. They also suggest that U.S. leaders might be hesitant to risk expensive, highly capable Navy ships in high-threat situations, reducing their effective utility. Nuclear propulsion in submarines fundamentally changes ship mobility and operations. Nuclear propulsion in submarines fundamentally changes ship mobility and operations by providing extended submerged endurance. AIP systems like fuel cells or closed-cycle diesel engines can also enhance the stationary or low-speed submerged endurance of non-nuclear-powered submarines. AIP systems can increase the submerged endurance of non-nuclear-powered submarines, but their high-speed endurance remains limited to 1 to 3 hours due to battery capacity. In contrast, nuclear-powered submarines can stay submerged for weeks or months, with endurance limited by food supply. Non-nuclear submarines are not ideal for long, stealthy transits due to their limited high-speed endurance. A nuclear-powered submarine can stay submerged for extended periods, while non-nuclear submarines, even with AIP systems, have limited high-speed endurance. The OFT report suggests transporting AIP submarines to overseas theaters on a transport ship, acknowledging that their presence may be known. In contrast, an SSN in a carrier strike group can be detached and redirected to another mission without alerting others. The presence of U.S. AIP submarines in a theater of operations may become known to others, while an SSN in a carrier strike group can be detached and redirected to a different theater without alerting opponents. This allows the SSN to operate in two theaters simultaneously, maximizing military effects. The effectiveness of an AIP submarine in a carrier strike group depends on its daily operations and conflict scenarios. Nuclear-powered carriers can make high-speed transits over long distances. Nuclear-powered carriers can make high-speed transits over long distances without the need for refueling, allowing them to commence combat operations immediately upon arrival. This capability also enables them to sustain combat operations for longer periods of time before needing to be resupplied. Advocates of higher-speed ships argue that their increased capability allows for rapid location shifts and makes them harder to track. Advocates of a larger number of lower-cost ships believe it offers more flexibility in maintaining presence in multiple locations or responding to crises. Advocates of a fleet with a larger number of less-capable ships argue for more flexibility in responding to crises and conflicts in multiple locations. They believe that increasing the number of ship nodes will enhance the total capability of the force, especially in light of networking and advanced technologies. On the other hand, defenders of a fleet with a smaller number of more-expensive ships argue for the ability to deploy ships to a greater number of locations. Advocates argue for a shift to less concentrated and more distributed force designs in the U.S. military, emphasizing the importance of flexibility and capability in responding to various situations. They believe that current ship designs already provide adequate flexibility for creating naval formations with appropriate capability levels. Additionally, they argue that a fleet consisting of a smaller number of more-expensive ships would still have enough nodes for engaging in network-centric warfare. Advocates argue for flexibility in naval formations to respond to different situations. Smaller, more expensive ships could still support network-centric warfare. Lower-cost options with technical risks include AIP-equipped non-nuclear-powered submarines, Tango Bravo nuclear-powered submarines, 13,500-ton high-speed carriers, and smaller surface combatants with new technologies. Smaller ships offer more homeporting options due to size constraints in some ports. The potential challenges of homeporting nuclear-powered Navy ships in foreign countries include access to nuclear-certified maintenance shops and political difficulties due to anti-nuclear sentiments. Lower-cost ship designs could impact the Navy shipbuilding industrial base by changing the total volume of work or distribution among shipyards based on available funding. Lower-cost ship designs could impact the Navy shipbuilding industrial base by changing the total volume of work or distribution among shipyards based on available funding. Shifting to lower-cost designs may not affect the total funding for Navy ship procurement, leading to no substantial change in shipbuilding work volume. Alternatively, it could reduce the total volume of work by building the same number of ships at a lower cost or make Navy ships more cost-effective compared to other programs. The shift to lower-cost ship designs could impact the Navy shipbuilding industrial base by changing the distribution of work among shipyards. For example, a Tango Bravo nuclear-powered submarine could be designed and built by General Dynamics' Electric Boat (GD/EB) and Northrop Grumman Newport News (NGNN). This could potentially alter the current division of work between the two shipyards for building Virginia-class submarines. General Dynamics' Electric Boat (GD/EB) and Northrop Grumman Newport News (NGNN) are involved in building submarines. AIP-equipped non-nuclear powered submarines could be built by these shipyards or by non-nuclear shipyards like Ingalls at Pascagoula, MS. Procuring AIP submarines instead of nuclear-powered ones may reduce work for U.S. naval nuclear propulsion component manufacturers. NGNN is the only U.S. yard capable of building large nuclear-powered carriers. NGNN is the only U.S. yard capable of building large nuclear-powered carriers, while other shipyards like Ingalls could potentially build medium-sized conventionally powered carriers. Avondale shipyard and GD/NASSCO could also be options for building conventionally powered carriers. Small, high-speed carriers using SES/catamaran hull design could be built at various yards with experience in building such hulls. If conventionally powered carriers are procured instead of nuclear-powered ones, it could reduce work for U.S. naval nuclear propulsion component manufacturers. A small, high-speed carrier using an SES/catamaran hull design could be built at various yards with experience in such hulls. Procuring conventionally powered carriers instead of nuclear-powered ones may reduce work for U.S. naval nuclear propulsion component manufacturers. DDG-1000 destroyers are to be built at NGSS and General Dynamics' Bath Iron Works, while a 11,000-ton SCD, a 6,000-ton FFG(X), or a low-cost gunfire support ship could also be built at these yards or others like Avondale or NGNN. Smaller surface combatants are also being considered for construction. The construction of various naval vessels, including a 11,000-ton SCD, a 6,000-ton FFG(X), and a low-cost gunfire support ship, is likely to be undertaken at yards like NGSS and GD/BIW. Smaller surface combatants, such as versions of the LCS, are planned to be built at different shipyards like Marinette Marine, Bollinger Shipyards, and Austal USA. Sections 122, 123, and 124 of H.R. 5122 aim to limit procurement costs for CVN-21 class aircraft carriers, LHA(R) class ships, and LPD-17 class ships. Additionally, a shipbuilding industrial base improvement program is proposed in Section 1014. The House Armed Services Committee expressed concerns about rising costs and production delays in major defense acquisition programs, leading to fewer platforms being fielded. They warned against an over-reliance on expensive \"mega\" systems, which could limit the number of platforms purchased and strain military personnel. This situation could impact traditional presence missions and strategic depth. The House Armed Services Committee is concerned about rising costs and production delays in defense acquisition programs, leading to fewer platforms being fielded. This could result in a ''high demand, low density'' situation, impacting traditional presence missions and strategic depth. The Navy's shipbuilding plan is praised for providing a long-term view but is criticized for unrealistic assumptions and affordability concerns. The House Armed Services Committee is concerned about the Navy's shipbuilding plan, which was developed using unrealistic assumptions and faces affordability challenges. The plan requires a significant increase in shipbuilding funds and assumes that ship acquisition programs can avoid cost growth. The committee is worried about the long-term affordability of the plan and the excess capacity in the U.S. shipbuilding/ship repair industrial base. The House Armed Services Committee is concerned about the Navy's shipbuilding plan, which faces affordability challenges due to unrealistic assumptions and excess capacity in the U.S. shipbuilding/ship repair industrial base. The committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to report on managing capacity to make Navy shipbuilding more affordable. The committee is also worried about the accuracy of the Navy's ship cost estimates. The committee is concerned about the Navy's ship cost estimates, which have been described as inaccurate and unrealistic for existing ship classes. They recommend revising the process to include all major known elements of ship cost. Additionally, the committee notes that cost limitations are being imposed on three current ship classes based on the Navy's latest cost estimates, emphasizing the need for confidence in these estimates. The Secretary of the Navy is directed to revalidate the cost estimates. The committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to revalidate cost estimates for CVN-21, LHA Replacement program ships, and San Antonio class amphibious ships. The revalidated estimates must be reviewed and approved by the Under Secretary of Defense. A report with certified cost estimates must be submitted by July 1, 2006. The committee does not find the DD(X) program affordable. The Navy submitted a report to Congress with revalidated cost estimates for ship classes, including the DDG-1000 program. The committee does not believe the DD(X) program is affordable and doubts the ability to design and build the lead ships within budget. Originally proposing 32 destroyers, the Navy reduced it to 7 to make it more affordable, but the committee questions if the original requirements can be met. They suggest reducing requirements to procure a smaller, less expensive destroyer in greater numbers. The committee does not believe the DD(X) will be procured in sufficient numbers to meet operational needs. They support building up to two DD(X)s to demonstrate future technologies. The committee doubts the affordability of the DD(X) program and questions if the original requirements can be met. They suggest reducing requirements to procure a smaller, less expensive destroyer in greater numbers. The committee does not believe the DD(X) will be procured in sufficient numbers to meet operational needs. They support building up to two DD(X)s to demonstrate future technologies. The committee supports measures to improve the efficiency of Navy shipbuilding, including the maritime technology program aimed at reducing the cost of naval ship construction. The committee supports measures to enhance the efficiency and competitiveness of the U.S. shipbuilding industry, including incentives for cost reduction in ship procurement programs. They propose a shipbuilding industrial base improvement program to award grants and loan guarantees to qualified shipyards for productivity and cost effectiveness improvements. The committee recommends a shipbuilding industrial base improvement program to award grants and loan guarantees to qualified shipyards for productivity and cost effectiveness improvements. They also recommend funds for the maritime technology program and the national shipbuilding research program. The committee recommends $20.0 million in PE 78730N for the national shipbuilding research program, which operates on a 50-50 cost share between government and industry. They also recommend providing grants to U.S. shipyards for innovative design and efficiency improvements. The committee recommends $50.0 million in PE 78730N for shipbuilding industrial base improvement grants to support U.S. shipyards in developing innovative technologies and infrastructure for naval vessel construction. Additionally, they recommend providing loan guarantees to enhance the efficiency and competitiveness of the shipbuilding industry. The committee recommends providing loan guarantees to U.S. shipyards for acquiring technologies and infrastructure to improve efficiency and competitiveness in shipbuilding and repair industries. Additionally, Section 121 of S. 2766 authorizes incremental funding for aircraft carriers to address cost limits and procurement issues. The Senate Armed Services Committee emphasizes the importance of stable ship requirements and increased funding to prevent a downward spiral in shipbuilding rates. The Senate committee report on S. 2766 highlighted concerns about the low shipbuilding rate driving up costs and urged for stable ship requirements, increased funding, and flexibility in funding large capital ships to reverse the trend. The committee also expressed worries about cost growth in the CVN-77 program and recommended measures to improve affordability for future aircraft carriers. The shipbuilder proposed savings through a stable procurement plan and procurement of economic order quantity material for future carriers. The committee recommended a $50.0 million increase in funding. The shipbuilder proposed savings through a stable procurement plan and procurement of economic order quantity material for future carriers. The committee recommended a $50.0 million increase in funding for CVN-21 class advance procurement, with a directive for the Secretary of the Navy to review economic order quantity and long lead time material procurement for the CVN-21 class. The report discusses the cost increase for CVN-77 to $6.057 billion due to various factors. The Navy has implemented management actions to contain costs, but projections still show an increase in CVN-77 costs. The Navy has implemented management actions to control costs for CVN-77, including deferral of non-essential upgrades, minimizing contract change orders, and implementing a Lean Six-Sigma program. Despite these efforts, the Navy projects CVN-77 costs to exceed the baseline cost cap by over 30%. The Secretary of the Navy is directed to provide quarterly reports to Congress on cost performance to assess the effectiveness of these actions and improve affordability for future naval vessels. The Secretary of the Navy is directed to submit quarterly reports to Congress on the cost performance of the CVN-77 ship construction contract, including contract target cost, Program Manager's Estimate at Completion, contractor's Estimate at Completion, contract ceiling price, end of period actual costs, and percent progress. The report also highlights cost risks in the construction of lead LCS vessels and emphasizes the importance of cost control through competition, commonality, and learning curves in the procurement of this ship class. The committee emphasizes cost control through competition, commonality, and learning curves in the procurement of the LCS ship class. They view LCS as crucial for the Navy's global war on terror strategy but are concerned about apparent cost growth and lack of a clear acquisition strategy. Management of program risk is crucial to ensure affordable full mission capability. The rapid ramp-up in LCS procurement may compound cost issues, and added costs for training, maintenance, and supply support need to be assessed for the two flight 0 ship classes. The Navy's emphasis on affordability is hindered by the lack of a clear acquisition strategy for the LCS program. Concerns include the added costs for training, maintenance, and supply support for the two flight 0 ship classes. The committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to submit a report outlining the acquisition strategy, competition plan, and cost containment strategy for the program by December 1, 2006. Additionally, shipyard costs and efficiency are highlighted in the report. The report highlights the need for a clear acquisition strategy, competition plan, and cost containment strategy for the LCS program. It also emphasizes the importance of funding maritime technology through the NSRP-ASE to reduce shipbuilding costs and maintain a healthy industrial base. The committee recommends an increase of $10.0 million in funding to support NSRP-ASE efforts. The committee recommends increasing funding by $10.0 million for the NSRP-ASE to support efforts in developing a skilled shipbuilding workforce, establishing a national supply chain, exploring new markets for shipbuilders, and improving computer interoperability. Additionally, Section 121 of H.R. 5122 authorizes incremental funding for CVN-21 class aircraft carriers. Section 121 of H.R. 5122 authorizes incremental funding for CVN-21 class aircraft carriers, establishing unit procurement cost caps for various types of ships, and directing the Navy to assess naval vessel construction efficiencies and contractor incentives. The Navy is conducting an assessment of naval vessel construction efficiencies and contractor incentives. New procurement cost caps can be adjusted for inflation. The Secretary must report any negative impact of congressional actions on program costs. The CVN-21 class budget represents the Navy's assessment of future aircraft carrier costs. The CVN-21 class budget reflects the Navy's cost assessment for future aircraft carriers, with adjustments allowed for design and engineering costs to manage risks. Trade-offs may be necessary to stay within budget, impacting capabilities and other factors in construction. The Secretary must notify of any significant changes in program costs due to congressional actions. The Secretary must notify Congress of any cost-driven reductions that could impact safety, crew quality of life, or meeting the requirements of the CVN-21 Operational Requirements Document. The amendment does not allow the Secretary to adjust limitation amounts for cost increases due to congressional actions affecting the shipbuilding program. The report states that the amendment does not give the Secretary authority to adjust limitation amounts for cost increases due to congressional actions impacting the shipbuilding program. However, the Secretary is directed to assess any negative impact of congressional actions on program costs in the annual notice to Congress. The amendment allows for adjustments to cost limitations for non-recurring design and engineering to reduce risk in the LHA-6 program. The amendment allows for adjustments to cost limitations for non-recurring design and engineering in the LHA-6 program to reduce risk. The Navy is expected to manage program execution within budget estimates, with potential trade-offs in capabilities, system performance, and crew quality of life. The Secretary must notify Congress before implementing any cost-driven reductions that could impact safety or program requirements. The Secretary must notify Congress before implementing any cost-driven reductions that could impact safety, crew quality of life, or program requirements. The House Appropriations Committee emphasizes the importance of cost control in the Navy's long-range shipbuilding plan, noting a lack of initiatives to meet cost targets and a concerning trend of cost growth in ongoing shipbuilding programs. The Navy lacks a plan or initiatives to meet cost targets in shipbuilding programs, with ongoing programs showing a trend of cost growth. The Committee urges the Navy to set firm cost targets, develop cost control initiatives, and sign contracts to reduce cost growth. The report recommends reducing funding by $141.4 million for FY2007 procurement to cover cost growth on prior ships. The Committee remains concerned about the lack of cost control in Navy shipbuilding programs. The Committee expressed concerns about the Navy's ongoing ship construction contracts, noting a lack of firm cost controls and significant cost overruns. Specific programs like the CVN-77 aircraft carrier and Virginia class attack submarines continue to exceed cost estimates. The Navy estimates an $867.9 million overrun in the CVN-77 production alone. Congressional legislation may be needed to raise cost caps. Additionally, cost performance on the U.S.S. Texas and U.S.S. North Carolina submarines is below expectations. The Committee is concerned about cost overruns in Navy ship construction contracts, particularly with the CVN-77 aircraft carrier and Virginia class submarines. Congressional legislation may be necessary to raise cost caps. The fiscal year 2007 budget requests $136 million for the U.S.S. Texas and cost performance on the U.S.S. North Carolina is below Navy expectations. The Committee is unwilling to provide increased appropriations for cost overruns without compelling justification or a detailed cost control plan. The recommendation provides $436 million for Completion of Prior Year Shipbuilding Programs, with reductions allocated to various programs. The reduction of $141.4 million from the shipbuilding programs should be allocated to specific programs. Increasing annual ship-procurement funding to $14.4 billion per year may be challenging due to finite defense funding. The Navy has been working on operating more efficiently to save costs, but these savings have been offset by rising costs in other areas. Increasing funding for Navy ship procurement could require reducing funding for other Navy or DOD priorities. The Navy has been striving to operate more efficiently to save costs, but rising costs in other areas have offset these savings. Possible options to address this issue include modifying the funding structure for new Navy ships and utilizing multiyear procurement contracts. These changes could potentially increase the number of ships procured within a given budget, but may also raise concerns regarding Congress's oversight and funding responsibilities. One option to address Navy ship procurement costs is to consider using multiyear procurement contracts, which could potentially increase the number of ships procured within a given budget. Another option is to change the acquisition strategy for building certain Navy ships, such as consolidating construction at a single yard to reduce costs. However, these changes may impact Congress's oversight and funding responsibilities. Shifting to a single-yard acquisition strategy for building DDG-1000 destroyers could save $3 billion for 10 ships, but may eliminate competition and innovation in design. Increasing competition in Navy ship acquisition could help control costs and improve production quality. Increasing competition in Navy ship acquisition by awarding contracts for building follow-on ships in each class could lead to cost savings and improved production quality. This approach would require a high annual procurement rate or a willingness for shipyards to permanently withdraw from building certain types of ships. Another option is to reduce shipyard fixed overhead costs to lower procurement costs. One option to reduce shipyard fixed overhead costs is to eliminate excess capacity or increase other types of work to absorb costs. This could include building ships for other government agencies or commercial purposes. Another option is to improve operating efficiency through advanced design and production processes. The National Shipbuilding Research Program (NSRP) Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise (ASE) aims to improve the operating efficiency of shipyards building Navy ships. One option is to build Navy ships without some planned equipment to reduce costs, with the possibility of adding it back later. Building a ship without some planned equipment could reduce its capabilities, but the equipment could be added later at a higher cost. Building ships in foreign shipyards may lower construction costs due to factors like lower wages and material prices. The provision in 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 7309 prohibits the construction of Navy ships in foreign shipyards, except for certain exceptions authorized by the President in the interest of national security. The annual DOD appropriations act also includes provisions for Navy shipbuilding, ensuring that funds are available for construction in domestic shipyards. The annual DOD appropriations act, under U.S.C. \u00a7 7309, prohibits the use of funds for Navy shipbuilding in foreign facilities. A recent report by the RAND Corporation discusses the increasing cost of Navy ships and suggests ways to reduce costs."
