    "content": "The most recent multi-year authorization for federal surface transportation programs, SAFETEA-LU, expired in 2009. Since then, programs have operated on extensions due to constrained financial resources. The highway trust fund, funded by gasoline and diesel taxes, has declined, leading to debates on passing a bill without cutting spending, raising taxes, or increasing the deficit. Alternative finance and tolling are also key issues in the ongoing debate. The debate on passing a multi-year bill for federal surface transportation programs without cutting spending, raising taxes, or increasing the deficit continues. Other issues being discussed include alternative finance, tolling, public-private partnerships, project delivery acceleration, and performance management. The question of equity in federal spending distribution among states remains unresolved due to forecasted revenue constraints. The Senate passed MAP-21 in 2012 to reauthorize surface transportation programs for two years. The Senate passed MAP-21 in 2012, reauthorizing surface transportation programs for two years. The House committees reported favorably on H.R. 7, a five-year bill with a total authorization of $260 billion, linking transportation reauthorization with provisions for oil and gas production. Both bills reduce programs by two-thirds and do not have earmarks. The House passed the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2012, Part II (H.R. 4348) to extend surface transportation authorizations through the end of FY2012. It includes provisions for the Keystone XL Pipeline, Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund, Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund guarantee, Coal Residuals Reuse and Management Act, and environmental streamlining from H.R. 7. The Senate later replaced this language with MAP-21, leading to a conference between the House and Senate. The Senate replaced the House-passed language from H.R. 4348 with MAP-21, enabling a conference between the two chambers. Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman John Mica plans to negotiate the entire substance of H.R. 7 in the conference. Surface transportation reauthorization involves multiple committees and funding sources, with the highway trust fund primarily financed by excise taxes on motor fuels. The highway trust fund is primarily financed by excise taxes on motor fuels, with 90% of revenue coming from gasoline and diesel taxes. The fund consists of separate accounts for highways and mass transit, with fuel tax rates last raised in 1993. Due to economic factors and improved fuel efficiency, fuel tax revenues have fallen below projections, requiring transfers from the general fund to cover expenses. The economic downturn since 2007 and increased vehicle fuel efficiency have led to a decrease in fuel tax revenues, causing a shortfall in the highway trust fund. The Congressional Budget Office projects a shortfall of $4.6 billion by the end of FY2013, with a gap of $8-9 billion per year through FY2022. The mass transit account is also facing deficits, with a projected shortfall of $1.2 billion by the end of FY2014. This poses challenges for reauthorization legislation. The mass transit account, which received a $4.8 billion general fund transfer in FY2010, will remain above zero through FY2013 but then fall to a negative $1.2 billion shortfall by the end of FY2014. Without an increase in fuel taxes, the fuel-based trust fund taxation system will not be able to support existing or increased surface transportation spending. Policymakers face the choice of finding new revenue sources for transportation or settling for a smaller program. The Federal-Aid Highway Program is primarily state-run, with state DOTs determining where money is spent while complying with federal planning guidelines. The Highway Program, administered by FHWA, is primarily state-run with state DOTs determining spending and complying with federal guidelines. Projects require a state/local matching share, with Interstate System projects at 10% and other roads at 20%. FHWA manages fund distribution through notifications, apportionment, and allocation. States do not receive federal money upfront for highway projects. The FHWA manages fund distribution through notifications, apportionment, allocation, and reimbursement for highway projects. Contract authority allows for obligation without an appropriation, and limitation on obligations controls annual spending. The FHWA manages fund distribution through notifications, apportionment, allocation, and reimbursement for highway projects. Contract authority allows for obligation without an appropriation, and limitation on obligations controls annual spending. Obligation of contract authority legally commits the federal government to reimburse the state for the federal share of a project. The ObLim sets a limit on the total amount of contract authority that can be obligated in a single fiscal year. Formula programs are apportioned annually among states, while discretionary programs are allocated by FHWA or earmarked by Congress. The majority of federal-aid highway money is apportioned to state DOTs through large formula-driven programs. Under SAFETEA, federal-aid highway money is apportioned to state DOTs through core formula programs like IM, NHS, STP, HBP, CMAQ, HSIP, and EB. Each program has its own formula factors, and states can transfer funds between programs. The Equity Bonus Program guarantees each state a minimum share of funds, regardless of funding formulas. States have flexibility to transfer funds between programs, reducing the importance of funding formulas. Some state DOTs feel restricted by the programmatic structure in using federal highway funds as they see fit. The Equity Bonus Program ensures states receive a minimum share of funds, regardless of formulas. Smaller discretionary highway programs are part of the Federal-Aid Highway Program, with funding earmarked by Congress during SAFETEA. The federal transit program consists of various individual programs with different funding mechanisms. The federal transit program, administered by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) in the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), consists of individual programs with different funding amounts and distributional mechanisms. There are four main federal transit programs in SAFETEA, which account for 85% of authorized transit funding. Funding in two programs, the Urbanized Area Formula Program and the Fixed Guideway Modernization Program, is distributed by formula. The Urbanized Area Formula Program provides funding to urbanized areas with populations of 50,000 or more, while the Fixed Guideway Modernization Program funds mainly go towards the replacement and rehabilitation of transit rail system assets. Funds from the federal transit program can be used for various expenses in urbanized areas with populations up to 200,000. The Fixed Guideway Modernization Program focuses on replacing and rehabilitating transit rail system assets. The New Starts Program and Bus Program are discretionary programs, with New Starts funding primarily for new fixed guideway systems and extensions. A \"Small Starts\" program was enacted to fund projects with a total cost of $250 million or less. Bus Program funds are used to purchase buses and related equipment. The Small Starts program in SAFETEA funds projects with a total cost of $250 million or less, with a federal share of $75 million or less. Bus Program funds are used to purchase buses and bus-related equipment. Other smaller funding programs account for the remaining 15% of transit program funds. Highway transportation is the leading cause of transportation-related fatalities and injuries in the United States, primarily the responsibility of the states. Highway safety programs authorized in SAFETEA assist states in improving highway safety. Three DOT agencies administer these programs: NHTSA focuses on driver behavior and vehicle safety, FMCSA on commercial driver qualifications and vehicle safety, and FHWA on roadway design safety. NHTSA provides grants to states, regulates motor vehicle safety, and conducts research on traffic safety. NHTSA provides grants to states for traffic safety efforts, regulates vehicle safety, and oversees federal grant fund usage. States must submit approved highway safety plans to receive funds, identifying safety issues, setting goals, and establishing performance measures. NHTSA offers training and assistance, funding programs to improve data collection, reduce speeding, increase seat belt use, combat drunk driving, and enhance motorcycle safety. The Safety Program, including the Section 402 program, supports state efforts to improve traffic safety by reducing speeding, increasing seat belt use, combating drunk and drugged driving, reducing motorcycle and school bus crashes, and discouraging unsafe driving behavior. FMCSA promotes commercial motor vehicle safety through regulation, enforcement, training, and grants for truck and motor coach operations. HSIP aims to reduce traffic fatalities and injuries by improving road design and operation, with funding allocated to states based on road lane-miles, vehicle miles traveled, and traffic fatalities. The HSIP program aims to reduce traffic fatalities and injuries by improving road design and operation. Each state receives funding based on road lane-miles, vehicle miles traveled, and traffic fatalities. SAFETEA guarantees certain annual funding levels for highway and mass transit projects. SAFETEA established budget firewalls to protect highway and mass transit funds from being used elsewhere. It guaranteed annual funding levels for FY2005 through FY2009 and prevented lower funding levels from being set. The guarantees were later removed, allowing for potential adjustments in funding levels based on annual receipts. In the 112th Congress, the House removed the last guarantee of funding levels for highways. The RABA mechanism adjusts funding levels based on annual receipts, but Congress has never cut spending despite revenue falling below guarantees. The Budget Control Act requires sequestration if spending reductions aren't agreed upon, with exemptions available. Consideration of mechanisms to align spending with receipts may still be on the table. The Budget Control Act requires sequestration of certain funding authorizations if a special joint committee fails to reach an agreement on spending reductions. Exemptions under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 suggest that sequestration may not significantly reduce surface transportation spending beyond FY2012. Exempted programs include Federal-Aid Highways, Highway Traffic Safety Grants, NHTSA operations, Motor Carrier Safety Programs, and Transit Formula and Bus Grants. Annual contract authority of $739 million may be subject to sequester. The Budget Control Act requires sequestration of certain funding authorizations if a special joint committee fails to reach an agreement on spending reductions. Exemptions under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 suggest that sequestration may not significantly reduce surface transportation spending beyond FY2012. The $739 million of annual contract authority that is typically exempt from the obligation limitation appears to be subject to sequester. SAFETEA expired on September 30, 2009, and surface transportation programs have been operating on extension legislation. The House-passed STEA-II is an authorization extension of the HTF and federal surface transportation programs through September 30, 2012. The Senate agreed to substitute the full text of MAP-21, enabling the measure to go to conference. The Senate agreed to substitute the full text of MAP-21 for the House-passed language, enabling the measure to go to conference. Negotiations will involve the entire substance of H.R. 7, with provisions in conference proposals falling within the \"scope of the differences\" between the House and Senate versions. Members may raise issues on what is within the allowable scope for conference on H.R. 4348, with conference reports containing out-of-scope provisions subject to points of order in both the House and Senate. The conference on H.R. 4348 will involve negotiations on the entire substance of the bill, with provisions falling within the \"scope of the differences\" between the House and Senate versions. Members may raise issues on allowable scope for conference, with out-of-scope provisions subject to points of order in both chambers. The proposed STEA-II includes provisions unrelated to surface transportation programs, such as the North American Energy Access Act and the transfer of permitting authority for the Keystone XL pipeline. The Energy Access Act (H.R. 3548) transfers permitting authority for the Keystone XL pipeline to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, requiring a permit within 30 days. It establishes the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund financed by penalties from the Deepwater Horizon incident, distributing funds to Gulf Coast states, restoration council, and research. The Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund, funded by penalties from the Deepwater Horizon incident, distributes revenues to Gulf Coast states, restoration council, and research. H.R. 4348 requires a future act of Congress for revenue distribution, unlike S. 1400. Title V includes the Coal Residuals Reuse and Management Act, amending the Solid Waste Disposal Act for coal combustion residuals permit programs. Title VI incorporates Title III of H.R. 7 for accelerating transportation project delivery. Title V of H.R. 4348 adds the Coal Residuals Reuse and Management Act to authorize states to implement coal combustion residuals permit programs. Title VI includes provisions from H.R. 7 for expediting transportation project delivery. Both House and Senate bills aim to accelerate project delivery, reduce highway programs, and make changes to funding distribution. MAP-21 reauthorizes the Federal-Aid Highway Program with $39.5 billion for FY2012 and $40.5 billion for FY2013, along with $400 million for research and education each fiscal year. The MAP-21 reauthorization of the Federal-Aid Highway Program includes a total authorization of $39.5 billion for FY2012 and $40.5 billion for FY2013, along with $400 million for research and education each fiscal year. It eliminates formula factors and apportions funds to states based on their previous allocations. This change reduces congressional influence on project selection and direction. The MAP-21 reauthorization of the Federal-Aid Highway Program reduces congressional influence on project selection by eliminating program formulas and congressional designation of projects. National interests and needs are driven by federal planning, performance management, and project eligibility requirements. The number of programs is reduced by two-thirds, with transferability restricted to 20% of each formula program's apportionment. Discretionary grant programs under FHWA control are mostly eliminated, with the Transportation Enhancements Program rolled into the CMAQ program. Some controversial TE uses are eliminated, and states can use TE funds for non-TE CMAQ uses after building up an unspent balance. The Transportation Enhancements Program (TE) is merged into the CMAQ program, allowing states to use TE funds for non-TE CMAQ uses after building up an unspent balance. The bill also introduces a National Freight Program (NFP) to increase funding for freight projects and significantly boosts funding for the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) program. However, the bill does not address tolling of federally funded roads and bridges. The House bill proposes modest increases for federal-aid highways and allocates funds for research and education. The House bill proposes modest increases for federal-aid highways from $40.4 billion in FY2013 to $41.0 billion in FY2016, with additional funding for research and education. The bill would fold existing programs into the National Highway System and Surface Transportation Programs, reducing the number of distinct programs by about two-thirds. The Equity Bonus program would guarantee a 94% state rate of return on payments to the Highway Trust Fund, and the Mass Transit Account would be renamed the Alternative Transportation Account, providing funding for both mass transit and highway programs. The House bill proposes renaming the Mass Transit Account to the Alternative Transportation Account, redirecting fuel taxes to the Highway Account, and changing NEPA requirements for federal highway and transit projects. It would increase TIFIA funding and fund the Federal Transit Administration at current levels. The HTF would provide 79.9% of funding, with the general fund providing 20.1%. MAP-21 provisions include $10.458 billion annually for transit programs and the creation of the State of Good Repair program. The House bill proposes renaming the Mass Transit Account to the Alternative Transportation Account, redirecting fuel taxes to the Highway Account, and changing NEPA requirements for federal highway and transit projects. It would increase TIFIA funding and fund the Federal Transit Administration at current levels. The HTF would provide 79.9% of funding, with the general fund providing 20.1%. MAP-21 provisions include $10.458 billion annually for transit programs and the creation of the State of Good Repair program. Funding for the Bus and Bus Facilities program would be set aside from the New Starts program. H.R. 7 provisions include renaming the Mass Transit Account to the Alternative Transportation Account, redirecting fuel taxes to the Highway Account, and transferring $40 billion from the general fund to the ATA. It eliminates various grant programs, combines others into a single program, and distributes funding for the Bus and Bus-related Facilities Program by formula. MAP-21 includes provisions for a national rail plan, a rolling stock equipment pool for corridor intercity passenger services, and positive train control implementation. It also amends the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing Program to accept state or local subsidies as collateral. The bill includes provisions for a rolling stock equipment pool for corridor intercity passenger services and positive train control implementation. It also amends the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing Program to accept state or local subsidies as collateral. The bill aims to close the gap between projected revenues and total authorizations, with provisions to raise revenue and provide offsets for the Highway Trust Fund. The bill includes provisions to raise revenue for the Highway Trust Fund, totaling $13.872 billion over ten-and-a-half fiscal years. This includes transfers from various sources such as the Leaking Underground Storage Tank trust fund, Gas Guzzler Tax, revocation of passports for tax delinquents, and future import tariffs on automotive products. The bill includes provisions to raise $13.872 billion for the Highway Trust Fund over ten-and-a-half fiscal years. This includes transfers from various sources such as future import tariffs on automotive products, changes in tax treatment of securities, pension funding stabilization, and other revenue-generating measures. The bill includes provisions to raise $13.872 billion for the Highway Trust Fund over ten-and-a-half fiscal years. This includes transfers from various sources such as future import tariffs on automotive products, changes in tax treatment of securities, pension funding stabilization, and other revenue-generating measures. Offsets and revenue provisions have raised comments as they exceed the needed amount to offset the HTF revenue and MAP-21 spending levels, providing an opportunity for deficit reduction or additional spending. The Finance Committee reported favorably on provisions costing money, including changes to the Small Issuer Exception, tax treatment of bonds, employer-provided benefits, and the Sustainable Water Infrastructure Act. The Senate bill also includes a provision for states to issue TRIP bonds for transportation and regional infrastructure. The Senate bill includes provisions for TRIP bonds for transportation and regional infrastructure, as well as changes to the depreciation period for long-term highway leases. This may impact the attractiveness of highway privatization to private-sector investors. The bill also addresses the amortization period for the franchise right to collect tolls. The bill proposes changes to the amortization period for the franchise right to collect tolls, ensuring it is not less than the lease term or 15 years. It also establishes a \"solvency account\" to transfer excess funds to the Highway Trust Fund and Mass Transit Account. The Senate bill may utilize the LUST trust fund for funding. The Senate bill proposes using the LUST trust fund as a new revenue source for the highway trust fund, which was established in 1986 to address groundwater contamination from leaking underground storage tanks. Annual appropriations from the fund support environmental cleanup programs and leak prevention efforts. States historically used the fund to oversee corrective actions by responsible parties. The LUST trust fund, established in 1986, supports environmental cleanup programs and leak prevention efforts for leaking underground storage tanks. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 expanded state and EPA responsibilities, allowing trust fund monies to be used for federal UST leak prevention and detection programs. Over 413,000 out of 501,000 reported releases have been addressed, with 88,000 releases still requiring cleanup. The fund had an unobligated balance of $3.392 billion in FY2012, with estimated interest payments of $117 million and tax receipts of $181 million. In FY2012, the LUST trust fund had an unobligated balance of $3.392 billion. Congress has appropriated approximately $113 million annually from the fund, with states receiving a minimum of 80% as grants. A Senate bill proposes transferring $3.0 billion from the LUST trust fund to the highway trust fund in FY2012, along with future transfers from gasoline and diesel fuel taxes. The Senate bill proposes transferring $3.0 billion from the LUST trust fund to the highway trust fund in FY2012. Future transfers from gasoline and diesel fuel taxes are also included, with projected annual transfers ranging from $62 million to $67 million. The bill extends the LUST trust fund expenditure authority through September 30, 2013, and reauthorizes HTF expenditure authority through FY2016. Highway taxes, including motor fuel taxes, would be extended through FY2018. H.R. 7, introduced by the Committee on Ways and Means on February 9, 2012, aims to reauthorize HTF expenditure authority through FY2016 and extend existing highway taxes, including motor fuel taxes, through FY2018. The bill includes provisions for future transfers from the general fund to the HTF to be fully offset. It seeks to fill gaps in revenue increases or offsets, including $40 billion for the proposed alternative transportation account. Unlike the Senate bill, H.R. 7 does not allocate balances or revenues from the LUST trust fund to the Highway Trust Fund. H.R. 7 aims to reauthorize HTF expenditure authority through FY2016 and extend existing highway taxes. It includes provisions for future transfers from the general fund to the HTF to be fully offset. Section 15002(c) would extend the LUST trust fund until October 1, 2016. The bill originally sought to direct federal revenues from energy leasing into the highway account of the Highway Trust Fund. The House approved energy leasing provisions separately, with the statutory basis for offshore energy development being the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act administers offshore energy development, allowing leasing for oil and gas resources with upfront payments, rentals, and royalties. Federal receipts from offshore oil and gas totaled $6.5 billion in FY2011. Current law allocates receipts to various programs, including the Land and Water Conservation Fund and the National Historic Preservation Fund. H.R. 7 renames the mass transit account to the alternative transportation account. H.R. 7 renames the mass transit account to the alternative transportation account and provides a one-time appropriation of $40 billion. It transfers motor fuels taxes to the highway account and proposes total authorizations of $80.8 billion over two years. The Senate bill does not reinstate funding firewalls or spending guarantees, and eliminates the Equity Bonus Program. The Senate bill, known as MAP-21, proposes total authorizations of $80.8 billion over two years, with $39.9 billion for FY2012 and $40.9 billion for FY2013 under the Highway and Research titles. It eliminates the Equity Bonus Program and includes a provision called the \"ratchet mechanism\" to ensure the solvency of the highway account of the HTF. This mechanism requires adjustments to the distribution of funds if the account balance is projected to fall below certain levels. The Senate bill MAP-21 proposes $80.8 billion in total authorizations over two years, with $39.9 billion for FY2012 and $40.9 billion for FY2013. It includes a \"ratchet mechanism\" to prevent a shortfall in the Highway Trust Fund, requiring adjustments to fund distribution if the balance is projected to drop below certain levels. This provision aims to keep spending within the means of the HTF and may lead to the identification of additional revenue options. The mechanism could face resistance in Congress due to past negative adjustments in funding levels. H.R. 7 proposes a total federal-aid highway program authorization of $205 billion over five years, with obligation limitations for FY2013-FY2016. Some programs would be funded from an Alternative Transportation Account, providing an additional $2.7 billion annually. The bill does not include spending guarantee mechanisms like SAFETEA. H.R. 7 proposes a total federal-aid highway program authorization of $205 billion over five years, with additional funding from an Alternative Transportation Account of $2.7 billion annually. The bill includes a modified Equity Bonus Program and funding for various highway programs, as well as allowing expanded tolling of the Interstate system. The House bill proposes a $205 billion federal-aid highway program authorization over five years, with additional funding from an Alternative Transportation Account of $2.7 billion annually. It allows expanded tolling of the Interstate system and does not include earmarks. MAP-21 determines state apportionments for major programs using a single methodology based on each state's share of total nationwide apportionments and allocations received for FY2005-FY2009. The methodology for determining state apportionments for major programs under MAP-21 involves calculating initial amounts based on each state's share of total nationwide apportionments and adjusting them to ensure a minimum level of funding. A portion of the adjusted amount is set aside for the new CMAQ program, and the metropolitan planning amount is determined based on a state's apportionment under Title 23 Section 134. The state's apportionments under MAP-21 involve calculating initial amounts based on nationwide apportionments. A portion is set aside for the CMAQ program, and the metropolitan planning amount is determined based on Title 23 Section 134. The remaining amount is divided among core programs like NHPP, TMP, HSIP, and NFP, with adjustments based on privatized highway lane miles and vehicle miles traveled. The provision in the NFP program involves adjusting state apportioned amounts based on privatized highway lane miles and vehicle miles traveled on privatized highways. This adjustment applies to formerly publicly operated toll roads that have been privatized, reducing apportionments for Illinois, Indiana, and Colorado while increasing apportionments for other states. The dollar amounts of the aggregate programmatic split are shown in Table 5. The NFP program adjusts state apportioned amounts based on privatized highway lane miles and vehicle miles traveled on privatized highways. This results in reduced apportionments for Illinois, Indiana, and Colorado, while increasing apportionments for other states. The dollar amounts of the aggregate programmatic split are detailed in Table 5. Additionally, MAP-21 aims to resolve the \"donor-donee\" issue by determining the \"initial amount\" for each state based on their share of total funding during FY2005-FY2009. Although there is an adjustment mechanism to ensure states receive at least a 95% rate of return on their payments to the HTF, it is unlikely that adjustments will be necessary. The adjustment mechanism in the program aims to resolve the \"donor-donee\" issue upfront by ensuring states receive a 95% rate of return on their payments to the HTF. If Congress does not provide sufficient funding, adjustments may be necessary. Some states prefer using their state return on payments to determine the \"initial amount\" due to earmarking legacy issues. SAFETEA included numerous earmarks valued at $24.3 billion, with 67% being \"below the line\" and not bringing additional money to the state. The transportation authorization bill, worth $24.3 billion, included funding for highway earmarks. 67% of the earmarks were \"below the line,\" reducing the state's Equity Bonus distribution. The remaining 33% were \"above the line\" earmarks, increasing funds to receiving states. Extension legislation did not extend individual earmarks, but states that previously received above-the-line earmarks benefited from higher base amounts. MAP-21 eliminated project earmarks but states that did well under SAFETEA received increased apportionment shares. SAFETEA's unequal distribution of earmarking was controversial. The SAFETEA years (FY2005-FY2009) determined state funding shares based on earmarks. States that performed well in receiving \"above the line\" earmarks would benefit under MAP-21. MAP-21 reduced funding programs by two-thirds, consolidating eligibilities into core programs. The five core programs plus metropolitan transportation planning would be authorized at $39.143 billion for FY2012 and $39.806 billion for FY2013. The NHPP would receive $20.5 billion for FY2012 and $21 billion for FY2013. The NHPP program under MAP-21 would be the largest within the Federal-Aid Highway program, receiving $20.5 billion for FY2012 and $21 billion for FY2013. It aims to improve the condition and performance of the National Highway System by combining three SAFETEA core programs. Projects under NHPP include infrastructure improvements, construction, rehabilitation of bridges and tunnels, bicycle transportation infrastructure, and pedestrian walkways. The NHPP program under MAP-21 aims to improve the condition and performance of the National Highway System by focusing on system maintenance, infrastructure improvements, and construction of bridges, tunnels, and pedestrian walkways. States must develop asset management plans with performance metrics and targets, with a limit of 40% of funds on new capacity. Funds may be transferred if bridge conditions fall below minimum standards. The Transportation Mobility Program (TMP) aims to improve Interstate System and NHS bridge conditions by transferring funds from other programs in states. It replaces SAFETEA's Surface Transportation Program, with TMP funds eligible for various transportation projects including transit, carpool programs, and recreational trails. The authorization for TMP is approximately $10.5 billion annually for FY2012 and FY2013. The Transportation Mobility Program (TMP) funds various transportation projects such as congestion pricing, recreational trails, ferry facilities, and border infrastructure. It also includes state participation in natural habitat mitigation efforts and maintenance of public roads near international borders. States may face penalties for increasing deficient bridge deck areas. Fifty percent of each state's apportionment is based on population residing in urbanized areas. Under MAP-21, the Transportation Mobility Program (TMP) would see changes such as the elimination of the Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS) program, giving states more flexibility in spending. The Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ) program would be expanded to include projects like demand-shifting. CMAQ funding would increase to roughly $3.3 billion annually, absorbing eligibilities from discontinued programs. Under MAP-21, the CMAQ program would be expanded to include demand-shifting projects like telecommuting and ridesharing, with funding increasing to $3.3 billion annually. The HSIP program would remain largely unchanged, supporting safety improvements on road infrastructure with $2.5 billion in annual funding. The High Risk Rural Roads Program and Rail-Highway Grade Crossing Program would be abolished, while a new National Freight Program (NFP) would be established with $2 billion in funding to improve the national freight network. The NFP would be a new program with $2 billion in funding annually for FY2012 and FY2013, aimed at improving the national freight network. MAP-21 would reduce the maximum percentage of funding that states can transfer between programs from 50% to 20%. H.R. 7 proposes to retain more of the existing core program structure and expand the National Highway System. H.R. 7 proposes to consolidate or eliminate many programs, retaining more of the existing core program structure. It would expand the National Highway System Program and the Surface Transportation Program, absorbing the Highway Bridge Program. The Interstate Maintenance program would be folded into the NHS, while the Highway Safety Improvement Program would be retained. The 10% set-aside for Transportation Enhancements is eliminated, with many absorbed or eliminated programs' eligibilities continuing under other programs. The total obligation limitations for core highway programs for FY2013 through FY2016 amount to $150.7 billion, with an additional $8 billion for the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program. Under H.R. 7, core highway programs would be consolidated or eliminated, with the National Highway System Program expanding to cover maintenance and repair of the Interstate Highway system. The Interstate Maintenance Program and Highway Bridge Program would be absorbed, with funding focused on projects supporting national performance goals. The total funding for core highway programs for FY2013 through FY2016 is $150.7 billion, with an additional $8 billion for the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program. Under H.R. 7, the NHS would expand to cover maintenance and repair of the Interstate Highway system, with the elimination of the existing Highway Bridge Program. Projects on the NHS would be eligible for funding, supporting progress towards national performance goals. The bill would authorize $42.4 billion for FY2013-FY2014 for the STP program, broadening its purpose to include bridges and tunnels of all classifications. The requirement for 10% of STP funds to be set aside for transportation enhancement purposes would be eliminated, but up to 15% of the STP amounts could be used in specific areas. H.R. 7 eliminates the 10% set-aside for transportation enhancement purposes in STP funds. It allows up to 15% of STP funds in areas with populations under 5,000 to be used on minor collectors. The bill reduces the required spending on urbanized areas over 200,000 from 62.5% to 50%. States must consult with local planning organizations for projects in areas of 5,000 to 200,000 population. $10.4 billion is allocated for HSIP in FY2013-FY2014, with states needing their own safety programs and plans to receive funds. Plans must set safety goals, identify projects, and evaluate progress on the 100 most dangerous roads annually. H.R. 7 would amend highway safety improvement programs and state safety plans to receive funds, requiring consultation with stakeholders, setting safety goals, identifying projects, and evaluating progress on the 100 most dangerous roads annually. Federal cost share would remain at 90%. The bill would provide $8 billion over FY2013-FY2014 for CMAQ from the proposed alternative transportation account. Each state would receive a minimum 94% return in core program apportionments on highway users' payments. The total authorization is $15.6 billion over FY2013-FY2014, with a limit of $3.9 billion per year to fulfill the guarantee. H.R. 7 authorizes $15.6 billion over FY2013-FY2014 for highway trust fund taxes, with a limit of $3.9 billion per year. The bill clarifies eligibility criteria for roads and bridges damaged by natural disasters, with a cap of $20 million for U.S. territories and eliminating the $100 million ceiling for single disasters or failures in a state. The ER funds can only be used on federal-aid highways, with U.S. territories limited to $20 million per fiscal year. The $100 million ceiling for single disasters in a state is eliminated. Section 1506 allows adjustments for the 180-day emergency period. H.R. 7 defines \"comparable facility\" for maximum project costs. Debris removal costs are reimbursed if not covered by the Stafford Act. The ER funding is limited to federal-aid highways, with U.S. territories capped at $20 million per fiscal year. Debris removal costs are reimbursed if not covered by the Stafford Act. The Senate bill proposes restructuring the Federal Lands Highways Programs to create the Federal Lands and Tribal Transportation Program, with funding for the Tribal Transportation Program set at $450 million annually. The Federal Lands and Tribal Transportation Program, proposed under MAP-21, includes the Tribal Transportation Program, Federal Lands Transportation Program, and Federal Lands Access Program. Funding for the Tribal Transportation Program is set at $450 million annually, while other federal lands programs would receive $550 million annually. Changes in the Tribal Transportation Program include a new formula for fund distribution based on road mileage and tribal population. Additionally, H.R. 7 authorizes $465 million annually for the Tribal Transportation Program and $535 million annually for the Federal Lands Transportation Program. The Senate bill combines the Puerto Rico and Territorial Highway programs, funding them at $180 million annually for FY2012 and FY2013. The Tribal Transportation Program under H.R. 7 is authorized at $465 million annually for FY2013-FY2016, while the Federal Lands Transportation program is authorized at $535 million annually for the same period. The Senate bill combines the Puerto Rico and Territorial Highway programs, with funding set at $180 million annually for FY2012 and FY2013. Puerto Rico's set-aside is limited to specific program eligibilities, with $135 million annually allocated. H.R. 7 retains the Puerto Rico Highway Program at $150 million annually and the Territorial Highway Program at $50 million annually for FY2013-FY2016. The Senate bill merges the Puerto Rico and Territorial Highway programs, allocating $180 million annually for FY2012 and FY2013. Puerto Rico's set-aside is limited to specific program eligibilities, with $135 million annually allocated. The bill also eliminates the ADHS program and incorporates its eligibilities into the new Transportation Mobility Program. Section 1530 increases the federal share payable for constructing highways on the Appalachian Development Highway System to 95% under certain conditions. H.R. 7 retains the Puerto Rico Highway Program at $150 million annually and the Territorial Highway Program at $50 million annually for FY2013-FY2016. States can use toll credits for the local matching share. The Senate bill, Section 1118, establishes a program to fund critical high-cost surface transportation infrastructure projects with a budget authority of $1 billion for FY2013. The program aims to improve national and regional economic benefits, reduce congestion, enhance energy security, and improve transportation safety. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) is required to report on project selection within three years of enactment. H.R. 7 would repeal the SAFETEA PNRS provision. The Senate bill, H.R. 4348 as amended by MAP-21, Section 1119, creates a general fund program for Ferries and Ferry Terminal Facilities. Funding distribution is based on passengers, vehicles, and route miles serviced by ferry systems. MAP-21 authorizes $67 million for each fiscal year FY2012 and FY2013, requiring an appropriation to be made available. The House bill (H.R. 7, Section 1113) proposes funding for ferry boats and facilities under the National Highway Performance Program. It authorizes $67 million for each fiscal year FY2013-FY2016, distributed based on vehicles, passengers, and route miles serviced by ferry systems in each state. The House bill proposes funding for ferry boats and facilities under the National Highway Performance Program, distributing funds based on vehicles, passengers, and route miles serviced by ferry systems in each state. Additionally, the bill suggests expanding the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) to provide federal credit assistance for large transportation projects. The MAP-21 bill proposes significant changes to the TIFIA program, including authorizing $1 billion annually from the highway trust fund for administrative and subsidy costs. This would increase the capacity for loans to $9.9 billion per year and allow TIFIA to provide up to 49% of project costs. Additionally, credit assistance could be provided for a program of projects secured by a common security pledge. MAP-21 proposes significant changes to the TIFIA program, including increasing the share of project costs TIFIA may provide to 49%. It also allows credit assistance for a program of projects secured by a common security pledge through a \"master credit agreement.\" The threshold for eligible projects remains at $50 million, except for rural infrastructure projects, which have a threshold of $25 million. The TIFIA program under MAP-21 proposes changes such as increasing the project cost share to 49% and allowing credit assistance for projects through a \"master credit agreement.\" Rural infrastructure projects have a lower threshold of $25 million and receive loans at half the Treasury rate. Projects seeking TIFIA assistance would be evaluated solely on eligibility on a first-come, first-served basis, with 10% of TIFIA funds set aside for rural projects. Funding can be exhausted for the year, and project sponsors can enter into a master credit agreement or pay their own credit subsidy. H.R. 7 authorizes $1 billion annually for TIFIA from the highway trust fund, with funds available for administrative and subsidy costs. The bill establishes master credit agreements for credit assistance on a first-come, first-served basis. It maintains thresholds for project eligibility, including $50 million for non-ITS projects, $15 million for ITS projects, and adds a $25 million threshold for rural projects. H.R. 7 proposes changes to TIFIA assistance, including new thresholds for project eligibility and increasing federal assistance to 49%. It also authorizes $750 million per year for state infrastructure banks. SAFETEA does not have a separate federal freight transportation program, with funding mainly provided through existing highway programs like the Surface Transportation Program (STP). The SAFETEA program does not have a dedicated federal freight transportation program, with most funding provided through existing highway programs like the Surface Transportation Program (STP). There is a debate on whether the federal government should focus more on funding freight improvements, with the Senate bill (MAP-21) proposing a new dedicated funding program for freight transport. The House bill (H.R. 7) does not create a similar program but includes provisions that impact freight transport. Both bills require the U.S. Department of Transportation to prepare and update a national freight transport plan. The Senate bill (MAP-21) proposes a new dedicated funding program for freight transport, while the House bill (H.R. 7) includes provisions that significantly affect freight transport. Both bills require the U.S. Department of Transportation to prepare a national freight transport plan and seek to increase private-sector participation in financing transportation improvements. MAP-21 also introduces a new core program to direct funds to critical infrastructure segments for freight movement, designating a \"primary freight network\" consisting of 27,000 centerline miles of existing roadways. The Secretary of Transportation designates critical segments for freight movement, creating the \"primary freight network\" (PFN) of 27,000 centerline miles. States must prioritize spending on PFN before other freight infrastructure. Additional 3,000 miles can be added based on future importance. States can designate \"critical rural freight corridors\" connecting PFN or Interstates, with a maximum of 20% of funds allocated to these roads. States can designate \"critical rural freight corridors\" based on truck traffic density connecting the PFN or Interstate System with busy freight terminals. They can allocate up to 20% of their freight program funds to these roads. The critical rural freight corridors, portions of the Interstate System not designated as the PFN, and the PFN would form the \"national freight network (NFM).\" States can also use funds for non-Interstate highways or transit projects that improve freight flows on nearby interstates more cost-effectively. Additionally, states can allocate up to 10% of funds for freight rail or maritime projects if they significantly improve freight flow and provide a better return than a highway project on the PFN. The Secretary of Transportation can allocate funds for freight rail or maritime projects if they improve freight flow significantly and offer a better return than highway projects on the Primary Freight Network (PFN). Creating a specific funding program for freight movement and requiring states to develop performance measures will enhance consideration of freight needs in project selection. The PFN, consisting of about 30,000 miles of highway, would focus funds on critical segments for freight movement, particularly in congested urban interchanges where trucks face speed and stop-and-go conditions during rush hours. States may be hesitant to address costly bottlenecks that primarily benefit trucks serving local shippers due to reliance on apportioned funds. The House bill focuses on funding for freight transport by reducing funding for non-relevant programs and increasing reliance on tolling for highway construction. It also terminates the transfer of federal gas taxes to the mass transit trust fund, potentially benefiting truck transportation. The Senate bill does not change truck size and weight limits but requires a study on possible changes. Programs like TIFIA, PNRS, and CMAQ may be more suitable for funding projects under MAP-21. Urban interchanges with stop-and-go conditions for trucks during rush hours are a key focus for improving freight flow. The House bill focuses on funding for freight transport by reducing funding for non-relevant programs and increasing reliance on tolling for highway construction. It terminates the transfer of federal gas taxes to the mass transit trust fund, potentially benefiting truck transportation. H.R. 7 includes provisions for increasing truck weight limits and trailer lengths, as well as a pilot program allowing states to increase truck weights to 126,000 pounds on specific routes. The House bill proposes increasing trailer lengths for LTL and truckload carriers, as well as allowing auto transporters to be up to 80 feet long. It also includes a pilot program for certain states to increase truck weights to 126,000 pounds on specific highway segments. Additionally, there is a weight exemption for idle reduction equipment and changes to transportation planning requirements at national, state, and local levels. The changes to transportation planning requirements at the national, state, and local levels under MAP-21 include the use of performance management, with states and metropolitan planning organizations developing performance measures and targets. The consequences for not meeting targets are mild, requiring a remedial plan. Additionally, a national freight strategic plan with performance measures for freight movement on the primary network is required, with states setting performance targets to receive funding from the new freight program. The MAP-21 program requires the development of a national freight strategic plan by DOT, with quantifiable performance measures for freight movement. States must set performance targets to receive funding, and if targets are not met, a remedial plan must be submitted. Additionally, the Surface Transportation and Freight Policy Act includes provisions for a national surface transportation and freight policy, as well as a strategic plan. The Surface Transportation and Freight Policy Act includes provisions for a national surface transportation and freight strategic plan, with some provisions repeating or conflicting with those in Division A, Title I. For example, there are goals to reduce traffic fatalities and serious injuries, as well as conflicting timelines for developing strategic plans. States must develop risk-based asset management plans with performance targets, and the Secretary must oversee planning efforts. Under the Surface Transportation and Freight Policy Act, states are required to develop risk-based asset management plans with performance targets. The Secretary would set minimum standards for pavement and bridge conditions, with states needing to redirect federal funds if these standards are not met. MAP-21 also requires states to incorporate metropolitan transportation plans into their statewide plans and improvement programs. MAP-21 introduces changes to transportation planning, requiring statewide plans to incorporate metropolitan transportation plans without change. States must now develop plans in cooperation with nonmetropolitan areas and use a performance-based approach. Metropolitan transportation planning would create two tiers of MPOs based on population size, each with specific technical requirements. MAP-21 proposes creating two tiers of Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) based on population size, with Tier I for areas with 1 million or more people and Tier II for areas with less than 1 million. Both tiers have minimum technical requirements, with Tier I requiring performance-based planning and targets. The Secretary will establish regulations for these requirements within a year of enactment. Tier II requirements will be more discretionary, potentially including performance measures. Both tiers can select projects from their Transportation Improvement Programs (TIPs) in consultation with states and facility owners. Optional blueprint planning scenarios are also included in MAP-21. MAP-21 introduces two tiers of Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) based on population size, with Tier I for areas with 1 million or more people and Tier II for areas with less than 1 million. Tier II MPOs in urbanized areas below 200,000 population can be designated by agreement between the governor and local officials, but must meet minimum technical requirements set by the Secretary. Existing MPOs in areas under 200,000 population may be terminated three years after regulations are promulgated for Tier II MPOs if not reaffirmed by the MPO and governor. The legislation aims to consolidate metropolitan planning within a single MPO in each urban region, but allows for multiple MPOs to co-exist under certain conditions. The proposed legislation under H.R. 7 aims to consolidate metropolitan historians. is. re is  of just and in  of  of  of  of  of  of  of  of  of      of  of                                                                                             1.  1  1   The national plan under H.R. 7 includes cost estimates and must be updated every two years. It also mandates the development of a national performance management system to track progress towards national performance goals for highways and public transportation. This system includes national and state performance measures, targets, and reporting requirements. States must report annually on their progress towards meeting performance targets and identify projects of national, regional, and statewide significance in the long-range plan. Additionally, H.R. 7 addresses congestion issues at airports, freight rail corridors, ports, inland waterways, and considers the role of intercity buses in reducing congestion, pollution, and energy consumption. H.R. 7 includes measures to address congestion at airports, freight rail corridors, ports, and inland waterways. It also considers the role of intercity buses in reducing congestion, pollution, and energy consumption. The bill proposes increasing the urbanized population threshold for the designation of Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) from 50,000 to 100,000. Additionally, it adds a requirement for regional transportation planning organizations in areas without a designated MPO. H.R. 7 proposes measures to address congestion in various transportation sectors and includes provisions to expedite project delivery by changing elements of the environmental review process. The bill also adds a requirement for metropolitan planning to consider the role of intercity buses. Budgetary pressures have increased concerns about using transportation resources effectively. The environmental review process for transportation projects involves preparing documentation to identify and address potential impacts on the human, natural, or cultural environment. Various requirements may apply, such as obtaining permits or mitigating effects on historic sites. The environmental review process for transportation projects involves preparing documentation to identify and address potential impacts on the human, natural, or cultural environment. This includes obtaining permits, mitigating effects on historic sites, and complying with NEPA requirements for federal-aid highway or transit projects. Approval from FHWA or FTA is necessary before final design activities or project construction can proceed. Coordination of all environmental investigations, reviews, and consultations is required as a single process under DOT policy. The distinction between NEPA requirements and those identified during the compliance process may be blurred. The environmental review process for transportation projects involves coordinating all environmental investigations, reviews, and consultations as a single process. Recent legislative efforts aim to expedite project delivery by changing existing environmental compliance requirements, with the House proposal suggesting more sweeping changes than MAP-21. The distinction between NEPA requirements and those identified during compliance may impact project delays and solutions for expediting the review process. The House proposal and MAP-21 focus on expediting highway and transit project delivery by changing environmental compliance requirements. The proposed changes may accelerate environmental reviews or slow project delivery by removing coordination mechanisms or adding requirements. Compliance with environmental requirements involves input from federal, state, and tribal agencies before final design activities. The \"environmental review process\" is a crucial phase in project development where state, tribal, and federal environmental compliance requirements, including those under NEPA, are identified and documented. FHWA or FTA must ensure completion of this process before final design activities or project construction can proceed. Projects with significant environmental impacts require an environmental impact statement, while those with unclear impacts undergo an environmental assessment. Projects with no significant impacts are categorically excluded from EIS or EA requirements, known as categorical exclusions (CEs). Projects with no significant environmental impacts are categorically excluded from the requirement to prepare an EIS or EA, known as categorical exclusions (CEs). Approximately 90% of highway projects approved annually by FHWA were processed as CEs, while 6% required an EA. These projects may still be subject to other environmental requirements under various laws. The most significant changes in the environmental review process in MAP-21 involve \"Accelerated Decisionmaking\" and \"Review of Federal Project and Program Delivery.\" Under Section 1313 of MAP-21, new requirements for issue resolution in the environmental review process would be established to ensure timely project completion and dispute resolution. Financial transfer provisions would also be implemented for agencies failing to issue required approvals, with penalties of $10,000 or $20,000 per week for delays. Under certain conditions, the agency responsible for delays in issuing approvals must transfer $10,000 or $20,000 weekly to the division handling the application. This transfer is required 180 days after a permit application is complete or after a final project decision is made. The transfer is not needed if the delay is not the agency's fault. Various agencies, such as EPA or the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, are responsible for issuing approvals for DOT projects. Delays are sometimes due to under-staffing or lack of funds. Under-staffing or lack of funds in agencies responsible for processing permit applications can cause delays in issuing necessary approvals. Redirecting limited agency funds to expedite a single transportation project approval may slow down other applications. MAP-21 requires DOT to compare completion times of environmental assessments initiated before and after 2005, with no specific funding authorized for the assessments. The Department of Transportation (DOT) is required by MAP-21 to compare completion times of environmental assessments (CEs, EAs, and EISs) initiated before and after January 1, 2005. There is no specific funding authorized for these assessments, and it may be challenging to accurately determine the time it takes to complete the NEPA process. State DOTs generally do not track this information, and accurate data may be difficult to extract. To meet Congress's directive, DOT may need to require states to start tracking this information. The Department of Transportation (DOT) is required by MAP-21 to compare completion times of environmental assessments (CEs, EAs, and EISs) initiated before and after January 1, 2005. To meet Congress's directive, DOT may require states to begin tracking this information and report it to DOT. MAP-21 provisions applicable to CEs involve directives to DOT to change existing regulatory requirements applicable to such projects, including adding new projects to the list of categorical exclusions. The Department of Transportation (DOT) is directed by MAP-21 to make changes to existing CE regulations, including adding new projects to the list of categorical exclusions. Other provisions involve specifying DOT agency roles in NEPA compliance for multimodal projects and criteria for designating projects within existing highway right-of-ways as categorical exclusions. Assistance to Affected State and Federal Agencies would continue authorizing federal transportation funds for dedicated staff to expedite transportation project planning and delivery. Under SAFETEA, federal transportation funds can be used for staff to support project planning. States can use funds for attorneys' fees related to eligible activities. The surface transportation project delivery program allows states to take on federal responsibilities for environmental reviews. The surface transportation project delivery program, established under SAFETEA, allows states to assume federal responsibilities for environmental reviews. The proposed legislation would make this program permanent, expanding participation to all states and requiring DOT to assess states' ability to implement the program. Provisions in the House bill aim to streamline the environmental review process for federal highway and transit projects, as well as rail programs. The proposed legislation aims to streamline the environmental review process for federal highway and transit projects, as well as rail programs. It includes provisions that would change NEPA requirements, such as raising the cost threshold for projects subject to NEPA and establishing specific timeframes for permits and approvals. The House bill aims to streamline the environmental review process for federal projects by setting specific timeframes for permits and approvals, establishing a 270-day deadline for the overall review process, and amending requirements for parks, wildlife refuges, and historic sites. The Senate has agreed to substitute the language of MAP-21 for the House-passed language of H.R. 4348, ensuring that the House streamlining provisions will not be challenged. The House bill includes streamlining provisions for the environmental review process in federal projects. MAP-21 would allow state DOTs to enter into construction manager/general contractor contracts, which aim to accelerate project delivery by involving the contractor early in the design phase. The House bill includes provisions for streamlining the environmental review process in federal projects. MAP-21 allows state DOTs to enter into construction manager/general contractor contracts to accelerate project delivery by involving the contractor early in the design phase. It also increases federal funding share by 5% for highway projects using innovative project delivery methods. MAP-21 introduces innovations such as prefabricated bridge elements, digital modeling technologies, and alternative contracting methods. It also includes a pilot program for advance payment of moving costs for those affected by highway projects, with a limit of five states. This program aims to expedite the relocation process, but is a minor change compared to other proposed alternatives for property acquisition and relocation laws. The \"Program\" aims to expedite the removal of people from project right-of-way, a minor change compared to other proposed alternatives for property acquisition and relocation laws. State transportation officials suggest allowing states to use their own laws if they meet federal requirements. The CMAQ program under Section 1113 of MAP-21 would be rewritten to fund projects reducing transportation-related pollutants exceeding air quality standards set by the EPA. The CMAQ program was established to provide funds for projects in nonattainment and maintenance areas, with goals, criteria, and funding levels largely unchanged under MAP-21. Proposed amendments would change how funding levels are established and distributed within states. Congress has authorized specific annual CMAQ program funding levels since the early 1990s. Proposed amendments to the CMAQ program would change how funding levels are established and distributed within states. Congress has authorized specific annual CMAQ program funding levels since the early 1990s. The CMAQ apportionment for FYs 2012 and 2013 would be tied to previous funding levels and distributed within each state based on new program limitations. The proposed amendments to the CMAQ program would change funding distribution within states. States would reserve 10% of apportioned funds for specific projects like transportation enhancements and recreational trails. The remaining funds would be suballocated for projects in designated nonattainment or maintenance areas based on a formula approved by DOT. The proposed amendments to the CMAQ program would change funding distribution within states. States would reserve 10% of apportioned funds for specific projects like transportation enhancements and recreational trails. The remaining funds would be suballocated for projects in designated nonattainment or maintenance areas based on a formula approved by DOT, weighted by population and pollution severity. Additionally, funds would be set aside for low-emissions construction equipment and vehicles. States in attainment for NAAQS may use their apportioned funds for CMAQ-eligible projects. Additional provisions in MAP-21 may significantly impact the implementation of the CMAQ program in individual states. The proposed amendments to the CMAQ program under MAP-21 would change funding distribution within states. States in attainment for NAAQS may use their apportioned funds for CMAQ-eligible projects. Additional provisions include prioritizing projects to reduce pollutants in nonattainment areas, evaluating project cost-effectiveness, optional programmatic eligibility for emissions reductions, and requiring performance plans for CMAQ-funded projects. The proposed amendments to the CMAQ program include optional programmatic eligibility for emissions reductions, requiring MPOs to prepare performance plans for CMAQ-funded projects, and amending project eligibility requirements. Current laws provide incentives for alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles, such as tax credits for plug-in vehicles and biofuel production. Incentives for alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles include tax credits for plug-in vehicles and biofuel production. Non-tax incentives under the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) program and various highway programs also provide benefits for automakers producing and selling alternative fuel vehicles. Highway programs like SAFETEA allow low-emission vehicles to use HOV lanes, with proposed extensions in legislation like H.R. 7 and MAP-21, but with limitations if vehicles cause lane degradation. The House and Senate bills propose allowing exemptions for vehicles in HOV lanes if the lanes become degraded, regardless of the cause. Additionally, the bills aim to expand electric vehicle infrastructure by using highway funds for new charging stations. MAP-21 would also amend the Clean Fuels Grant Program to include grants for clean fuel buses and facilities, including zero emission buses. MAP-21 would amend definitions to include buses and other vehicles, with a focus on clean fuel buses and facilities. It authorizes $10.458 billion annually for federal transit programs, with a portion coming from the mass transit account of the highway trust fund. H.R. 7 does not have comparable provisions and proposes renaming the mass transit account. H.R. 7 proposes renaming the mass transit account to the alternative transportation account and authorizes $10.458 billion annually for FY2012 and $10.498 billion for FY2013 through FY2016. It eliminates the use of motor fuel taxes for mass transit and transfers revenue to the highway account. The bill also transfers $40 billion from the general fund to the alternative transportation account, restructuring the federal transit program with a new State of Good Repair Grant Program for fixed guideway public transit. The proposed State of Good Repair Grant Program includes four components: High Intensity Fixed Guideway SGR Formula Program for maintenance of fixed guideway public transit, Fixed Guideway SGR Grant Program for upkeep of fixed guideway systems, High Intensity Motorbus SGR program for public transportation on facilities with access for high-occupancy vehicles, and Bus and Bus. Funding for these programs would come from the mass transit account or the general fund. The High Intensity Motorbus SGR program distributes funds for public transportation on facilities accessible to high-occupancy vehicles that are at least seven years old. Funding comes from the mass transit account and is distributed based on fixed-guideway motor bus vehicle miles and route miles. The Bus and Bus Facilities SGR program provides competitive grants for bus and facility maintenance, with $75 million set aside from the New Starts program. The FPTA proposes combining the Formula Grants for Elderly Individuals and Individuals with Disabilities Program with the New Freedom Program into a single program. The Senate bill proposes significant changes to public transportation funding programs, including combining programs for elderly individuals and individuals with disabilities into one program called Formula Grants for Enhanced Mobility of Seniors and Individuals with Disabilities. The Jobs Access and Reverse Commute program would be shifted to the Urbanized and Non-Urbanized Area Formula programs. A new Access to Jobs program would require recipients to allocate 3% of their funding to projects benefiting low-income individuals. Additionally, two new programs would be created: the Appalachian Development Public Transportation Assistance Program and the Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program. The Senate bill proposes new public transportation funding programs, including the Appalachian Development Public Transportation Assistance Program and the Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program. The bill also doubles funding for transit on Indian reservations and eliminates some programs like the Clean Fuels Grant Program and the Transit in Parks Program. The House bill (H.R. 7) proposes changes to the federal transit program, including eliminating certain programs like the Clean Fuels Grant Program and combining others into a single program. It also suggests distributing funding for the Bus and Bus-Related Facilities Program by formula and providing incentives for contracting out bus services. The proposed changes in H.R. 7 aim to make the federal transit program more accessible to all types of transit agencies, including bus and rail providers in urban and non-urban areas. One significant change is the incentive for contracting out bus services, allowing providers to lower their cost share for capital projects. The Senate bill focuses on enhancing the New Starts program by allowing funds for core capacity improvement projects and simplifying the process with three major stages: project development, engineering, and construction. The bill aims to simplify the New Starts process by reducing stages from four to three: project development, engineering, and construction. It eliminates the separate alternatives analysis and requires applicants to apply to the Secretary of Transportation to initiate the NEPA process. Project sponsors must provide necessary information for project justification and local financial commitment during project development, with a two-year timeline. The Engineering Phase can begin after the NEPA process concludes with a ROD, FONSI, or Categorical Exclusion, and the project is selected as the locally preferred alternative. The Senate bill aims to streamline the project development process by reducing stages to project development, engineering, and construction. It allows projects to enter the Engineering Phase after the NEPA process is completed and certain criteria are met. The bill also introduces special warrants for projects with federal share of $100 million or less. However, it eliminates the Small Starts program for projects requesting $75 million or less in federal assistance. Additionally, the bill creates a pilot program for expedited project delivery for three projects. The House bill (H.R. 7) aims to expedite project delivery for certain fixed guideway capital projects and core capacity improvement projects. It maintains the distinction between New Starts and Small Starts projects, allocating $150 million for Small Starts projects. The bill eliminates the alternatives analysis but still requires evaluation against a no-action alternative. It includes provisions for expediting projects, such as using special warrants for projects like new urban circulator service. H.R. 7 aims to expedite project delivery by eliminating alternatives analysis and changing project justification criteria. It includes provisions for expediting projects like new urban circulator service and adds private contributions as evaluation factors. The bill maintains the prohibition on federal funds for operating expenses in urbanized areas but allows exceptions for small bus transit systems. The House bill (H.R. 7) allows small bus transit systems in urbanized areas of 200,000 or more people to use federal funds for operating expenses, with varying percentages based on the number of buses in peak service. Additionally, it permits the use of funds in areas with high unemployment rates for up to three years, with decreasing percentages allowed each year. The House bill (H.R. 7) allows transit bus systems in urbanized areas of 200,000 or more people to use federal funding for operating expenses based on the number of buses in peak service. It also increases the share of funds for Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) paratransit from 10% to 15%. Both the Senate and House bills include provisions for passenger and freight rail, with a call for a national rail plan. The House bill increases the share of funds for Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) paratransit from 10% to 15%. It also includes provisions for passenger and freight rail, calling for a national rail plan and regional rail plans to guide future investments and development. States may create state rail plans to further refine regional plans for federal capital grants for intercity passenger service. Amendments are made to the NEC advisory commission, and Amtrak is required to submit a new plan for high-speed service. The bill requires DOT to develop guidance on measuring train delays, conduct a data needs assessment for intercity passenger rail, survey track access arrangements, and create an equipment pool for corridor intercity passenger services. The bill aims to develop an equipment pool for corridor intercity passenger services controlled by Amtrak and states, to standardize cars and improve efficiency. It also includes Amtrak as an eligible recipient for capital grants, potentially impacting car design regulations. The Federal Railroad Administration regulations on passenger car design, particularly regarding crash survival, could be influenced by the implementation of positive train control. This may align U.S. requirements more with foreign standards, potentially opening up a global market for passenger car equipment. Additionally, H.R. 7 proposes repealing the congestion grant program, which aimed to reduce congestion and promote ridership growth on high-priority rail corridors. H.R. 7 proposes changes to Amtrak's operating assistance grants and food and beverage service regulations. It would reduce funding levels for Amtrak and require competitive bidding for food and beverage services on trains. H.R. 7 proposes changes to Amtrak's operating assistance grants and food and beverage service regulations. It would repeal the self-supporting requirement for food and beverage service on trains, require competitive bidding, and allow subsidies only if a net loss is foreseen. Additionally, it includes amendments to federal grant programs for relocating railroad lines and expands eligible uses of the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing Program. The Senate bill proposes changes to the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing (RRIF) Program, allowing state or local subsidies as collateral and expanding eligible uses of RRIF loans. It also suggests modifications to laws governing the Surface Transportation Board (STB), including raising the ceiling on freight charge cases and imposing shorter procedural deadlines. Additionally, the STB would study incorporating railroad asset replacement costs in its annual revenue adequacy examination. The bill H.R. 7 proposes various changes to the railroad industry, including imposing shorter procedural deadlines for rate relief cases, studying railroad asset replacement costs, compiling and reporting railroad service complaints, repealing a capital grant program for smaller railroads, and facilitating access to the RRIF loan program. It also mandates positive train control for passenger and freight railroads on certain routes to prevent accidents. The Senate bill proposes extending the deadline for implementing Positive Train Control (PTC) technology, allowing for extensions until December 31, 2018. It also makes PTC implementation eligible for RRIF funding and requires a study on spectrum needs for PTC. The House bill, H.R. 7, extends the PTC deadline to 2021 for routes with passenger traffic and removes the deadline for routes carrying certain toxic chemicals. The Senate bill extends the deadline for implementing Positive Train Control (PTC) technology to December 31, 2018, and allows for RRIF funding. The House bill, H.R. 7, extends the PTC deadline to 2021 for routes with passenger traffic and removes the deadline for routes carrying certain toxic chemicals. Additionally, the Senate bill introduces new highway safety programs, including an incentive grant program to discourage texting while driving and increased penalties for vehicle safety violations. The House bill, H.R. 7, proposes various changes to vehicle safety regulations, including increasing civil penalties for safety violations and requiring event data recorders in passenger vehicles starting from 2015. It also consolidates multiple highway safety grant programs into one, while prohibiting federal funding for measuring motorcycle helmet usage. The Senate bill authorizes higher highway safety grants and establishes a clearinghouse for drug and alcohol test results for commercial drivers to prevent penalties evasion. The Senate bill authorizes higher highway safety grants in FY2012 and FY2013 compared to the House bill. Both bills aim to prevent drivers from evading penalties by switching employers after failing drug and alcohol tests. They also address reincarnated carriers and provide similar funding for truck safety grants to states in FY2013. Additionally, there are concerns about transit safety oversight following fatal incidents in 2009 and 2010, leading to proposed legislation similar to previous proposals and acts. The transit safety section in MAP-21 (\u00a720021) is similar to a proposal made by the Administration in 2009 and the Public Transportation Safety Act of 2010 (S. 3638). It would authorize DOT to establish and enforce minimum safety standards for rail transit systems, establish a safety certification program, and require state safety oversight agencies to be financially independent. H.R. 7 would not authorize DOT to set safety standards but would allow funds for transit agencies to be spent on safety. H.R. 7 addresses the issue of transit safety oversight by authorizing grants to states for safety programs, requiring funds to be spent on safety and repair projects, and providing financial assistance to state safety oversight organizations. It also includes provisions for transportation research and education funding, technology deployment programs, and prize competitions for transportation innovations. H.R. 7 and MAP-21 both authorize funding for transportation research and education, technology deployment programs, and prize competitions for innovations. They also direct studies on improving transportation safety, reducing congestion, and assessing infrastructure investment needs. Additionally, both bills include provisions for grants to university transportation centers and emphasize the need to fully spend revenues in the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund for waterside infrastructure maintenance. The House-passed H.R. 4348 includes language that would require the total level of budgetary resources provided for a fiscal year to equal the level of receipts credited to the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund. This provision would restrict the use of funds to harbor maintenance programs."
