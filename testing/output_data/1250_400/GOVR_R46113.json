The annual appropriations for DHS allocate resources to every departmental component, with discretionary appropriations providing the majority of funding. The budget also includes fee revenues, trust funds, and mandatory spending. DHS began working on a new Common Appropriations Structure in 2014 to standardize appropriations format across components. In 2014, DHS started developing a new Common Appropriations Structure (CAS) to standardize appropriations format. The CAS converted legacy structures into four categories: Operations and Support, Procurement, Construction, and Improvements, and Research and Development. This change aimed to improve transparency, facilitate comparisons between programs, and simplify spending decisions. The CAS structure converted legacy appropriations into four categories: Operations and Support, Procurement, Construction, and Improvements, Research and Development, and Federal Assistance. These categories cover operating expenses, planning, technology development, and grant funding managed by DHS components. Some appropriations, like the Federal Protective Service, are not included in these categories. The Federal Protective Service and USCG's Retired Pay appropriations are not included in the CAS structure categories. The FPS account allows funds to be spent as needed, while the USCG's Retired Pay supports retired personnel entitlements with no permanent statutory funding mechanism in place. The Retired Pay appropriation for USCG personnel and their dependents is categorized as appropriated mandatory spending, with no permanent statutory funding mechanism. FEMA receives separate appropriations for disaster relief activities, allowing for better tracking of spending. The National Flood Insurance Program also has some discretionary appropriations for certain functions. FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program is largely mandatory spending, with some functions funded through discretionary appropriations. Certain program costs are covered by fees collected by the government. Prior to the FY2017 act, appropriations included directions on how budget authority could be used. In the FY2017 act, provisions within appropriations and general provisions were grouped at the ends of titles where components are funded.

Federal government spending involves a multistep process starting with budget authority enactment by Congress, followed by fund obligation and outlays. The Antideficiency Act prohibits agencies from obligating more funds than enacted budget authority. Budget authority is determined through appropriations acts or direct spending legislation. Budget authority is established through appropriations acts or direct spending legislation and determines the amounts available for federal agencies to spend. The Antideficiency Act prohibits agencies from obligating more funds than enacted by Congress. Budget authority may be one-year, multiyear, or no-year, with obligations incurred when agencies engage in transactions creating a legal requirement for payment. Outlays are the funds actually spent during the fiscal year. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and authorizes payments, or outlays, to be made from the Treasury. It is available for obligation for an indefinite period of time. Discretionary spending is appropriated yearly by Congress through appropriations acts, while mandatory spending is mandated by existing law. Gross budget authority may consist of discretionary and mandatory spending. Entitlement programs, funded annually through appropriations acts, include discretionary and mandatory spending. Discretionary spending, not mandated by law, is appropriated yearly by Congress. Mandatory spending, mandated by law, is typically not appropriated annually. Some mandatory entitlement programs require yearly appropriations, such as Coast Guard retirement pay within DHS. Offsetting collections are funds collected by the government from government accounts or the public, not considered federal revenue. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) budget includes appropriated mandatory spending for programs like Coast Guard retirement pay. Offsetting collections are funds collected by the government from government accounts or the public, not counted as federal revenue. DHS net discretionary budget authority is composed of discretionary spending minus any fee or fund collections that offset discretionary spending. Mandatory entitlement programs like the Secret Service and Coast Guard retired pay accounts are funded by permanent appropriations. The DHS budget includes mandatory entitlement programs like the Secret Service and Coast Guard retired pay accounts. Some entitlements are funded by permanent appropriations, while others are funded by annual appropriations. Secret Service retirement pay is a permanent appropriation, while Coast Guard retirement pay is annually appropriated. Additionally, the DHS budget contains offsetting Trust and Public Enterprise Funds, which are not appropriated by Congress. The maximum budget authority for annual appropriations is determined through a two-stage congressional budget process. The maximum budget authority for annual appropriations, including DHS, is determined through a two-stage congressional budget process. Congress sets overall spending totals in the annual concurrent resolution on the budget, which are then allocated among congressional committees as 302(a) allocations. These allocations are discretionary totals available for enactment in annual appropriations bills. Appropriations committees further allocate these funds among subcommittees as 302(b) allocations, which must not exceed the 302(a) discretionary allocation to enforce budget discipline. Adjustments to 302(b) allocations may occur during the year. The 302(b) allocations are set by Congress for each appropriations bill and must not exceed the 302(a) discretionary allocation to enforce budget discipline. Adjustments can be made during the year. Amendments in the House markup of the FY2020 DHS appropriations bill exceeded the allocation but were later revised. The House markup of the FY2020 DHS appropriations bill exceeded the 302(b) discretionary allocation by $3.066 billion, later revised to $1.9 billion. The final FY2020 DHS annual appropriations act did not include these provisions. The Budget Control Act established enforceable discretionary limits for defense and nondefense spending, with adjustments made through subsequent legislation. Most of the DHS budget is considered nondefense spending, with allowances for adjustments to cover various funding needs. The Budget Control Act established statutory caps for discretionary budget authority, including funding for overseas contingency operations, emergency spending, disaster relief, and other purposes. Adjustments to the caps are made based on three justifications outlined in the Act, with the allowable adjustment for disaster relief determined by a formula. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 amended the formula to increase the allowable size of the adjustment. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 increased the allowable adjustment for disaster relief by adding 5% of emergency-designated funding for major disasters under the Stafford Act. OMB estimated the allowable adjustment for FY2020 at $17.5 billion, the second-largest in history, based on a formula that includes the 10-year average, emergency-designated Stafford Act spending, and carryover from the previous year. The final adjustment for FY2020 may still vary from this estimate."
