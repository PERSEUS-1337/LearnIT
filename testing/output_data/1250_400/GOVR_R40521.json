    "content": "The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is a federal statute that provides funding for special education and related services. It requires states to offer a free appropriate public education (FAPE) to children with disabilities, identify and evaluate them, create individual education programs (IEPs), and involve parents in planning and overseeing services. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) mandates individual education programs (IEPs) for children with disabilities, involving parents in planning and overseeing services. It ensures children with disabilities are educated alongside non-disabled peers and provides procedural safeguards, including the right to a due process hearing and appeal. IDEA was enacted in 1975 in response to the need for education for children with disabilities, with the most recent reauthorization in 2004. Congress is currently considering potential issues for the next reauthorization. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) mandates individual education programs (IEPs) for children with disabilities, involving parents in planning and overseeing services. The most recent reauthorization of IDEA was P.L. 108-446 in 2004, with specific authorizations for appropriations through 2011. Congress is currently identifying potential issues for the next reauthorization. The IDEA definition of a child with a disability is categorical, requiring special education and related services. The IDEA definition categorizes a child with a disability as one who needs special education and related services. In Hansen v. Republic R-III School District, the court determined that a child with conduct disorder, bipolar disorder, and ADHD qualified as a child with a disability under IDEA due to serious emotional disturbance and other health impairments affecting educational performance. The court found that a child with ADHD and educational struggles qualified as a child with a disability under IDEA. Court decisions have debated whether minimal educational impact still qualifies a child as disabled under IDEA, with one case ruling in favor of a child with Asperger's Syndrome. The court rejected the notion that IDEA is limited to children with significant educational impacts. The court rulings on children with disabilities under IDEA vary, with one case involving a child with high grades and intellectual ability being considered disabled despite minimal impact on educational performance. Another case involved a child with schizophrenia who was deemed disabled due to missed school, incomplete assignments, and potential relapse in a public school setting. However, a child with ADHD, depression, and other disorders was not eligible for IDEA services as her behavior did not significantly affect her educational performance. The Ninth Circuit ruled that a child with ADHD, depression, and other disorders was not eligible for IDEA services as her behavior did not adversely affect her educational performance. Other cases also found that children with various disorders did not meet the requirements for seriously emotionally disturbed under IDEA regulations. The Second Circuit found that a child, even if seriously emotionally disturbed, lacked evidence of adverse effects on educational performance. IDEA mandates states to have policies for identifying and evaluating children with disabilities needing special education, known as child find. In Compton Unified School District v. Addison, the Ninth Circuit ruled that a district's failure to evaluate a struggling ninth grader violated child find requirements. The Supreme Court is considering the issue, seeking input from the Department of Justice on whether parents can file due process complaints for such failures. The Supreme Court is considering whether parents can file due process complaints for school officials' failure to provide an educational program for children with disabilities, as required by IDEA. The core requirement of IDEA is to provide children with disabilities a free appropriate public education to receive federal funding. The Supreme Court's decision in Board of Education of the Hendrick Hudson Central School District v. Rowley in 1982 clarified the requirements of a free appropriate public education (FAPE) under IDEA. The Court emphasized that the education provided to children with disabilities must confer some educational benefit and include specialized instruction and related services tailored to each child's needs. The Supreme Court's decision in Board of Education of the Hendrick Hudson Central School District v. Rowley in 1982 clarified that a free appropriate public education (FAPE) under IDEA must provide educational benefit through personalized instruction and support services. The instruction should meet state standards, align with the child's IEP, and be monitored for progress. Mainstreaming can also contribute to educational benefit. The Supreme Court clarified in Board of Education of the Hendrick Hudson Central School District v. Rowley that a child with a disability in mainstream education should receive personalized instruction to achieve passing grades and advance. The FAPE requirement is met as long as the child is making measurable progress and gains. Courts should not impose their views on educational methods, as the responsibility lies with state and local educational agencies. The Supreme Court emphasized in Board of Education of the Hendrick Hudson Central School District v. Rowley that state and local educational agencies have the primary responsibility for providing education to children with disabilities. The Court did not establish a specific test for determining educational benefits under IDEA, leaving it to the discretion of individual cases. Lower courts have varied in their interpretation of Rowley, with some emphasizing access to education over educational progress. For example, in Fort Zumwalt School District v. Clynes, the Eighth Circuit held that an IEP was adequate as long as the child was making progress. Some courts interpret Rowley to support schools' IEPs if procedural requirements are met, even with minimal educational progress. For example, in Fort Zumwalt School District v. Clynes, the Eighth Circuit emphasized \"access to education\" and deemed the IEP adequate despite low reading scores. Other courts have read Rowley more expansively, requiring more than de minimis educational benefit in IEPs. Some courts have interpreted Rowley more expansively, requiring IEPs to provide more than de minimis educational benefit. The Fifth Circuit emphasized that the educational benefit must be meaningful, and the Cypress-Fairbanks court identified four factors to determine if an IEP meets this standard. Other courts have considered academic achievement testing and grades to measure educational benefit, as seen in Falzett v. Pocono Mountain School District. In Falzett v. Pocono Mountain School District, academic achievement testing and grades were used to measure educational benefit. The court found that improved SAT scores and excellent grades qualified a student for FAPE under IDEA. However, in Ringwood Board of Education v. K.H.J., the Third Circuit emphasized that above-average intellectual ability requires more than a negligible benefit under IDEA. Procedural violations must affect the child's substantive rights to constitute a violation of FAPE. Procedural violations must impact the child's substantive rights to be considered a violation of FAPE. In N.B. and C.B. v. Hellgate Elementary School District, the Ninth Circuit ruled that failing to evaluate a child in all areas of suspected disability denied FAPE. Similarly, a denial of FAPE occurred when the LEA unilaterally scheduled an IEP meeting without parental agreement. The application of the Supreme Court's analysis in Rowley to current disputes is complicated by changes in the term \"educational standards.\" The LEA unilaterally scheduled an IEP meeting without parental agreement. The application of the Supreme Court's analysis in Rowley to current controversies is confused by changes in the term \"educational standards.\" The term now refers to specific content-based standards reflecting the standards-based education movement. The 1997 Amendments to IDEA significantly changed IEP requirements to include measurable annual goals for progress in the general curriculum. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA emphasized high expectations for children with disabilities and access to the general curriculum. Questions have arisen about the application of the Supreme Court's Rowley decision due to changes in educational standards. Parents have argued that NCLBA has altered FAPE requirements, but these arguments have not been successful. The 2004 Amendments to IDEA introduced a requirement for specially designed instruction and related services to be based on peer-reviewed research. This has raised questions about how it aligns with the educational standards set by the Rowley decision. In a case like Joshua A. v. Rocklin Unified School District, the issue of reconciling peer-reviewed research with the educational benefit requirement of Rowley has been addressed by at least one court of appeals. The court in Joshua A. v. Rocklin Unified School District rejected the argument that an IEP must be based on peer-reviewed research, emphasizing that the school's \"eclectic approach\" was sufficient under IDEA. IDEA requires an Individualized Education Team to develop an IEP for a child with a disability, including detailed requirements for academic achievement and functional performance levels. After a child is identified as having a disability under IDEA, an Individualized Education Team creates an IEP with specific requirements. The IEP must outline the child's current academic and functional levels, set measurable goals, describe how goals will be achieved, specify special education services, and address inclusion with non-disabled peers. Judicial decisions focus on whether the IEP complies with IDEA procedures and if it provides educational benefits. While an IEP doesn't need to be perfect, it must be reasonably calculated to help the child progress. The court determines compliance with IDEA procedures and the adequacy of the IEP in providing educational benefits. Judicial decisions emphasize that an IEP doesn't have to be perfect but must be reasonably calculated to benefit the child. Flaws in an IEP may not violate IDEA if they don't hinder the child's right to education. Lack of a functional behavioral assessment in an IEP doesn't automatically invalidate it, as long as the child is making progress. The court found that supporting the adequacy of the IEP, including recent social progress, indicated no violation of IDEA. Lack of a functional behavioral assessment in an IEP does not invalidate it. Courts have ruled that an IEP must provide educational benefits to avoid violating IDEA. In A.K. v. Alexandria City School Board, Fourth Circuit ruled IEP not providing educational benefits violates IDEA. Ninth Circuit in M.L. v. Federal Way School District found excluding regular education teacher on IEP team denies FAPE. R.B. v. Napa Valley Unified School District stated special education teacher's presence is sufficient. Courts limit parental control over IEP content, allowing schools to conduct independent medical evaluations without consent. Courts have limited parental control over IEP content, allowing schools to conduct independent medical evaluations without consent. Despite this, courts have ruled in favor of parents in IEP cases, such as finding violations of IDEA due to lack of notice and failure to inform parents of due process rights. Line-drawing in the IEP context is challenging, with courts acknowledging the difficulty in distinguishing between valid parental input and impermissible demands. In IEP cases, courts have found violations of IDEA due to lack of notice and failure to inform parents of due process rights. Violations include determining placement before the IEP meeting and scheduling meetings without considering parents' availability. Denying parents' request to reschedule can also deny the student FAPE, which is a cornerstone of IDEA requiring special education and related services. Related services include transportation, speech-language pathology, audiology, psychological services, therapy, recreation, social work, and school nurse services. The concept of related services under IDEA includes various supportive services such as speech-language pathology, audiology, psychological services, therapy, recreation, social work, and school nurse services. Two Supreme Court decisions have addressed the provision of medical services, with one case involving a child requiring clean intermittent catheterization. In Irving Independent School District v. Tatro, the Supreme Court ruled that schools must provide medical services if necessary for a child with a disability to benefit from special education. The decision set a precedent for the provision of related services under IDEA, clarifying that non-physicians can administer certain medical services. This ruling was further explored in Cedar Rapids Community School District v. Garret F. in 1999. In Cedar Rapids Community School District v. Garret F., the Supreme Court ruled that the medical services exclusion from the definition of related services under IDEA is limited to the services of a physician or a hospital. This decision clarified that non-physicians can provide certain necessary medical services for children with disabilities. The Court rejected a proposed test for determining related services under IDEA, stating that the medical services exclusion only applies to services provided by a physician or hospital. The 2004 reauthorization allowed states to establish risk pools to assist LEAs serving high-need children with disabilities. Recent IDEA cases have emphasized the broad discretion of federal courts in defining necessary services for children with disabilities. Recent IDEA cases have highlighted the broad discretion of federal courts in defining necessary services for children with disabilities, emphasizing the importance of educating disabled children with non-disabled peers whenever possible. Courts have adopted a two-pronged approach to determine if an Individualized Education Program (IEP) places a student in the least restrictive environment, considering factors such as the school's efforts to accommodate the child and the extent of mainstreaming. The court must consider if the school has made reasonable efforts to accommodate a child with disabilities in the regular classroom, comparing the educational benefits in a regular classroom versus a special education classroom, and the potential negative effects on other students. In a specific case, disruptive behaviors led to the decision that full-time education in a regular classroom was not satisfactory. This decision aligns with the emphasis on educating disabled children with non-disabled peers whenever possible in recent IDEA cases. The court upheld the decision that a student with disabilities could not be educated full time in a regular classroom due to disruptive behaviors. The \"stay put\" provision in IDEA ensures that a child remains in their current placement during disputes between school and parents to prevent discrimination. The \"stay put\" provision in IDEA prevents discrimination by ensuring that a child remains in their current placement during disputes. In the case of Honig v. Doe, the Supreme Court ruled that schools cannot unilaterally expel disabled students, even those with disruptive behaviors, unless they pose an immediate threat to others. The Honig v. Doe case limited schools' authority to exclude disabled students, allowing temporary suspension for safety threats. The Honig injunction allows schools to seek judicial relief in extreme cases. Congress later amended IDEA to allow schools to remove a child with a disability for bringing a firearm to school. In 1994, Congress amended IDEA's \"stay put\" provision to allow schools to remove a child with a disability to an interim alternative educational setting for bringing a firearm to school. This provision was later expanded to include weapons, drugs, and situations involving serious bodily injury inflicted by a student at school. Some issues related to the stay put provisions have involved transitions from Part C to Part B of IDEA. The Third Circuit in Pardini v. Allegheny Intermediate Unit held that the stay put provision requires the child to continue to receive conductive education until the dispute over its appropriateness for inclusion in her IEP was resolved. The Eleventh Circuit in D.P. v. School Board of Broward County disagreed, stating that children applying for initial admission to a public school program were not entitled to continue to receive services pursuant to their IFSPs. Other issues regarding the stay put provision have involved mediation, private school placement, a move from a resource room to a classroom, and the appeals process in the courts. Sammons v. Polk County School Board raised the issue of whether a request for mediation invokes the stay put provision. The Eleventh Circuit in Sammons v. Polk County School Board clarified that the stay put provision only applies during administrative or judicial proceedings, not mediation. In L.M. v. Capistrano Unified School District, the Ninth Circuit ruled that a child unilaterally placed in a private school cannot use the stay put provision. Additionally, in E.Y. v. Elysian Charter School of Hoboken, the court determined that the \"stay put\" placement is the one from the previous school year. The stay put provision applies during administrative or judicial proceedings, not mediation. A child unilaterally placed in a private school cannot use the stay put provision. The \"stay put\" placement is the one from the previous school year. In E.Y. v. Elysian Charter School of Hoboken, the court held that a child's relocation within the school did not constitute a change in placement. The Ninth Circuit ruled in Joshua A. v. Rocklin Unified School District that the stay put provision applies throughout the appeals process. However, in N.D. v. State of Hawaii, a novel application of the stay put provision failed when the state decided to furlough teachers and shut down public schools. The Ninth Circuit found no violation, stating that the stay put provision does not cover system-wide changes affecting children. The Ninth Circuit found no violation of the stay put provision in IDEA when public schools were shut down for 17 Fridays in the 2009-2010 school year. Legislation addressing the use of seclusion and restraints in schools has been introduced in Congress. IDEA emphasizes positive behavioral interventions and supports but does not explicitly prohibit the use of mechanical restraints or aversive techniques. The Department of Education has stated that IDEA does not specifically prohibit the use of seclusion and restraints for children with disabilities, but emphasizes the use of positive behavioral interventions and supports. State laws may address the use of restraints, and the critical consideration is whether they can be implemented in line with the child's IEP and the requirement for positive interventions. The Supreme Court has not directly addressed the use of seclusion or restraints under IDEA, but in Honig v. Doe, it ruled that suspensions longer than ten days violated IDEA's \"stay-put\" provision for children with violent or inappropriate behavior. The Supreme Court has not directly addressed the use of seclusion or restraints under IDEA. In Honig v. Doe, the Court ruled that suspensions longer than ten days violated IDEA's \"stay-put\" provision for children with violent or inappropriate behavior. Despite the lack of specific language in IDEA regarding restraints and seclusion, cases have been brought alleging violations of a child's right to education. Courts have generally not found violations where seclusion or restraint was necessary to prevent harm or where the child was progressing academically with tailored IEPs. Courts have examined whether the administrative exhaustion requirements of IDEA apply in situations involving the use of seclusion and restraint. In C.N. v. Willmar Public Schools, the child's IEP allowed for the use of seclusion and restraint when necessary, but the parents alleged improper and excessive use. The parents withdrew their daughter from the school and requested a due process hearing, challenging the adequacy of educational services. The Eighth Circuit affirmed the dismissal, stating that due process procedures must be followed while the child is still in the school district. The Eighth Circuit affirmed the district court's dismissal of the case, stating that parents must follow IDEA due process procedures if dissatisfied with their child's education. In another case, the Second Circuit vacated an injunction against a New York State regulation banning aversive interventions, upholding the regulations as rational and consistent with IDEA purposes. Disability harassment, while not explicitly prohibited in IDEA, can result in consequences according to the Department of Education. The regulations regarding the use of aversives in education were found to be rational and consistent with the purposes of IDEA. Disability harassment, although not explicitly prohibited in IDEA, can lead to a denial of FAPE. Courts have ruled that harassment can deny a child with a disability access to educational benefits, violating IDEA. Claims of harassment must be tied to IDEA and show that FAPE has been denied. Retaliation claims are subject to IDEA's administrative remedies. The ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act can also lead to actions alleging retaliation for advocating violations of IDEA. Special education student rights protection is considered a protected activity under the Rehabilitation Act. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act may give rise to actions alleging retaliation for advocacy of IDEA violations. Section 615 of IDEA provides procedural safeguards for children with disabilities and their parents, including due process procedures. Complaints must be filed within two years of the alleged violation. Schools can also file complaints under the 2004 reauthorization. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA added provisions for schools to file complaints, with a requirement for a resolution session before due process hearings. Mediation of disputes and judicial enforcement of agreements were also included in the law. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA added provisions for schools to file complaints, with a requirement for a resolution session before due process hearings. Provisions allowing for mediation of disputes under IDEA were added in the 1997 reauthorization and retained in the current law. Judicial enforcement of agreements reached through a resolution session or mediation was also provided for in the 2004 reauthorization. Court decisions have addressed issues regarding the confidentiality of information disclosed during resolution sessions and the presence of attorneys in these sessions. Procedural violations in a resolution session do not violate FAPE if there was not a substantial effect on the child's educational opportunities. Several courts have examined the enforceability of settlement agreements in federal court. In federal court, judicial enforcement of settlement agreements reached through dispute resolution or mediation is limited. Courts have ruled that procedural violations in resolution sessions do not violate FAPE unless they significantly impact the child's educational opportunities. Examples include cases where mediation agreements were upheld even if the agreed-upon services were not exactly as specified. In Knight v. Washington School District, a district court addressed issues regarding the review of a hearing officer's determination that a due process complaint did not meet IDEA's pleading requirements. The court quoted from the Senate report stating that the determination of complaint notice adequacy should be made on the face of the complaint, with no hearing or appeal allowed. The court found it troubling that a state official's jurisdiction was limited in this matter. The court found that although it had no jurisdiction to determine the adequacy of the complaint notice, it was troubling that a state official's summary dismissal of a complaint based on federal law was unreviewable in federal court. The Eighth Circuit affirmed the dismissal without prejudice, stating that IDEA does not allow LEAs to bring actions against SEAs for noncompliance with procedural safeguards. In Traverse Bay Area Intermediate School District v. Michigan Department of Education, the Sixth Circuit ruled that LEAs cannot challenge state agencies for noncompliance with IDEA's procedural safeguards. The Ninth Circuit also held that LEAs have no private right of action under IDEA except for issues raised by parents. The Supreme Court in Winkelman v. Parma City School District allowed parents to bring pro se suits under IDEA for their own rights. The Supreme Court in Winkelman v. Parma City School District ruled that parents, even those who are not attorneys, can bring pro se suits under IDEA for their own rights, including the entitlement to a free appropriate public education for their child. Justice Kennedy emphasized that IDEA grants parents independent, enforceable rights beyond procedural or reimbursement issues, ensuring the protection of both parents and children with disabilities. The Supreme Court found that parents of children with disabilities have rights under IDEA, including procedural and substantive rights. These rights are independent and enforceable, not just related to reimbursement. The Court rejected the argument that granting these rights would increase costs to states. The Supreme Court emphasized parents' rights under IDEA, including the ability to bring lawsuits without financial constraints. The Court rejected arguments that these rights would increase state costs and highlighted that parents can be awarded attorneys' fees for improper actions. Non-attorney parents can assert their own claims, but cannot circumvent existing consent decrees. In cases where a parent cannot pursue claims on behalf of their child, they may amend the complaint to assert their own claims. Parents have been found to have \"personal rights to enforce FAPE\" and can survive attempts to dismiss their claims. However, parents cannot use their rights to circumvent existing consent decrees. The extent of parental rights, as determined by Winkelman, varies among courts, with some extending them to cases under Section 504 and the ADA. However, not all courts agree with this interpretation, as seen in D.A. and M.A. v. Pleasantville School District. In D.A. and M.A. v. Pleasantville School District, the court found that Winkelman's emphasis on parental involvement was not applicable to Section 504 and the ADA. Other parental rights issues, such as recovering damages under IDEA, have been addressed in cases like Blanchard v. Morton School District and Fuentes v. Board of Education of New York City. The Second Circuit in Fuentes v. Board of Education of New York City addressed the rights of a noncustodial parent in making educational decisions for their child under IDEA. IDEA, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and the ADA all play significant roles in ensuring the education rights of individuals with disabilities. Each statute has its own provisions, with IDEA being a grants and civil rights statute, while Section 504 and the ADA focus on the rights of individuals with disabilities to education. IDEA, Section 504, and the ADA are significant statutes in ensuring education rights for individuals with disabilities. While IDEA is a grants and civil rights statute, Section 504 and the ADA focus on prohibiting discrimination. The ADA has broader coverage than Section 504, which is tied to federal financial assistance. The interaction of these statutes in educational coverage has been examined by courts, noting differences in coverage. The Supreme Court's decision in Schaffer v. Weast clarified that the burden of proof in an IDEA due process hearing rests with the party seeking relief. This ruling addressed the issue of who bears the burden of proof regarding an allegedly inadequate IEP. The burden of proof in an IDEA due process hearing lies with the party seeking relief, as clarified by the Supreme Court in Schaffer v. Weast. Justice O'Connor emphasized that the burden of persuasion typically falls on the party seeking relief, rejecting arguments that the school system should bear the burden due to their informational advantage. The Court noted that IDEA safeguards parents' procedural rights, including the right to review records and receive information about options considered by the school district. The IDEA provides parents with rights to review records, independent evaluations, details on school district options, and attorneys' fees if they prevail. This ensures schools do not have an informational advantage. Controversies arise over services for disabled children in private schools, with costs covered by the school district or parents. Under IDEA, a child with a disability can be placed in a private school by the LEA or SEA, with costs covered by them. Parents can also unilaterally place their child in a private school, but reimbursement is only possible if certain conditions are met. IDEA mandates some services for children in private schools, even if parents place them there unilaterally. The current statutory provisions allow parents to enroll a child in a private school under IDEA, with possible reimbursement if the public agency fails to provide timely education. Recent Supreme Court cases have addressed tuition reimbursement for parents who place their child in a private school without prior special education from the public school. In a 2007 decision, the Supreme Court allowed private school reimbursement for parents of a child with a disability, even if the child had never received special education services from the public school. This decision did not set a precedent for lower courts, leaving the issue unsettled. However, in 2009, the Supreme Court ruled that reimbursement for private special education services is authorized under IDEA when a public school fails to provide a FAPE and the private school placement is appropriate, regardless of prior special education services. In Forest Grove School District v. T.A., IDEA allows reimbursement for private special-education services if a public school fails to provide a FAPE and the private-school placement is suitable. Recent lower court decisions have found that if a child is making educational progress with an IEP from the public school, they may not be entitled to private school placement or tuition reimbursement. The same standards apply when parents want to place their child in a different private school. If a private school does not meet the child's needs, the court may not require tuition reimbursement. Private school tuition reimbursement may be denied if the school does not adequately address the child's educational needs or if parents arrange for private school services without notifying the LEA. Reimbursement may also be barred if parents act unreasonably or if procedural violations do not result in substantive harm. However, reimbursement is allowed if the child has not previously received special education services and if the school district has deprived the child of FAPE. If a school district is found to have deprived a child with a disability of FAPE, the child may be entitled to private school reimbursement or compensatory education. Compensatory education is the award of prospective educational services to compensate for a previous inadequate program, derived from the Supreme Court's ruling in School Committee of the Town of Burlington v. Department of Education of Massachusetts. This ruling allows parents to obtain reimbursement for private school tuition if the public school program violates FAPE. Parents who place a child in a private school due to public school program violations of FAPE may seek reimbursement for tuition. Courts differ on awarding compensatory education, some granting it for the same time services were withheld, while others focus on providing appropriate education under IDEA. The IEP for children receiving compensatory education may require more services than a general IEP. Section 1983 allows suits against state officials for rights deprivation under state law. The IDEA procedural remedies must be exhausted before filing a \u00a71983 action for deprivation of rights. The application of section 1983 to IDEA, with damages for pain and suffering, is unclear. Some courts allow damages, while others do not. The original version of IDEA did not provide for attorneys' fees, but prevailing parties used other statutes for fee awards. The Supreme Court ruled that remedies under IDEA are limited to those in the statute. The Supreme Court ruled in Smith v. Robinson that remedies under IDEA are limited to those in the statute, not allowing the use of other statutes for attorneys' fees. Congress later enacted the Handicapped Children's Protection Act in 1986 to provide for attorneys' fees under IDEA, with amendments in 1997 and 2004. These amendments allowed for fee reduction if specific information was not provided and excluded fees for most IEP meetings. The 2004 IDEA reauthorization, P.L. 108-446, allowed attorneys' fees for the state or local educational agency against parents or their attorneys in certain situations. The ADA permits courts to award attorneys' fees to the prevailing party, rejecting the \"catalyst theory\" for fee eligibility. Buckhannon Board and Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Department of Human Resources established that fees are only available with a judicially sanctioned change in the parties' legal relationship. The Court rejected the \"catalyst theory\" for attorneys' fees eligibility, stating that fees are only available with a judicially sanctioned change in the parties' legal relationship. Buckhannon Board and Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Department of Human Resources established this principle. Attorneys' fees have been awarded in IDEA cases where there is a legally enforceable result, such as in administrative or judicial proceedings. Fees have been given for misclassification of a child's disability but not for cases where the child's disability under IDEA has not been determined. Attorneys' fees are awarded in IDEA cases for misclassification of a child's disability, but not when the child's disability has not been determined. Fees are only awarded for relief obtained through a settlement agreement with judicial approval. Attorneys' fees will not be awarded for voluntary settlements or private agreements without judicial sanction. Additionally, fees may be awarded to relatives other than parents, such as grandparents, but not for representation by consultants or parent-attorneys. Courts have discretion in determining the amount of attorneys' fees to award. Attorneys' fees in IDEA cases are awarded for relief obtained through a settlement agreement with judicial approval. Courts have discretion in determining the amount of fees to award, and may award less than the full amount requested based on the party's degree of success. A fee cap was first imposed on IDEA cases in the District of Columbia in FY1999. The 2004 IDEA reauthorization added a provision allowing courts to award attorneys' fees to a prevailing party in cases where the parent's attorney's actions were deemed frivolous or unreasonable. In El Paso Independent School District v. Berry, the Fifth Circuit permitted attorneys' fees to be awarded against a lawyer who obstructed relief and refused to cooperate in evaluating the student. In El Paso Independent School District v. Berry, the Fifth Circuit allowed attorneys' fees to be awarded against a lawyer who obstructed relief and refused to cooperate in evaluating the student. The fee-shifting provision does not apply to private schools, and the mere fact that parents do not prevail in court does not make their action frivolous. The Ninth Circuit emphasized that lawyers should not be discouraged from taking on potentially meritorious IDEA cases. Several cases have examined whether the LEA was the prevailing party. In El Paso Independent School District v. Richard R, the Fifth Circuit ruled that the school district did not prevail on educational issues and thus was not entitled to attorneys' fees. Similarly, in District of Columbia v. Straus, the D.C. Court of Appeals refused to award fees for the school district as it was not considered a prevailing party. The court highlighted concerns about allowing districts to ignore legal obligations until sued, comply quickly, and then recover attorney's fees from parents' lawyers. Some lower courts have interpreted the language on attorneys' fees but there is no specific provision for expert witness fees for prevailing parents. The Supreme Court held that IDEA does not allow prevailing parents to recover expert witness fees, despite the interpretation of attorneys' fees language by lower courts. The Supreme Court ruled that the Handicapped Children's Protection Act does not authorize prevailing parents to recover fees paid to experts under IDEA, despite lower courts' interpretation of attorneys' fees language. Congress introduced bills in the 112th Congress to amend IDEA to include expert witness fees. H.R. 1208 and S. 613 in the 112th Congress aimed to include expert witness fees in IDEA. IDEA has due process procedures and state complaint resolution systems. The Department of Education monitors IDEA implementation. Courts have addressed systemic complaints under IDEA. Congress established protection and advocacy systems in 1975. The Ninth Circuit rejected an LEA's suit against the SEA for violating IDEA. Congress established protection and advocacy systems in 1975 to protect individuals with disabilities. P & A's often file class action lawsuits for systemic violations, including issues related to access to student records."
