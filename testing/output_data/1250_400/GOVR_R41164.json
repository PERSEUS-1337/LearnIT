    "content": "The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act allocated $7.2 billion for broadband grants and loans, split between the NTIA/DOC and RUS/USDA. NTIA received $4.35 billion for a competitive grant program called BTOP, while RUS received $2.5 billion for broadband projects in rural areas. The law requires 75% of the area served by eligible projects to be rural. The RUS broadband grant and loan program is known as the Broadband Initiatives Program (BIP). P.L. 111-226 rescinded $302 million of unobligated BTOP money. There were two rounds of ARRA broadband funding, with all funds awarded by September 30, 2010. This report focuses on the distribution of ARRA broadband funding. The ARRA mandated that all funding be obligated and awarded by September 30, 2010. As of October 1, 2010, all ARRA broadband funds have been awarded. This report focuses on the distribution of ARRA broadband funding, including breakdown of applications and awards data. The first funding round was announced on July 1, 2009, with grants and loans falling into different project categories such as last mile, middle mile, public computer centers, and sustainable broadband adoption. The ARRA broadband funding included grants for last mile and middle mile projects, public computer centers, and sustainable broadband adoption. Projects could be in remote or nonremote areas, with over 2,200 applications requesting nearly $28 billion in funding during the first round. In September 2009, NTIA and RUS released data on over 2,200 applications requesting nearly $28 billion in funding for broadband projects across all 50 states. The federal funding requested was seven times the available amount in the first round. In January 2010, NTIA and RUS announced the second round of funding with $4.8 billion available, split between BTOP and BIP programs. Changes were made to streamline the application process based on feedback from the first round. Each agency had its own NOFA, and applicants could apply to either BTOP or BIP, but not both. In the second round of BTOP and BIP funding, NTIA and RUS made significant changes to the application process. Each agency had its own separate NOFA, with NTIA/BTOP focusing on middle mile broadband infrastructure projects and RUS/BIP on last mile projects. BTOP shifted towards Comprehensive Community Infrastructure grants for middle mile projects, while BIP offered a standard grant/loan combination for all projects. The requirement for projects to cover \"unserved\" or \"underserved\" areas was eliminated in the second round. In the second round of funding, BIP projects required coverage of at least 75% rural areas without High Speed Access broadband service. Eligible BTOP projects needed a nonfederal match of 20% or more. BIP introduced three new grant programs: Satellite Projects, Rural Library Broadband, and Technical Assistance. NTIA received 867 applications for second round funding totaling $11 billion. In the second round of funding, NTIA and RUS received a total of 1643 applications requesting $22.2 billion in federal funds. This was 26% less than the first round in terms of applications and 21% less in funding requested. RUS received 27 applications for Satellite Projects, 51 applications for Technical Assistance, and 2 applications for Rural Library Broadband. In the second round of funding, NTIA and RUS received 1643 applications requesting $22.2 billion in federal funds, 26% less than the first round. RUS received 27 applications for Satellite Projects, 51 for Technical Assistance, and 2 for Rural Library Broadband. NTIA and RUS announced awards for 553 projects totaling $7.5 billion, including 233 BTOP projects ($3.9 billion) and 320 BIP projects ($3.6 billion). $6.2 billion was grant funding, and $1.3 billion was loan funding. Awards data breakdown by project category, broadband technology deployed, and state-by-state distribution is available. Awards data for broadband infrastructure funding from NTIA and RUS include breakdowns by project category and program. Half of the funding went to middle mile projects, while the other half went to last mile projects. Most loan funding was awarded to last mile projects. Fiber projects made up 56% of all funded infrastructure projects. Deployment of broadband infrastructure includes various technologies such as fiber, wireless, cable modem, DSL, and satellite. 56% of funded projects are fiber-based, with most projects involving a combination of fiber and wireless technologies. State-by-state breakdowns of funding are provided in the tables, with NTIA and RUS moving towards monitoring after the awards process. Table A-2 shows per capita funding by state for broadband projects. Funding is associated with a state based on the service area covered. NTIA and RUS are monitoring the progress of funded projects, which must be completed within three years. The Administration requested $23.7 million for NTIA's grant management office in FY2011. NTIA awarded a $5 million contract to ASR Analytics to measure the impact of BTOP grants on broadband availability and adoption. The NTIA has awarded a $5 million contract to ASR Analytics to measure the impact of BTOP grants on broadband availability, adoption, and economic and social conditions in areas served by grantees. The 112th Congress is likely to provide oversight on NTIA and RUS efforts to monitor funded projects, while the FCC's National Broadband Plan recommends expanding federal funding for broadband deployment in unserved areas. Funding patterns and trends from previous rounds of funding could provide insights into the future of broadband grant and loan programs."
