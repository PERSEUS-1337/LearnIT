    "content": "The bill is titled the \"Freedom to Fish Act\" and includes findings related to fishing rights. Congress finds that recreational fishing is a popular outdoor sport with over 50 million participants nationwide, contributing $116 billion annually to the economy and supporting over 1.2 million jobs. Recreational anglers also show a strong conservation ethic by contributing over $500 million annually to state fisheries conservation programs. Recreational anglers contribute over $500 million annually to state fisheries conservation programs and demonstrate a strong conservation ethic. Federal policies support public access to public lands and waters for recreational purposes while maintaining fishery resources through various management measures. Recreational fishery resources can be maintained through management measures like take limits, size requirements, catch and release rules, gear adaptations, and closed seasons. A clear policy is needed to show anglers that recreational fishing can be managed without unnecessary restrictions. A comprehensive policy on marine protected areas is necessary to balance recreational fishing with sustaining fishery resources. SEC. 3. POLICY. The United States aims to promote conservation of fishery resources by ensuring federal regulations prioritize access for recreational anglers and involve them in decision-making. Limitations on access are only imposed if scientifically necessary for conservation. SEC. 4. MAGNUSON-STEVENS FISHERY CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT ACT AMENDMENTS. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is amended to limit closures on recreational fishing areas unless there is clear evidence that recreational fishing is causing a specific conservation issue, and alternative measures are not sufficient. Management plans must include measurable criteria and undergo periodic reviews to assess the need for the closure every three years based on scientific information. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is amended to limit closures on recreational fishing areas unless there is clear evidence that recreational fishing is causing a specific conservation issue. The closure must be supported by the best available scientific information and undergo periodic reviews every three years. The prohibition is to be terminated once the condition that led to the closure no longer exists. Technical amendments are made to ensure clarity in the text. SEC. 5. NATIONAL MARINE SANCTUARIES ACT AMENDMENT. Section 304(a)(5) of the National Marine Sanctuaries Act is amended to allow Regional Fishery Management Councils to draft fishing regulations for the exclusive economic zone in accordance with the Magnuson Act. Regulations may also extend to fisheries within a state with approval from the Governor or determination by the Secretary. Regulations may extend to fisheries within a state if approved by the Governor or determined by the Secretary after a hearing. The Secretary must notify the State and Council of a decision to regulate a fishery, and a hearing may be requested by the State. The Secretary must conduct a hearing before regulating a fishery within the State's boundaries. The Secretary can regulate a fishery within a State's boundaries under certain conditions. If the Secretary assumes regulation, the State can request reinstatement of authority over the fishery. If the reasons for regulation no longer apply, the Secretary must promptly terminate it."
