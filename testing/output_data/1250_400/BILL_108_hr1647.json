    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Crane Conservation Act of 2003\". Congress finds that crane populations in many countries are declining, endangering species in Africa, Asia, and Europe. Five Asian crane species are listed as endangered, and the Crane Action Plan identifies several threatened species from Africa and Asia. The Crane Action Plan identifies 5 seriously threatened crane species, including the wattled crane, blue crane, grey-crowned crane, black-crowned crane, and sarus crane. The whooping crane and Mississippi sandhill crane are listed as endangered species, with both remaining vulnerable to extinction due to low population numbers. Conservation resources have been insufficient to address the decline in crane populations. The whooping crane and Mississippi sandhill crane are endangered species with low population numbers, making them vulnerable to extinction. Conservation resources have been inadequate to address the decline in crane populations. Cranes are flagship species for wetland, grassland, and agricultural conservation, with threats including egg collection, poisoning from insecticides, power line collisions, and disturbance from human activities. The threats to cranes include egg collection, poisoning from insecticides, power line collisions, disturbance from human activities, and trapping for sale. International cooperation is needed to address these threats and conserve crane populations worldwide. Cranes serve as ambassadors for promoting goodwill among countries due to their migration across continents. Conservation successes in one region can be applied to other regions where cranes face similar threats. Conservation successes and methods developed in one region have wide applicability in other regions where cranes face similar threats. Conservationists in the United States can learn from colleagues in other countries where government and private agencies cooperate to conserve threatened cranes. The purposes of this Act are to perpetuate healthy populations of cranes, support conservation programs in countries where endangered cranes occur, assist private organizations dedicated to crane conservation, and provide financial resources for these efforts. The term \"conservation\" in this Act refers to methods ensuring wild crane populations are sufficient to prevent extinction, including habitat protection, research, management plans, enforcement, and community involvement. The curr_chunk outlines various activities related to crane conservation, including management plan development, enforcement of the Convention, law enforcement, habitat protection, reintroduction of cranes, conflict resolution, and community outreach. It also defines key terms such as \"Convention,\" \"Fund,\" and \"Secretary.\" The curr_chunk focuses on crane conservation assistance. The Secretary will use funds from the Fund to provide financial assistance for crane conservation projects approved by the Secretary. Eligible applicants include wildlife management authorities in countries within the range of crane species. Eligible applicants for financial assistance for crane conservation projects include wildlife management authorities in countries within the range of crane species, the Secretariat of the Convention, and individuals or organizations with expertise in crane conservation. Project proposals must include a statement of purpose, names of project personnel, and their qualifications. The curr_chunk outlines the requirements for project proposals, including a concise statement of purpose, names and qualifications of project personnel, methods for implementation and assessment, estimated funds and time needed, evidence of government support, and information on funding sources. The Secretary requires project proposals to include evidence of government support, details on matching funding, and any other necessary information for eligibility. The Secretary reviews proposals within 30 days and consults with other Federal officials before approving or disapproving them. The Secretary, after receiving a project proposal, consults with other Federal officials and the government of each country involved. Within 180 days, the Secretary approves or disapproves the proposal and notifies the applicant and relevant officials. The Secretary approves or disapproves project proposals within 180 days and notifies the applicant, relevant officials, and countries involved. Approval criteria include enhancing conservation programs, addressing human-crane conflicts, ensuring compliance with laws, and developing scientific monitoring methods. The Secretary approves or disapproves project proposals within 180 days, focusing on enhancing conservation programs, addressing human-crane conflicts, ensuring compliance with laws, developing scientific monitoring methods, promoting cooperative projects, carrying out necessary scientific research, and reintroducing cranes successfully back into the wild. The Secretary gives preference to project proposals that ensure long-term conservation of cranes and habitats, or have matching funds available. Recipients of assistance must submit project reports periodically to the Secretary. The Secretary convenes a panel of experts biennially to evaluate projects for the conservation of cranes and wetlands. Reports on project progress must be submitted periodically and made available to the public. The Secretary convenes a panel of experts biennially to identify conservation needs for cranes and wetlands. The panel evaluates projects and reports on progress must be made public. The Crane Conservation Fund is established under Section 6. The Crane Conservation Fund is established within the Multinational Species Conservation Fund. It consists of transferred amounts, appropriations, and interest earned. The Fund allows for expenditures to provide assistance as determined by the Secretary, including administrative expenses. The Secretary can transfer necessary amounts from the Crane Conservation Fund for assistance, with a limit on administrative expenses. Not more than 50% of the Fund can be used for North American crane conservation projects. The Treasury Secretary can invest the Fund in US interest-bearing obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury can invest the Fund in US interest-bearing obligations, with the option to acquire or sell obligations at market prices. The interest and proceeds from these investments will be credited to the Fund. Amounts required to be transferred to the Fund will be done monthly from the general fund of the Treasury based on estimates by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Fund will receive transfers from the general fund of the Treasury on a monthly basis, based on estimates by the Secretary of the Treasury. Donations can be accepted by the Secretary to provide assistance under section 5, with the received amounts being transferred to the Treasury for deposit into the Fund. The Secretary may convene an advisory group of individuals involved in crane conservation to assist in carrying out the Act. The advisory group must hold open meetings, provide opportunities for public input, and keep minutes available to the public. $3,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated to the Fund annually from 2004 to 2007."
