The Congress finds a shortage of foster and adoptive parents, with a decrease in foster parents despite an increase in children in foster care. There is a significant need for post-adoption services due to the rise in adoptions from foster care. One Church, One Child is a national foster care and adoption ministry founded in 1980 in Chicago, Illinois. It aims to provide services for at-risk children and support adoptive, foster, and kinship families. Despite its success in placing over 140,000 children in adoptive families, the organization receives limited federal funding.
