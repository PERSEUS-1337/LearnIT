    "content": "Section 1 introduces a new section in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, SEC. 1259, which deals with constructive sales treatment for appreciated financial positions. Section 1 introduces SEC. 1259 in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, which outlines the treatment for constructive sales of appreciated financial positions. If there is a constructive sale of an appreciated financial position, the taxpayer must recognize gain as if the position were sold at fair market value on the date of the constructive sale. Proper adjustments are made for any subsequent gains or losses realized, and the holding period is determined as if the position was acquired on the date of the constructive sale. An appreciated financial position refers to any position with potential gain if sold, such as stock, debt instrument, or partnership interest. For tax purposes, a taxpayer is considered to have made a constructive sale of an appreciated financial position if they engage in certain transactions like short sales, notional principal contracts, or futures contracts involving the same or similar property. An appreciated financial position refers to any interest with potential gain upon sale, such as stock, debt instrument, or partnership interest. A constructive sale of an appreciated financial position occurs when a taxpayer engages in transactions involving the same or similar property, such as notional principal contracts, futures contracts, or acquiring substantially identical property. This does not include transactions marked to market under specific sections. The term 'constructive sale' excludes transactions marked to market under specific sections, sales of nonpublicly traded property within 1 year, and transactions closed by year end with recognized gain or loss. In applying this section, disregarded are any appreciated financial positions sold or disposed of with recognized gain or loss during the taxable year, and any other constructive sale transactions closed before the end of the year, with no similar transactions entered into within 31 days. A person is related to another person for a transaction if the relationship is described in specific sections. For tax purposes, a person is considered related to another person in a transaction if the relationship falls under specific sections. Positions in interest rates are treated as substantially identical to debt instruments. Definitions include forward contracts and offsetting notional principal contracts. The term 'offsetting notional principal contract' refers to an agreement to pay the investment yield on a property in exchange for reimbursement for any decline in its value. Special rules apply to subsequent sales of positions deemed sold, with specific conditions to determine constructive sales for tax purposes. For tax purposes, if a transaction results in the constructive sale of a financial position, it is treated as if the taxpayer entered into the transaction immediately after the sale. An interest in a trust actively traded is treated as stock. When there is a constructive sale of a portion of property, the specific property deemed sold is determined as if it were an actual sale, disregarding any prior constructive sales that remain open. For tax purposes, a constructive sale of property by a taxpayer is treated as an actual sale, disregarding any prior open constructive sales. The Secretary can prescribe regulations to carry out this section. Securities traders can elect mark to market accounting for securities held in connection with their trade or business. For tax purposes, a person engaged in the trade or business of being an active trader in securities can elect to be treated as a dealer in securities. Securities held in connection with this trade or business shall be treated as not held for investment. This election can be made without the consent of the Secretary and applies to the taxable year for which it is made and all subsequent years unless revoked with the Secretary's consent. Sec. 1259 addresses the constructive sales treatment for appreciated financial positions. The effective date specifies that the amendments apply to constructive sales after the enactment of the Act, and also to sales after January 12, 1996, under certain conditions. The section discusses the treatment of constructive sales for appreciated financial positions, with specific rules for cases involving a decedent. The sale of a position open with respect to a decedent or related person, where gain has not been recognized under section 1259 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, will be treated as property constituting rights to receive income under section 691 of the Code. Securities traders can elect to be treated as dealers for taxable years beginning after the enactment of the Act. Taxpayers can elect to change their accounting method over a 5-year period starting from the first taxable year after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 2. LIMITATION ON EXCEPTION FOR INVESTMENT COMPANIES UNDER SECTION 351. Amends section 351(e) of the Internal Revenue Code to include all stock and securities in determining if a company is an investment company. Effective for transfers after the enactment of this Act in taxable years ending after such date."
