    "content": "In enacting the CAA of 1970, Congress differentiated between existing and new stationary sources of air pollution. Existing sources were given flexibility by states to set emission limits, while new sources had to adhere to strict technology-based standards set by the EPA. The 1977 amendments further strengthened regulations in areas where air quality exceeded national standards. The EPA sets strict technology-based standards for new sources of air pollution, known as NSPSs. The 1977 amendments require major new sources in clean or dirty air areas to undergo NSR before construction, with emission limits based on best available control technology or lowest achievable emission rate. The CAA also applies NSPSs and NSR to modifications of existing sources. The Clean Air Act applies strict standards for new sources of air pollution, known as NSPSs, and requires NSR for modifications of existing sources. The key issue is determining what changes to a stationary source constitute a \"modification,\" defined as any physical change that increases emissions or results in new emissions. The Clean Air Act defines \"modification\" as any physical change in a stationary source that increases emissions or results in new emissions. This definition determines which changes trigger NSPSs and NSR. The definition leaves questions unanswered and has been the subject of litigation. A \"reconstruction\" of an existing facility can also trigger NSPSs and NSR if the fixed capital cost of new components exceeds 50 percent of the fixed. A \"reconstruction\" of an existing facility can trigger NSPSs and NSR if the fixed capital cost of new components exceeds 50 percent of the fixed capital cost that would be required to construct a comparable entirely new facility. Modifications can also trigger NSPSs and NSR, with EPA defining \"modification\" as any physical change in a stationary source that increases emissions or results in new emissions. EPA has exceptions for certain changes that do not constitute modifications, such as maintenance, repair, and replacement. The EPA has exceptions for changes in stationary sources that do not constitute modifications, such as maintenance, repair, and replacement. The most debated exception is for routine maintenance, repair, and replacement activities. Eligibility for this exemption was determined through case-by-case analysis until recently. The EPA's case-by-case approach in the WEPCO case ruled that extensive renovations for a life extension program triggered NSPS and PSD-area NSR permits. The court found the proposal to go beyond routine maintenance, repair, and replacement due to the substantial and unprecedented work, infrequency, and high cost involved. The RMRR exemption has been a focal point in recent years, especially with CAA enforcement actions against electric utilities. The RMRR exemption has been a focal point in recent years, with CAA enforcement actions against electric utilities. In response, President Bush's National Energy Policy Development Group directed EPA to review the impact of NSR on investment in new utility and refinery generation capacity. This led to EPA publishing final regulations in December 2002 affecting how sources calculate emission increases for NSR purposes. In June 2002, a report to the President discussed the impact of NSR regulations and proposed specifying categories of activities as \"routine maintenance.\" In December 2002, EPA published final regulations for NSR emission calculations and proposed a rule to clarify the RMRR exception. The Eleventh Circuit's decision in EPA v. Whitman involved the EPA's determination that TVA violated the CAA through projects exceeding RMRR without permits. The Eleventh Circuit found that the CAA allows EPA to issue ACOs as law, but penalties for noncompliance must be proven in district court. TVA was deemed free to violate ACOs without penalty. The 2003 final rule reshaped RMRR by declaring certain equipment replacement activities as per se RMRR. The 2003 final rule reshaped the RMRR exception by declaring specific equipment replacement activities as per se RMRR, providing greater regulatory certainty without sacrificing environmental protection. EPA's new approach addresses criticism of the old case-by-case method, allowing for the replacement of components with identical ones or their functional equivalents. EPA has not yet taken action on the proposed annual maintenance, repair, and replacement \"allowance.\" The EPA's new rule specifies that replacing components of a process unit with identical ones or their functional equivalents constitutes RMRR if the replacement cost is less than 20% of the unit's current value and does not alter its design parameters. This approach allows for more component replacements compared to the previous case-by-case method, with the latter still available as an alternative. The new rule does not require recordkeeping. The EPA's new rule allows for more component replacements under the RMRR approach, with the former case-by-case method still available as an alternative. The rule does not impose recordkeeping requirements and applies only to conduct after its effective date. Multiple lawsuits challenge the rule, arguing it exceeds EPA's authority under the CAA. Several states, including those in the Northeast, California, Illinois, New Mexico, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia, along with environmental groups, are challenging the EPA's equipment-replacement RMRR rule, arguing it goes beyond the agency's authority under the CAA. The lawsuits have been consolidated under the case State of New York v. Environmental Protection Agency. The court granted a motion to stay the rule on December 24, 2003, citing irreparable harm and likelihood of success on the merits. This suspension means the old case-by-case approach remains in effect for now. The court also declined to consolidate these actions with other cases challenging a previous rule but assigned the same panel to handle both sets of cases. The court, on December 24, declined to consolidate the above actions with another group of cases challenging a previous rule but agreed to designate the same panel for both sets of cases due to their related nature."
