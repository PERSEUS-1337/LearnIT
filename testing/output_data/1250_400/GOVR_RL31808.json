The House of Representatives passed H.R. 2989, providing $85.8 billion, including additional funding for highways and the deletion of grants-in-aid to airports. The FY2004 budget consolidated appropriations for the Department of Transportation and the Department of the Treasury into a single bill due to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. This resulted in the transfer of agencies like the United States Coast Guard and the Transportation Security Administration to DHS. The FY2004 budget consolidated appropriations for the Department of Transportation and the Department of the Treasury into a single bill as part of creating the Department of Homeland Security. This involved transferring agencies like the United States Coast Guard and the Transportation Security Administration to DHS, along with other agencies like the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Budget numbers were adjusted for comparison with previous years. The House divides its appropriation bill into six titles, while the Senate has five titles. The FY2003 Consolidated Appropriations Resolution included a 0.65% across-the-board rescission for most accounts in the Department of Transportation and Department of the Treasury.

The FY2004 budget for the Department of Transportation and the Department of the Treasury was consolidated into a single bill as part of creating the Department of Homeland Security. The budget request was $85.9 billion, $740 million below the final FY2003-enacted figure. The Senate and House had differences in budget allocations, with funding for two programs being struck during House deliberations on H.R. 2989. During House deliberations on H.R. 2989, funding for two programs was removed due to disputes over the way funds were provided, reducing total transportation funding in the bill from $58.4 billion to $54.9 billion. The total funding in the bill dropped from $89.3 billion to $85.8 billion. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 included an across-the-board rescission of 0.59%, not reflected in these figures. Funding trends for Transportation/Treasury Appropriations from FY1999-FY2004 are shown in Table 3. The House of Representatives Committee on Appropriations provided a comparative statement of budget authority tables for fiscal years 1999 through 2004. Adjustments were made to figures for Department of Transportation and Department of the Treasury appropriations for FY1999-FY2003 for comparison with FY2004. Across-the-board rescissions were included in FY2001, FY2003, and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004. The Department of Transportation budget for FY2004 was proposed at $54.3 billion, which was 2.6% lower than the previous year. The budget request aligned with the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century and the Wendell Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act of the 21st Century. Some changes were proposed to the highway and transit funding structure in line with the Administration's reauthorization proposal. The FY2004 Department of Transportation budget proposed changes to the highway and transit funding structure in line with the Administration's reauthorization proposal. The budget included funding details from the Transportation-Treasury Appropriations bill, with some programs facing disputes during House deliberations. During House deliberations on H.R. 2989, funding for two programs was struck due to disputes over the way funds were being provided: FAA's Grants-in-Aid to Airports program ($3.425 billion) and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's Border Enforcement program ($47 million). This reduced total transportation funding in the bill by those amounts, which may be restored in conference. Additionally, there were across-the-board rescissions and additional funding allocations for various programs, including the Essential Air Service program and grants for motor carrier safety activities. The FY2004 funding for various transportation programs includes $102 million for the Essential Air Service program, $187 million for the Appalachian Development Highway System, and additional funding for motor carrier safety activities. NHTSA's budget includes $100 million transferred from FHWA, and Amtrak's repayment of a $100 million loan was postponed. The total resources for RSPA in FY2003 were $119 million, and for FY2004, it was $132 million. The FY2004 funding for transportation programs includes $102 million for Essential Air Service, $187 million for Appalachian Development Highway System, and additional funding for motor carrier safety. The total resources for RSPA in FY2003 were $119 million, and for FY2004, it was $132 million. The FAA received $13.93 billion in FY2004, a $440 million increase from FY2003. The funding differed slightly from the House and Senate bills. The FY2004 funding for transportation programs includes an increase in funding for the FAA to $13.93 billion, with the majority allocated for Operations & Maintenance expenses. The funding sources include the Airport and Airway Trust Fund and Treasury general fund contributions. The Administration aimed to increase the general fund contribution, reaching $3.4 billion for FY2004. The FY2004 Act allocated $4.5 billion from the general fund for FAA funding, a significant increase from previous years. Operations and Maintenance spending for FY2004 is set at $7.5 billion, representing a notable increase from the previous year. The FY2004 Act provides $7.5 billion for Operations and Maintenance (O&M) spending, with a focus on salaries for FAA personnel in air traffic control and safety-related activities. For Facilities and Equipment (F&E), $2.91 billion is allocated, with a Senate proposal to transfer funds to the Airport Improvement Program dropped in Conference. F&E funding is primarily used for capital investment in air traffic control and safety. The FY2004 Act allocates $2.91 billion for Facilities and Equipment (F&E) spending, with no significant new initiatives. Research, Engineering, and Development (RE&D) receives $119.4 million, below the FY2003 level. The Essential Air Service (EAS) program operates through the Office of the Secretary of Transportation and has an annual funding level of $50 million. The Essential Air Service (EAS) program, funded through user fees from foreign aircraft overflights, has an annual authorized funding level of $50 million. However, additional funding sources have been necessary. In FY2003, $102 million was allocated for the program, with $50 million from its regular authorization and $52 million from the aviation trust fund. The FY2004 Act also provides $102 million for EAS, rejecting the overflight fee as the main funding mechanism and precluding a pilot cost-sharing program. This funding level is consistent with Senate proposals and $11 million less than House proposals, despite the Bush Administration's calls for a reduction in program size. The FY2004 Act provides $102 million for the Essential Air Service program, rejecting the Bush Administration's proposal to reduce the program size. The Airport Improvement Program receives $3.425 billion, with $20 million allocated for the Small Community Air Service Program. The FAA is directed to prioritize projects listed in the report language for AIP discretionary grants. The House-reported bill recommended $3.425 billion for AIP, $25 million above the Administration's proposal. AIP discretionary grants directed FAA to prioritize projects at listed airports. House-passed bill contained no funding for AIP, while the Senate-passed bill provided $3.5 billion for AIP, including a $100 million transfer from the F&E account. The bill also included a prohibition against using AIP grants for certain airport improvements. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 (P.L. 108-199) provides $3.4 billion for AIP grants, with restrictions on using funds for certain airport improvements and projects at specific airports. The Act prohibits the implementation of a ten-city Essential Air Service program and includes funding for airport projects at nearly 150 airports totaling just under $258 million. The recently passed FAA reauthorization Act includes a ten-city Essential Air Service program and funding for airport projects at nearly 150 airports totaling just under $258 million. The FHWA budget for FY2004 was requested at $30.2 billion, a decrease from the previous year. The proposed obligation limitation was set at $29.3 billion, with funding for exempt programs at $931 million. The budget also proposed changes reflecting the Administration's surface transportation reauthorization proposal. The FY2004 FHWA budget proposed funding of $931 million for exempt programs, including emergency relief and minimum guarantee funding. It also included a new $1.0 billion Infrastructure Performance and Maintenance initiative. The budget aimed to redirect gasohol excise tax revenues to the highway trust fund, projected to add $600 million in FY2004. The House-passed FY2004 appropriations bill included these proposals. The House and Senate passed FY2004 appropriations bills for FHWA, with the House proposing $34.6 billion and the Senate proposing $34.8 billion. Both bills included redirecting gasohol excise tax revenues to the highway trust fund, adding roughly $600 million in funding. Earmarking of federal-aid highway discretionary programs continued in both bills. The Senate-passed FY2004 appropriations bill for FHWA provided $34.8 billion, with heavily earmarked discretionary programs. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004, allocated $34.7 billion for FHWA, slightly higher than the House total and slightly lower than the Senate total, representing an increase of more than 6% over the FY2003 enacted total. The FY2004 Consolidated Appropriations Act allocated $34.7 billion for FHWA, slightly higher than the House total and slightly lower than the Senate total. This represents an increase of more than 6% over the FY2003 enacted total. Project earmarking heavily earmarked discretionary programs under FHWA. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 earmarks funds for various core formula programs, including the Interstate Maintenance Program, National Highway System, Surface Transportation Program, Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program, and Highway Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation Program. Over $1 billion of unobligated core program funds are earmarked for projects, with a 100% federal share for funding. This is a departure from past practices where the federal share was determined by the program. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 provides funding for core programs with a 100% federal share, a departure from past practices. Nearly $300 million of unobligated funds are allocated for interagency transfers and project earmarks, including funds for the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, construction of Pennsylvania Avenue, and Amber Alert grants. Additionally, $150 million is allocated for the Appalachian Development Highway System, with $75 million earmarked.

The TEA-21 Funding Framework, which created the largest surface transportation program in U.S. history, continues to operate on the basis of extensions until new authorizing legislation emerges. TEA-21 established the largest surface transportation program in U.S. history, continuing existing highway and transit programs from ISTEA. The core federal-aid highway programs include NHS, IM, STP, BRR, and CMAQ, apportioned annually by formula. Additional funding includes minimum guarantee and emergency relief funds, not subject to annual obligation limits. The \"exempt\" category of highway funding includes minimum guarantee funding and emergency relief funds, not subject to annual obligation limits. The \"allocated\" programs are under the direct control of FHWA or other governmental entities, including the Federal Lands Highway Program and High Priority Projects. FMCSA, created in 1999, enforces federal motor carrier safety regulations. The FMCSA, established in 1999, enforces federal motor carrier safety regulations, issues licenses for commercial drivers, conducts inspections of Mexican-domiciled commercial drivers and vehicles entering the US, and administers grants for truck and bus safety programs funded by the Highway Trust Fund.

The Administration requested $665 million for NHTSA in FY2004, with $447 million designated for traffic safety incentives. The Administration requested $447 million in FY2004 to support traffic safety incentive and performance grants to states, primarily for occupant protection measures and reducing impaired driving. Additionally, $218 million was allocated for NHTSA's operations and research activities to reduce highway fatalities and prevent injuries, including research, highway safety programs, safety assurance, and safety performance standards. The House, Senate, and conference agreement recommended funding for NHTSA and FRA in FY2004. NHTSA received $451.1 million for highway traffic safety grants and operations. FRA received $1.455 billion, with most funding going to Amtrak. Amtrak received $1.225 billion, and $131 million was allocated for railroad safety and operations. Most of FRA's funding is for Amtrak, with the Administration requesting $900 million, the House agreeing to $900 million, the Senate agreeing to $1.346 billion, and P.L. 108-199 providing $1.225 billion. Additionally, $131 million was allocated for railroad safety and operations, $35 million for railroad research and development, and $23 million for next generation high-speed rail. Conferees agreed on $37 million for high-speed rail. The President requested $23 million for high-speed rail, $7 million less than last year. The House agreed to $28 million, the Senate agreed to $29 million, and conferees settled on $37 million. The FRA budget debate focuses on Amtrak, agency safety activities, Next Generation High-Speed Rail, and state funding for high-speed rail initiatives. The FRA's safety program received $131.2 million in FY2004, a 13% increase from FY2003. The House, Senate, and conference agreement allocated around $130.8 million for safety and operations. The FY2004 DOT appropriations for rail safety and operations saw a 13% increase to $130.8 million, with funds mainly used for staff salaries, travel, training, and safety monitoring. The funding supports goals of reducing rail accidents, grade-crossing accidents, and hazardous materials incidents. Despite the last reauthorization of the railroad safety statute in 1994, funding authority expired in FY1998, leading to ongoing debates on funding for regulatory activities and existing authorities. The FRA's safety program continued using existing authorities and annual appropriations after the funding authority expired in FY1998. Deliberations on funding for regulatory activities and existing authorities have not resulted in agreement. To improve railroad safety, the FRA conducts R&D on topics like employee fatigue and train movement control. The FY2003 DOT appropriation provided $29.1 million for R&D, with a request for $35 million in FY2004. The House Committee recommended $28.2 million, and the Senate Committee recommended...

The final appropriation in P.L. 108-199 was $37.4 million, combining various projects from both House and Senate bills. Amtrak requested $900 million, but received $900 million from the House, with concerns raised about its survival on that amount. Amtrak requested $1.8 billion for FY2004 but received $900 million from the House, which they said was insufficient for survival. The Senate approved $1.346 billion for Amtrak, extending funding requirements to all routes. P.L. 108-199 provided $1.225 billion, postponed loan repayment, and introduced competitive bidding for state-supported routes. P.L. 108-199 introduced competitive bidding for state-supported routes currently operated by Amtrak, allowing states to contract with non-Amtrak operators. The Secretary of Transportation has the power to compel Amtrak to provide equipment and services if terms cannot be agreed upon. Amtrak's funding for FY2003 was stipulated to go through the Secretary of Transportation via the grant-making process, reducing Amtrak's discretion with federal funding. Congress also required Amtrak to submit a 5-year business plan in 2003. In FY2003, Congress imposed requirements on Amtrak, including submitting a 5-year business plan requesting $1.6 billion annually for maintenance needs. Authorization for Amtrak expired in FY2002, with bills proposed for reauthorization at $2 billion annually for three to six years. Various bills aim to change federal passenger rail policy.

The fund aims to facilitate the development of a Public Key Infrastructure for secure online communications and implement the Government Paperwork Elimination Act of 1998. The Bush Administration later doubled the fund to $20 million. The Electronic Government Fund, established with $10 million in 2002, grew to $100 million over three years to support interagency e-gov initiatives. The fund aims to develop secure online communications and implement the Government Paperwork Elimination Act of 1998. Congress appropriated $5 million for the fund in FY2002, with transfers to federal agencies requiring a spending plan and justification submitted to the Committees on Appropriations. The administration submitted a spending plan for the Electronic Government Fund to the Committees on Appropriations. Both chambers agreed to clarify the fund's authorization status. The President's budget for FY2003 recognized GSA as the operator of the federal portal for citizen access to government services. The budget sought $45 million for the e-gov fund, a significant increase from the previous year. The Administration sought $45 million for the e-gov fund, a significant increase from the previous year. The House appropriators recommended $5 million for the fund, emphasizing the need for project plans and justifications before transferring funds to federal agencies. The House Committee recommended $5 million for the e-gov fund, requiring project plans and justifications before transferring funds to federal agencies. The Senate, however, supported the full $45 million requested by the President, stating that the Office of Management and Budget would control fund allocation for information systems projects. Ultimately, the final funding provided was $5 million. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) received an allocation of $316.3 million, with $256.7 million designated for operating expenses. NARA is responsible for preserving federal records, administering presidential libraries, and assisting in federal security classification and declassification policy. The funding also supports the National Historical Publications and Records Commission (NHPRC) in making grants to nonprofit organizations for preserving materials documenting American history. The Senate and House allocated $316.3 million for NARA, with $256.7 million for operating expenses. $35.9 million was recommended for the electronic records archive, $13.7 million for repairs and restoration, and $10 million for the NHPRC. Specific projects included $500,000 for a study, $2.25 million for land acquisition in Alaska, and $5 million for repairs at the Lyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library. The Senate and House allocated $316.3 million for NARA, with $256.7 million for operating expenses, $35.9 million for the electronic records archive, $13.7 million for repairs and restoration, and $10 million for the NHPRC. Specific projects included $500,000 for a study, $2.25 million for land acquisition in Alaska, and $5 million for repairs at the Lyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library. The Senate initially approved $276.674 million for NARA for FY2004, with $258.191 million proposed for operating expenses, $13.483 million for repairs and restoration, $2.025 million for a regional archival facility in Alaska, $5 million for the Lyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library plaza repair, and $5 million for the NHPRC. The House initially approved $299.8 million for NARA, with $255.2 million proposed for operating expenses. The House approved $299.8 million for NARA, $255.2 million for operating expenses, $35.9 million for electronic records archive, and funds for repairs and restoration. The President's budget requested $305.6 million for FY2004, with increased funding for operating expenses compared to FY2003. The NHPRC received twice the amount requested by the President. The President's FY2004 budget proposed $35.5 million for the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), an 11.6% increase from FY2003. The budget includes funds for employee and managerial development opportunities and compliance with the Accountability of Tax Dollars Act of 2002. The President's FY2004 budget proposed an appropriation of $35.5 million for the MSPB, an 11.6% increase from FY2003. The budget includes funds for employee and managerial development opportunities and compliance with the Accountability of Tax Dollars Act of 2002. Beginning in fiscal year 2004, the MSPB is not requesting funds be transferred from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Trust Fund. Instead, the funding previously supplied from the Trust Fund for adjudication of Civil Service Retirement appeals is being requested as part of the regular appropriation total. The President's FY2004 budget proposed an appropriation of $35.5 million for the MSPB, an 11.6% increase from FY2003. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations recommended, and the law provides an appropriation of $32.9 million, $2.6 million less than the President's request. Up to $2.6 million for administrative expenses could be transferred from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund to adjudicate retirement appeals. The conferees agreed to the trust fund transfer rather than providing a direct appropriation as the President had requested. The House committee report on H.R. 2989 discusses the budget authority for current appropriations for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). OPM is responsible for administering personnel functions and developing human resources management systems to support agency missions. The agency's divisions focus on designing policies, implementing human capital strategies, and providing retirement and insurance programs. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is responsible for administering personnel functions and developing human resources management systems to support agency missions. The agency's divisions assist agencies in implementing human capital strategies, administering retirement and insurance programs, and conducting audits and investigations. The President's FY2004 budget proposed an appropriation of $18.0 billion for OPM, including discretionary and mandatory funding for various programs. The FY2004 budget included $1.5 million for OIG salaries and expenses, $7.5 billion for government payment for annuitants' health benefits, $35.0 million for annuitants' life insurance, and $10.0 billion for civil service retirement and disability fund. Trust fund transfers of $135.9 million for salaries and expenses and $14.4 million for OIG salaries and expenses were also included. OPM's budget requested $118.7 million for salaries and expenses, including funds for information technology support, e-Government projects, and program evaluation. The budget also mentioned funding for more audit staff and special agent criminal investigators for the OIG. The budget request for OPM in FY2004 includes funding for e-Government projects, program evaluation, and increased audit staff for the OIG. The budget is 8.8% higher than the previous year, with specific increases and decreases in various areas of funding. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended and passed the budget. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended an appropriation of $119.498 million for salaries and expenses for OPM in FY2004, including funding for e-Government projects and program evaluation. This amount includes specific allocations for various projects such as enterprise human resources integration, modernizing federal payroll systems, and program evaluation. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended funding for OPM in FY2004, including trust fund transfers for salaries and expenses. The Committee also directed OPM to provide additional funding for a retirement readiness project with InFRE and to certify that any transfer of DSS functions will not impact OPM's current workload. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended funding for OPM in FY2004, including trust fund transfers for salaries and expenses. The Committee directed OPM to award money to InFRE for a retirement readiness project and report on the progress within 60 days. OPM was also urged to certify that transferring DSS functions will not affect its workload, notify Committees of any delays in PBMs research, complete an audit on FEHBP costs, and consider including Hampshire and Hampden counties in the Hartford Locality Pay Area. Additionally, OPM was directed to conduct a study on the number of eligible Federal employees and retirees not covered by FEHBP. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended the same appropriations as the President requested for OPM in FY2004. The Committee directed OPM to conduct a study on eligible Federal employees and retirees not covered by FEHBP, including reasons for lack of coverage and employment details. The Committee also addressed OPM's modernization program for its retirement system. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended the same appropriations as the President requested for OPM in FY2004. The Committee directed OPM to conduct a study on eligible Federal employees and retirees not covered by FEHBP, including reasons for lack of coverage and employment details. Additionally, the Committee addressed OPM's ongoing program to modernize its retirement system, expressing disappointment in the lack of cooperation and directing GAO to conduct a comprehensive audit on the problems and mismanagement of the modernization project. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended the same appropriations as the President requested for OPM in FY2004. The Committee directed GAO to conduct a comprehensive audit on the problems and mismanagement of the modernization project. Senator Grassley proposed an amendment to prohibit funds from being used to implement regulations related to the detail of executive branch employees to the legislative branch. Senator Grassley proposed an amendment to prohibit funds from being used to implement regulations proposed by OPM on September 9, 2003, relating to the detail of executive branch employees to the legislative branch. The regulation seeks to reduce the time detailees can spend in Congress to 6 months, limiting their activities and micro-managing from afar, which Senator Grassley finds unacceptable. Additionally, the President's FY2004 budget proposed a $500 million appropriation for the Human Capital Performance Fund to create performance-driven pay systems for employees. The President's FY2004 budget proposed a $500 million appropriation for the Human Capital Performance Fund, aiming to create performance-driven pay systems for employees. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $2.5 million, significantly less than the President's request, with funding contingent upon legislation authorizing the fund's creation within OPM. The House passed an appropriation of $2.5 million for the Human Capital Performance Fund, $497.5 million less than the President's request. Funding is contingent upon legislation authorizing the fund's creation within OPM. The Senate did not recommend or pass an appropriation for the fund, believing it should be budgeted and administered within individual agencies. The law provides an appropriation of $1 million, with funds not to be obligated until legislation establishes the fund within OPM. The report accompanying S. 1589 states that the $1 million appropriation for the Human Capital Performance Fund should be budgeted and administered within individual agencies. The Office of Special Counsel investigates federal employee allegations, prosecutes matters before the Merit Systems Protection Board, enforces the Hatch Act, and provides a channel for whistleblowing. The President's FY2004 budget proposed an appropriation of $13.5 million. The Office of Special Counsel (OSC) enforces the Hatch Act and provides a channel for whistleblowing by federal employees. The President's FY2004 budget proposed an appropriation of $13.5 million for the OSC, with a focus on reducing case processing backlogs. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations recommended and passed the same appropriation as requested. The report also briefly discusses general provisions related to government-wide policies. The report discusses general provisions related to government-wide policies, including the Buy America Act and drug-free federal workplaces. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004, contains new or modified policies. The Administration's proposed language for these provisions can be found in the Appendix. The Administration's proposed language for government-wide general provisions can be found in the Appendix. Most of the general provisions continued language which has appeared for several years. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 has enacted an average 4.1% increase in General Schedule pay, retroactive to January 1, 2004. This includes a 2% adjustment. Federal white-collar employees under the General Schedule will benefit from this increase. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 has enacted a 4.1% increase in General Schedule pay, retroactive to January 1, 2004. This includes a 2% adjustment based on the Federal Pay Comparability Act of 1990. The full pay increase for the General Schedule was 4.1%, with no stipulation on how the additional 1% would be apportioned. The salary schedules for federal civilian personnel were adjusted in January 2003, with a 4.1% increase in the General Schedule pay. An additional 1% increase was retroactively applied to locality-based comparability payments. In January 2004, a 2.0% pay increase was proposed, with an alternative plan of 1.5% increase in basic pay and 0.5% increase in locality pay. Congress had not finalized legislation for other rates, so the President's plan went into effect. In January 2004, the President's plan for pay increases for civilian and military personnel went into effect, with a 4.1% increase proposed. The pay provision allowed for the increase to be split between basic and locality pay, with 2.7% for basic pay and 1.4% for locality-based payments. The Federal Wage System (FWS) compensates federal blue-collar workers at prevailing local wage rates. The Federal Wage System (FWS) compensates federal blue-collar workers at prevailing local wage rates. Congress has limited the rates of adjustment for FWS wages based on the rates of adjustment for the General Schedule. In high-cost areas, FWS wages are capped to prevent them from exceeding salaries paid to General Schedule supervisors. In high-cost areas, Federal Wage System (FWS) wages are capped to prevent them from exceeding salaries paid to General Schedule supervisors. The Monroney Amendment extended out-of-area survey application to Department of Defense personnel. Senior Executive Service salaries were changed under the National Defense Authorization Act for 2004, with rates ranging from $103,700 to $158,100 for those in agencies with certified performance appraisal systems. The National Defense Authorization Act for 2004 changed Senior Executive Service salaries, capping rates at $103,700 to $158,100 for those in agencies with certified performance appraisal systems. A 2% across-the-board increase with a performance component was proposed, along with a $500 million fund for top-performing individuals. Members of Congress, Judges, and other officials are set for a 2.2% pay adjustment in January 2004. The pay adjustment for Members of Congress, Judges, and other federal officials is set at 2.2% effective January 2004. Despite a previous limit of 1.5%, the full adjustment will be retroactive. An amendment to deny the pay increase for Members was tabled by the Senate. Pay adjustments are based on ECI calculations, with a cap tied to the General Schedule base pay adjustment rate. Pay adjustments for federal officials, including Members of Congress and judges, are based on ECI calculations. The ECI calculations dictate a pay adjustment of 2.2% in January 2004, but the statute limits adjustments to the rate of adjustment for the General Schedule base pay, which was 1.5%. No bill language is needed for the automatic pay adjustment process. Judges require specific authorization for annual pay increases, as seen in P.L. 108-167. The President's salary was set at $400,000 per annum effective January 20, 2001. The Federal Employees Compensation Act (FECA) provides workers' compensation benefits for Federal employees injured on the job. Costs are reimbursed through agency budgets to the Labor Department, which administers the program. Former Presidents receive a pension equal to Cabinet Secretaries' pay rate. The Federal Employees Compensation Act (FECA) provides workers' compensation benefits for Federal employees injured on the job. The Administration proposed changes to charge administrative costs to employing agencies to improve workplace safety. The surcharge would be around 3.5% of benefit costs, mainly paid by the U.S. Postal Service and the Defense Department. The Administration proposed a surcharge to cover administrative costs for FECA benefits, mainly to be paid by the U.S. Postal Service and the Defense Department. The Administration supported competitive sourcing and objected to any hindrance in the process, even threatening a veto if funding for public-private competitions was prohibited. The Office of Management and Budget successfully altered or removed some competitive sourcing provisions in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004. The Office of Management and Budget successfully altered or removed competitive sourcing provisions in H.R. 2673, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004. Competitive sourcing is part of the President's Management Agenda and involves public-private competitions for federal executive agencies. The enacted versions of the competitive sourcing provisions are found in Section 647 of H.R. 2673 (P.L. 108-199), Division F, Title VI. Section 647 of H.R. 2673 (P.L. 108-199) imposes conditions on competitions involving more than 10 federal employees in departments funded by the Department of Transportation and Treasury. It requires the development of a Most Efficient Organization (MEO) plan and consideration of the conversion differential, potentially impacting streamlined competitions. Section 647(a) of H.R. 2673 imposes conditions on competitions involving federal employees in certain departments. It requires consideration of the conversion differential in streamlined competitions, potentially impacting contractor costs. The competitive sourcing official must assess if contractor performance would be less costly to the agency by $10 million or 10% of personnel costs. The criteria for comparison and implementation remain unclear. The CSO must assess if contractor performance would be less costly to the agency by $10 million or 10% of personnel costs in streamlined competitions. The criteria for comparison and implementation remain unclear. Section 647(b) requires executive agencies to submit annual reports on competitive sourcing activities to Congress. The agencies must add the conversion differential to the non-incumbent's performance cost as per Circular A-76. Section 647(b) mandates executive agencies to submit annual reports to Congress on competitive sourcing activities, including completed competitions, costs, savings, FTEs, and decision-making processes. This reporting requirement aids congressional oversight and informs OMB policy and agency decisions. However, the lack of a standardized methodology for data collection poses a challenge. The absence of a standardized methodology for data collection in the sourcing decision-making process could detract from its usefulness and add to competitive sourcing costs. Agency heads are not required to limit the performance period in a letter of obligation to five years or less under Section 647(c), potentially resulting in less frequent recompetitions for MEOs. This modification may lead to different treatment for government agencies and private sector sources in public-private competitions. Allowing agencies to write letters of obligation with performance periods longer than five years could mitigate recruitment or retention problems among federal government employees concerned about frequent recompetitions. Section 647(d) permits agency heads to use funds for monitoring activities post-public-private competitions, supporting oversight efforts and enhancing decision-making. Section 647(e) prohibits moving work converted to contractor performance outside the US if previously done by federal employees within the US. This could impact competitive bids and job retention in the US. The provision aims to retain jobs in the United States by preventing work from being outsourced to other countries where costs may be cheaper. However, certain provisions in the appropriations bill were dropped, including restrictions on travel-related transactions and Cuba-related provisions, due to the threat of a veto from the White House. The conference dropped two Cuba provisions from the House version of H.R. 2989 on remittances and people-to-people educational exchanges, in response to the White House's threat of a veto over weakening economic sanctions against Cuba. U.S. policy towards Cuba has historically focused on isolating the Communist government through comprehensive sanctions, including a trade embargo and restrictions on financial transactions and travel. The Cuban Democracy Act and the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act imposed sanctions on financial transactions with Cuba. There are differing opinions in Congress on how to approach U.S. policy towards Cuba, with some advocating for maximum pressure on the Cuban government, others calling for the lifting of certain sanctions, and still others pushing for a swift normalization of U.S.-Cuban relations by lifting the embargo. Some advocate maximum pressure on the Cuban government until reforms are enacted, others argue for lifting some U.S. sanctions believed to hurt the Cuban people, and still others call for swift normalization of U.S.-Cuban relations by lifting the embargo. House-approved H.R. 2929 had provisions to prevent funds from enforcing travel and remittance restrictions, and eliminating the travel category of people-to-people educational exchanges. Restrictions on travel have been a contentious component in U.S. efforts to isolate Cuba. Restrictions on travel to Cuba have been a key component in U.S. efforts to isolate the country. Certain categories of travelers, such as government officials, journalists, and athletes, can travel under general licenses. Supporters of easing travel restrictions argue that it can help promote freedom in Cuba, while opponents believe it infringes on Americans' rights. Supporters of easing travel restrictions to Cuba argue that it can promote freedom and expose Cubans to alternative information. Opponents believe that not enforcing the restrictions would provide the Cuban government with tourist revenue while cracking down on democracy activists. H.Amdt. 377 (Delahunt) aimed to prevent funds from enforcing restrictions on remittances, allowing Cuban Americans to send unlimited financial support. In March 2003, OFAC amended Cuba travel regulations to allow travelers to carry up to $3,000 in remittances, with a $300 limit per quarter for Cuban households. Supporters of lifting the cap on remittances argued for unlimited financial support for Cuban Americans, while opponents feared more money would go to the Cuban regime. H.Amdt. 382 (Davis) aimed to prevent the elimination of people-to-people educational exchanges, which became section 749 of the House bill. OFAC also tightened regulations on certain types of educational travel, restricting people-to-people exchanges unrelated to academic coursework. Cuba travel regulations were tightened for certain types of educational travel, specifically people-to-people exchanges unrelated to academic coursework. Some groups supported the restriction, while others criticized it for limiting ordinary people's ability to travel and exchange with counterparts on the island. In Senate action, a motion to prevent funds from enforcing Cuba travel restrictions was defeated. The Senate provision mirrored a similar amendment in the House bill, with the only difference being the timeline for enactment. The Dorgan amendment, similar to the Flake amendment, was defeated in a vote of 59-36. Momentum for easing U.S. sanctions on Cuba was impacted by Cuba's human rights crackdown in 2003. The House-approved Cuba amendments to H.R. 2989 had less support compared to previous years. The Flake amendment to H.R. 2989 was approved by a vote of 227-188. For more information, refer to CRS Report RL31740 and CRS Report RL31139 on Cuba issues and U.S. restrictions on travel. The curr_chunk provides a list of abbreviations related to transportation and aviation programs, including ARC, AIP, AIR21, ARAA, ATSA, BRR, BTS, CG, CMAQ, DOT, EAS, F&E, FAA, FAHP, FAIR21, FHWA, and FRA. Abbreviations related to transportation and aviation programs include EAS, F&E, FAA, FAHP, FAIR21, FHWA, FRA, FTA, Hazmat, HPP, HTF, IM, ITS, MCSAP, New Starts, NHS, NHTSA, NMCSA, O&M, OIG, OST, RABA, and RD&T. The Department of Transportation (DOT) budget includes various programs such as NHTSA, NMCSA, O&M, OIG, OST, RABA, RD&T, RE&D, RSPA, SCASD, STB, STP, TCSP, TEA-21, TIFIA, and TSA. Funding for the DOT budget comes from dedicated transportation trust funds and is considered part of the discretionary budget. The Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act program (TIFIA) and Transportation Security Administration (TSA) are part of the Department of Transportation's (DOT) budget, which is funded by transportation trust funds and federal Treasury general funds. Trust funds, including the highway trust fund and airport and airway trust fund, account for the majority of DOT funding. Highway and transit programs receive contract authority from the highway trust fund, making it a significant source of funding. During the 105th and 106th Congresses, legislation changed the relationships between transportation trust funds and the federal budget, with the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) being a significant development. Highway and transit funding, funded through contract authority from the highway trust fund, constitute a large portion of DOT appropriations. Contract authority allows for funds to be automatically available at the start of each fiscal year, without the need for new appropriations legislation. This setup differs from most federal programs, where new budget authority is required annually. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) changed the relationships between transportation trust funds and the federal budget. It linked annual spending for highway programs directly to revenue collections for the highway trust fund and created a \"firewall\" around highway and transit spending programs to make it difficult for funding levels to be altered. Funding guarantees were set up to prevent changes in funding levels through the annual budget/appropriations process. Additional highway funds can be provided annually through a mechanism called \"Revenue Aligned Budget Authority\" (RABA). TEA-21 established funding guarantees to prevent changes in funding levels through the annual budget process. The Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA) mechanism allows for additional highway funds annually. The role of House and Senate appropriations committees in determining spending levels for highway and transit programs was changed by TEA-21, limiting their discretion in setting annual obligations. The FY2000, FY2001, and FY2002 appropriations acts saw redistributions of funds among programs and added significant spending projects. Appropriators regained some discretion over highway spending, with FY2001 adding funds for earmarked projects and redirecting funding between programs. The Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (FAIR21 or AIR21) guarantees Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) program spending. The FY2002 Act redistributed RABA funds, transferring some to ineligible agencies under TEA-21. FAIR21 guarantees FAA program spending through point-of-order rules. Spending increased in FY2001 and FY2002, but FAIR21 guarantees are seen as weaker than TEA-21. Congress can waive points-of-order. Transportation appropriators have control over spending for TSA, Coast Guard, Federal Railroad Administration, and smaller DOT programs. Enactment of TEA-21 and FAIR21 gives transportation appropriators control over spending for specific agencies. The budgeting process involves a complex lexicon of budget authority and contract authority, with contract authority providing obligational funding for trust fund-financed programs. Prior to TEA-21, changes in transportation budget spending were achieved through a combination of budget/contract authority changes and limitations on obligations to control outlays in line with congressional budget agreements. TEA-21 limited the role of appropriations in highway and transit programs by setting obligation levels for FY1999 through FY2003. States pay for projects upfront and are reimbursed by the federal government upon completion. Highway and transit grant programs operate on a reimbursable basis. The TEA-21 Act limited appropriations in highway and transit programs by setting obligation levels for FY1999 through FY2003. States pay upfront for projects and are reimbursed by the federal government upon completion. Trust fund balances remain high to cover future commitments, including outstanding obligations and unobligated amounts dedicated to projects. The distribution of contract authority funds to states and programs involves apportionments for formula-driven programs and allocations for programs under direct federal control. Apportionments are funds distributed to states, while allocations are distributed administratively to various entities. These terms provide a frame of reference for highway program recipients but are not part of the federal budget process."
