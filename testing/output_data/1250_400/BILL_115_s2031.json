    "content": "The \"Kisatchie National Forest Land Conveyance Act\" authorizes the conveyance of certain Federal land in the Kisatchie National Forest in Louisiana for market value consideration. The Act defines terms such as \"Collins Camp Properties\" and \"Secretary\" for clarity. The Secretary is authorized to convey Federal land in Louisiana by quitclaim deed, including a 2.16-acre parcel. Collins Camp Properties has the first right of purchase within a 1-year period. During a 1-year period, Collins Camp Properties has the first right to purchase Federal land in Louisiana, including Collins Campsites and a 2.16-acre parcel, with the Secretary able to configure the land for marketability or management objectives and establish terms and conditions for the conveyance. The Act allows for the conveyance of Federal land to maximize marketability or achieve management objectives, with terms and conditions set by the Secretary. Consideration for the conveyance must be in cash and equal to the market value of the land. The market value is determined through appraisal or competitive sale. The Secretary can approve conveyance of Federal land through appraisal standards or competitive sale. Hazardous substances disclosure is required, but the Secretary is not obligated to remediate them. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act still applies to Federal land conveyances. SEC. 5 states that proceeds from the sale of Federal land will be deposited into a specific fund. SEC. 6 addresses the administration of the process. As part of the conveyance of Federal land to Collins Camp Properties, the Secretary will require payment for appraisal costs, administrative, and environmental analyses. Collins Camp Properties must obtain written statements from holders of Forest Service special use authorizations agreeing to relinquish them upon acquisition of the land. Failure to provide written authorization will result in Collins Camp Properties administering the special use authorization according to its terms. If the holder of a special use authorization fails to provide a written authorization, the Secretary will require Collins Camp Properties to administer the authorization until it expires."
