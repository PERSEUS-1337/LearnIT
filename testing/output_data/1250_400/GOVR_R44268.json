    "content": "During the Vietnam War, Operation Ranch Hand sprayed millions of gallons of herbicides, including Agent Orange, over southern Vietnam. The area remains contaminated with TCDD, a toxic chemical, with hot spots at airbases and the A Luoi Valley. The environmental damage and health issues caused by Agent Orange have prompted a response from the U.S. The A Luoi Valley, a former U.S. military base west of Danang, was heavily sprayed during the Vietnam War as part of the Ho Chi Minh Trail. The U.S. has responded to the environmental damage and health problems caused by Agent Orange in Vietnam, with efforts to remove dioxin from Danang Airport and cleanup at Bien Hoa Air Base. This has been seen as advancing bilateral relations between the two nations. Danang Airport is nearly complete, with the United States assisting in the cleanup at Bien Hoa Air Base. A joint statement highlighted Vietnam's cooperation in the dioxin remediation at Danang International Airport and the ongoing cleanup at Bien Hoa Air Base. The Trump Administration has reaffirmed its commitment to addressing the Agent Orange/dioxin issue in Vietnam. President Trump and Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc have pledged to work together on war legacy issues, including dioxin remediation. Under Secretary of State Thomas Shannon and Senior Lieutenant General Nguyen Phuong Nam celebrated the completion of these efforts on November 10, 2017. The United States and Vietnam have been collaborating on environmental remediation efforts, including dioxin cleanup at Danang Airport and plans for continued collaboration at Bien Hoa Airport. A Memorandum of Intent was signed in 2018 for the decontamination of Bien Hoa. Congress has allocated $254.8 million for Agent Orange/dioxin remediation and health programs in Vietnam since 2007. The 112th Congress appropriated funds for environmental remediation and health programs in Vietnam, with more funds allocated for remediation. The actual amount available for assistance may be less than specified due to provisions of the Foreign Assistance Act. The 115th Congress authorized the transfer of funds for the Bien Hoa dioxin cleanup. Funds for remediation are allocated under the State Department's Economic Support Fund account. The 115th Congress authorized funds transfer for the Bien Hoa dioxin cleanup in Vietnam from the Department of Defense's \"Operation and Maintenance, Defense-wide\" account. Funds for environmental remediation and health programs in Vietnam have been allocated under the State Department's Economic Support Fund account. The State Department has delegated fund administration to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Most of the environmental remediation focused on Danang airport, with funds used for disability support programs in Danang and other parts of Vietnam. Cleanup at Danang airport is completed, and joint dioxin removal operations are planned at Bien Hoa airbase. The U.S. and Vietnamese governments have completed cleanup at Danang airport and are planning joint dioxin removal operations at Bien Hoa airbase. Funds have been allocated for disability support programs in Vietnam, administered by the State Department and USAID. Vietnam's central government established Office 33 to oversee policies on Agent Orange and dioxin. Office 33, an interministerial body in Vietnam, oversees government policy on Agent Orange and dioxin. Congressional interest focuses on allocating funds for environmental remediation and health programs in affected areas, as well as oversight of fund usage by the State Department and USAID. The State Department and USAID are responsible for allocating and spending funds for Agent Orange/dioxin cleanup and health programs in Vietnam. Congress has appropriated a total of $18 million for these efforts, with $3 million initially allocated in 2007. The 111th Congress appropriated a total of $18 million for dioxin cleanup and health services in Vietnam. In 2009 and 2010, Congress allocated $3 million for Agent Orange/dioxin remediation and health care assistance in Danang, with an additional $12 million for dioxin contamination at Danang Airport. State Department and USAID also allocated $1.9 million for environmental remediation at the airport in FY2010. The 111th Congress allocated $18 million for dioxin cleanup and health services in Vietnam. In addition, the State Department and USAID allocated $1.9 million for environmental remediation at Danang airport. The 113th Congress continued to appropriate funds for the environmental remediation of Agent Orange/dioxin in Vietnam and related health services. The 113th Congress allocated funds for environmental remediation of Agent Orange/dioxin in Vietnam and related health services. Appropriations were renewed for FY2013 and FY2014, with $22.0 million for remediation and $7.0 million for health and disability programs. Funds were also made available for dioxin contaminated sites in Vietnam under the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015. Funds appropriated under the \"Economic Support Fund\" and \"Development Assistance\" will be used for remediation of dioxin contaminated sites in Vietnam and health/disability activities in areas affected by Agent Orange. The 114th Congress allocated $7.5 million for health/disability programs and $15.0 million for environmental remediation in Vietnam. The 114th Congress allocated funds for remediation of dioxin contaminated sites in Vietnam and health/disability programs in areas affected by Agent Orange. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 provided funding for these initiatives, with a focus on minimizing administrative costs and maximizing impact through Vietnamese organizations and entities. The Committee aims for health/disability funds to be implemented by Vietnamese organizations. Funding for FY2017 in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 includes $20,000,000 for dioxin remediation and $10,000,000 for health and disability programs in areas affected by Agent Orange. The 115th Congress appropriated funds for health and disability programs in areas affected by Agent Orange and dioxin contamination in Vietnam, allowing assistance to the Government of Vietnam for the first time. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 allocated not less than $20 million for dioxin remediation and not less than $10 million for health and disability programs. The 116th Congress appropriated funds for health and disability programs in areas affected by Agent Orange and dioxin contamination in Vietnam. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 allocated not less than $20 million for dioxin remediation and not less than $12.5 million for health and disability programs. The State Department designated USAID as the responsible agency for the funds. The State Department designated USAID as the responsible agency for funds allocated for Agent Orange/dioxin-related activities in Vietnam. USAID has obligated significant amounts of funds for environmental remediation and health- and disability-related services from FY2007 to FY2017. Congressional attention has been drawn to how USAID has obligated appropriations for health and disability activities. Since FY2007, USAID has allocated funds for Agent Orange/dioxin-related activities in Vietnam, with congressional concerns about the pace and types of programs funded. Congress has designated health and disability services to be provided near contaminated areas, with specific appropriations for environmental remediation and health activities in nearby communities. Funds allocated by USAID for health and disability services in Vietnam have been designated for areas contaminated with Agent Orange/dioxin since FY2007. Congressional appropriations have specified funding for environmental remediation and health activities in affected communities. It is uncertain if all funds have been used according to this guidance, with some funds being directed to a disability support program by Development Alternatives, Inc. from FY2010 to FY2013. Funds for health and disability services in Vietnam were initially allocated to areas contaminated with Agent Orange/dioxin from FY2007-FY2009. However, from FY2010 to FY2013, funds were mainly directed to a disability support program by Development Alternatives, Inc. USAID later returned to directly obligating funds for health- and disability-related services in smaller amounts from FY2014 onwards, increasing outreach to Vietnamese NGOs. One key project funded by congressional appropriations is the environmental remediation at Danang Airport. The environmental remediation project at Danang Airport, funded by congressional appropriations, experienced delays, increased material for decontamination, and rising costs. The project, initially planned for completion in October 2013, was finished in August 2017, with costs escalating from $33.7 million to over $110 million. The decontamination project at Danang Airport faced delays and cost increases. The amount of material to be cleaned rose to 90,000 m3, with an additional 60,000 m3 of lower-risk material. The estimated project cost surged from $33.7 million to over $110 million. Soil samples showed high levels of TCDD toxic equivalents, exceeding international standards. Work began in December 2009 under a memorandum of understanding between the State Department, Vietnam's Ministry of Natural Resources, and USAID. The MOU between USAID and Office 33 allocated $6.0 million for environmental health programs in Danang, including a grant for dioxin containment at the airport. An Environmental Assessment recommended thermal desorption for decontamination, estimating a cost of $33.7 million. A Memorandum of Intent with Vietnam's Ministry of National Defence aimed to start the remediation project in 2011 and finish by 2013. The USAID and Vietnam's Ministry of National Defence signed a Memorandum of Intent in 2010 to remediate Danang airport by in-pile thermal desorption. Contracts were awarded in 2012 to CDM Smith and Tetra Tech, Inc. for project oversight and construction. Onsite work began in August 2012. An internal USAID audit in 2014 highlighted six contracts related to the project. The Danang airport environmental remediation project, awarded $17 million to Tetra Tech, Inc., began in August 2012. An internal USAID audit in 2014 revealed six contracts for the project, including thermal desorption of contaminated soil in two phases. Phase 1, treating 45,000 m3 of soil, started in April 2014 and successfully removed over 95% of dioxin. Phase 2 involved draining lakes for excavation. The decontamination of Danang airport involved removing approximately 45,000 m3 of soil in two phases. Phase 1 started in April 2014 and successfully removed over 95% of dioxin. Phase 2 began in January 2015, with soil treatment completed in August 2017. Progress was delayed due to weather conditions, increased soil testing requirements, and technical issues with the treatment facility. The secondary treatment facility at Danang Airport was shut down in July 2014 to change the filtering system. It took longer than expected to raise the soil temperature to the target level. An internal audit by USAID's Office of Inspector General in November 2014 highlighted potential risks that could delay the project and increase costs, including issues with inclement weather and soil cooling. Recommendations were made for a formal risk management plan, more training for Vietnamese officials, and better data documentation procedures. USAID agreed with the audit's recommendations. The completion of the Danang Airport environmental remediation project took longer and cost more than initially projected by USAID due to underestimating contamination. USAID utilized funds for health/disability activities in areas contaminated with dioxin as part of its support program for persons with disabilities in Vietnam. The dioxin contamination in Danang was deeper than expected, leading to delays and increased costs in the environmental remediation project. USAID has allocated over $60 million for disabled Vietnamese individuals, regardless of the cause of disability, with a focus on areas near Agent Orange/dioxin-contaminated sites. Funding has been used for health services and programs to improve the quality of life for persons with disabilities in Danang. Between FY2007 and FY2010, the State Department and USAID utilized funds for health services grants in Danang to improve the quality of life for persons with disabilities. A 2010 USAID assessment noted accomplishments but mentioned the short timeframe. In 2012, USAID approved a nationwide Persons with Disability Support Program (PDSP) to be implemented with Development Alternatives, Inc. (DAI) and Vietnam Assistance for the Handicapped (VNAH), focusing on Danang and other high-need areas with dioxin hot spots. The PDSP program, funded at $9 million, focused on providing assistance to persons with disabilities in Danang and other high-need areas with dioxin hot spots. DAI awarded grants for health services, rehabilitation therapy, vocational training, and community awareness. USAID also supported VNAH in addressing disability policy and legal framework needs in Vietnam. The program expanded to additional provinces beyond the initial focus areas. The PDSP program, headquartered in Danang, extended to provinces with dioxin hot spots. USAID provided grants to local partners for assistance to persons with disabilities in Vietnam, aiming to improve health and participation in social and economic life. USAID aims to provide direct assistance to improve health, independence, and participation in economic and social life for persons with disabilities in Vietnam. They will offer therapies and training in provinces with high disability prevalence and poverty rates. The environmental cleanup of Danang airport has been completed, and the governments are exploring a similar cleanup of dioxin. The Aspen Institute has identified Ninh, Thai Binh, and Thua Thien-Hue as heavily sprayed areas. USAID will directly administer a new approach in consultation with Vietnamese agencies. The Bien Hoa airbase, a dioxin \"hot spot,\" is being explored for cleanup after Danang airport. Soil samples from Bien Hoa showed high TEQ concentrations, exceeding international limits. The Vietnamese government has taken some mitigation measures, but other dioxin \"hot spots\" remain unaddressed. The Bien Hoa airbase has conducted mitigation measures for dioxin contamination, including a passive landfill for contaminated soil. However, other dioxin \"hot spots\" have not been addressed, leading to soil spreading into nearby water bodies. The UNDP, along with other organizations, has been working on mapping and developing a remediation plan for the airbase, estimating a cost of $250 million for decontaminating 250,000 m3 of soil. USAID has also contracted CDM International Inc. to assess dioxin remediation alternatives at Bien Hoa. In 2014, a joint investigation estimated that 250,000 m3 of soil at Bien Hoa airbase needed decontamination, costing at least $250 million. USAID contracted CDM International Inc. in 2013 to assess dioxin remediation options. The final report in 2016 revealed 408,500 to 495,300 m3 of contaminated soil, with treatment costs ranging from $137 million to $794 million. The estimated costs could vary by 40% to 75%, potentially reaching $1.4 billion. The estimated costs for decontamination methods at Bien Hoa airbase ranged from $137 million to $794 million. USAID has allocated over $3.7 million for environmental assessment. Vietnam's Ministry of National Defence initiated infrastructure construction for dioxin decontamination with a budget of $11.8 million. USAID and Vietnam's Ministry of National Defence signed a memorandum of intent to start the decontamination process. In 2018, USAID and Vietnam's Ministry of National Defence signed a memorandum of intent to decontaminate Bien Hoa airport. The agreement involves a five-year, $183 million aid program to clean up 500,000 cubic meters of soil. The Ministry also partnered with Shimizu Corporation to build a decontamination factory using a filtered sponge technique. In September 2018, the Ministry of National Defence signed a memorandum with Shimizu Corporation to construct a decontamination factory at Bien Hoa airport. The factory will use a filtered sponge technique to decontaminate 500,000 cubic meters of soil, costing half as much as previous methods. U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis visited the site in October 2018, emphasizing America's commitment to remediate past issues with Agent Orange. Congressional interest in providing assistance for environmental cleanup in Vietnam remains a key focus. Congressional interest in Agent Orange/dioxin in Vietnam has focused on providing assistance for environmental damage and health effects, as well as oversight of how funds for decontamination projects are utilized. The State Department regularly requests funding for decontamination of dioxin \"hot spots\" in Vietnam, with Congress generally appropriating funds for health and disability services in affected areas. The Trump Administration has shown support for Agent Orange projects in Vietnam. The State Department regularly requests funding for decontamination of dioxin \"hot spots\" in Vietnam, with Congress generally appropriating funds for health and disability services in affected areas. President Obama's budget requests did not explicitly include funding for health and disability assistance programs for areas contaminated with Agent Orange or dioxin. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 continues the practice of designating funds for health and disability services in places contaminated with Agent Orange/dioxin. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 designates funds for health and disability services in areas contaminated with Agent Orange/dioxin. The Victims of Agent Orange Relief Act of 2019 aims to provide assistance for individuals affected by exposure to Agent Orange, including medical care, vocational training, and equipment. Section 3 of the Victims of Agent Orange Relief Act of 2019 requires the Secretary of State to provide assistance for Vietnamese residents affected by exposure to Agent Orange, including medical care, vocational training, and housing repairs. Section 4 mandates support for research on health issues related to Agent Orange exposure. Section 3 of the Victims of Agent Orange Relief Act of 2019 mandates the Secretary of State to provide assistance for Vietnamese residents affected by Agent Orange exposure, including medical care and environmental remediation in heavily sprayed areas. Additionally, Section 8 requires quarterly reports from the Secretaries of State, Health and Human Services, and Veterans Affairs on the implementation of the Act. The Secretaries of State, Health and Human Services, and Veterans Affairs are required to submit quarterly reports to Congress on the implementation of the Victims of Agent Orange Relief Act of 2019. Congressional oversight has focused on funding for environmental remediation and health services in Vietnam, particularly the rising costs at Danang airport and the slow pace of fund utilization by USAID. Members have raised concerns about the slow pace of fund utilization and changes in USAID's approach to administering funds for environmental remediation projects in Vietnam. The cost of the Danang airport cleanup increased significantly, leading to questions about potential cost overruns at Bien Hoa airport. While USAID managed to keep the Danang project going, there have been challenges in utilizing funds for health services in contaminated areas. Only 63.5% of funds allocated from FY2011 to FY2017 have been obligated, and there have been shifts in USAID's approach to administering these funds. According to USAID, 63.5% of funds allocated from FY2011 to FY2017 for health services in Vietnam have been obligated. There have been changes in USAID's approach to administering these funds, raising concerns about their effectiveness and alignment with congressional priorities. Congressional dissatisfaction with fund management is reflected in legislation, with specific amounts usually detailed in accompanying reports or statements."
