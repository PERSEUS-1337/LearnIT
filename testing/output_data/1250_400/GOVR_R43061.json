Congress has long been concerned about the adequacy of the U.S. science and engineering workforce and has implemented programs to support education and development in these fields. Policymakers have also aimed to increase the number of students pursuing S&E degrees and foreign scientists and engineers working in the U.S. Many programs support the education and development of scientists and engineers. Congress aims to improve STEM skills and increase the number of students pursuing S&E degrees. Policymakers have diverse views on the adequacy of the S&E workforce, including whether there is a shortage and if the federal government should intervene. There is a debate on whether there is a shortage of scientists and engineers in the United States, with some arguing for interventions to address the potential shortage while others believe there is no evidence to support such claims. Federal policies have historically played a role in developing the scientific and engineering workforce. The debate over a shortage of scientists and engineers in the United States is not supported by data on employment growth, wage growth, and unemployment rates. Regardless of shortages, increasing the number of scientists and engineers will boost innovation, economic performance, and job creation. Government interventions to address perceived shortages may introduce inefficiencies. Students with S&E degrees gain valuable skills applicable in various fields. Government interventions to address perceived shortages in the S&E labor market may lead to inefficiencies, such as an oversupply of students with S&E degrees compared to available jobs. Long-term workforce projections are unreliable and may result in mismatches between education and market needs due to unexpected changes in technology, prices, and retirement behavior. Short-term shortages in certain industries or occupations, including new and emerging S&E fields like nanotechnology, may exist. However, the labor market will resolve these needs through wage adjustments, increased supply of S&E graduates, or alternative substitutions. The labor market will resolve short-term shortages in industries like nanotechnology through wage adjustments, increased supply of S&E graduates, or alternative substitutions. Government interventions may be necessary to prevent adverse consequences such as loss of technological leadership, lower economic performance, and diminished national security. Industry claims of shortages are driven by a desire to lower labor costs and increase current knowledge through education, training, and immigration. The real issue is a skills mismatch, not a shortage of people. Expanding immigration can help address the skills mismatch in the Science and Engineering (S&E) workforce by bringing in foreign scientists and engineers to meet the specific skills needed by employers. This will reduce the loss of U.S.-educated foreign nationals with S&E degrees and dampen market signals that would otherwise drive more U.S. students into science and engineering. Expanding immigration to bring in foreign scientists and engineers may depress wages, increase unemployment, and discourage American students from pursuing STEM degrees and careers. Federal efforts to improve STEM education are necessary to address the skills gap and ensure economic competitiveness. Federal efforts are needed to improve STEM education in the U.S. to address the skills gap and ensure economic competitiveness. International assessments may not accurately reflect U.S. student STEM knowledge, leading to concerns about the future capabilities of American scientists and engineers. Federal policies can help strengthen K-12 STEM education and foster the development of the S&E workforce. The federal government plays a role in fostering the development of the S&E workforce through various policies such as increasing the number of students pursuing S&E degrees, admitting foreign scientists and engineers, and improving K-12 STEM education. Congress may consider these perspectives to enhance U.S. competitiveness and leadership in science, engineering, technology, and industry. BLS provides data on the educational composition of S&E occupations to support employment projections. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) publishes data on the educational composition of occupations using the American Community Survey (ACS). The ACS uses a compressed version of the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) system. The occupational composition of S&E occupations is illustrated in charts, with educational levels below associate's degrees aggregated into a category called \"Less than an Associate's degree.\" This category includes individuals with less than a high school diploma, a high school diploma or equivalent, and some college but no degree."
