    "content": "The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA), enacted in 1990, provides one-time cash benefits to individuals exposed to ionizing radiation from atomic weapons testing or uranium industry work. Administered by the DOJ, over 30,000 claims totaling nearly $2 billion have been approved. Most claims are related to atomic weapons testing. Benefits are paid from general revenue and are considered mandatory spending. The DOJ has approved over 30,000 RECA claims totaling nearly $2 billion in benefits, with the majority related to atomic weapons testing. Benefits are paid from general revenue and are considered mandatory spending. All RECA benefit applications must be filed before July 10, 2022, when the program will end. The United States conducted 1,054 atomic weapons tests from 1945 to 1992, with the majority at the Nevada Test Site. The United States conducted 1,054 atomic weapons tests from 1945 to 1992, with the majority at the Nevada Test Site. 928 tests were conducted underground, and 100 were atmospheric tests releasing radioactive material. Atmospheric tests at NTS were conducted between 1951-1958 and 1962. The largest atmospheric test at NTS was the Hood Test in 1957 with an energy yield equivalent to 74,000 tons of TNT. The Nevada Test Site (NTS) conducted atmospheric atomic weapons tests between 1951-1958 and 1962. The largest test was the Hood Test in 1957 with an energy yield equivalent to 74,000 tons of TNT. Benefits under the RECA program include $75,000 for onsite participants, $50,000 for downwinders, and $100,000 for uranium workers. Benefits are one-time lump sum payments not adjusted for inflation and are not subject to federal income tax. Benefits under the RECA program include one-time lump sum payments of $75,000 for onsite participants, $50,000 for downwinders, and $100,000 for uranium workers. These benefits are not subject to federal income tax and are reduced by other payments received for related illnesses or injuries. Eligible uranium workers also receive an additional $50,000 in compensation and medical benefits under EEOICPA. Benefit payments are made directly to the claimant or to eligible survivors in a specific order of precedence. The RECA program provides benefits to eligible survivors in a specific order of precedence if the claimant is deceased. To be eligible for benefits, an onsite participant must meet exposure and disease requirements by being present during atmospheric atomic weapons testing conducted by the United States in specific geographic areas. The RECA program provides benefits to eligible survivors who meet specific geographic and participation requirements related to atmospheric atomic weapons testing conducted by the United States. This includes being present in designated geographic areas during testing periods and up to six months after. The RECA program provides benefits to eligible survivors who were present in designated areas during atmospheric atomic weapons testing, including those who held specific occupations and performed certain activities during and after the testing period. Eligible survivors of atmospheric atomic weapons testing may qualify for benefits if they were involved in specific activities such as decontamination, cloud tracking, or serving on Enewetak atoll during certain time periods. Participants must have contracted one of the listed cancers after exposure to ionizing radiation. Eligible survivors of atmospheric atomic weapons testing may qualify for benefits if they were involved in specific activities such as decontamination, cloud tracking, or serving on Enewetak atoll during certain time periods. Participants must have contracted one of the listed cancers after exposure to ionizing radiation. To be eligible for RECA benefits, downwinders and uranium miners must also meet specific exposure and disease requirements based on their physical presence near NTS or participation in atomic weapons tests. To qualify for RECA benefits, downwinders must have contracted specific cancers after exposure to ionizing radiation from atomic weapons tests at NTS. Uranium miners must have worked in a uranium mine for at least one year between 1942 and 1971, or have been exposed to a certain amount of radiation. The exposure is measured in working-level months (WLM), with specific requirements for developing lung cancer or respiratory diseases. To qualify for RECA benefits, uranium miners and ore transporters must have worked in specific locations between 1941 and 1971 and developed certain diseases after exposure to radiation. The exposure is measured in working-level months (WLM) and specific conditions include lung cancer, renal cancer, and chronic renal diseases. Uranium miners and ore transporters must have worked in specified locations between 1941 and 1971 and developed specific diseases after radiation exposure to qualify for RECA benefits. The DOJ's Civil Division administers the program and requires written documentation of illnesses for benefit claims. Native American applicants must have their application and payment procedures consider Native American law, tradition, and custom. The RECA regulations outline requirements for benefit applications, including consideration of Native American law and customs. Application decisions are made within 12 months, with automatic approval if no decision is reached. The 2000 RECA amendments allow HHS to provide grants for cancer screenings and medical documentation assistance. The Health and Human Services (HHS) provides grants for cancer screenings and medical documentation assistance under the Radiation Exposure Screening and Education Program (RESEP). RESEP clinics in several states offer these services, including one exclusively for Native Americans. Applicants for RECA benefits can appeal denials to the DOJ within 60 days, with the option for judicial review in the U.S. district court if dissatisfied with the outcome. The attorney general of the Civil Division of DOJ handles appeals for RECA benefits. Appeals must be made in writing within 60 days, with options for affirming, reversing, or remanding the initial decision. Applicants can seek judicial review in the U.S. district court if dissatisfied. Licensed attorneys or non-attorney representatives of tribal organizations can represent RECA claimants, with limitations on fees for attorneys based on the date of the contract. Non-attorney representatives cannot charge fees for their services. Limitations on fees for attorneys representing RECA claimants vary based on the date of the contract: 2% for contracts after July 10, 2000, and 10% for contracts before that date. Attorneys can recover costs for unsuccessful claims and expenses for successful claims. Legislation may expand benefits for downwinders and uranium workers. No statutory changes to the RECA program have occurred since 2000. Some Members of Congress are pushing for legislation to expand benefits for downwinders and uranium workers exposed to radiation. Current law limits benefits to those present in specific counties during atmospheric testing at NTS. Concerns have been raised about the health effects of atomic weapons fallout in areas not eligible for benefits. No changes to the RECA program have been made since 2000. Residents outside current downwinder eligibility areas expressed health concerns from atomic weapons testing fallout. Inability to win civil judgments led to the creation of the RECA program in 1990. Bills for compensation were introduced in 1979 for those affected by atmospheric testing at NTS. H.R. 4766 and S. 1865 aimed to make the United States liable for damages caused by atmospheric atomic testing at NTS to downwinders with cancer, onsite participants, and sheep herds. Eligibility for compensation included specific cancer types in designated areas around NTS. A federal advisory board would have been created under the proposed bills. The proposed bills, H.R. 4766 and S. 1865, aimed to hold the United States accountable for damages from atomic testing at NTS to downwinders, onsite participants, and sheep herds. Eligibility for compensation included specific cancer types in designated areas around NTS, with a federal advisory board to oversee the process. The affected areas for downwinder eligibility were outlined in Arizona, Nevada, and Utah. The bill aimed to expand the downwinder eligibility area for compensation under the RECA statute, including areas in Arizona, Nevada, and Utah. Various bills have been introduced to expand eligibility for NTS downwinders over multiple Congresses. Since the 2000 RECA amendments, bills have been introduced to expand downwinder eligibility areas to include Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Guam, and persons affected by fallout from the Trinity test. In 2002, HRSA requested the NRC to study scientific evidence on radiation exposure health effects for Congress. The House report requested the NRC to study radiation exposure health effects for Congress. The NRC recommended a science-based approach for determining downwinder eligibility for RECA benefits, considering factors like location, outdoor time, and milk consumption. The NTC recommended a science-based approach for determining downwinder eligibility for RECA benefits, considering factors like location, outdoor time, and milk consumption. The NRC report suggested using a model of probability of causation to evaluate individual claims for benefits based on absorbed dose of radionuclides. This model would calculate the probability that an individual's specific cancer was caused by exposure to ionizing radiation. The probability of causation model, recommended by the NRC, would estimate cancer causation due to ionizing radiation exposure. This model, similar to EEOICPA and VA programs, could determine eligibility for RECA benefits based on the likelihood of radiation-induced cancer. No legislation has proposed shifting RECA downwinder eligibility from geography to a probability-based model. The NRC recommends a probability of causation model for determining cancer causation from radiation exposure. This model may result in fewer successful claims due to low radiation levels and the weak cancer-causing nature of ionizing radiation. Congress may consider changes to eligibility criteria, but few successful claims are expected. The committee's conclusion on eligibility criteria for RECA benefits for uranium workers is based on scientific information. Changes in criteria may result in few successful claims due to continued uranium mining after the cut-off date. Since the enactment of the Private Ownership of Special Nuclear Materials Act in 1964, private ownership of uranium for nuclear power plants has been legal, creating a new market for mined uranium. Legislation has been introduced to expand RECA eligibility to uranium workers exposed to radiation after 1971, including mine core drillers, and to research health effects of uranium tailing piles. Advocates argue that despite safety regulations, uranium workers, especially miners, remain at risk for radon-induced diseases due to higher radiation exposure limits. Despite safety regulations, uranium workers, especially miners, are at elevated risk for radon-induced diseases due to higher radiation exposure limits. The intent of the RECA program is to provide restitution to individuals affected by fallout from atomic weapons tests and uranium miners working for the nuclear weapons program. Expanding RECA to cover post-1971 uranium activities would benefit workers in the commercial sector. Expanding the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) to cover post-1971 uranium activities would extend benefits to workers in the commercial uranium sector, beyond the original intent of the program. Illnesses from uranium mining for commercial clients may already be covered by state workers' compensation systems."
