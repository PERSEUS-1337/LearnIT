    "content": "The statutory debt limit applies to federal debt held by the public and government accounts, including trust funds like Social Security. Changes in debt held by the public are determined by government surpluses or deficits. Debt held in government accounts is affected by net financial flows. Federal borrowing from the public has increased in most years since the late 1950s due to persistent budget deficits. The federal government has increased borrowing from the public since the late 1950s, except for a few years. The accumulation of trust funds, like Social Security, has led to sustained growth in government-held debt. Congress has periodically raised the debt limit due to the growth in federal debt. When federal debt nears its legal limit, standard methods of financing federal activities can be affected. The Debt Limit Since 2011, discussed in CRS Report R43389, highlights how the U.S. Treasury's ability to borrow is crucial for managing fluctuations in federal revenues and outlays. When the debt nears its limit, financial management becomes more complex, potentially leading to delays in meeting legal obligations if borrowing is restricted. When the federal debt nears the limit, the U.S. Treasury's ability to borrow is restricted, leading to complications in financial management. This could result in delays in meeting legal obligations and hinder the government's ability to pay bills or invest surpluses. Delays in increasing the debt limit could have serious negative consequences for the Treasury market. The U.S. Treasury's ability to borrow may be hindered if the debt limit is not increased on time, leading to delays in meeting obligations and potential default. This could have serious negative consequences for the Treasury market and increase borrowing costs. Delaying payments could result in interest penalties and borrowing from various entities. The U.S. Treasury faces potential default and borrowing cost increases if the debt limit is not increased on time. Delaying payments could incur interest penalties under statutes like the Prompt Payment Act and the Internal Revenue Code. Concerns have been raised by credit ratings agencies and investment banks about the impact on the financial system and global capital markets if Treasury securities are associated with default risks. Past Treasury Secretaries have used special strategies like suspending debt sales and withholding receipts to manage cash and debt responsibilities during debt ceiling constraints. Congress has authorized the Treasury Secretary to invoke a \"debt issuance suspension period.\" The U.S. Treasury has used special strategies to manage cash and debt responsibilities during debt ceiling constraints, including suspending debt sales and withholding receipts. The Treasury Secretary has been authorized to invoke a \"debt issuance suspension period\" to use certain funds and make them whole after easing the debt constraint. The Treasury also sold off mortgage-backed securities to minimize market disruptions, eliminating the portfolio by March 2012. The U.S. Treasury sold off mortgage-backed securities to minimize market disruptions, eliminating the portfolio by March 2012. Proceeds from other asset sales are unlikely to help manage debt operations without an increase in the debt limit. Some suggest using the Fourteenth Amendment to bypass the debt limit, but President Obama and legal analysts reject this idea. The debt limit can hinder the Treasury's ability to manage the government's finances. The debt limit can hinder the Treasury's ability to manage the federal government's finances. It has never caused a federal government default but has led to inconvenience and uncertainty in Treasury operations. The debt limit allows Congress to control spending and imposes fiscal accountability on Congress and the President. The debt limit imposes fiscal accountability on Congress and the President, compelling visible action to allow further federal borrowing when spending exceeds revenues. Some experts argue for eliminating the debt limit, stating that other controls in the budget process have superseded its effectiveness. The Obama Administration has proposed allowing increases in the debt limit subject to congressional disapproval, providing a different leverage for controlling federal spending. The debt limit provides Congress with leverage to control federal spending, separate from the budget process. Committees have specific responsibilities for discretionary and mandatory spending decisions. Restrictions on federal debt help Congress assert its constitutional powers. The form of statutory restrictions on federal debt evolved into an aggregate limit between World War I and World War II. Between World War I and World War II, Congress evolved restrictions on federal debt into an aggregate limit that applied to nearly all outstanding debt. Before World War I, borrowing was often authorized for specific purposes, with Congress specifying details such as financial instruments and interest rates. Concerns were raised about the Treasury Secretary's authority to issue debt affecting monetary policies, but these became less relevant after the establishment of the Federal Reserve System in 1913. The Treasury Secretary's authority to issue debt raised concerns about its impact on monetary policies, but these concerns became less relevant after the establishment of the Federal Reserve System in 1913. The War Revenue Act of 1898 allowed for short-term borrowing through certificates of indebtedness and long-term bonds, with the Treasury Secretary granted significant administrative leeway within specified limits. The Second Liberty Bond Act of 1917 allowed the Treasury to issue $400 million in longer-term notes and bonds, expanding the Treasury Secretary's administrative leeway. It dropped certain limits on bond maturity and redemption, incorporating unused borrowing capacity from previous acts. Subsequent borrowing measures were drafted as amendments to this act until 1982. The Second Liberty Bond Act of 1917 allowed the Treasury to issue $400 million in longer-term notes and bonds, expanding the Treasury Secretary's administrative leeway. Subsequent borrowing measures were drafted as amendments to this act until 1982, reflecting changes in legislative drafting practices. Congress provided Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon with additional leeway in the 1920s to replace expensive federal debt with cheaper new issues, introducing notes and savings certificates for small investors. In the 1930s, Congress moved towards aggregate constraints on federal borrowing, allowing the Treasury greater flexibility in financial management. In the 1930s, Congress granted the U.S. Treasury greater flexibility in issuing bonds, replacing limits with more flexible constraints on federal borrowing. Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau called for a change to focus on managing federal finances rather than tying securities to specific projects or wars. Congress then established limits on shorter-term debt and outstanding bonds in 1935. President Franklin also gave Treasury more flexibility to roll over debt and reintroduced savings certificates for small investors. In the 1930s, Congress granted the U.S. Treasury greater flexibility in issuing bonds, replacing limits with more flexible constraints on federal borrowing. President Franklin Roosevelt and Secretary Morgenthau requested Congress to eliminate separate limits on bonds and other types of debt. The law enacted in July 1939 created an aggregate limit of $45 billion covering nearly all public debt, allowing the Treasury to manage federal debt more freely. The 1939 law replaced separate limits on bonds and other debt with an aggregate limit of $45 billion, giving the Treasury more flexibility in managing federal debt. This allowed for the issuance of debt instruments with maturities to reduce interest costs and minimize financial risks. Additionally, a $4 billion limit for \"National Defense\" series securities was introduced in 1940 but later folded back under an increased aggregate limit of $65 billion in 1941. The debt limit in 1939 was $45 billion, only about 10% above the total federal debt at the time. During World War II, the debt limit was raised to accommodate increasing costs, reaching $300 billion in 1945. After the war, the limit was reduced to $275 billion. The Korean War was mostly financed on a pay-as-you-go basis, keeping the limit at $275 billion until 1954. Temporary increases were approved in 1954, but the limit reverted to $275 billion in 1957. Congress delayed further increases to promote better financial management. In 1953, the debt limit was increased in the State of the Union address, but Congress only approved a temporary increase in August 1954. Subsequent temporary increases followed, with the limit reverting to $275 billion in July 1957. Congress raised the limit in February 1958 to promote better financial management. Since then, there have been 78 measures altering the federal debt limit, with some recent increases being significant, such as the $1.9 trillion increase in February 2010. Since FY1996, federal debt has fluctuated with surpluses and deficits. Debt held by the public has grown due to budget deficits, while debt held in government accounts has increased from Social Security taxes exceeding beneficiary payments. Debt limit increases have been frequent, with significant increases like the $1.9 trillion in February 2010. Federal debt held by government accounts has grown steadily since 1982, in part due to increases in Social Security taxes passed following recommendations of the 1983 Greenspan Commission. Debt held by the public grew as a share of GDP through the mid-1990s, but deficits shrank after FY1992, leading to surpluses from FY1998 through FY2001. However, deficits reemerged in FY2002, increasing debt held by the public as a share of GDP. This accumulation of debt in government accounts added pressure on the debt limit in 2002. In 2002, deficits reemerged, leading to increases in debt held by the public and pressure on the debt limit. The Administration requested Congress to raise the debt limit by $750 billion to $6,700 billion as the debt approached the $5,950 billion limit. The Administration requested Congress to raise the debt limit by $750 billion to $6,700 billion as the debt approached the limit. In April 2002, the Treasury avoided reaching the limit by suspending reinvestment of government securities in the G-Fund. This allowed the Treasury to issue new debt and meet government obligations. By the end of April, debt subject to limit had fallen back $35 billion below the limit. The Treasury avoided reaching the debt limit in April 2002 by suspending reinvestment in the G-Fund. They restored the G-Fund by crediting it with interest on the debt not issued to the TSP. By the end of April, debt subject to limit was $35 billion below the limit. However, by mid-May, it had risen to within $15 million of the statutory limit. The Treasury requested Congress to raise the debt limit or enact changes to issue new debt to avoid default. The Treasury announced a debt issuance suspension period starting no later than May 16, 2002, to manage government operations. They replaced federal debt with non-debt instruments to issue new debt and meet obligations until June 28, 2002. Without a debt limit increase by then, the Treasury would need to take further actions to avoid breaching the ceiling, potentially leading to a default. Congress took steps during May and June 2002 to address the situation. The Treasury postponed a securities auction by June 21, facing the risk of default due to impending obligations. Congress debated increasing the debt limit in May and June 2002, with the Senate eventually passing a bill to raise the limit by $450 billion to $6,400 billion on June 11. This increase was deemed sufficient for government operations through the end of 2002. The Senate passed a bill to raise the debt limit by $450 billion to $6,400 billion on June 11, 2002, to avoid default. The House passed the increase by a single vote on June 27, and the President signed it into law on June 28, ending the 2002 debt limit crisis. In late February 2003, the Treasury requested an unspecified increase in the debt limit as the $6,400 billion limit was about to be reached. The 108th Congress did not immediately respond, leading to repeated requests from the Treasury to raise the limit to avoid financial problems. The Treasury requested an increase in the debt limit as it approached $6,400 billion. The 108th Congress did not immediately respond, leading to repeated requests to avoid financial problems. The Treasury used measures to manage debt holdings and avoid reaching the limit. The adoption of the FY2004 budget resolution triggered the \"Gephardt rule\" to raise the debt limit. In April and May, the Treasury requested an increase in the debt limit to accommodate spending levels approved in the FY2004 budget resolution. The Senate delayed action until May 23, when the debt was $25 million below the existing limit. Legislation was eventually passed, raising the debt limit to $7,384 billion. In January 2004, CBO predicted reaching the limit the following summer. In June 2004, the Treasury urged Congress to raise the limit to avoid financial disruptions. In August and September 2004, the Treasury warned that the debt limit of $7,384 billion would be reached in October. By October 14, the debt was just $25 million below the limit. Secretary of the Treasury John Snow informed Congress that measures to avoid breaching the limit would be exhausted by mid-November, risking the government's ability to meet obligations and impacting borrowing costs. The Treasury warned that the debt limit would be reached in October, risking the government's ability to meet obligations and impacting borrowing costs. Without a budget resolution passed by Congress, no measure to raise the debt limit could be deemed passed automatically. The House added an amendment to remove the Treasury's financing flexibility as federal debt approached the limit, but the Senate did not act on it. The House added an amendment to remove the Treasury's financing flexibility as federal debt approached the limit. Senator Frist introduced legislation to raise the debt limit by $800 billion, which was approved by the Senate and House in November 2004. The President signed the legislation into law, allowing the Treasury to reschedule debt auctions and cancel the \"debt limit suspension period.\" In December 2005, the Treasury delayed a debt auction before the debt limit increase, invoking a \"debt limit suspension period.\" The debt limit was raised in mid-November, allowing the rescheduling of the auction and cancellation of the suspension period. Congress included reconciliation instructions in the FY2006 budget resolution to raise the debt limit by $781 billion, but no bill was reported by the committees. The adoption of the budget resolution triggered the Gephardt rule, leading to a House Joint Resolution to raise the debt limit. The Gephardt rule was triggered by the adoption of the FY2006 budget resolution in late April 2005, resulting in a House Joint Resolution (H.J.Res. 47) to raise the debt limit by $781 billion to $8,965 billion. The resolution was automatically passed by the House but was not considered by the Senate. Secretary of the Treasury Snow warned Congress in December 2005 that the debt limit would be reached in mid-February 2006, requesting an increase. Measures were taken to avoid reaching the limit until mid-March 2006. In February and March 2006, Secretary Snow requested an increase in the debt limit to avoid reaching it until mid-March. The Senate passed a debt limit increase on March 16, 2006, raising it to $8,965 billion. In May 2007, Congress passed a resolution raising the debt limit by $850 billion to $9,815 billion. In mid-May 2007, Congress passed a resolution raising the debt limit by $850 billion to $9,815 billion. The Treasury requested Congress to raise the debt limit in July 2007, projecting it would be reached in October. The Senate approved the resolution in September 2007, which the President signed into law. Financial markets showed signs of turmoil in mid-2007, leading to a serious recession that lasted until 2009. The House resolution (H.J.Res. 43) was approved without changes on September 12, 2007, followed by the Senate passing the measure on September 27 and the President signing it into law on September 29, 2007 (P.L. 110-91). The financial crisis and recession that began in 2007 led to federal actions to stabilize the housing and financial markets, including measures to unfreeze credit markets, boost consumption, and increase spending. This resulted in large deficits and debt limit increases, with federal deficit spending peaking at 9.8% of GDP. Despite declining deficits since FY2009, the economic recovery has been weak compared to previous post-World War II recoveries. The recession led to large deficits and debt limit increases, with federal deficit spending peaking at 9.8% of GDP. Falling asset prices reduced federal revenues, while unemployment led to increased federal spending. Deficit spending can provide a fiscal stimulus if the economy is below potential output levels, but it can also accelerate inflation. Deficit spending during the recession led to large deficits and debt limit increases, with federal deficit spending peaking at 9.8% of GDP. Unemployment and falling asset prices reduced federal revenues, while programs paid out more money as unemployment rose. Boosting the economy through deficit spending can provide a fiscal stimulus if output levels are below potential, but it can also accelerate inflation if output levels are near potential. The federal debt limit was raised multiple times in response to economic conditions and government actions to bring the economy out of recession. The federal debt limit was raised multiple times in response to deficit spending during the recession. The House and Senate recommended policies that would result in a total debt of over $10 trillion in FY2009, requiring an increase in the debt limit. The budget conference report passed in the House, but the Senate did not take up the legislation to increase the debt limit, keeping it at $9.815 billion. The House passed a measure to increase the debt limit to $10,615 billion, but the Senate did not take it up, keeping the limit at $9,815 billion. Later, the House passed a bill including the debt limit increase, which was signed into law as P.L. 110-289. This law also authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to extend credit to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and created the Federal Housing Finance Agency. The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) was created to replace the Department of Housing and Urban Development Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) and the Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB). The FHFA placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in conservatorship on September 7, 2008, giving it full control over their assets and operations. The government took steps to stabilize financial markets after the deprivatization of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. On September 7, 2008, FHFA placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in conservatorship, giving full control over their assets. The government aimed to stabilize financial markets by proposing the purchase of mortgage-related assets. Despite initial rejection, a revised version of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 was passed by the Senate and House, raising the debt limit to $11,315 billion. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 was passed on October 3, 2008, raising the debt limit to $11,315 billion. Another economic stimulus measure, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, increased the debt limit to $12,140 billion. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 raised the debt limit to $12,140 billion. The final conference agreement on the Act increased the debt limit to $12,104 billion. The Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for FY2010 recommended policies leading to a debt limit of $13,233 billion. The Gephardt rule triggered a House Joint Resolution to raise the debt limit to $13,029 billion. In August 2009, Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner notified Congress about the debt limit. In 2009, the Gephardt rule triggered a House Joint Resolution (H.J.Res. 45) to raise the debt limit by $925 billion to $13,029 billion. Treasury announced it could delay reaching the debt limit by reducing loans available through the Supplemental Financing Program. The Obama Administration considered scaling back the Troubled Asset Relief Program to lower federal debt subject to the limit. Repayments of TARP funds by financial institutions could also reduce the debt subject to the limit. In mid-December, senior Members of the House opted for a smaller increase in the debt limit, allowing the Treasury to continue normal debt operations. The Treasury was scheduled to issue nonmarketable securities to the FDIC and make interest payments to federal trust funds, which could have posed challenges without a debt limit increase. Repayments of TARP funds by financial institutions could also lower the debt subject to the limit. Other measures, such as those taken in 2003, could extend the Treasury's ability to operate within the debt limit. In mid-December, senior Members of the House opted for a smaller increase in the debt limit to allow the Treasury to continue normal debt operations. H.R. 4314 was introduced to raise the debt limit to $12,394 billion, passed by the House and Senate, and signed by the President. A subsequent amendment raised the debt ceiling to $14,294 billion, with an approved amendment to impose PAYGO restrictions. Some Members of Congress proposed a national commission to address federal debt and fiscal issues linked to the debt limit increase. In addition to raising the debt limit to $14,294 billion, an amendment to impose PAYGO restrictions was approved. Some Members of Congress proposed a national commission to address federal debt and fiscal issues, which could be enabled through a measure linked to the debt limit increase. President Obama charged a Fiscal Commission with identifying policies to improve the fiscal situation. The House approved the measure and the President signed it into law on February 12, 2010. The House approved H.J.Res. 45 on February 4, 2010, and the President signed the measure (P.L. 111-139) on February 12, 2010. The 2011 debt limit episode was resolved by the Budget Control Act of 2011, which reinstated caps on discretionary spending. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner announced a debt issuance suspension period until August 2, 2011, due to reaching the statutory limit. Funding from extraordinary measures may provide less time than in previous debt limit episodes. The U.S. Treasury took extraordinary measures to extend its borrowing capacity until August 2, 2011. Despite suggestions to cut spending to avoid increasing the debt limit, the federal deficit was projected to reach $1,399 billion. The Treasury suspended reinvestment in the Exchange Stabilization Fund as one of the last available measures before exhausting its borrowing authority. The U.S. Treasury suspended reinvestment in the Exchange Stabilization Fund as one of the last available measures before exhausting its borrowing authority. Funding federal operations could become complicated without a debt limit increase, with cash inflows projected to be significantly lower than outflows from August 3 onwards. Treasury estimates on debt limit constraints and extraordinary measures have shifted. From August 3 onwards, cash inflows are projected to be $174.4 billion, $134.3 billion less than outflows of $306.7 billion. Treasury's estimates on debt limit constraints and extraordinary measures have changed since January 6, 2011. Higher individual income tax revenues and sales of mortgage-backed securities have helped increase federal debt headroom. Treasury Secretary warned of a debt issuance suspension period starting on May 16. The Treasury Secretary warned of a potential debt issuance suspension period starting on May 16, 2011, unless Congress acted beforehand. Extraordinary measures, such as the draw-down of the Supplementary Financing Program, were already in place to extend Treasury's borrowing capacity. New issuances of State and Local Government Series Treasury securities were suspended on May 6, 2011. Treasury Secretary Geithner had requested an increase in the debt limit in January 2011, anticipating reaching the statutory limit between March 31 and May 16, 2011. On May 6, 2011, new issuances of State and Local Government Series Treasury securities were suspended. Treasury Secretary Geithner requested a debt limit increase in January 2011, predicting reaching the limit between March 31 and May 16, 2011. A bill to raise the debt limit to $16,700 billion was introduced on May 24 but was defeated in a House vote on May 31, 2011. The Cut, Cap, and Balance Act of 2011 was passed by the House on July 19, 2011, but was tabled by the Senate on July 22. The House passed the Cut, Cap, and Balance Act of 2011 on July 19, 2011, increasing the federal debt limit to $16,700 billion. The Senate later tabled the bill on July 22. The Budget Control Act of 2011 was introduced by House Speaker Boehner and Majority Leader Reid on July 25, 2011. President Obama signed the revised compromise measure into law on August 2, 2011, eliminating the need for further debt limit increases until early 2013. The Act included provisions for deficit reduction and allowed for increases in the debt limit up to $2.4 trillion. The Budget Control Act of 2011, signed into law on August 2, 2011, eliminated the need for further debt limit increases until early 2013. It included provisions for deficit reduction and allowed for increases in the debt limit up to $2.4 trillion. The Act imposed discretionary spending caps, enforced by automatic spending reductions, established a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, and provided a three-step procedure for increasing the debt limit. The debt limit was raised by $400 billion to $14,694 billion on August 2, 2011, and then by $500 billion on September 22, 2011. A third increase of $1.2 trillion was triggered in late December 2011, subject to a joint resolution of disapproval. The Senate rejected a disapproval measure, while the House passed one but the Senate did not act on it. The President delayed the request for the third increase to allow Congress to consider the disapproval measure. The debt limit was close to reaching its statutory limit, prompting the President to request a third increase of $1.2 trillion, which required a joint resolution of disapproval. Other ways to trigger an increase included a balanced budget amendment or recommendations from the Super Committee, but these options did not materialize. After the Super Committee failed to agree on recommendations, a third increase in the debt limit of $1.2 trillion was implemented to match budget reductions through sequestration. The House passed a measure to suspend the debt limit until May 19, 2013, to allow for further discussions on the issue. The House passed H.R. 325 to suspend the debt limit until May 19, 2013, allowing the Treasury to replenish funds and reset its ability to use extraordinary measures. The Senate also passed the measure, which was signed into law on February 4, 2013. After the suspension lapsed, the debt limit was reset at $16,699 billion, just $25 million below the limit on May 20, 2013. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew declared a new debt issuance suspension period to manage the debt. On May 20, 2013, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew declared a new debt issuance suspension period after the debt limit was just $25 million below the statutory limit. He sent multiple notices to Congress with updated forecasts, pushing back the expected exhaustion date of the U.S. Treasury's borrowing capacity. Congress passed a continuing resolution on October 17, 2013, to end the federal government shutdown that began on October 1. After the debt limit suspension ended on February 7, 2014, Congress quickly addressed the issue by passing a measure to suspend the debt limit until March 15, 2015. The President signed the measure on February 15, 2014. Once the debt limit suspension expired on March 16, 2015, the limit was reestablished at $18,113 billion, and the Treasury Secretary used extraordinary measures for debt issuance. After the debt limit suspension ended on February 7, 2014, Congress quickly passed a measure to suspend the debt limit until March 15, 2015. The President signed the measure (P.L. 113-83) on February 15, 2014. Once the debt limit suspension expired on March 16, 2015, the limit was reestablished at $18,113 billion. Treasury Secretary Lew invoked extraordinary measures to meet federal financial obligations until October 2015, with a small cash reserve projected to be on hand. Secretary Lew stated that extraordinary measures would be exhausted no later than November 3, 2015. After the debt limit suspension ended on February 7, 2014, Congress quickly passed a measure to suspend the debt limit until March 15, 2015. The President signed the measure (P.L. 113-83) on February 15, 2014. Once the debt limit suspension expired on March 16, 2015, the limit was reestablished at $18,113 billion. Treasury Secretary Lew invoked extraordinary measures to meet federal financial obligations until October 2015, with a small cash reserve projected to be on hand. Secretary Lew stated that extraordinary measures would be exhausted no later than November 3, 2015, with lower tax collections and higher trust fund investments reducing Treasury's headroom more than expected. Projections for meeting federal obligations were uncertain due to fiscal policy changes and economic conditions. On October 26, 2015, a \"Bipartisan Budget Agreement\" was released, resetting the debt limit on March 16, 2017, at a level reflecting payment of federal obligations during the suspension period. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 addressed fiscal issues, including the debt limit, resetting it on March 16, 2017. The agreement also increased discretionary spending caps for FY2016 and FY2017. The federal government had budget surpluses from FY1998 to FY2001, reducing its debt. The President signed P.L. 114-74 on November 2, 2015, addressing fiscal issues including the debt limit. Budget surpluses from FY1998 to FY2001 reduced the federal government's debt, but deficits increased due to various factors including higher military spending post-9/11, rising nondefense outlays, and tax reductions in 2001 and 2003. The financial crisis of 2007-2009 further accelerated the growth of total debt, leading to a series of debt limit increases. The financial crisis of 2007-2009 and subsequent recession caused large federal deficits, leading to debt limit increases. While fiscal concerns were prominent in 2011, deficits have since decreased with economic recovery. However, without policy changes, persistent deficits could significantly increase federal debt, warned by the CBO for years. Over the next decade, without major changes in federal policies, persistent deficits could substantially increase federal debt. CBO has warned that current borrowing trajectory is unsustainable and could lead to slower economic growth. Congress may need to raise the debt limit repeatedly to accommodate growing federal debt. Data shows federal debt has increased since FY2001, with all measures of debt subject to limit rising. Since the end of FY2001, total federal debt has increased by $12,380 billion, with debt held in government accounts rising by $2,566 billion and debt held by the public increasing by $9,813 billion. Debt measures experienced periodic reductions, despite an overall increasing trend."
