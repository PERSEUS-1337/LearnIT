These smaller networks can be combined to solve more complex tasks like n-digit multiplication and division. Our approach allows for reusability and generalization up to 7 digit numbers. Our approach involves using smaller neural networks for basic operations like multiplication and addition, which can be combined to solve more complex tasks such as n-digit multiplication and division. This strategy allows for reusability and generalization up to 7 digit numbers, including both positive and negative numbers. The success of feed-forward Artificial Neural Networks lies in their ability to learn and adapt to specific tasks, although generalization issues may arise on unseen data. The learning process in neural networks is primarily based on memorization, lacking quantitative reasoning and systematic abstraction. In contrast, other living species, like children, demonstrate the ability to memorize and extrapolate numerical operations. Generalization is achieved through understanding how to reuse memorized examples, as complex operations are combinations of simple functions. The key to generalization in neural networks lies in understanding how to reuse memorized examples. By identifying and learning fundamental operations, complex numerical extrapolation and quantitative reasoning can be developed. This work focuses on learning fundamental operations with simple neural networks and reusing them to solve more complex arithmetic problems. This work focuses on learning fundamental arithmetic operations with simple neural networks and using them to solve complex problems like n-digit multiplication and division. It is the first to propose a generalized solution for these operations, working for both positive and negative numbers. Previous methods have focused on approximating mathematical functions, but the inability to generalize over unseen data makes the proposed network architecture complex. The architecture of proposed networks for arithmetic operations is complex due to the inability to generalize over unseen data. Recent works like Resnet, highway networks, and dense networks aim to train networks to generalize over minimal training data. EqnMaster uses generative recurrent networks for arithmetic functions, but struggles with generalization. The Neural Arithmetic Logic Unit (NALU) uses linear activations and gate operations to predict arithmetic function outputs, highlighting extrapolation issues in end-to-end learning tasks. The Neural Arithmetic Logic Unit (NALU) uses linear activations and gate operations to predict arithmetic function outputs, highlighting extrapolation issues in end-to-end learning tasks. Different approaches, such as Feed Forward Networks and Optimal Depth Networks using binary logic gates, have been explored for solving arithmetic problems inspired by digital circuits. Our work builds on the concept of Binary Multiplier Neural Networks to predict arithmetic functions for both positive and negative decimal integers. Instead of using a single neural network for different tasks, we propose training smaller networks for specific subtasks like signed multiplication and division. By combining these smaller networks, we can design networks capable of performing complex arithmetic operations. Our proposal involves training smaller networks for specific subtasks like signed multiplication, division, and cross product to perform complex arithmetic operations. We also suggest a loop unrolling strategy to generalize solutions from 1-digit to n-digit arithmetic operations. Digital circuits using shift and accumulator are known for accurate arithmetic operations and can be easily scaled. Previous work has shown neural networks can simulate digital circuits, inspiring our analysis of n-digit multiplication on paper and pencil. Neural networks can simulate digital circuits for accurate arithmetic operations. Designing smaller networks for specific subtasks like multiplication and division can lead to complex arithmetic calculations. The basic function of a neuron network involves a sum transform with weighted inputs passed through an activation. Several complex neural networks are designed for specific functions like multiplication and division, which can be used to create an arithmetic equation calculator. Neurons in a network perform a sum transform by multiplying inputs with weights and passing them through an activation function. Addition and subtraction modules are implemented using single neurons with specific weights. Shift-and-add multiplication is facilitated by these modules, where each digit is multiplied sequentially. The output is then combined to produce the final result. The shift-and-add multiplication process involves multiplying each digit of the multiplier with each digit of the multiplicand sequentially. The output is then placed in the correct position using a place value shifter and added together to get the final result. This neural network for single digit multiplication has two input neurons, a hidden layer with 30 neurons, and an output layer of 82 neurons. The model takes two 1-digit integers as input and produces 82 possible outcomes. The highest-ranked prediction is selected as the final output. The neural network for single digit multiplication has two input neurons, a hidden layer with 30 neurons, and an output layer of 82 neurons. It computes the absolute value of a single number using a neural network with 2 hidden layers. The input sign calculator extracts the sign of a number using a single neuron, while the output sign calculator computes the sign of the result of a multiplication or division using a neural network with 2 hidden layers. The output sign calculator in a neural network computes the resultant from multiplication or division of two numbers using a combination of 1 and -1 inputs. The process involves 2 hidden layers with mathematical representation as mod(x1 + x2) - 1. The network predicts the output of sign multiplication with a soft-sign activation. Signed multiplication involves converting numbers to positive integers and using input and output sign calculators. The process of signed multiplication involves converting numbers to positive integers using input and output sign calculators. The multiplication is then performed using a multiply sub module that tokenizes the inputs into single digits and multiplies each token of the multiplicant with the 1st token of the multiplier. The final output is assigned a sign using 1-digit sign multiply based on digital circuitry. The multiplication process involves adding the results of 1-digit multiplications with carry forwards. The final output is a single number with a sign assigned using 1-digit sign multiply. The division model separates sign and magnitude, inspired by long division, where the n-digit divisor controls the output computation. The selected node represents the remainder and quotient result of the division. The n-digit divisor is multiplied with single digit multipliers and subtracted from the dividend chunk. The smallest non-negative integer is selected from the outputs using additional layers. The architecture of the multiplication network is shown in Figure 2(b,d). A division model based on digital circuitry for decimal digits is generated. Comparison with other arithmetic operations is done, but division results cannot be compared. The Neural Arithmetic and Logic Unit (NALU) implementation is used for comparison after training it to match their results. The study compares the performance of a proposed division architecture with signed arithmetic operations using Neural Arithmetic and Logic Unit (NALU). The model outperforms recurrent and discriminative networks, achieving 100% accuracy within the testing range. Additionally, the model shows exclusive performance in signed multiplication. The study compares the proposed division architecture with signed arithmetic operations using Neural Arithmetic and Logic Unit (NALU). Results show 100% accuracy within the testing range, with exclusive performance in signed multiplication. Comparison with NALU model for arithmetic operations on positive integers is also presented. In this paper, the authors demonstrate how complex tasks can be broken down into smaller sub-tasks, with many sharing similar operations. Instead of training a single end-to-end neural network, multiple smaller networks can be trained independently to perform specific operations. Fundamental arithmetic operations are identified and learned using feed forward neural networks, which are then combined to solve more complex tasks like n-digit multiplication and division. One limitation is the use of float operations in the tokenizer, but this does not hinder the current work as only pre-trained smaller networks representing fundamental operations are used. The authors have developed a complex network for solving tasks like n-digit multiplication and division. They are currently testing a cross product network and plan to work on a point cloud segmentation algorithm in the future. The use of float operations in the tokenizer is a limitation that they aim to resolve."
