    "content": "The environmental impacts of human activity, particularly related to buildings, have become a major concern in recent decades. Buildings, including residential, commercial, and government structures, are recognized as significant sources of environmental impact due to resource consumption, waste production, and direct effects on occupants. This includes the use of electricity, water, and construction materials, as well as waste generation throughout the building lifecycle. Buildings in the U.S. consume vast resources annually, including electricity, water, and construction materials, leading to high environmental and financial costs. They account for 40% of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, costing consumers over $430 billion a year. The location and design of buildings also impact stormwater management and transportation energy requirements. Buildings have significant impacts on stormwater management, transportation energy requirements, and occupant health. Green building practices aim to address these environmental and health concerns by transforming the design, construction, operation, and demolition of buildings. Green building is a transformative approach to designing, constructing, and operating buildings to address environmental and health impacts. It has gained interest since the 1990s and involves various stakeholders such as construction firms, building owners, and government agencies. This report discusses the definition of green building, its environmental goals, tools for compliance, implementation challenges, relevant policies, and federal agency programs. Green building emerged in the 1990s with the formation of organizations like the American Institute of Architects (AIA) and the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC). The concept has evolved to promote environmentally conscious design principles and strategies to reduce harmful impacts of the built environment. The concept of green building emerged in the 1990s with organizations like the AIA and USGBC promoting environmentally conscious design principles and strategies to reduce harmful impacts of the built environment. Green building efforts vary along a design and performance continuum, with some aiming for zero-impact or even minus-impact buildings, while others may engage in greenwashing practices for marketing purposes. Green building aims to significantly reduce the environmental footprint of buildings compared to standard practices. It is an integrated approach to design, construction, and operations that goes beyond just energy consumption. Green buildings can have zero-impact or even provide a net environmental benefit. This approach can be applied to any type of building, with the goal of improving environmental performance. Green building is an integrated approach that aims to reduce the environmental footprint of buildings through various techniques and strategies. It can be applied to any type of building and involves innovative technologies and design features to improve environmental performance. The term green building is often used interchangeably with sustainable building. Green building techniques focus on reducing the environmental footprint of buildings, primarily in new construction projects. The term is often used interchangeably with sustainable building, which aims to maintain small environmental footprints to support future human activity and ecosystem functioning. Another related term is high-performance building, which includes factors like security in addition to environmental considerations. Federal statutory definitions emphasize integrating and optimizing attributes like energy efficiency, durability, and occupant productivity on a life cycle basis. High-performance buildings integrate and optimize various attributes such as energy efficiency, durability, occupant productivity, safety, security, accessibility, cost-benefit, sustainability, and functionality. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 established a detailed definition for high-performance green buildings, focusing on elements like energy, water, materials, waste, and health. Green building descriptions typically focus on elements like energy, water, materials, waste, health, and siting. Siting has gained importance in recent years due to attention on the built environment beyond the building itself. High-performance buildings also consider serviceability, productivity, functionality, disaster resilience, and climate resilience as objectives, especially after natural disasters like Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, and the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear meltdown. The objectives for high-performance buildings include disaster and climate resilience, which have become more important following natural disasters like Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, and the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear meltdown. Green building projects vary based on stakeholder needs and may prioritize different elements. Local factors like climate zone and flood risk influence design, with a focus on reducing energy footprint through efficiency, conservation, and use of renewable energy sources. Energy efficiency and conservation are key elements of green building, with techniques like using energy-efficient appliances, lighting, weatherization, and daylighting. Alternative and renewable energy sources such as solar, geothermal, and biomass are also utilized. Energy storage technologies and smart-grid innovations play a role in reducing energy consumption. Federal laws mandate reductions in energy use for buildings, with significant progress seen in federal building energy intensity reduction from 2003 to 2015. The Department of Energy estimated that buildings using the best energy efficiency technologies consume half as much energy as current buildings. Federal law mandates energy use reductions in federal buildings, with a 22% decline in energy intensity from 2003 to 2015. However, energy consumption in 2015 exceeded the federal goal. While energy is important in green building, focusing solely on it may not make a building green. Water usage reduction in buildings can save costs and aid in water resource management, especially in arid areas and during droughts. Water usage in buildings can provide cost savings and aid in water resource management, especially in arid areas and during droughts. Reductions can be achieved through measures like reduced-flow plumbing fixtures, wastewater recycling, and water-efficient landscaping. Water management also involves handling rain, on-site water, and run-off, with techniques like low-impact development and green infrastructure. The choice and use of materials in construction and operations can significantly impact a building's environmental footprint. The choice and use of materials in construction can impact a building's environmental footprint. Environmentally preferable materials, such as those with recycled content or made from renewable resources, can reduce resource depletion, pollution, and energy consumption. These materials may also be designed to reduce health risks from volatile organic compounds. However, there is debate over what constitutes environmentally preferable materials due to inconsistencies in measurement methodologies and reporting frameworks used by eco-labelling systems. The environmental impacts of a building's waste stream can be mitigated through waste-reduction efforts like source reduction, reuse, recycling, and waste-to-energy. Efforts to reduce waste from standard demolition and construction processes include efficient material use and recycling. Landscaping can help reduce chemical pollutants and recycle waste. High-efficiency boilers and furnaces can reduce atmospheric pollutants, while operational solid waste can be recycled or processed to reduce environmental impact. Indoor environmental quality (IEQ) is crucial for occupant health, with factors like indoor air pollutants, ventilation, air filtration, and materials impacting IAQ. Other factors such as lighting, climate control, acoustics, and ergonomic design also affect building occupants' health. Overall indoor environmental quality (IEQ) includes factors like lighting, climate control, acoustics, and ergonomic design, in addition to indoor air quality (IAQ). Site selection for buildings can impact their environmental footprint, considering factors like proximity to transportation hubs, ecological sensitivity, and climate-related risks. Building orientation, proximity to trees, and climate risks like sea-level rise and extreme weather events are also important considerations for builders, especially in coastal areas. Green building considers climate-related risk factors in siting decisions, such as sea-level rise and extreme weather events. Productivity and utility are essential elements of green building, with indoor environmental quality (IEQ) influencing worker comfort and productivity. While green buildings can improve productivity, trade-offs between serviceability and other elements may occur. Serviceability is an objective for high-performance buildings. Resistance to hazards like earthquakes, hurricanes, flooding, and forest fires can enhance a building's lifespan and functionality during service disruptions. Resilience strategies include resistant construction, elevated mechanical components, on-site power generation, rainwater harvesting, and water recycling. Climate-resilient design is increasingly emphasized for preparing, enduring, and recovering from severe weather events and climate change impacts. Green building emphasizes integration across elements and stages to improve performance and minimize environmental impacts throughout the building's lifecycle. This approach allows for better assessment of overall environmental impact, balance among competing goals, and development of an integrated strategy. Information technology can enhance integration and performance in building design. Green building focuses on integrating various elements and stages to improve performance and reduce environmental impact. It allows for a balanced assessment of competing goals and the development of an integrated strategy. Information technology can enhance building operations. Energy efficiency must be balanced with health considerations to prevent issues like mold growth. A green building approach helps optimize overall performance by considering the impact of actions on different elements. A green building approach involves balancing energy efficiency and health considerations, often requiring compromises or advanced technologies like active ventilation. Prioritizing certain elements over others may be necessary based on cost, feasibility, or occupant priorities. However, focusing on only one stage in a building's life cycle can lead to savings in one area but losses in another. For example, while concrete walls provide better insulation than wood, they have higher carbon dioxide emissions over their life cycle. Operating a building consumes far more energy than constructing it. A green building approach involves balancing energy efficiency and health considerations, often requiring compromises or advanced technologies like active ventilation. Choices made during construction may need to be balanced with planning for the postoccupancy stage. Elements like environmentally preferable products can impact occupant health and productivity. On-site renewable energy generation can help during power outages, while stormwater management can provide ecological services. Formal systems exist for assessing green and sustainable buildings. Renewable energy generation can function during power outages, and stormwater management can provide ecological services. Systems and tools have been developed to assess green and sustainable buildings, falling into categories like rating systems, certifications, standards, and codes. Professional organizations in the building sector developed rating and certification systems in the 1990s to standardize green building practices. The term rating system is often used interchangeably with certification system. Some professional organizations in the building sector developed rating and certification systems to standardize green building practices. Rating systems assign points to buildings based on green design criteria, resulting in an overall score and tier ranking. Certification validates that a building meets specified requirements, ideally done by an independent third party. Several organizations offer green building rating and certification services. LEED, developed by the USGBC, is a widely recognized certification system for green buildings. Over 37,300 commercial buildings worldwide have been LEED certified since 2000. Certification is available for various building types and operations. LEED certification by USGBC has expanded to include various building types and operations, focusing on six green building elements and offering certification levels of Certified, Silver, Gold, or Platinum based on total score. The LEED certification system requires buildings to meet mandatory requirements and earn points from optional items to achieve Certified, Silver, Gold, or Platinum levels. It allows for simple compliance assessment and integrated consideration of green building elements. Other certification systems in the US include BREEAM, which offers the BREEAM In-Use certification for existing commercial building performance. Unlike LEED, BREEAM In-Use has no prerequisites. BREEAM is a British system developed in 1990, with the BREEAM In-Use certification introduced in the US in 2017. It is an online rating system for existing commercial building performance, with ratings ranging from Acceptable to Outstanding. Certifications must be renewed annually. Green Globes, based on BREEAM, awards between one and four Globes based on points earned across six elements. Green Globes, developed in Canada by the Green Building Initiative, is based on BREEAM and awards between one and four Globes based on points earned across six elements. Certification is solely based on the number of points earned, with no mandatory provisions. The International Living Future Institute offers three certifications: Living Building Certification, Petal Certification, and Zero Energy Building Certification, each with specific criteria and performance areas. The Living Building Challenge offers three certifications: Living Building Certification, Petal Certification, and Zero Energy Building Certification. Each certification has specific criteria and performance areas, with requirements in place for different aspects of green building. Certification under the Living Building Challenge includes a 12-month assessment of actual building performance. Different ratings systems emphasize various aspects of green building, and the choice of certification may depend on local conditions and priorities. Some programs focus on new construction, while others are geared towards existing buildings. Some green certification systems focus on specific elements or limited performance areas, such as Energy Star for energy efficiency, Indoor airPLUS for indoor air quality, WaterSense for water efficiency, Zero Energy Ready Home for energy and air quality, and Passive House/ PHIUS+ for energy, water, and air quality. Federal offices and agencies have been using third-party green building certification systems since the late 1990s, with the General Services Administration recommending their use despite no system meeting all federal requirements. Some federal agencies have been using third-party green building certification systems since the late 1990s, despite no system meeting all federal requirements. The General Services Administration recommends their use, citing benefits such as simplifying compliance, reducing the need for additional staff, and providing a recognizable label for sustainability efforts. EISA required the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with GSA and the Department of Defense, to identify a third-party certification system that encourages a comprehensive and environmentally-sound approach to green building certification. The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with GSA and the Department of Defense, recommends using either LEED or Green Globes for green building certification. Federal agencies must achieve a LEED Silver rating or Two Globes under the Green Globes system for new construction and major renovation projects. The 2014 Department of Energy rule sets minimum criteria for rating systems eligible for federal agency use. Many states also require green building certification. The 2014 Department of Energy rule sets minimum criteria for green building certification systems eligible for federal agency use. Many states and local jurisdictions also require green building certification for government and commercial buildings, with some offering grants or tax incentives. Green building rating systems have influenced model building codes and standards, while building codes are often mandatory. Building codes are mandatory and may incorporate standards. Green building codes address multiple elements beyond energy efficiency. They specify requirements for environmental design and performance. State and local governments adopt national model codes for regulating buildings. Green building codes go beyond minimum building code requirements and can be adopted as mandatory or voluntary measures by state and local governments. These codes specify additional environmental design and performance requirements, often incorporating technical standards created by recognized standards development organizations. Green building standards are created by recognized standards development organizations (SDOs) and define guidelines and criteria for judging products. Buildings meeting a standard may be certified as having met its criteria through prescriptive, performance, or outcome-based pathways. These standards are often code-intended and can be adopted by jurisdictions with or without modifications. The curr_chunk discusses the development of green building codes and standards in the United States by organizations like the International Code Council (ICC) and ASHRAE. These standards are outcome-based and may be adopted by jurisdictions with or without modifications. The ICC is known for its International Building Code (IBC) widely used in the U.S. and released the International... The International Code Council (ICC) is responsible for developing comprehensive International Codes, including the widely used International Building Code (IBC) in the United States. In 2012, the ICC released the International Green Construction Code (IgCC), the first model code to incorporate sustainability measures for construction projects. The IgCC can be adopted alongside other ICC codes and offers flexibility in compliance pathways. It covers most building types except for low-rise residential buildings, which are referred to the ICC 700 National Green Building Standard (NGBS). The IgCC offers various compliance pathways and options to adjust requirements based on local factors. It covers most building types except for low-rise residential buildings, which are directed to the ICC 700 NGBS. ASHRAE, USGBC, and IES have also released Standard 189.1 for nonresidential and residential buildings over three stories, focusing on sustainability, energy efficiency, water use, indoor environmental quality, and building impacts. Standard 189.1, a code-intended standard under the IgCC, includes requirements for site sustainability, energy efficiency, water-use efficiency, indoor environmental quality, and building impacts. It has been integrated into Department of Defense properties and will serve as the technical content of the 2018 IgCC version. The new code will align with the LEED rating system and various state, local, and tribal authorities have developed their own green building codes. Federal laws and policy instruments also have provisions related to green building. Several federal laws, executive orders, and policy instruments have provisions relating to green building. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 and 2005 contained incentives and requirements for energy and water efficiency in federal, commercial, and residential buildings. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 requires agencies to procure products with recycled content. State and local policies also influence green building efforts. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT 2005) included provisions for energy efficiency in federal buildings, state building energy codes, a pilot program for energy-efficient housing mortgages, development of energy-efficient technologies, and energy and water efficiency requirements for appliances and building materials. It aimed to reduce energy consumption in federal buildings by 20% by 2015, promote energy-efficient products procurement, set energy consumption targets for new federal buildings, and apply sustainable-design principles to new federal buildings. It also authorized funding for state energy conservation plans and rebate programs for residential energy-efficient appliances. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT 2005) set energy-efficiency standards for federal buildings, state energy conservation plans, and residential energy-efficient appliances. It established the Energy Star labeling program, public information programs on energy conservation, and required agencies to purchase energy-efficient products. EPACT 2005 also provided tax incentives to businesses and directed the Department of Housing and Urban Development to develop an energy conservation strategy.

The rise of green building since the 1990s raises questions about its impacts. The rise of green building since the 1990s has raised questions about its impacts, covering market penetration, cost, building performance, measurement science, legislative goals, and implementation. The construction industry is a significant part of the U.S. economy, with green building growing in recent years due to government requirements, investment returns, and environmental concerns. In 2005, only 2% of new construction was green. The percentage of green building in the construction market has significantly increased in recent years, reaching 20% in 2013 from just 2% in 2005. Green construction spending in the US has tripled from $39 billion in 2008 to $129 billion in 2014, with projections of generating $303.4 billion in GDP between 2015 and 2018. New institutional construction, driven by certification requirements, is expected to further boost green building growth. Construction is expected to drive green building growth in the United States due to certification requirements for public buildings and schools. The percentage of certified-green floorspace is increasing, with a rise in office space certified by LEED or Energy Star. However, a large portion of U.S. buildings still do not meet green criteria, making rapid retrofitting challenging. Green building efforts impact a building's financial performance by affecting construction costs, operating expenses, rental rates, and property values. Costs of implementing green measures influence design and construction decisions, but obtaining accurate cost information can be challenging. The initial costs of green buildings can be higher than conventional buildings, which is a top obstacle for green building in the United States. Higher costs can stem from expensive features like high-efficiency appliances and design costs, making it challenging to obtain accurate cost information. Limited empirical evidence exists on the financial performance of green building investments due to the difficulty in generalizing cost performance across the market segment. Professionals have identified higher perceived initial costs as a major obstacle for green building in the United States. These costs can arise from various sources, such as expensive features like high-efficiency appliances and design costs. However, a review by the DOE found that construction costs for green buildings are comparable to conventional buildings. Proponents argue that operational cost savings over time can offset the initial investment, achieved through reduced utility resource usage and potential revenue from selling renewable energy back to the grid. Green buildings can result in reductions in initial costs, with evidence supporting operational cost savings over time. By reducing utility resource usage and selling renewable energy back to the grid, green buildings can create operational cost savings. Studies show that green certification is linked to lower utility expenses, but it only makes up 19% of a commercial building's operating costs. Green-labeled buildings can command price premiums in the real estate market, but some factors may reduce incentives for green building investments. Investments in green building can lead to cost savings and price premiums in the real estate market. However, factors like short-term ownership, rental agreements, and capital constraints can hinder the financial benefits for building owners and tenants. This creates a split-incentive problem, where only long-term tenants may see a return on their investment in green building renovations. Long-term tenants may benefit from green building investments, overcoming the split-incentive problem. Constraints on capital availability limit potential beneficiaries, including educational institutions and hospitals. Cost barriers are decreasing with widespread adoption and financial incentives from states and municipalities. The \"triple bottom line\" concept considers social and environmental returns in addition to financial gains in evaluating green building efforts. The \"triple bottom line\" concept in green building considers social and environmental returns along with financial gains. Green building efforts need to distinguish between design and performance, as factors like maintenance, alterations, and changes in building use can affect a building's environmental performance post-certification. It is uncertain if a green building will outperform a conventional one in the long run. Studies have shown that green buildings may not always perform significantly better than conventional ones due to factors like maintenance, alterations, and changes in building use. Even certified green buildings can be resource-intensive post-occupancy. Energy efficiency initiatives in newer homes have reduced energy-use intensity, but larger size and more electronic devices offset these savings. The energy performance of green buildings is under scrutiny. The energy performance of green buildings is a topic of scrutiny, with a focus on closing the \"performance gap\" between predicted and actual energy use. Rating systems like LEED now require post-occupancy performance assessment through building-level energy and water meters. Other systems, such as BREEAM In-Use and Living Building Certification, also include performance parameters for certification. The certification process for green buildings now includes the installation of energy and water meters for post-occupancy performance assessment. Building codes are also incorporating performance outcomes, with commissioning being a key practice to ensure environmental performance. Additionally, organizations can develop an environmental management system to further enhance sustainability efforts. Commissioning improves environmental performance for energy use in new and existing buildings. Organizations can develop an environmental management system with international standards. Certification requires an environmental policy, performance improvement, and pollution prevention. Building monitoring tools allow early fault detection and resource use analytics for effective management. GSAlink has identified over 33,000 instances of sub-optimal building performance. Smart building technology, like GSAlink, detects faults in critical equipment and provides resource analytics for building managers to respond effectively. Studies on green building performance show mixed results, with some buildings falling short of energy efficiency expectations. Limited data on buildings constructed under non-LEED rating systems in the U.S. makes comparisons challenging. Studies on green building performance using LEED ratings as criteria show a wide range of energy performance, with some buildings underperforming compared to design expectations. A study of over 100 LEED-certified buildings found that, on average, they performed 24% better than other buildings, but about one in seven performed worse than average. Criticisms of the study included sample bias and inappropriate baselines for comparison. Another assessment using the same data found that primary energy savings from LEED certification were nonexistent for lower levels of certification and 13% better than average for Gold and Platinum-certified buildings. Additionally, a GSA study of 22 green federal buildings, most of which were LEED-certified, showed better performance in energy use, water use, operating costs, and occupant satisfaction compared to the national average. The GSA study of 22 green federal buildings, most LEED-certified, showed better performance in energy use, water use, operating costs, occupant satisfaction, and carbon emissions compared to the national average. However, a study of 11 LEED-certified Navy buildings found that 9 did not meet federal energy consumption requirements, with most consuming more electricity than the national average. An assessment of Arizona's LEED-certified new construction buildings revealed underperformance in energy use compared to design and baseline simulations, indicating a disconnect between strategies employed and modeling results. The majority of green buildings underperformed in energy use compared to design and baseline simulations, indicating a disconnect between strategies employed and modeling results. Studies do not provide sufficient evidence that LEED certification consistently reduces building energy consumption due to small sample sizes and limited access to performance data. Improved methods for measuring green building performance are needed to ensure environmental targets are met and identify areas for improvement. Performance measurement is crucial for ensuring green buildings meet environmental targets and identifying areas for improvement. Methods for measuring green building performance are not well-developed for most elements, with some being easier to quantify than others. Disagreements may arise on which metrics are most relevant, such as energy use intensity (EUI). The Green Building Advisory Committee has proposed additional methodologies for measuring EUI, including energy use per occupant and area-based EUI. The Green Building Advisory Committee has proposed two additional methodologies for measuring EUI: energy use per occupant and area-based EUI measuring energy used in commuter transportation to and from the building. Accurate building occupancy data is crucial for calculating occupancy-adjusted EUI. Commonly accepted metrics like Energy Star scores may not be highly correlated with intended outcomes. Regular measurement and adjustment of building performance are essential for maintaining environmental performance over the building's lifespan. Measurement of building performance is crucial for maintaining environmental standards over the building's lifespan. EISA mandates federal agencies to measure their buildings' energy performance against specified targets, with more stringent requirements for new construction. Challenges include determining accurate baselines and obtaining reliable data. Despite available options, uncertainties exist in setting measurement goals and obtaining consistent data. Measurement science in green building is a key research area with challenges in setting specific goals and obtaining reliable data. The National Institute of Standards and Technology prioritizes developing metrics for measuring building sustainability. Agency progress towards green building goals varies, with the Obama Administration releasing annual sustainability scorecards. The Obama Administration released annual sustainability scorecards for federal agencies, including energy and sustainability goals in various areas. Scorecards included numeric reports and color scores to track progress. Green Building Goal: E.O. 13693 directed agencies to ensure 15% of buildings over 5,000 square feet are green. Federal progress towards three buildings-related goals is discussed, including the Green Building Goal, Energy Intensity Goal, and Potable Water Intensity Goal. Some agencies have surpassed targets, while others are lagging behind. Overall, progress has been mixed, with some agencies receiving low scores in the green buildings category. Energy intensity reduction fell short of the 30% goal set by EISA, and agencies are now directed to reduce energy intensity by 2.5% annually. The goal for a 26% reduction in potable water intensity by 2020 remains in place. The Green Building Goal, Energy Intensity Goal, and Potable Water Intensity Goal for federal agencies are discussed. Progress has been mixed, with some agencies exceeding targets while others lag behind. Concerns have been raised about the certification process for green buildings, with criticisms about rating systems and lack of caps on performance metrics. Critics have raised concerns about the certification process for green buildings, pointing out that some systems lack caps on performance metrics like energy use, making sustainability claims relative. They argue that design criteria should be more integrative and go beyond mere mitigation of environmental impacts. Some worry that new builders may not fully grasp the importance of an integrative approach to green building design, viewing green measures as add-ons rather than integral parts of projects. Some observers are concerned that new builders may not understand the importance of an integrative approach to green building design, viewing green measures as add-ons rather than integral parts of projects. The limited scientific and technological knowledge base for green building makes it challenging to identify the most appropriate approaches, with substantial research needed to improve the knowledge base. Differences in goals and perspectives among proponents of green building can complicate matters, especially in identifying objective criteria for elements like siting. Proponents of green building face challenges in identifying objective criteria for elements like siting. Congress may need to assess current federal green building programs, coordination methods, and priorities for facilitating adoption of green building measures. Possible actions include appropriations, new statutory requirements, and reviewing agency programs. Congress could take actions such as appropriations, new statutory requirements, and reviewing agency programs to facilitate the growth of scientific and technical knowledge related to green building. GAO reports have highlighted various federal efforts in this area, but coordination among agencies is lacking. Congress may also need to assess how well federal agencies are implementing green building programs and their impact on adoption nationwide. Congress may wish to examine the performance and efficiency of federal agencies in implementing green building programs, as well as the impacts on nationwide adoption. It may be useful to assess coordination among agencies and consider providing stronger mortgage and tax incentives to promote energy efficiency. Additionally, funding could be allocated to speed up adoption in areas where market penetration is low, such as residential renovation. Congress could consider steps such as providing stronger mortgage and tax incentives, broadening incentives to include green building elements, funding rebate programs, and specific appropriations to accelerate green building adoption. Regulatory actions may be considered, but could be complicated by federalism issues. Congress could also enhance current green building efforts in federal agencies and ensure integration and harmonization of activities. Energy has received more attention than other green building elements. The report discusses the priority of energy in green building efforts, highlighting concerns about fossil fuel imports, climate change, and energy inefficiency in buildings. Congress may need to ensure a balanced approach to green building elements and consider accelerating efforts. Funding for R&D in green building is supported by federal and private-sector sources. Congress may need to consider whether the incremental approach in green building activities is sufficient or if modifications are needed. R&D funding for green building from federal and private-sector sources may be inadequate, with some elements receiving higher priority than others. Congress should evaluate federal funding levels and priorities for green building efforts. Given the range of green building elements and the importance of integration and economics, Congress may need to consider modifying federal funding levels and priorities, creating incentives for private-sector R&D funding, and ensuring sufficient training and education for a knowledgeable workforce in green building construction and operation."
