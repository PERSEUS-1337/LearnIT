    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Enhancing Employment and Training Through Education Act of 2013.\" It includes pilot projects to reduce dependency and increase work effort in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 is amended to include pilot projects aimed at reducing dependency and increasing work effort in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. These projects will identify best practices for employment and training programs to help participants secure unsubsidized employment, increase earned income, and reduce reliance on public assistance. Selection criteria for pilot projects will focus on enhancing existing programs and participating in evaluations of participants' employment activities. The pilot projects under the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 aim to enhance employment and training programs, collaborate with workforce boards, and target various populations of work registrants to reduce dependency and increase work effort in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The pilot projects target different populations of work registrants and are selected from various employment and training programs, including section 20 workfare, skills development, post-employment support services, and education leading to recognized credentials. The pilot projects aim to provide services for maintaining employment, education leading to credentials, and are located in diverse geographic areas. The Secretary will conduct an independent evaluation to measure the impact on participants' ability to find and retain employment leading to increased household income. A report to Congress is due by September 30, 2017. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress by September 30, 2017, detailing the results and costs of each pilot project, including the impact on employment, income, and public benefit receipt of the target population. The report will also outline the dissemination of findings with State agencies and the necessary steps and funding to incorporate components of the pilot projects. The Secretary will report to Congress on the results and costs of pilot projects, including their impact on employment and income. $10,000,000 will be allocated annually for fiscal years 2014-2016 for these projects, with funds to be used for project compliance, administration, and related costs. The pilot projects funded annually for fiscal years 2014-2016 must comply with the Act, cover project costs, provide information for evaluation, and cover evaluation costs. Federal funds cannot replace non-Federal funds for existing employment and training activities."
