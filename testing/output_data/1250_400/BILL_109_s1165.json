    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge Expansion Act of 2005\". The United States Fish and Wildlife Service manages the James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge to promote the recovery of 4 species of endangered Hawaiian waterbirds. They lease 240 acres of wetland habitat and have a contract to purchase additional land for habitat protection and Refuge management. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service has identified approximately 800 acres of high-value wildlife habitat owned by the estate of James Campbell for inclusion in the Refuge. The land features coastal dunes, wetlands, and strand that support a variety of threatened and endangered species, including Hawaiian waterbirds, migratory shorebirds, waterfowl, seabirds, native plant species, monk seals, and green sea turtles. Expanding the Refuge will provide more opportunities for wildlife observation, photography, and environmental education. Expanding the Refuge by acquiring land owned by the estate of James Campbell will create a large, ecologically-intact unit with buffer land to reduce impacts. It will also help reduce flood damage in the town of Kahuku. The Act defines key terms such as Director, Refuge, and Secretary. The Act also includes provisions for the expansion of the James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge. SEC. 4 of the Act expands the boundary of the James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge by approximately 1,100 acres of land. The Secretary is authorized to make minor boundary revisions to achieve the goals of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service or facilitate property acquisition within the Refuge. The map depicting the expansion will be available for inspection, and notice of its availability will be published. The Secretary is authorized to acquire land and water for the Refuge, which will become part of the Refuge and be administered according to the law. Appropriations are authorized for carrying out the Act."
