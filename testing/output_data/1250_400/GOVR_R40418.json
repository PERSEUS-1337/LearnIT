    "content": "The federal government responded to the 9/11 and anthrax attacks by increasing funding for biodefense, focusing on addressing capacity shortages in diagnostic, clinical, and research laboratories. Various government departments have expanded their high-containment laboratory capacity to study dangerous pathogens, playing a crucial role in biodefense efforts. These labs offer hope for better responses to biological attacks but also pose a risk as potential sources of materials or training for attackers. Additionally, research has been invested in developing countermeasures, diagnostics, and detectors for dangerous pathogens. The federal government increased funding for biodefense after 9/11 and the anthrax attacks, focusing on capacity shortages in diagnostic, clinical, and research laboratories. This led to the development of countermeasures, diagnostics, and detectors for dangerous pathogens. Funding for civilian biodefense increased significantly from FY2001 to FY2008, supporting academic and industrial researchers. The influx of funds and researchers has raised concerns about aging laboratory infrastructure and limited capacity. High-containment laboratories have also expanded globally due to the threat of bioterrorism and emerging diseases. The proliferation of high-containment laboratories globally has raised new policy questions regarding capacity, federal investment, consolidation vs. dispersion, optimal size, coordination of efforts, risk of accidents or misuse, and balancing benefits with risks. Policymakers are increasingly concerned following incidents of accidents, noncompliance, and community resistance. The federal government is focusing on regulating high containment laboratories due to concerns about accidents, noncompliance, and community resistance. The Commission on the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and Terrorism recommended tighter oversight. Biosecurity and biosafety are key concepts in this regulation. The federal government is focusing on regulating high containment laboratories to address concerns about accidents, noncompliance, and community resistance. Biosecurity and biosafety are closely related concepts in this regulation, with biosecurity referring to securing pathogens from theft and biosafety focusing on lowering the risk of unintentional infection. The Select Agent Program is the major federal regulatory program addressing biosecurity by overseeing commerce in pathogens with severe consequences if released into the environment. The Select Agent Program was established by the federal government to regulate commerce in pathogens with severe consequences if released. It was created in response to the threat of bioterrorism, with laws like the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 and the USA PATRIOT Act increasing restrictions on the possession of select agents. Entities possessing select agents were required to develop security and biosafety plans. The USA PATRIOT Act and the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 increased restrictions on the possession of pathogens and toxins with potential for malevolent use. The Select Agent Program oversees regulation of select agents possession, transfer, and use, focusing on people with access to select agents and facilities where they are stored. Scientists must register with the federal government to handle select agents, and facilities must implement security plans to protect them from theft or improper access. The Select Agent Program oversees regulation of select agents possession, transfer, and use. Facilities must develop security plans to protect select agents from theft or improper access. Violations of regulations can result in fines or legal consequences. As of February 2009, around 390 entities had certificates to work with select agents. As of February 2009, approximately 390 entities had certificates allowing work with select agents, with 15,300 staff having security risk assessment approvals. The Laboratory Response Network links state or local public health laboratories to enhance testing and response capabilities. The Select Agent Program has caused tensions in academia due to the regulations conflicting with the tradition of openness. One goal of the Laboratory Response Network was to establish a lab in each state capable of handling dangerous pathogens. Tensions have risen in academia over the Select Agent Program, with some entities choosing to transfer or destroy their select agent inventories rather than comply with regulations. Investigations by agency Inspectors General have found non-compliance among universities and laboratories with select agent regulations. The HHS and USDA Inspectors General found non-compliance with select agent regulations among universities, laboratories, and other entities. Several organizations faced fines for violations, and some chose to withdraw their select agent licenses. The CDC suspended a select agent entity certificate at Texas A&M University due to failures in reporting occupational exposures and security risk assessments for laboratory workers. Several organizations, including universities and laboratories, have been fined for violating select agent regulations. The HHS OIG imposed fines totaling $1,887,000 on 12 organizations for non-compliance. Scientists studying dangerous pathogens are aware of the risks involved and have developed best practices to mitigate them. Biosafety guidelines, such as those in the publication Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) by HHS, outline four levels of biosafety (BSL-1 to BSL-4) for handling biological agents safely. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have established four main levels of biosafety (BSL-1 to BSL-4) to guide laboratory researchers in safe handling of biological agents. Each biosafety level is associated with specific physical and procedural protections, with higher levels recommended for more dangerous pathogens. The term \"high-containment laboratory\" typically refers to BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories, with guidelines developed to protect workers from specific risks posed by different pathogens. These guidelines define biosafety levels, best practices for safe laboratory operation, and mechanisms for identifying the appropriate biosafety level for a given organism and procedure. The Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) guidelines provide criteria for defining biosafety levels, best practices for safe laboratory operation, and security guidelines for different biosafety levels. Researchers and laboratory workers at institutions receiving federal funds must be trained in these procedures before accessing the laboratory. The correct biosafety level depends on the pathogen, its transmission potential, treatment, and the research procedure being conducted. Researchers and laboratory workers at institutions receiving federal funds must be trained in procedures described in the BMBL before accessing the laboratory. The correct biosafety level depends on the pathogen, its potential for transmission, and the research procedure being conducted, ranging from BSL-1 for low-risk activities to BSL-4 for high-risk activities. It is possible to handle deadly pathogens at lower biosafety levels for certain experiments. The BMBL recommends handling deadly pathogens at appropriate biosafety levels based on the specific activity being conducted. Some pathogens can be safely handled at lower containment levels for certain experiments. While some select agents require BSL-4 containment, others can be studied at BSL-2 depending on the circumstances. The BMBL guidelines recommend appropriate biosafety levels for handling pathogens based on the specific activity. BSL-4 containment is required for 13 select agents, while 30 others can be studied at BSL-2. BSL-4 facilities in the US work with select agents and are regulated under the Select Agent Program. Compliance with BMBL guidelines is often voluntary but mandatory for federal contracts and grants. The BMBL guidelines are mandatory for federal contracts and grants, with noncompliance risking loss of funding. Various laboratories must comply with these guidelines, including those under the Select Agent Program. Building design standards, grant requirements, and federal regulations related to DNA research also incorporate the BMBL guidelines. The BMBL guidelines are integrated into building design standards, grant and contract requirements, federal regulations for DNA research, and the Select Agent Program. Federal facilities and those funded by federal funds follow design standards based on the BMBL guidelines, with additional security requirements specified in separate documents. NIH provides design specifications for its buildings, including ventilation, utilities, and access controls. High-containment laboratories undergo testing and certification before occupancy, following checklists provided by NIH. Other agencies have similar processes in place to ensure compliance with established policies and directives. The NIH and other agencies have guidelines for certifying or commissioning laboratories to ensure compliance with biosafety guidelines. The process involves contracting specialized individuals, such as licensed Professional Engineers, with extensive experience in design, optimization, and testing of systems. It is recommended that companies not involved in the facility's design or construction handle the commissioning process. Specialized individuals, like licensed Professional Engineers, are needed for certifying laboratories to comply with biosafety guidelines. Non-compliance could result in the withdrawal of federal funding. Compliance with health and safety standards must be demonstrated if requested by the awarding office. Federal research grants may require grantees to establish an institutional biosafety committee (IBC) to oversee compliance with guidelines for recombinant DNA research. The IBC has the authority to determine biosafety levels for research activities and can require specific precautions. Some suggest expanding the role of IBCs to oversee other research with biosafety concerns. The IBCs help scientists determine appropriate protection levels for experiments. The IBCs have the authority to determine biosafety levels for research activities and can require specific precautions. Some suggest expanding their role to oversee other research with biosafety concerns. The BMBL guidelines are incorporated into the Select Agent Program regulations, making compliance mandatory. Entities with select agents must develop security and biosafety plans following BMBL guidelines, which may be reviewed by federal officials. The number of BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories is believed to have increased in recent years. The number of BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories in the United States has increased significantly in recent years, with a twelve-fold increase in BSL-4 space since 2004. This expansion is due to federal construction, increased funding for research activities, and a focus on public health. The federal government is funding the construction of high-containment laboratories in various departments, including Defense, Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, and Agriculture. Some facilities are federally owned and operated, while others are privately owned and operated. The federal investment in high-containment laboratories across various departments, including Defense, Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, and Agriculture, has created both government and private infrastructure. The Department of Defense has maintained high-containment laboratories since World War II, focusing on defensive research and developing countermeasures to protect against biological weapons. The Department of Defense (DOD) has high-containment laboratories for defensive research and developing countermeasures against biological weapons. USAMRIID in Frederick, MD, is the sole BSL-4 lab in DOD, with other sites having BSL-3 labs. DOD is expanding its facilities at USAMRIID with a $683 million investment. The labs conduct research on infectious diseases, evaluate vaccines, and test for disease outbreaks globally. The Department of Homeland Security established the National Bioforensics Analysis Center in response to the need for specialized facilities to analyze pathogens for identifying biological attack perpetrators. The center, part of the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center, is currently located at USAMRIID in Frederick, MD, with permanent facilities, including BSL-4 and BSL-3 laboratories, under construction and expected to be fully operational in 2010. The Department of Homeland Security is establishing the National Bio- and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) in Kansas to replace the Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC). The NBAF will be a BSL-4 laboratory focusing on researching animal pathogens and developing countermeasures. The facility is expected to expand research capabilities for high-level biocontainment pathogens. The Department of Homeland Security is establishing the National Bio- and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) in Kansas to replace the Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC). The NBAF will focus on researching animal pathogens and developing countermeasures, expanding research capabilities for high-level biocontainment pathogens. The DHS announced the decision to site the NBAF in Kansas, with additional BSL-4 laboratories at NIH in Bethesda, MD, and CDC in Atlanta, GA, as well as NBLs and RBLs across the US for biodefense research and public health emergencies.

The NBAF will focus on researching animal pathogens and developing countermeasures, expanding research capabilities for high-level biocontainment pathogens. The DHS announced the decision to site the NBAF in Kansas, with additional BSL-4 laboratories at NIH in Bethesda, MD, and CDC in Atlanta, GA, as well as NBLs and RBLs across the US for biodefense research and public health emergencies. The NBLs and RBLs are being built in Boston, MA, and Galveston, TX, and are part of a grant-making process. The HHS has developed the Laboratory Response Network (LRN) to respond to bioterrorism and other public health emergencies, involving federal and state public health facilities, medical institutions, and others with BSL-3 capabilities. The USDA is also involved in constructing new BSL-3 laboratories. The Department of Agriculture (USDA) and academic institutions are investing in high-containment laboratory facilities for biodefense research. Universities like the University of Minnesota, Purdue University, and Ohio State University are constructing additional BSL-3 laboratory space to enhance research capabilities and compete for federal funding. Private sector companies and non-profit institutions also maintain high-containment laboratory facilities for research purposes. The University of Minnesota, Purdue University, and Ohio State University are examples of institutions investing in additional BSL-3 laboratory space to compete for federal funding. Private sector companies and non-profit institutions also have high-containment laboratory facilities for research purposes. Some companies have in-house high-containment labs for product development, while others contract with firms like Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute and Battelle Memorial Institute. The expansion of high-containment labs raises issues for policymakers regarding capacity, oversight, and balancing increased risk with the desire for more laboratory space. The expansion of high-containment laboratories has raised issues for policymakers regarding capacity, oversight, and balancing risk with the desire for more laboratory space. After the 2001 anthrax mailings, policymakers realized the existing infrastructure was insufficient, leading to the decision to construct additional high-containment laboratory space with federal support. Agencies made decisions to build and support these facilities without a robust national needs assessment or coordinated expansion plan. The decision to build high-containment laboratories was made without a national needs assessment, leading to concerns of overcapacity. Lack of information on existing laboratory capacity hinders coordinated planning. Estimates of BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories vary and have been criticized for relying on registered facilities. The DHS and HHS estimated 630 BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories, criticized for methodological shortcomings. Nongovernmental experts question the accuracy, as registration with select agents does not always indicate high-containment lab use. Government Accountability Office noted an increase in labs but couldn't determine exact numbers. A comprehensive government-wide assessment is needed to determine if construction meets national needs. Previous attempts to assess lab numbers have failed, prompting Congress to consider a new survey. The construction of high-containment facilities raises questions about capacity utilization and the need for increased funding for research, operations, and management. Agencies expanding their laboratory capacity may face challenges in justifying larger research budgets to cover maintenance costs. Interagency federal planning efforts are necessary to address these issues. The agency's increase in high containment laboratory capacity will lead to higher operations and maintenance costs, regardless of full utilization. Agencies may need larger research budgets to cover these costs. Interagency federal planning is needed to address overcapacity costs and coordination of laboratory use. Congress may need to consider central coordination for multi-agency high-containment laboratory use. The growth of BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories has raised concerns about pathogen release and biological weapon proliferation. Events like laboratory infections and improper shipping of select agents have led to a reexamination of oversight frameworks, with calls for additional federal regulations. The growth of BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories has raised concerns about pathogen release and biological weapon proliferation, leading to a reexamination of the current oversight framework. There is a lack of consensus on the best approach to overseeing these laboratories, with some experts advocating for mandatory biosafety training and increased federal oversight, while others suggest enhancing self-regulatory measures with greater worker engagement and responsibility. Increased high-containment laboratory capacity presents both benefits and risks, such as enabling more biodefense research and public health testing, but also increasing the potential for theft or accidental release of dangerous pathogens. Expansion of high-containment laboratories allows for greater diversity in biodefense research and more efficient public health testing. However, it also raises concerns about the potential for theft or accidental release of dangerous pathogens. Legislation has been passed to enhance physical security, but security weaknesses have been identified at some facilities. Regulatory focus on compliance with the Select Agent Program may help minimize these risks, but growing laboratory capacity could strain agency resources. High-containment laboratories are designed to minimize accidents from human error or mechanical failure. The Select Agent Program aims to minimize risks in high-containment laboratories, but accidents can still occur, overwhelming safety measures. The GAO has testified that each facility carries inherent risks, which increase with the construction of more facilities. Policymakers may need to estimate the benefits of research in these labs against the potential risks. The risks associated with high-containment laboratories include accidental releases, subsequent illnesses, and the total number of facilities. Policymakers may need to weigh the benefits of research in these labs against the potential costs of infectious releases. Concerns also include the \"insider threat\" posed by personnel. The expansion of high-containment laboratories raises concerns about personnel surety and the potential for insider threats. The increase in trained technicians and scientists could lead to a higher risk of malicious intent. The DOJ believes that the perpetrator of the 2001 anthrax mailings was a government scientist with expertise in high-containment techniques, highlighting the international implications of the growing capacity of these facilities. The increase in high-containment laboratory capacity may be perceived internationally as excessive, potentially leading to suspicions of offensive biological weapons development by the United States. This perception could harm U.S. efforts to promote adherence to the Biological Weapons Convention and may spur other countries to build similar facilities. The proliferation of high-containment laboratories globally could increase the risk of misuse of biotechnological knowledge and techniques for malicious purposes. Differences in biosafety regulations among countries could impact the decisions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Differences in biosafety and biosecurity regulations among countries may influence the decisions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, potentially leading to the relocation of research and production facilities. This could impact national capabilities to respond to bioterrorism or disease outbreaks, as countries relying on foreign production may face restricted access to countermeasures. Variances in regulations have also caused U.S. scientists to limit international collaborations, affecting the scientific process. Some U.S. scientists are reducing international collaborations due to differences in biosecurity regulations between countries. This may lead to industry investing in countries with perceived lower barriers to collaboration. The impact of biosecurity regulations on research and international partnerships remains unclear. The presence of U.S. biosecurity standards could influence other countries to develop similar policies. Local resistance varies towards the construction of high-containment laboratories in the United States, with some communities supporting them for economic benefits. Some groups support building high-containment laboratories in the United States for economic benefits, while others oppose them due to public health and quality of life concerns. Policymakers have options to address these issues, including deferring action until expert panels provide recommendations. High-paying jobs for the local workforce, policymakers have options to address oversight of high-containment laboratories, balancing security with research productivity. Scientists support reducing terrorist threats but oppose measures hindering research progress. Policymakers may find current oversight sufficient without additional measures. The scientific community supports reducing terrorist threats but opposes measures hindering research progress. Policymakers may find current oversight of high-containment laboratories sufficient without additional measures. Some suggest focusing on identifying potential bioterrorists and disrupting their activities instead of implementing new regulations. The Bush Administration created expert groups to examine biosafety and biosecurity issues, with ongoing investigations into high-containment laboratories. Congress may defer action on oversight until recommendations are made, endorsing the groups' activities in the meantime. The Bush Administration established expert groups to address biosafety and biosecurity concerns, including investigations into high-containment laboratories. Congress may choose to wait for recommendations from these groups before taking action, endorsing their activities in the meantime. The Trans-Federal Task Force on Optimizing Biosafety and Biocontainment Oversight was established by the HHS in December 2007. Co-chaired by HHS and USDA, the task force includes staff from various government agencies and is tasked with reviewing and evaluating existing laws and regulations related to biosafety and biosecurity. Recommendations to the President are due in July 2009. The National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity, consisting of members from various federal agencies, is developing policies for dual-use research and biosafety training programs. The GAO is expected to release a report in 2009 addressing high-containment laboratory issues with additional recommendations. The National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity is developing policies for dual-use research and biosafety training programs. The GAO is expected to release a report in 2009 addressing high-containment laboratory issues with additional recommendations for legislative and executive branch action. Congress may choose to wait for these recommendations or address the issue without waiting for reports. Previous efforts to determine the number and capacity of high-containment laboratories have been unsuccessful. Several policy options may facilitate addressing the issue of high-containment laboratories without waiting for executive branch or GAO reports. Previous efforts to determine the number and capacity of such laboratories have failed to produce a reliable inventory. Non-federal high-containment laboratories are located in various institutions and a voluntary self-reporting mechanism may not be sufficient to identify them. A comprehensive inventory may be challenging due to the diverse locations and types of work performed in these facilities. Efforts to identify high-containment laboratories have been hindered by challenges such as concerns about competitiveness and reporting burden. Incentivizing self-reporting or mandating registration with the federal government could help create a comprehensive inventory. This registry could provide information on laboratory capacity, current use, geographic distribution, and availability. A registry of high-containment laboratories could provide the government with crucial information on capacity, current use, and geographic distribution. Registration may be required for all facilities, including federal ones, to allow for efficient planning and resource allocation. The government could efficiently plan for high-containment laboratory capacity by conducting a needs assessment and comparing it with existing federal capacity. Congress should consider the economic costs and benefits of surveying the number of laboratories, and may require needs assessments from specific agencies. Some policymakers have suggested a moratorium on new federally funded construction. The benefits of conducting a needs assessment for high-containment laboratories are highlighted, with policymakers considering a moratorium on new construction to avoid over-building. Incremental increases in capacity may be more beneficial than large-scale construction without a comprehensive assessment. The establishment and operation of new high-containment laboratories may lead to over-building and redundant operations among agencies. Incremental increases in capacity could be more effective than constructing new laboratory space. Some agencies argue that existing infrastructure is outdated and not suitable for expansion. Without a government-wide assessment, agency-specific needs assessments may overlook synergies or available infrastructure in other agencies. A construction moratorium could impact the federal government's ability to meet national goals. Enacting a construction moratorium could hinder the federal government's ability to meet national goals, such as establishing a permanent bioforensics capability and expanding high-containment laboratory facilities. Some analysts suggest licensing and certifying all high-containment laboratories to ensure compliance with security regulations. Some analysts suggest licensing and certifying all high-containment laboratories to ensure compliance with security regulations, either by applying Select Agent Program requirements universally or establishing a separate licensing program with flexible requirements. Establishing a separately administered program for licensing high-containment laboratories could provide flexibility in requirements. However, licensing and certifying all laboratories capable of BSL-2 or higher containment may be more comprehensive but would involve overseeing a significantly larger number of facilities. A more comprehensive approach to biosecurity oversight would involve regulating all laboratories capable of BSL-2 or higher containment, impacting various sectors. An alternative approach could be expanding the select agent list to include dangerous pathogens not currently covered, such as SARS, dengue fever, and yellow fever. This would enhance the regulation of potentially harmful biological weapons. Some potentially dangerous diseases like SARS, dengue fever, western equine encephalitis, and yellow fever are not covered by the Select Agent regulations. Expanding the list of regulated pathogens could lead to more high-containment facilities being regulated. There are concerns about the current select agent list being too reliant on taxonomic definitions, hindering research. The NIH has requested scientific advances to identify select agents based on other features beyond taxonomy. Regulatory impacts would only affect entities using pathogens of concern, not all high-containment facilities. The NIH has requested the National Academies to determine scientific advances necessary to identify select agents based on features beyond taxonomy. Focusing on the Select Agent list would only impact entities using pathogens of concern, not all high-containment facilities. This approach could limit disruption of scientific development and public health activities, allowing regulatory efforts to target high-risk laboratories. Background checks for personnel using BSL-3 and BSL-4 facilities could be expanded, with the possibility of different levels of screening for access to high-containment facilities. Efforts to enhance personnel oversight at high-containment facilities may face challenges, such as resistance to government documentation and certification of laboratory researchers. Some scientists may choose to leave research fields requiring high-containment laboratories rather than undergo the necessary government clearance. The Department of Defense has more extensive personnel oversight programs than those required for access to select agents. Efforts to enhance personnel oversight at high-containment facilities may encounter resistance from researchers who prefer to exit fields requiring government clearance. The Department of Defense has more extensive personnel oversight programs than those required for access to select agents. The Select Agent Program mandates worker training tailored to individual needs and work risks, but lacks specific standards, leading to potential variations in quality. Experts suggest expanding biosafety training programs to meet current demand and ensure core competencies are covered. The development of training standards could help assure core competencies for trainees in biosafety. Experts recommend expanding biosafety training programs to meet demand and address potential variations in quality. Training could range from voluntary local programs to mandatory federal certification. Enhanced training may reduce laboratory acquired infections, but may not address biosecurity vulnerabilities. Considerations for dual-use pathogens in high-containment labs could improve biosecurity awareness among workers. Enhancing training to address dual-use pathogens in high-containment labs can improve biosecurity awareness among workers. Reporting mechanisms, both voluntary and mandatory, can help disseminate information about accidents and near accidents to prevent future incidents. However, the fear of penalties or professional repercussions may inhibit reporting, hindering the improvement of practices and procedures. Experts recommend enhancing the reporting system for accidents in research institutions to establish a database of incidents and remedies. This database could help prevent future accidents by providing warnings to scientists and minimizing penalties for reporting to encourage more reports. Congress may need to consider the balance between unpunished negligence and existing penalties in the Select Agent Program. Experts recommend minimizing penalties for reporting accidents to a database to encourage more reports. Congress must consider the balance between unpunished negligence and existing penalties in the Select Agent Program. Policymakers need to assess the optimal balance between increasing oversight and regulatory burden, which may face resistance from scientists and stakeholders. Increased oversight could reduce opportunities for misuse of biological weapons. Expanding the Select Agent Program may hinder public health response and international collaboration. Critics argue that the program could impede the response to emerging threats. Expanding the Select Agent Program to include more laboratories and pathogens may hinder public health response and international collaboration. Critics argue that the program's requirements could impede the timely transfer of materials between high-containment laboratories, affecting scientific research and public health efforts. International collaboration may also be hindered due to differing security regimes in foreign countries. Scientists not involved in biodefense activities could be impacted by new licensure requirements, potentially reducing scientific advancements. The lack of comparable security regimes in foreign countries may impede efforts to regulate pathogens in public health and scientific research. Licensing and certification requirements could significantly impact regulated entities, including scientists in academic and industrial sectors. Public health laboratories and hospitals may face increased costs, and federal resources would be needed for registration, inspections, and oversight. Identifying the most appropriate oversight agency is a key issue, with USDA and HHS considered suitable regulators. Historically, concerns have focused on laboratory worker safety and minimizing the risk of pathogen accidents. Policymakers are considering whether USDA and HHS are still appropriate regulators for biosafety and biosecurity programs, as homeland security concerns have evolved to include pathogen theft and malicious intent. They may opt to involve DHS or create new oversight authorities. Harmonizing new requirements with existing ones and potentially consolidating oversight into one agency could facilitate smooth implementation. The oversight of biosafety and biosecurity programs is being reevaluated, with potential changes to regulatory agencies and the expansion of high-containment laboratory practices. Legislation has been introduced in Congress to address these issues, including extending the Select Agent Program and considering new oversight criteria. Additional funding and staffing may be needed for agencies to meet new mandates. Legislation introduced in Congress aims to extend the Select Agent Program and expand criteria for pathogen classification. The bills require a review by the National Academy of Sciences, mandatory biosafety training, and improvements to monitoring procedures. Additionally, the HHS Secretary must evaluate laboratory capacity and share best practices across biodefense and infectious disease communities. The bills introduced in Congress aim to enhance laboratory capacity and biosafety measures. They require the HHS Secretary to evaluate current capacity, share best practices, and establish a Biological Laboratory Incident Reporting System. The Laboratory Surge Capacity Preparedness Act would authorize grants for Regional Biocontainment Laboratories and assess the need for additional surge capacity in response to biodefense or infectious disease emergencies. The bill requires the DHS Secretary, in consultation with the HHS Secretary, to report to Congress on integrating the RBL network and assessing the need for additional surge capacity in response to biodefense or infectious disease emergencies. International harmonization of biocontainment technologies is crucial to address the threat of high-containment laboratories being the source of bioterror weapons. Congressional policymakers face the challenge of defining the goal of enhanced oversight of high-containment laboratories, which may impact the choice of policies to address security concerns. The choice of goal may impact the importance of issues and policies to address them. For instance, focusing on a registry of high-containment labs may improve planning and coordination but offer limited security benefits. A strict oversight program could enhance security but lead to regulatory burden and hinder scientific progress. Policymakers must balance competing national needs when considering policy options for these complex issues."
