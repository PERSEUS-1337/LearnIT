Congress finds that Huntington's Disease is a progressive neurological condition causing physical and mental deterioration. Approximately 30,000 individuals in the US are affected, with 200,000 at risk. Symptoms include loss of movement control, cognitive decline, and behavioral changes. Adult-onset typically occurs between ages 30-50. Huntington's Disease symptoms include personality changes, irritability, mood swings, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive behavior, inability to concentrate, decreased motivation, and severe depression. The disease has different onset types: Adult-onset (30-50 years), Late-onset (after 50 years, milder course), and Juvenile (before 19 years, rapid progression). Due to the debilitating nature of the disease, individuals with Huntington's Disease are often unable to work and rely on Social Security Disability Insurance.

The Commissioner of Social Security will update medical and evaluation criteria for Huntington's Disease for disability determinations under titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act.
