    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Economic Development Information Act of 1997\". It includes findings and declarations. Congress finds that accurate and timely information on economic development programs is crucial for maintaining the national economy and assisting regions with high unemployment. Previous efforts by the Economic Development Administration have been successful in aiding communities affected by military base closures or defense industry downsizing. Congress declares the importance of maintaining a strong national economy. Congress emphasizes the importance of expanding economic development information to assist areas facing economic distress or long-term deterioration. This information should provide access to various government and economic resources in a format that is easily usable for economic development purposes. The Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section on the Office of Economic Development Information. This aims to provide easily accessible government and economic resources for areas in economic distress or long-term deterioration. The Secretary shall establish the Office of Economic Development Information within the Economic Development Administration to serve as a central information clearinghouse on economic development programs, assist applicants in locating and applying for assistance, and develop electronic links to information databases for identifying and applying for resources. The Office of Economic Development Information will develop electronic links to databases containing information on federal, state, and local economic development programs, including contact details, application processes, eligibility criteria, and economic data. The Office of Economic Development Information will provide relevant information on major State and local economic development programs, economic data and trends, case studies, best practices, technology utilization programs, published works related to economic development, and current revolving loan fund programs. The Office of Economic Development Information compiles resources related to economic development, including published works, revolving loan fund programs, finance programs, sources of capital for businesses, and sustainable development initiatives. The Office ensures public access to its information clearinghouse in a user-friendly and culturally neutral manner. The Office of Economic Development Information provides accessible resources through various means such as an Internet website, toll-free telephone number, online electronic access, printed manuals, orientation workshops, and information specialists for person-to-person assistance. The Office of Economic Development Information offers network services, computer database access, printed manuals, orientation workshops, and on-call information specialists for assistance. Coordination with other federal departments is required, and economic development includes various aspects like economic adjustment and disaster recovery. Authorization of appropriations is provided for necessary funding."
