    "content": "While empirical evidence suggests that model generalization is linked to local properties of the optima described by the Hessian, the PAC-Bayes paradigm connects generalization ability to the Hessian, Lipschitz constant, and parameter scales. A metric is proposed to score generalization capability and an algorithm is suggested to optimize the model accordingly. Deep models, with millions of parameters, still generalize well in applications like computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. Classical learning theory relates generalization to the complexity of the hypothesis space, measured by parameters, Rademacher complexity, or VC-dimension. The generalization capability of models with many parameters is a topic of interest. While classical learning theory relates generalization to the complexity of the hypothesis space, empirical observations show that over-parameterized models can still generalize well. The Hessian matrix's spectrum at the solution point is linked to generalization ability, with large eigenvalues leading to poorer performance. Various metrics measure the \"sharpness\" of the solution, showing a connection between sharpness and generalization. Several metrics, such as BID15, BID1, and BID31, measure the \"sharpness\" of the solution and its impact on model generalization. Hessian-based sharpness measures are found to be problematic, especially in the context of RELU-MLP parameters. Bayesian analysis, introduced by Mackay (1995), uses Taylor expansion to evaluate model simplicity. BID34 penalizes sharp minima using the Occam factor to determine optimal batch size. BID4 connects PAC-Bayes bound and Bayesian marginal likelihood, offering an alternative perspective on Occam's razor. BID19, BID7, BID28, and BID29 utilize PAC-Bayes bound for further analysis. The Occam factor is used to penalize sharp minima and determine optimal batch size. PAC-Bayes bound connects with Bayesian marginal likelihood, providing an alternative view on Occam's razor. Various studies analyze generalization behavior of deep models using PAC-Bayes bound. Incorporating local properties of solutions into generalization analysis is suggested. BID3 aims to optimize PAC-Bayes bound for better model generalization, but some fundamental questions remain unanswered. In this paper, the relationship between model generalization and the local \"smoothness\" of a solution is explored from a PAC-Bayes perspective. The generalization error is shown to be related to the Hessian of the loss function, the Lipschitz constant of the Hessian, parameter scales, and the number of training samples. A new metric for generalization is proposed, allowing for the selection of an optimal perturbation level to improve generalization. An algorithm based on perturbation and estimation of the Hessian is introduced to enhance model generalization in supervised learning scenarios. The PAC-Bayes paradigm considers probability measures over the function class F: X \u2192 Y, with a \"posterior\" distribution D f and a \"prior\" distribution \u03c0 f. The empirical loss in this paradigm is the expected loss over the draw of functions from the posterior. PAC-Bayes theory bounds the gap between expected loss and empirical loss by the KL divergence between D f and \u03c0 f. If the function f is parameterized as f (w) with w \u2208 W, perturbing D w around any w is explored. The PAC-Bayes paradigm involves the expected loss over functions drawn from the posterior distribution. It suggests that the gap between expected loss and empirical loss is bounded by the KL divergence between D f and \u03c0 f. Perturbing the parameter w around any w leads to a PAC-Bayes bound, connecting generalization with local properties through perturbations. This helps in finding an optimal perturbation for better performance. In this section, the focus is on connecting the Hessian matrix \u2207 2L (w) with model generalization rigorously by introducing the local smoothness assumption and presenting a main theorem. The assumption of global smoothness properties for deep models is deemed unrealistic, with the focus being on small local neighborhoods around a reference point w * defined by a neighborhood set. The paper defines the neighborhood set with a particular type of radius \u03ba i (w * ) = \u03b3|w * i | + , emphasizing the need to search for an optimal perturbation level for better performance. In this paper, the focus is on the local smoothness assumption for deep models, as global smoothness properties are unrealistic. The neighborhood set is defined with a specific radius \u03ba i (w * ) = \u03b3|w * i | + , and the empirical loss function is required to be Hessian Lipschitz in the neighborhood. The Hessian Lipschitz condition is used to model the smoothness of second-order gradients. The paper assumes convexity and \u03c1-Hessian Lipschitz for the function. The uniform perturbation theorem states that with bounded model weights, the loss function falls within a certain range with high probability. The draft assumes convexity and \u03c1-Hessian Lipschitz for the function. Theorem 2 discusses controlling the expected loss of a uniformly perturbed model with carefully chosen perturbation levels. The perturbation level is related to various factors such as the diagonal element of Hessian, Lipschitz constant \u03c1, neighborhood scales characterized by \u03ba, number of parameters m, and number of samples n. Truncated Gaussian perturbation is also considered in the appendix. The next section provides intuitions on the arguments presented. The perturbation level is inversely related to \u22072i,iL, suggesting perturbation along \"flat\" coordinates. Truncated Gaussian perturbation is discussed in Appendix B. The model parameters' \"posterior\" distribution is uniform, with varying support. Perturbed parameters are bounded, and the prior distribution is chosen as u i \u223c U(\u2212\u03c4 i, \u03c4 i). KL divergence is calculated as i log(\u03c4 i /\u03c3 i). The model parameters' \"posterior\" distribution is uniform with varying support. Perturbed parameters are bounded, and the KL divergence is calculated. The third-order term is bounded, but the over-parameterization phenomenon is not explained. Lemma 3 states conditions for model weights and loss function. In experiments, \u03b7 is treated as a hyper-parameter. The model weights are bounded with perturbed random variables. The spectrum of \u2207 2L is not enough to determine generalization power. Re-parameterization of RELU-MLP can scale the Hessian spectrum without affecting model prediction. The bound does not assume cross entropy loss or RELU-MLP model. The optimal parameter distribution is not affected by re-parameterization. Our bound for generalization does not assume cross entropy loss or RELU-MLP model. The optimal perturbation levels scale inversely with parameters, leading to a logarithmic change in the bound. Re-parameterization in RELU-MLP results in small changes in the bound. We introduce heuristic-based approximations and empirical observations in the following sections. The curr_chunk discusses the PAC-Bayes based Generalization metric, pacGen, which approximates the optimal perturbation levels for model training. It also mentions the estimation of diagonal elements of the Hessian and Lipschitz constant for efficiency. The metric is calculated on real-world data using a fixed learning rate and varying batch sizes for training. The curr_chunk discusses estimating the Hessian of a perturbed model to calculate the metric \u03a8 \u03ba (L, w * ) for different batch sizes and learning rates. It shows that as batch size increases, the gap between test and training loss also increases. Similarly, decreasing the learning rate leads to a larger gap between test and training loss. The proposed metric follows the same trend as the generalization gap. The curr_chunk discusses the impact of batch size and learning rate on generalization gap and \u03a8 \u03ba (L, w * ). It suggests adding noise to the model for better generalization and optimizing the perturbed empirical loss E u [L(w + u)] for improved model generalization power. The algorithm presented in Algorithm 1 perturbs model weights based on the PAC-Bayes bound, using exponential smoothing technique to estimate the Hessian \u2207. The algorithm in Algorithm 1 introduces a systematic way to perturb model weights based on the PAC-Bayes bound, using exponential smoothing to estimate the Hessian \u2207. It perturbs parameters with small gradients below a certain threshold for efficiency, decreasing perturbation as epochs increase. Results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 BID17, and Tiny ImageNet 8 using Wide-ResNet BID36 model show improvements. The perturbed algorithm introduces a systematic way to perturb model weights based on the PAC-Bayes bound, using exponential smoothing to estimate the Hessian. It compares against the original optimization method on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 BID17, and Tiny ImageNet 8 using Wide-ResNet BID36 model. Various optimization methods and parameters are used for different datasets, showing improvements in performance. The perturbed algorithm perturbs model weights based on the PAC-Bayes bound, improving generalization. It outperforms dropout by applying different perturbations to parameters based on local smoothness structures. The Hessian and solution smoothness are linked to model generalization in the PAC-Bayes framework. The text discusses the integration of Hessian in model generalization within the PAC-Bayes framework. It explains how the generalization power of a model is related to the Hessian, smoothness of the solution, parameter scales, and training sample size. The best perturbation level scales inversely with the square root of the Hessian, which mitigates the scaling effect in re-parameterization. This work introduces a new metric for testing model generalization and a perturbation algorithm that adjusts levels based on the Hessian. Empirical results show the algorithm's effectiveness in improving performance on unseen data. The text discusses a new metric and perturbation algorithm based on the Hessian for testing model generalization. A toy example with a 2-dimensional sample set is used to demonstrate the algorithm's effect on model performance. The model is a 5-layer MLP with sigmoid activation and cross entropy loss, trained with 100 samples. The loss function is plotted with respect to model variables, showing multiple local optima. The model has only two free parameters w1 and w2, trained using 100 samples. The loss function shows multiple local optima, with a sharp one and a flat one observed. The generalization metric scores indicate better generalization power for the local optimum compared to the global optimum. The approximated generalization bound considers both the loss and the generalization metric. The color projected on the bottom plane indicates an approximated generalization bound, considering both loss and generalization metric. The sharp minimum approximates the true label better but has complex structures in its predicted labels, while the flat minimum produces a simpler classification boundary. Truncating the Gaussian distribution is necessary for bounded perturbation. The event is analyzed using the union bound with coefficients bounded by a constant \u03c4. The prior is chosen as N(0, \u03c4 I). After truncating the Gaussian distribution for bounded perturbation, the event is analyzed using the union bound with coefficients bounded by a constant \u03c4. The prior is chosen as N(0, \u03c4 I). The bound is approximated with \u03b7 = 39 using inequality (8). Lemma 4 states that for any \u03b4 > 0 and \u03b7, with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b4 over the draw of n samples, a tighter bound can be obtained by optimizing over a grid. After truncating the Gaussian distribution for bounded perturbation, the event is analyzed using the union bound with coefficients bounded by a constant \u03c4. The prior is chosen as N(0, \u03c4 I). Lemma 4 states that for any \u03b4 > 0 and \u03b7, with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b4 over the draw of n samples, a tighter bound can be obtained by optimizing over a grid. The proof involves optimizing \u03b7 as a hyper-parameter instead of depending on the data. The proof involves optimizing \u03b7 as a hyper-parameter to build a grid for tighter bounds. The eigenvalues of the Hessian are related to the generalization ability of the model. The inequality holds even with correlated perturbations. Another lemma discusses correlated perturbations and the local \u03c1-Hessian Lipschitz condition. Lemma 5 states that for any local optimal point w*, the loss function satisfies the local \u03c1-Hessian Lipschitz condition with random perturbations. The proof shows that the quadratic term is bounded, even with correlated perturbations. Dropout and the proposed perturbation algorithm are compared using wide resnet architectures. The comparison between dropout and the proposed perturbation algorithm is presented using wide resnet architectures. Results for CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet are reported with varying dropout rates. The pertOPT algorithm has all dropout layers turned off. Specific model details and training parameters are provided for each dataset. Figures show accuracy versus epochs for training and validation. For Tiny ImageNet, SGD with learning rate 10^-2 and batch size 200 is used. Perturbed SGD has parameters \u03b7 = 100, \u03b3 = 1, and \u03b5 = 1e-5. Validation set is used as the test set for Tiny ImageNet. Results show that dropout improves validation/test accuracy compared to the original method. Dropout rate of 0.3 works best for CIFAR-10, while 0.1 works better for CIFAR-100 and Tiny ImageNet. Perturbed algorithm outperforms dropout in all experiments, possibly due to different perturbation levels on parameters based on local smoothness structures."
