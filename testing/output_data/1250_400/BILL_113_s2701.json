    "content": "The Act titled \"Stopping Illegal Obamacare Subsidies Act\" limits auto-enrollment in health plans under American Health Benefit Exchanges until inconsistencies are resolved as outlined in a June 2014 report by the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will make public the steps to clear inconsistencies in eligibility for healthcare programs within 30 days of the Act's enactment. Methods to monitor progress will also be disclosed, and financial assistance programs may be suspended until inconsistencies are resolved. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services use methods to monitor progress in resolving inconsistencies in the Federal Exchange and State Exchanges. Premium assistance tax credits and cost-sharing programs are suspended until all inconsistencies are resolved. Requests for additional information are required if applicant information contains inconsistencies. Human Services confirms resolution of all inconsistencies in applicant information for enrollment in a qualified health plan on State or Federal Exchanges. Requests for additional information may be made, with a 90-day window for individuals to provide the required details. During the inconsistency period, enrollment in a health plan is allowed, but access to premium assistance credits and reduced cost-sharing programs is restricted. Eligible individuals who cooperate and provide necessary information will retroactively receive benefits from these programs. An individual who cooperates with a request for additional information and is later determined eligible for health programs will retroactively receive benefits they were eligible for during the inconsistency period. Failure to provide additional information will result in disenrollment from premium assistance credit and cost-sharing programs. During the inconsistency period, if an individual fails to provide additional information, they will be disenrolled from premium assistance credit and cost-sharing programs. They must re-enroll with accurate information during the next open enrollment period. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"inconsistencies\" refer to differences in self-attested information provided by an applicant for health plan enrollment and data received from the Federal Data Services Hub or other sources, including citizenship, income, employer-sponsored coverage, incarceration status, or other factors affecting eligibility for financial assistance programs under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The \"inconsistency period\" is defined as 90 days. The term \"inconsistency period\" refers to a 90-day period starting from the date a notice of an inconsistency is sent to the applicant, impacting eligibility for financial assistance programs under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act."
