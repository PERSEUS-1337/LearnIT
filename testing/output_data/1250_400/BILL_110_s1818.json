    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Missing Mercury in Manufacturing Monitoring and Mitigation Act.\" Congress acknowledges the highly toxic nature of mercury and its compounds to humans, ecosystems, and wildlife. It highlights the risks posed to pregnant women and unborn babies due to mercury exposure, primarily from contaminated fish consumption. The long-term solution to mercury pollution involves minimizing global mercury use and releases to reduce environmental contamination levels. Mercury pollution is a transboundary issue, with significant mercury use in chlor-alkali plants worldwide. Mercury pollution from chlor-alkali plants is a transboundary issue, affecting bodies of water globally. In the United States, only 8 out of 30 chlorine plants still use the mercury cell process, contributing to about 10% of chlorine production. This poses risks to human health and ecosystems, emphasizing the need to reduce mercury use and environmental contamination levels. The chlor-alkali industry in the United States uses the mercury cell process for about 10% of chlorine production, while cost-effective alternatives are used for the remaining 90%. Other countries like Japan have already banned the mercury cell process due to its environmental impact. Despite acknowledging the contamination risks, neither the industry nor the EPA can fully track the disposition of mercury used in the process. The chlor-alkali industry in the United States uses the mercury cell process for 10% of chlorine production, leading to direct and indirect mercury release. Despite known mercury quantities used, neither the industry nor the EPA can account for its disposition or accurately estimate current emissions. It is crucial for the US to minimize mercury supply, demand, and releases domestically and internationally. Congress declares the need to reduce mercury use and emissions in the United States, particularly focusing on reducing exposures to women of childbearing age and young children. Additionally, there is a call to address the use of mercury in chlorine and caustic soda manufacturing through an amendment to the Toxic Substances Control Act. The manufacture of chlorine or caustic soda using mercury cells is prohibited in the United States starting January 1, 2012. Owners of chlor-alkali facilities must report mercury-containing hazardous waste generated annually to the Administrator and the State. The chlor-alkali facility must report types and quantities of mercury-containing waste generated, mercury content, waste management details, mercury releases into air or water, and estimated mercury accumulation in equipment. The chlor-alkali facility must report on mercury emissions, volume accumulation in equipment, forms of mercury in products, and may combine this report with other required submissions to avoid duplication. For facilities ceasing operations after July 1, 2008, an inventory must be submitted within 1 year of cessation. The Administrator, in consultation with the State, conducts a comprehensive mercury inventory for chlor-alkali facilities ceasing operations after July 1, 2008. This inventory covers mercury purchased, remaining in equipment, and generated waste during the facility's operational life. The Administrator conducts a comprehensive mercury inventory for chlor-alkali facilities, including mercury purchase records and estimated mercury releases into the environment. A Mercury Storage Advisory Committee is established. The Mercury Storage Advisory Committee is established with 9 members, including appointments by the Speaker of the House and the Senate majority leader. The Administrator is also a member of the committee. The Mercury Storage Advisory Committee consists of 9 members, including a Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson, Administrator, Secretary of Defense, representatives from State environmental agencies, State attorneys general, the chlorine industry, mercury waste treatment industry, and a nonprofit environmental organization. Appointments must be made within 45 days. The Mercury Storage Advisory Committee consists of 9 members, including representatives from the mercury waste treatment industry and a nonprofit environmental organization. Appointments must be made within 45 days, and the Committee must hold its initial meeting within 30 days of all members being appointed. Meetings will be called by the Chairperson, and a majority of members will constitute a quorum. A report must be submitted within 1 year of the enactment of this section. The Mercury Storage Advisory Committee will meet as called by the Chairperson, with a majority of members forming a quorum. Within 1 year of enactment, a report must be submitted to Congress detailing environmental, health, and safety requirements to prevent mercury release and worker exposure, along with the cost of storing mercury and the optimal size of Federal facilities for storage. The report to Congress must include details on the optimal size and characteristics of Federal facilities for storing elemental mercury, estimated quantities of mercury from various sources, and the amount generated from recycling unwanted products to comply with export prohibitions. The report to Congress must include details on the estimated quantity of elemental mercury generated from recycling unwanted products for storage, barriers preventing private sector storage, advantages and disadvantages of consolidating storage, and the optimal plan for storing excess mercury from public and private sources. The Committee will oversee the storage of mercury from public and private sources, including excess mercury. Non-federal members will be compensated for their duties. The Committee members will receive compensation based on the annual rate of basic pay for level V of the Executive Schedule. Federal employees serving on the Committee will not receive additional compensation beyond their government salary. Members will also be reimbursed for travel expenses at authorized rates. The Committee members will receive compensation based on the annual rate of basic pay for level V of the Executive Schedule. They shall be allowed travel expenses, including per diem, while away from home in the performance of their duties. The Administrator will provide necessary funding and personnel for the Committee. The Committee will terminate 180 days after submitting its report. Regulations for transferring and storing mercury at chlor-alkali facilities will be established by July 1, 2008. The Administrator will establish regulations by July 1, 2008, for transferring and storing mercury at closed chlor-alkali facilities. Elemental mercury at closed facilities must be transferred to a storage facility by that date. Health assessments for operating facilities will be conducted by July 1, 2009. Additional regulations may be promulgated by the Administrator. The Administrator will conduct health assessments for employees at the chlor-alkali facility that continues to operate as of July 1, 2008. Additional regulations may be established as necessary to carry out this section. Sec. 6A addresses the use of mercury in chlorine and caustic soda manufacturing."
