    "content": "The report discusses the modernization of U.S. military tactical aircraft, including fighter aircraft, strike fighters, and attack planes. These aircraft are a significant part of U.S. defense capability and spending. Current modernization efforts focus on three main acquisition programs: the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, the Air Force F-22 fighter program, and the Navy F/A-18E/F strike fighter program. Congress faces decisions in FY2010 regarding the termination of the alternate engine program for the F-35, the procurement of additional F-22 aircraft, and the Navy's funding request for nine aircraft in FY2010. In FY2010, Congress must decide on the procurement of additional F-22 aircraft, funding for Navy's F/A-18E/F program, and the approval of a multiyear procurement arrangement for F/A-18E/Fs. These decisions are part of the overall affordability concern for modernizing the tactical aircraft force. The CRS report discusses FY2010 legislative activity on U.S. tactical aircraft, focusing on affordability and the future of the U.S. industrial base for designing and manufacturing tactical aircraft. Tactical aircraft refer to combat aircraft with shorter ranges, while strategic aircraft are larger bombers designed for long-range missions. Tactical aircraft, such as fighters, strike fighters, and attack planes, are designed for shorter-ranged combat missions. Fighters are for air-to-air combat, strike fighters have dual roles in air-to-ground and air-to-air operations, and attack planes are primarily for air-to-ground missions. Tactical aircraft, designated with \"F\" or \"F/A,\" are versatile planes for air-to-ground and air-to-air operations. Attack planes, with an \"A\" designation, focus on air-to-ground missions. These aircraft operate from land bases or aircraft carriers and are crucial for air superiority and close air support in combat. Tactical aircraft, such as fighters and attack planes, are versatile for air-to-air and air-to-ground missions. They are crucial for establishing air superiority and providing close air support in combat. The Air Force operates F-22, F-15, F-16, and A-10 aircraft, while the Navy operates F/A-18A-D and F/A-18E/F aircraft. The Marine Corps operates F/A-18 A-D aircraft. The U.S. tactical aircraft inventory includes older aircraft types like F-15, F-16, A-10, F/A-18A-D, and AV-8B. In early 2009, the DOD had about 3,500 tactical aircraft, with the Air Force having 2,375 and the Navy and Marine Corps having 1,125. Modernization efforts focus on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, F-22 fighter, and F/A-18E/F strike fighter programs. The F-35, known as the Lighting II, is being procured for the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program is a new strike fighter being procured for the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy. It is DOD's largest weapon procurement program with a total estimated acquisition cost of about $246 billion. The Air Force is acquiring the F-35A as a replacement for the F-16s and A-10s. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program involves the procurement of 2,456 JSFs for the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy at an estimated cost of $246 billion. The Air Force is getting the F-35A to replace F-16s and A-10s, the Marine Corps is getting the F-35B to replace F/A-18A-Ds and AV-8Bs, and the Navy is getting the F-35C for carrier operations. The F-22 fighter is also part of the program, known for its stealth capabilities. The administration's proposed FY2010 budget requested funding for the procurement of 30 F-35s, including 10 F-35As for the Air Force, 16 F-35Bs for the Marine Corps, and four F-35Cs for the Navy. The F-22 fighter, also known as the Raptor, is a fifth-generation aircraft with advanced capabilities. The administration plans to end F-22 procurement at 187 aircraft and did not request funding for additional F-22s in FY2010. Supporters of the F-22 aim to continue procurement for a total of 243 to 250 aircraft. The F/A-18E/F, or Super Hornet, is a modern Navy strike fighter. The F/A-18E/F Super Hornet is a Navy strike fighter, larger and more capable than earlier Hornets. It is considered a fourth-generation aircraft, with some fifth-generation technology. The Navy has been procuring Super Hornets since FY1997, with a total of 449 purchased through FY2009. The administration's FY2010 budget requested funding for nine F/A-18E/Fs. Air Force officials projected a fighter shortfall of up to 800 aircraft by 2024, while Navy officials projected a strike fighter shortfall of over 100 aircraft by 2018. The administration's FY2010 budget requested funding for nine F/A-18E/Fs. Air Force officials projected a fighter shortfall of up to 800 aircraft by 2024, while Navy officials projected a strike fighter shortfall of over 100 aircraft by 2018. Some observers questioned the Air Force's projections, suggesting they are influenced by assumptions about military threats and organizational constraints. The peak size of the Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall depends on service life extensions for Hornets and procurement rates of F-35Cs and F-35Bs. The Air Force announced a combat air forces restructuring plan in 2009 to retire older tactical aircraft, including F-15s, F-16s, and A-10s, to generate savings for other program needs. This plan aimed to create a smaller and more capable force by accelerating the retirement of approximately 250 aircraft. Air Force officials announced plans to retire legacy fighters to fund a smaller and more capable force, accelerating the retirement of approximately 250 aircraft including F-15 Eagles, F-16 Fighting Falcons, and A-10 Thunderbolt IIs. Cost savings of $355 million in FY10 and $3.5 billion over the next five fiscal years would be used to reduce capability gaps and invest in advanced modifications for remaining fighters and bombers. The Air Force plans to retire legacy fighters like F-15 Eagles and F-16 Fighting Falcons to fund a smaller, more capable force. Cost savings of $355 million in FY10 and $3.5 billion over the next five years will be used to reduce capability gaps and invest in advanced modifications for remaining fighters and bombers. The funds will also go towards procuring munitions for joint warfighters and critical intelligence capabilities. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Norton Schwartz emphasized the need for modernizing the fighter force to maintain an advantage over potential adversaries. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Norton Schwartz emphasized the need for modernizing the fighter force to maintain an advantage over potential adversaries. The CAF restructuring plan aims to move manpower authorizations to emerging missions like surveillance and nuclear deterrence. This includes expanding aircrews for MQ-1 Predator, MQ-9 Reaper, and MC-12 Liberty, adding a fourth B-52 squadron, and enhancing combat support capabilities in Afghanistan and Iraq. Secretary Donley and General Schwartz are committed to these initiatives. The Air Force is focused on modernizing its fighter force to maintain an advantage over potential adversaries. Initiatives include expanding aircrews for MQ-1 Predator, MQ-9 Reaper, and MC-12 Liberty; adding a fourth B-52 squadron; and enhancing combat support capabilities in Afghanistan and Iraq. Secretary Donley and General Schwartz are committed to reinvigorating the Air Force's nuclear enterprise and fielding 50 unmanned combat air patrols by FY11. Congress is concerned about the affordability of DOD's plans for modernizing tactical aircraft. The issue of tactical aircraft modernization affordability has been a concern in Congress and elsewhere for many years. Observers predict a budget \"train wreck\" as acquisition plans collide with insufficient funding. DOD plans to increase F-35 procurement rates, but has reduced the number of new aircraft acquired since the 1990s. The Department of Defense (DOD) plans to acquire 80 F-35As for the Air Force by 2015 and 50 F-35Bs and Cs for the Marine Corps and Navy by 2014. Reductions in planned aircraft acquisitions have been made since the 1990s due to post-Cold War changes and integration of Navy and Marine Corps strike fighter inventories. The F-35 program aims to reduce costs by developing a common strike fighter for all three services. Concerns remain about the affordability of DOD's tactical aircraft modernization plan. The F-35 program aims to reduce costs for developing, procuring, and operating U.S. tactical aircraft through the acquisition of a strike fighter that can be procured in three common versions for the three services. However, concerns persist about the affordability of DOD's tactical aircraft modernization plan, especially in light of potential future defense budget constraints. If funding for tactical aircraft acquisition programs is prioritized, it may come at the expense of funding for non-aircraft systems that could potentially fulfill similar missions. DOD's tactical aircraft modernization plans may face funding tradeoffs with other DOD programs, such as non-aircraft systems or other aircraft like long-range bombers. Some argue for less emphasis on tactical aircraft and more on long-range aircraft due to regional anti-access capabilities. Some argue for shifting funding from tactical aircraft to long-range aircraft due to regional anti-access capabilities of China and other countries. This includes comparing funding for tactical aircraft acquisition programs with other aircraft like airlift, refueling tankers, electronic attack, surveillance aircraft, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). UAVs have become increasingly important for surveillance and reconnaissance, while unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) are used for ground-attack operations, including precision attacks on terrorist targets. The curr_chunk discusses funding for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) for surveillance, reconnaissance, and ground-attack operations. It compares funding for land-based Air Force tactical aircraft acquisition programs (F-22, F-35A) with sea-based Navy and Marine Corps tactical aircraft acquisition programs (F/A-18E/F, F-35 Bs and Cs). The administration's proposal to end F-22 is also mentioned. The curr_chunk discusses the debate over funding for different land- and sea-based tactical aircraft, including the F-22, F-35A, F/A-18E/F, and potential tradeoffs between procurement of new models and service life extensions of existing aircraft. The administration's proposal to end F-22 procurement at 187 aircraft is highlighted as an example of a tradeoff in Air Force tactical aircraft procurement. The curr_chunk discusses potential tradeoffs in tactical aircraft procurement, such as upgrading existing F-15s and F-16s instead of acquiring new F-22s and F-35s. The debate includes considerations of costs, capabilities, and technical feasibility, with a focus on U.S. military goals and objectives in the Quadrennial Defense Review. The emphasis is on preparing for irregular warfare operations versus conventional interstate conflict, and how tactical aircraft fit into these planning priorities. The key issue in the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) is the balance between preparing for irregular warfare operations and conventional interstate conflict, particularly in relation to tactical aircraft. Some argue for reducing high-capability tactical aircraft procurement in favor of investing in UAVs, UCAVs, special operations helicopters, and other equipment, while others believe large numbers of high-capability tactical aircraft are still necessary due to potential threats from Russian aircraft and surface-to-air missiles. Some argue for reducing high-capability tactical aircraft procurement in favor of investing in UAVs, UCAVs, special operations helicopters, and other equipment. However, others believe large numbers of advanced aircraft are still necessary due to potential threats from Russian aircraft and surface-to-air missiles. Recent acquisitions of advanced fighter aircraft and surface-to-air missiles by China and India have raised concerns about potential challenges to U.S. airpower in the future. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) examined DOD's investment planning for modernizing its tactical fighter and attack aircraft force portfolio. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) examined DOD's investment planning for recapitalizing and modernizing its tactical fighter and attack aircraft force portfolio. The military services plan to spend about $109.3 billion to acquire new tactical aircraft and modernize operational aircraft in the next 7 years. Cost increases, schedule delays, and changes in requirements have reduced procurement quantities of new aircraft, leading to concerns about the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program. The Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program has seen a significant increase in development costs and delays in procurement and delivery schedules. This has led to concerns about the future modernization efforts and the need for additional funding to sustain and modernize legacy systems until new systems are ready to replace them. Uncertainty surrounding costs and delivery schedules makes it challenging to effectively plan and implement modernization efforts. Significant funding is needed to sustain, modernize, and extend the life of legacy systems for the total force. Uncertainty about new systems costs and deliveries complicates planning and implementation of modernization efforts. The services are investing about $1.7 billion per year on legacy modifications, but there are billions more in unfunded requirements and potential life extension programs. Hard decisions on retiring or extending the life of legacy aircraft are approaching. DOD lacks a comprehensive investment plan for recapitalizing and modernizing fighter and attack aircraft, leading to difficulty in determining capability gaps and duplication of capability. Each military service operates within its own stovepipe for planning and acquiring resources. The military services lack an integrated view of requirements for fighter and attack aircraft recapitalization and modernization. Each service operates independently to acquire resources for their specific force structures, leading to underperformance in delivering aircraft within desired costs and quantities. Future plans may be unaffordable due to unrealistic assumptions about funding levels and acquisition schedules, especially considering projected declines in federal discretionary spending. The GAO recommends that the DOD take decisive actions to shorten cycle times for developing and delivering new tactical aircraft and develop an integrated enterprise-level investment strategy for tactical air forces. This is necessary due to unrealistic assumptions about funding levels and acquisition schedules, projected declines in federal discretionary spending, and competing priorities for defense investments. The GAO recommends that the DOD shorten cycle times for developing new tactical aircraft and create an integrated investment strategy for tactical air forces. This is necessary due to unrealistic assumptions about funding levels, projected declines in federal spending, and competing defense priorities. The report issued in May 2009 compares seven alternative approaches for modernizing DoD's fighter forces, focusing on increasing capability with state-of-the-art aircraft. This includes improved payload capacity, stealth capabilities, and survivability, although unrefueled ranges may not increase significantly. The study emphasizes the need for modernization to meet future goals and recommends a more integrated investment strategy for tactical air forces. The DoD's emphasis on fielding aviation forces with greater flight endurance may not result in significant increases in unrefueled ranges for newer aircraft. Fighter inventories are projected to fall below stated goals, but aggregate capabilities are expected to improve due to enhanced lethality and survivability of new fighters. Alternative approaches like purchasing additional F/A-18E/F Super Hornets or upgraded versions of legacy aircraft could offer short-term inventory relief and cost savings, but with lesser capability improvements. Purchasing upgraded versions of legacy aircraft like the F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-15E Strike Eagle could provide short-term inventory relief and cost savings, but with lesser capability improvements compared to buying JSFs. A mix of fighters and subsonic attack aircraft would offer improved basing flexibility and persistence during air-to-ground missions. Replacing some fighters with attack aircraft could maintain air-to-ground weapons capacities at similar costs, but with fewer aircraft capable of air-to-air combat. Purchasing upgraded versions of legacy aircraft like the F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-15E Strike Eagle could provide short-term inventory relief and cost savings, but with lesser capability improvements compared to buying JSFs. A mix of fighters and subsonic attack aircraft would offer improved basing flexibility and persistence during air-to-ground missions. Tactical aircraft modernization decisions can impact employment levels and the structure of the U.S. military aircraft manufacturing industry, potentially reducing the number of prime contractors to one. The potential reduction of prime contractors for tactical aircraft production, specifically Lockheed and Boeing, raises concerns about future competition, innovation, pricing, and quality. Questions for Congress include the need for multiple prime contractors, the value of competition in aircraft development, and Boeing's ability to maintain key skills for future competition against Lockheed. The curr_chunk discusses the legislative activity for FY2010 related to tactical aircraft modernization, specifically focusing on the procurement of \"4.5\"-generation aircraft such as F-15s, F-16s, and F/A-18s. The section also highlights the requirement for DOD to submit a report to Congress on this matter. H.R. 2647 passed by the House requires DOD to report to Congress on the procurement of \"4.5\"-generation aircraft, including F-15s, F-16s, and F/A-18s with upgrades. The report must detail the number of aircraft needed for fiscal years 2011-2025, estimated procurement costs, potential savings from multiyear contracts, and a cost comparison analysis. The report required by H.R. 2647 includes details on the procurement of \"4.5\"-generation aircraft such as F-15s, F-16s, and F/A-18s with upgrades. It covers the number of aircraft needed, estimated procurement costs, potential savings from multiyear contracts, and a cost comparison analysis. Additionally, it discusses the availability and feasibility of F-35s for Air National Guard recapitalization and includes recommendations on authorizing a multiyear procurement contract for these fighter aircraft. The report required by H.R. 2647 discusses the procurement of \"4.5\"-generation fighter aircraft like F-15, F-16, and F/A-18 with advanced capabilities. It includes details on the number of aircraft needed, estimated costs, potential savings from multiyear contracts, and a cost comparison analysis. Additionally, it addresses the availability and feasibility of F-35s for Air National Guard recapitalization and recommends authorizing a multiyear procurement contract for these aircraft. Section 1032 of H.R. 2647 requires a report on the force structure findings of the 2009 Quadrennial Defense Review, focusing on factors influencing decisions regarding fighter force structure for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. Section 1047 prohibits the Air Force from retiring fighter aircraft as per a restructuring plan until 90 days after. Section 1047 of H.R. 2647 prohibits the Air Force from retiring fighter aircraft in accordance with a restructuring plan until 90 days after a report is submitted to Congress. This includes a prohibition on personnel reassignments related to the plan. The Secretary of the Air Force is prohibited from retiring any fighter aircraft or reassigning personnel related to the Combat Air Forces restructuring plan until a report is submitted to Congress. Funding requirements are specified for the continued operation and maintenance of the 249 fighter aircraft scheduled for retirement in fiscal year 2010. A detailed plan addressing force structure and capability gaps is to be included in the report submitted to Congress. The report shall detail the plan to address force structure and capability gaps resulting from fighter aircraft retirement. It will also include an assessment of the current threat environment, follow-on mission assignments for affected bases, criteria for base and fighter selection, environmental analyses, manpower authorizations, and funding requirements for fiscal years 2010-2015 if the restructuring plan is not implemented. The report will detail the plan to address force structure and capability gaps resulting from fighter aircraft retirement, including an assessment of the current threat environment, mission assignments for affected bases, criteria for base and fighter selection, environmental analyses, manpower authorizations, and funding requirements for fiscal years 2010-2015 if the restructuring plan is not implemented. The prohibition on fighter aircraft retirement in fiscal year 2010 does not apply to five aircraft. Congress also expresses its findings on Navy carrier air wing force structure. The budget for fiscal year 2009 was submitted to Congress, including findings on Navy carrier air wing force structure. Congress states that the Navy should maintain not less than 10 carrier air wings, each with at least 44 strike fighter aircraft, even if the number of aircraft carriers is temporarily reduced. The House Armed Services Committee is concerned about the Air Force's plans to retire legacy fighter aircraft, including 112 F-15s and 134 F-15s in addition to the five previously scheduled for retirement in fiscal year 2010. The House Armed Services Committee is concerned about the Air Force's plans to retire legacy fighter aircraft, including 112 F-15s and 134 F-15s in addition to the five previously scheduled for retirement in fiscal year 2010. The committee has identified $143.7 million in unjustified program growth in the Air Force operation and maintenance administrative budget and $200.9 million in unexecutable peacetime operations due to deployments in the Air Force operating forces. The House Armed Services Committee has identified $344.6 million in unjustified program growth and unexecutable peacetime operations in the Air Force budget. They recommend using these funds to maintain 249 legacy fighters slated for retirement. The Air Force projects a shortfall of approximately 800 fighter aircraft by 2024. The report highlights a projected Air Force fighter shortfall of 800 aircraft by 2024, impacting active duty and reserve forces' ability to meet future requirements. The committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force to provide a report addressing the \"fighter gap\" issue with alternative solutions by March 1, 2010. The report, due by March 1, 2010, must address the fighter gap issue for the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve. It should include statements from their Chiefs, discuss solutions like accelerated procurement of fifth generation fighters, and analyze the impact of any shortfalls on missions and capabilities. The report also expresses concern about the projected Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall. The committee is concerned about the projected Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall, with a potential peak shortfall of 312 aircraft by fiscal year 2018. Factors contributing to this include reductions in F/A-18A through D inventory, delays in the F-35B/C program, and early service life expiration of F/A-18A through D aircraft. The committee deems these shortfalls unacceptable. The committee is concerned about the projected Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall, with a potential peak shortfall of 312 aircraft by fiscal year 2018. Factors contributing to this include reductions in F/A-18A through D inventory, delays in the F-35B/C program, and early service life expiration of F/A-18A through D aircraft. The committee remains unconvinced that naval strike-fighter shortfalls should be viewed against the totality of Department of Defense strike-fighter inventory. They support procurement of additional F/A-18E/F aircraft to mitigate the shortfall and believe a multi-year procurement contract is more cost-effective than extending the service life of the F/A-18A through D fleet. The committee supports procurement of additional F/A-18E/F aircraft through a multi-year contract to address the projected Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall. They also express a sense of Congress for the Navy to maintain at least ten carrier air wings with 44 strike-fighters each. Additionally, a report is requested to evaluate the costs of extending the service life of F/A-18A through D aircraft versus procuring new aircraft. The Congressional Budget Office was asked to evaluate extending the service life of F/A-18A through D aircraft to 10,000 flight hours versus procuring additional F/A-18E/F aircraft. The Senate Armed Services Committee expressed concern about the Navy facing a shortfall in aircraft inventory as older Hornets retire before the F-35C variant is available. The committee expressed concern about the Navy facing a shortfall in aircraft inventory as older Hornets retire before the F-35C variant is available. The Navy projected a shortfall of 69 tactical aircraft in 2017, which could increase to 125 when Marine Corps requirements are included. The Chief of Naval Operations suggested the gap could be as high as 250 aircraft for the Department of the Navy. The committee criticized the Navy for not providing a report comparing single versus multiyear procurement costs as mandated. The committee is concerned about the Navy's projected shortfall in tactical aircraft inventory, which could be as high as 250 aircraft for the Department of the Navy. They criticize the Navy for not taking effective action to address this issue, potentially posing a risk to national security. The delay in addressing the shortfall is seen as accepting security risks, relying on costly service life extension programs for legacy aircraft, and not adequately considering realistic solutions. The Navy's projected shortfall in tactical aircraft inventory, up to 250 aircraft, raises concerns about security risks, reliance on costly service life extension programs for legacy aircraft, and lack of realistic procurement plans. The Navy's proposal to extend the life of select legacy F/A-18s to 10,000 flight hours through a costly SLEP is questioned due to uncertainties about the number of planes capable of reaching this milestone. The Navy's plan to extend the life of legacy F/A-18s to 10,000 flight hours through a costly Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) is questioned due to uncertainties about the number of planes capable of reaching this milestone. The committee believes that the cost uncertainties of achieving an additional 1,400 flight hours make the SLEP plan risky and inefficient compared to procuring new F/A-18E/F aircraft. The committee suggests that new F/A-18E/Fs, costing less than $50.0 million each, would provide more cost-effective benefits, with a lower cost per flight hour gained compared to a SLEP. The committee questions the cost-effectiveness of extending the life of legacy F/A-18s to 10,000 flight hours through a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP). They suggest that procuring new F/A-18E/F aircraft, with improved technological capabilities, would be more beneficial in terms of cost per flight hour gained. The Navy projects that the F/A-18E/F will remain in the fleet until at least 2040. The committee expects the Department of Defense to review tactical aircraft forces in the pending Quadrennial Defense Review. They anticipate the analysis of multiyear procurement for the F/A-18, considering cost differences and tradeoffs between SLEP and new procurements. The Department's tactical aviation procurement strategies should be informed by the Quadrennial Defense Review. The committee expects the Department of Defense to review tactical aircraft forces in the pending Quadrennial Defense Review and implement the results. Additional actions to address the strike-fighter shortfall cannot be delayed. H.R. 2647 requires a report on the procurement of \"4.5\"-generation fighter aircraft and force structure findings of the 2009 QDR. The report should include factors that informed decisions regarding fighter force structure for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. Section 1075 of H.R. 2647 prohibits certain actions related to tactical aviation procurement. The House report on H.R. 2647 requires a report on the procurement of 4.5-generation fighter aircraft and force structure findings of the 2009 QDR. Section 131 of H.R. 2647 mandates a report on the procurement of 4.5 generation fighter aircraft, including the number needed for fiscal years 2011 through 2025. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report to the congressional defense committees on the procurement of 4.5 generation fighter aircraft. The report includes the number needed for fiscal years 2011 through 2025, estimated procurement costs, potential savings from multiyear contracts, and a comparison of costs and benefits between annual and multiyear procurement. Additionally, it discusses the feasibility of procuring F-35 aircraft to re-capitalize the Air National Guard. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of 4.5 generation fighter aircraft, including advanced capabilities and armaments. It also mentions a report requirement on force structure findings from the 2009 Quadrennial Defense Review. The 2009 Quadrennial Defense Review report requires the Secretary of Defense to submit analyses supporting force structure findings and changes in major military capabilities. Section 1075 discusses limitations related to legacy aircraft until a report is submitted by the Secretary of the Air Force. Section 1075 imposes restrictions on retiring fighter aircraft and reassigning Air Force personnel until a report is submitted detailing plans to address force structure and capability gaps resulting from the retirement actions. The report required by Section 1075 must include a detailed plan to address force structure and capability gaps resulting from fighter aircraft retirements. It should also explain the assessment of current threat environment, describe follow-on mission assignments for affected bases, and identify necessary reassignments and funding for Air Force personnel. The report required by Section 1075 must include a detailed plan to address force structure and capability gaps resulting from fighter aircraft retirements. It should also explain the assessment of current threat environment, describe follow-on mission assignments for affected bases, and identify necessary reassignments and funding for Air Force personnel. Additionally, Section 1076 discusses the sense of Congress regarding carrier air wing force structure, emphasizing the need to maintain not less than 11 operational aircraft carriers according to title 10, United States Code. The Navy is required to maintain 11 operational aircraft carriers and 10 carrier air wings with 44 strike-fighter aircraft each. Congress emphasizes the importance of meeting the current requirement for 10 carrier air wings, even if the number of aircraft carriers is temporarily reduced. Congress and the Secretary of the Navy should take necessary actions to achieve this requirement until modifications to the carrier air wing force structure are justified. The conference report emphasizes the importance of maintaining 10 carrier air wings with 44 strike-fighter aircraft each. The Department of the Air Force's investment strategy to transition to a more flexible and capable strike fighter force is acknowledged as challenging. The Air Force is expected to analyze the possibility of procuring additional 4.5 generation fighter aircraft under a multiyear contract and submit a proposal to Congress when conditions under Section 2306b of title 10, United States Code, are met. The conferees expect the Air Force to analyze the viability of procuring additional 4.5 generation fighter aircraft under a multiyear contract and submit a proposal to Congress when conditions under Section 2306b of title 10, United States Code, are met. The provision aims to support a multiyear purchase of advanced fighter aircraft like the F-15, F-16, and F-18 with advanced capabilities. The House Appropriations Committee expresses concerns about the lack of detail and analysis provided to Congress regarding the Air Force's Combat Air Force restructure plan to retire 248 legacy F-15, F-16, and A-10 aircraft. The Committee directs that reports stipulated in the House-passed version of the Fiscal Year 2010 Defense Authorization Act be transmitted to the Defense Appropriations Committees. The House Appropriations Committee is concerned about the lack of detail and analysis provided to Congress regarding the Air Force's Combat Air Force restructure plan to retire 248 legacy F-15, F-16, and A-10 aircraft. They direct that reports stipulated in the House-passed version of the Fiscal Year 2010 Defense Authorization Act be transmitted to the Defense Appropriations Committees. Additionally, the Committee is worried about the personnel and acquisition costs related to the Air Force proposal to remove F-15 pilot training from Tyndall Air Force Base. They request a cost benefit analysis of this proposal for Tyndall Air Force Base and Kingsley Field in Oregon within 180 days. The House Appropriations Committee directs a report on the impacts of the Air Force's Combat Air Force restructure plan, including factors affecting F-15 training at Tyndall Air Force Base and Kingsley Field. The report will analyze training quantity and quality, identify locations for specific training programs, assess simulator and ancillary training access, and consider future military construction requirements. Additionally, the Committee requests information on airfields with shared runways for Air Force and commercial operations within the continental United States, along with an analysis of training and operational mission impacts at these bases. The House Appropriations Committee requests a report on the impacts of the Air Force's Combat Air Force restructure plan, including factors affecting F-15 training at specific bases. They also ask for information on airfields with shared runways for Air Force and commercial operations, along with an analysis of training and operational mission impacts. Additionally, an independent review by a Federally Funded Research and Development Center is directed to assess the impact of the restructure on the Nation's combat air forces. The Secretary of the Air Force is directed to provide the reports no sooner than 180 days after enactment of this Act, and no funds may be obligated on executing the restructure until after submission of all directed reports. (Pages 62-63) The report highlights the Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall due to high operational tempo in overseas contingencies aging the tactical aircraft fleet. The report highlights the Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall, caused by high operational tempo in overseas contingencies aging the tactical aircraft fleet. The sustained operations have led to critical shortfalls in the strike fighter inventory, with the shortfall now over 200 aircraft due to delays in the introduction of the F-35 aircraft. The life extension of older F-18 aircraft is proving to be more problematic than anticipated. The Navy's strike fighter shortfall has increased to over 200 aircraft due to delays in the F-35 program and challenges with extending the life of older F-18 aircraft. Despite a reduction in F-18 purchases in fiscal year 2010, the production line for the F/A-18E/F variant is still open and producing cost-effective aircraft. The difference in unit price between annual and multi-year procurement is significant, as the F-35 will not deliver in significant quantities for several years. The Navy's strike fighter shortfall has increased to over 200 aircraft due to delays in the F-35 program. The unit price difference between annual and multi-year procurement is substantial.
