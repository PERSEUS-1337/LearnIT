    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Early Hearing Loss Detection, Diagnosis, and Intervention Act of 1997\". The purposes of the Act are outlined in section 2. The Act aims to establish early detection, diagnosis, and intervention networks for hearing loss in babies, ensuring screening before leaving the hospital or within the first 3 months of life. Diagnostic testing should be done promptly, and programs should include linkage to early intervention services based on applied research. All universal newborn hearing screening programs should ensure linkage to diagnosis and early intervention services. Public policy in early hearing detection, diagnosis, and intervention should be based on applied research and consultation with relevant sectors. STATEWIDE EARLY DETECTION, DIAGNOSIS, AND INTERVENTION NETWORKS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will award grants to develop statewide networks for early detection, diagnosis, and intervention for newborn hearing loss. This includes developing state capacity, monitoring hearing detection in birthing hospitals, developing models for effective screening and referral, and collecting data for research and policy development. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will provide grants for technical assistance to State agencies for infant hearing detection, diagnosis, and treatment. This includes data collection, standardized procedures, cost-effectiveness studies, identifying causes of hearing loss, and assessing program effectiveness. The National Institutes of Health will conduct research on new screening techniques and technology for early hearing detection, diagnosis, and intervention programs. This includes clinical trials, efficacy studies, and basic research to improve outcomes for children with hearing loss. SEC. 5. COORDINATION AND COLLABORATION. In carrying out programs under this Act, the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Director of the National Institutes of Health shall collaborate with various agencies, organizations, and professionals to develop policies. The Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Director of the National Institutes of Health will collaborate on policy recommendations for early hearing detection, diagnosis, and treatment. They will also assist States in establishing networks for early detection and intervention, as well as developing a data collection system. Authorization of appropriations for statewide early detection, diagnosis, and intervention networks includes $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1999, $8,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, and necessary sums for 2001-2003. Additionally, funding for technical assistance, data management, and applied research at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health is allocated for the same fiscal years."
