Over 30 PHAs participate in MTW, managing billions in funding to support low-income families. The future of MTW is uncertain, with calls for changes before the 2018 expiration of current agreements. Critics argue that MTW agencies have too much flexibility without clear understanding of the program's impact. The future of the Moving to Work (MTW) demonstration program, created in 1996, is uncertain as current agreements are set to expire in 2018. Critics argue that MTW agencies have too much flexibility without clear understanding of the program's impact, while supporters believe it allows for unique and cost-effective ways to serve low-income families. Conflicting views on the program's effectiveness have led to calls to end, change, or expand it. The Moving to Work (MTW) demonstration program, created in 1996, faces uncertainty as current agreements are set to expire in 2018. Critics and supporters have conflicting views on the program's effectiveness, leading to calls for its end, change, or expansion. The program was designed to test innovations in assisted housing provision, with debates on restructuring it to better serve its purpose or continue allowing PHAs to operate outside traditional regulations. Despite controversy, MTW agency policies have influenced discussions on reforms to mainstream assisted housing programs. The Moving to Work (MTW) demonstration program, created in 1996, faces uncertainty as current agreements are set to expire in 2018. Despite controversy, MTW agency policies have influenced discussions on reforms to mainstream assisted housing programs. Policymakers may look to lessons from the MTW program for insight into future reforms of federal housing assistance programs. The Moving to Work Demonstration Program, authorized in 1996, allows PHAs to test new approaches for providing housing assistance to low-income families. The program aims to reduce costs, promote self-sufficiency, and increase housing choices. Up to 30 PHAs can participate in the program through a competitive process, with evaluations conducted for up to 15 agencies to identify successful models. The program's legislative guidelines are broad, allowing agencies flexibility in developing and testing approaches to assisted housing. The Moving to Work Demonstration Program allows PHAs to develop and test new approaches for providing housing assistance to low-income families. Up to 30 PHAs can participate in the program through a competitive process, with evaluations conducted for up to 15 agencies to identify successful models. The legislative guidelines for the program are broad, allowing agencies flexibility in developing and testing approaches to assisted housing. PHAs have the flexibility to combine funding streams, waive statutory requirements, and design rent policies to encourage employment and self-sufficiency. The legislation governing the Moving to Work Demonstration Program allows PHAs to design rent policies to promote employment and self-sufficiency. It requires PHAs to maintain certain standards, serve low-income families, and seek public input in developing their policies. PHAs must hold a public hearing on proposed policies before submitting an application to become an MTW agency and consider public comments in their application plan. The Moving to Work Demonstration Program requires PHAs to seek public input in developing their policies. A public hearing on proposed policies is mandatory before submitting an application to become an MTW agency. The PHA must consider public comments in their application plan, which outlines how they will use flexibilities under the program. Approval from HUD is necessary for participation, and MTW agencies must submit annual reports describing their use of funds and activities. The MTW demonstration program allows agencies to implement various policies and activities shaped by the policy context of public housing administration in the 1980s and 1990s. Federal policymakers sought strategies to reduce costs and improve management, leading to debates on block granting and local autonomy in housing programs. In the 1990s, federal policymakers and housing practitioners considered block granting or devolving assisted housing programs to the local level for greater autonomy. This was part of a strategy to increase family self-sufficiency and reduce costs through market-based approaches. The MTW demonstration program allowed for the pursuit of these goals while maintaining existing models of assisted housing. The MTW demonstration program, announced by HUD in December 1996, aimed to reduce assisted housing costs through market-based approaches. 30 PHAs were selected for participation, with agreements signed in 1998 or 1999. Six MTW agencies opted out, possibly due to delays in implementation or increased flexibility provided by a housing reform law in 1998. In February 1998, a milestone was reached in the MTW program with most agreements signed in 1998 or 1999. Due to delays or housing reform laws, six agencies chose not to participate. HUD allocated remaining spots to larger housing authorities in 2000. The program expanded beyond the original cap of 30 PHAs through congressional acts, adding more high-performing agencies. Alaska, San Bernardino, CA, San Jose, CA, and Santa Clara, CA, were selected for participation in the MTW program through various congressional acts. Currently, 35 PHAs are part of the program, with additional agencies being selected. Criticisms of HUD's implementation include selecting PHAs with prior poor performance and lack of uniformity in program structure. HUD's implementation of the MTW program has faced criticism for selecting PHAs with prior poor performance, lack of uniformity in program structure, and data collection issues hindering evaluation of MTW policies. HUD's monitoring of the demonstration's implementation was also deemed insufficient by its Inspector General. HUD has faced criticism for issues in the MTW program's design and implementation, including insufficient monitoring and evaluation of different MTW policies. In response, HUD introduced a standard MTW agreement in 2008 to improve oversight and extend participation in the program until 2018. This standard agreement aims to allow for more systematic evaluation of MTW agencies' policies in the future. HUD introduced a standard MTW agreement in 2008 to improve oversight and extend participation in the program until 2018. The standard agreement aims to allow for more systematic evaluation of MTW agencies' policies in the future, but it does not require standardization of performance data, limiting HUD's ability to evaluate specific policies. HUD has increased efforts to monitor MTW agencies' compliance with statutory purposes and requirements, including defining terms like \"self-sufficiency\" and \"housing choice.\" HUD has announced plans to require MTW agencies to create their own definitions of \"self-sufficiency\" and \"housing choice,\" and provide a template to collect data on a \"comparable mix of families.\" A 2011 assessment found that 91% of individuals served by MTW agencies were low-income and most agencies served the same number of families. The GAO report noted HUD's efforts to ensure compliance with statutory requirements but emphasized the need for standard definitions and a systematic evaluation process. The GAO and HUD IG reports highlighted the need for standard definitions and a systematic process to evaluate compliance with statutory requirements in the MTW program. HUD's initiatives were praised for moving in the right direction, but improvements are still necessary to ensure agencies' adherence to the statute. The IG report recommended delaying the addition of new MTW agencies until program administration is enhanced. MTW agencies have implemented a variety of program activities, ranging from full transformation of housing programs to more modest policy changes. MTW agencies have adopted a wide range of program activities, from fully transforming their assisted housing programs to making more modest policy changes. They have applied their policies to all assisted households or subsets of populations. Three policy areas where MTW agencies have discretion include merging funding streams, level of assistance, and administrative flexibilities. The policies may vary in scope and scale among participating agencies, with some altering their policies over time. This report does not evaluate the effectiveness or efficiency of these policies. MTW agencies have the option to receive federal funding in a merged form, departing from traditional program operations. This \"block grant\" assistance allows for flexibility in funding usage across programs, unlike the non-merged structure. MTW agencies have the option to receive federal funding in a merged form, allowing flexibility in funding usage across programs. The amount of MTW block grant assistance is negotiated through the MTW agreement, and most MTW PHAs now receive merged funding. Agencies used this flexibility to address financial shortfalls and for cross-programmatic purposes approved by HUD. MTW agencies utilized funding flexibility provided by the MTW program to address financial shortfalls and for cross-programmatic purposes approved by HUD. This autonomy from regulatory processes encouraged alternative uses of funds, such as developing additional support services for tenants and leveraging financing for low-income housing units. MTW agencies used funding flexibility for development purposes that would not have been feasible without merged funding, leveraging financing for low-income housing units. Some agencies undertook ambitious activities like converting public housing stocks to new forms of assistance, with examples from Chicago and Atlanta Housing Authorities. Chicago Housing Authority attracted private investment for its \"Plan for Transformation,\" replacing deteriorating housing with new developments in mixed-income communities. The Chicago Housing Authority used merged funding to attract private investment for its \"Plan for Transformation,\" replacing deteriorating public housing with new developments in mixed-income communities. The fixed 10-year merged funding stream was crucial in obtaining financing from private investors, allowing the agency to use revenue bond financing. Similarly, Atlanta used merged funding to replace distressed public housing stock. Other MTW agencies like Keene Housing Authority and the Housing Authorities of the County of Santa Clara and the City of San Jose used funding flexibility to convert public housing to project-based voucher developments. The City of San Jose and other MTW PHAs have used funding flexibility to convert public housing to project-based voucher developments, allowing for additional outside financing. Project-basing vouchers is more common among MTW PHAs, where a portion of the building is reserved for low-income tenants with attached vouchers. HUD-regulated voucher programs limit project-basing to 20% of tenant-based vouchers and 25% of units in a private building. The law authorizing the voucher program limits project-basing to 20% of tenant-based vouchers and 25% of units in a private building. MTW agencies have flexibility to convert public housing to project-based vouchers, project-base former public housing properties sold to nonprofits, and serve special populations by project-basing entire buildings. MTW agencies may also have their own processes for awarding project-based assistance. MTW agencies have the flexibility to convert public housing to project-based vouchers, project-base former public housing properties sold to nonprofits, and serve special populations by project-basing entire buildings. The majority of MTW agencies either currently have housing portfolios with project-based voucher assistance or have plans to begin project-basing vouchers, a much higher rate than non-MTW PHAs. MTW agencies can experiment with alternative income calculations and rent structures, but HUD guidance in 2011 required them to determine income eligibility for families. MTW agencies had full discretion to experiment with alternative income calculations and rent structures until 2011 when HUD issued guidance requiring compliance with statutory income calculations. While MTW agencies can still implement alternative rent structures, they must adhere to statutory income calculations. Additionally, they have the discretion to set conditions for tenants such as work requirements and participation in self-sufficiency programs. Industry groups argue that current income calculations and rent structures are overly complicated and discourage income reporting. Some MTW agencies have experimented with alternative income calculations and rent structures for public housing and Section 8 programs, aiming to simplify the process and encourage tenants to increase their income through work. Income is defined as income from all sources, with adjusted income used for rent calculations. Agencies have limited income exclusions and deductions, not including income from assets below a certain threshold. Some MTW agencies have simplified income calculations by limiting exclusions and deductions, and adjusting income from assets below a certain threshold. They have also reduced the frequency of verifying tenants' income, with some agencies reexamining income every two or three years. Some MTW agencies have simplified income calculations and reduced the frequency of verifying tenants' income, with 88% using an alternate schedule for recertifying tenant income. This approach may lead to potential cost savings or increased subsidy costs, but the cost-effectiveness is unknown. Assisted tenants under traditional housing programs pay no more than 30% of their incomes towards rent, with rents adjusting based on income changes. Assisted tenants are required to pay no more than 30% of their incomes towards rent, with PHAs allowed to set low minimum rent policies. MTW agencies have experimented with various rent structures, including maximum and minimum rents, flat rents, delayed rent increases, and simplified utility calculations. Most MTW agencies have their own minimum rent policies, some have tiered rent policies, and others have flat rent policies. About a third have simplified the utility calculation component. Most MTW agencies have adopted their own minimum, tiered, or flat rent policies, with some simplifying utility calculations. Officials believe alternative rent structures encourage work and mimic the private market, making it easier for tenants to understand and staff to administer. However, there is a lack of systematic data to evaluate if these alternative rent structures have led to increased tenant earnings or decreased administrative work. MTW agencies have implemented new requirements for tenants, including work and time limit policies, to promote self-sufficiency and serve more families. The specifics of these policies vary across agencies, with some providing supportive services to families subject to the requirements. Data on the impact of alternative rent structures on tenant earnings and administrative work is lacking. MTW agencies have implemented work requirements and time limits to promote self-sufficiency and serve more families. The specifics of these policies vary, with some agencies providing supportive services. Additional streamlined policies, such as alternative inspection schedules and reporting requirements, aim to ensure decent housing quality for assisted units. Alternative housing quality inspection schedules and reporting requirements are being considered in the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program to ensure decent housing quality for assisted units. Some MTW agencies have adopted risk-based inspections and clustered inspections based on location to address concerns about the high staff resources required for annual inspections. This approach includes less frequent inspections for landlords with good records, self-certification of units, and sampling of rental units for inspection. The Oakland Housing Authority (CA) and Biennial Inspections are implementing a risk-based model for inspections, allowing landlords with good records to have less frequent inspections and self-certify units. Some MTW agencies are conducting inspections less frequently than annually and allowing owners to self-certify under certain conditions. The effectiveness and efficiency of these alternative HQS inspection procedures compared to traditional procedures still need to be evaluated. At this time, a full evaluation has not been conducted on whether alternative HQS inspection procedures are more effective than regulated program procedures for ensuring the quality of Section 8 voucher-assisted rental units. Additional research is needed to compare the effectiveness and efficiency of traditional inspection procedures with alternative ones. MTW agencies differ in how they report program information to HUD, with MTW agencies submitting Annual MTW Plans and Reports that encourage program creativity and strategic planning. Non-MTW agencies also submit plans but are more focused on meeting federal rules and regulations. MTW agencies submit more prescriptive plans focused on creativity and strategic planning, while non-MTW agencies focus on meeting federal regulations. MTW reporting requirements encourage program innovation, with activities needing HUD approval since 2008. HUD now has more oversight on MTW agencies' activities and outcomes. Since 2008, MTW agencies must include new activities in their Annual MTW Plans for HUD's approval. However, the current reporting process allows agencies to self-report outcomes without verification. Some agencies have struggled with new reporting requirements, and HUD's systems lack capacity for MTW-specific data. There has been no systematic evaluation of MTW agencies' policies in achieving program goals. Despite the lack of systematic evaluation, observations from tenant advocates, PHAs, and HUD have informed policy debates about the impact of MTW activities on tenants and PHAs. Concerns have been raised by low-income housing advocates about the negative effects of MTW agency policies on assisted housing tenants. Since the start of the MTW demonstration program, concerns have been raised about its impact on assisted housing tenants. HUD suggests that MTW has allowed PHAs to provide more housing units, but it's unclear if this has benefited low-income individuals or if it's due to reducing assistance to current recipients. MTW agencies may assist more families by reducing current recipients' assistance rather than saving on administrative costs. Policies like requiring tenants to pay rent above 30% of income have been implemented. Self-sufficiency programs could benefit low-income individuals in the long term, but it's unclear if time limits and work requirements result in needy families losing assistance. Reports suggest reduced access to portability, limiting housing choices for tenants. Further research is needed to determine the overall impact of MTW discretion on low-income individuals. MTW agencies have reduced tenants' access to portability, limiting housing choices. The MTW demonstration program has led to large-scale demolition of public housing, impacting tenants. Some agencies have replaced demolished housing with vouchers and mixed-income developments, claiming better quality and more opportunities for residents. Tenant advocates have raised objections. The Atlanta and Chicago PHAs have demolished most of their public housing, replacing it with vouchers and mixed-income developments. Advocates argue that this displacement harms communities and access to services. Research on the effects of public housing demolition, like the HOPE VI program, shows positive outcomes for tenants, such as living in lower-poverty neighborhoods with improved health. Research on the outcomes of public housing revitalization, particularly through the HOPE VI program, has shown positive results for tenants, with improved health outcomes and living in lower-poverty neighborhoods. However, vulnerable tenants, such as large families or those with disabilities, may not benefit as much and may require additional services. Supporters of the program believe that MTW agencies' discretion leads to cost-effective administration, as evidenced by high participation rates among PHAs and interest from more practitioners. Supporters of the MTW program, including PHA industry groups and some Members of Congress, believe in its popularity and cost-effectiveness. However, not everyone agrees, as some argue that MTW agencies may actually cost more to administer assisted housing. Additionally, there are concerns that the funding MTW agencies receive could negatively impact other PHAs in a limited funding environment. Some advocates suggest that MTW agencies receive higher-cost housing and their negotiated funding negatively affects other PHAs. Supporters claim MTW agencies reduce administrative burdens without increasing oversight risk. Unlike traditional PHAs, MTW agencies define their own outcome goals instead of following regulatory structures. MTW agencies operate under a different regulatory model, allowing them to set their own outcome goals and self-report their effectiveness to HUD. Supporters argue this fosters innovation and long-term planning, while critics question the oversight of program funds. The future of the MTW program beyond 2018 is uncertain. The future of the MTW demonstration program is uncertain as current agreements are set to expire in 2018. Proposals range from expanding MTW to phasing it out, with differing opinions on its role in reforming rental assistance programs. Critics call for more meaningful evaluations, while supporters advocate for a permanent program with potential changes. The future of the MTW demonstration program is uncertain as current agreements are set to expire in 2018. Proposals range from expanding MTW to phasing it out, with differing opinions on its role in reforming rental assistance programs. Policymakers are considering changing the program to make it more effective, turning it into a permanent program, or maintaining the status quo. The program aims to design and test various approaches for providing housing assistance, with goals of reducing cost, promoting work and self-sufficiency, and increasing family choice. The MTW demonstration program aims to reduce costs, promote work and self-sufficiency, and increase family choice. However, the program's effectiveness has been limited due to its design and implementation. Some suggest changes to allow for more research-oriented purposes, while HUD has proposed expanding the program to 60 agencies. HUD has proposed expanding the MTW demonstration program to 60 agencies for systematic evaluation of targeted policy changes. The selection of high-performing agencies capable of rigorous evaluation aims to assess policies for potential national adoption. Similar proposals are included in legislative reform acts like the Section 8 Voucher Reform Act and AHSSIA. The MTW demonstration program has been proposed for expansion to 60 agencies for evaluation of policy changes with potential national adoption. Calls have been made to expand MTW to at least 250 PHAs and make it a permanent program. Calls have been made to expand the Moving to Work (MTW) program to at least 250 Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) and make it a permanent program. Some have proposed block granting and deregulating federal housing assistance for all PHAs, similar to MTW, but concerns have been raised about potential funding reductions and loss of tenant protections. Tenant advocates are concerned about potential rent increases and loss of protections under a deregulated block grant proposal for federal housing assistance. HUD has expressed concerns about the capacity of some agencies entering the MTW program, recommending selection based on evaluation capacity, innovation, and local support. It is unclear if the current MTW program or a fully deregulated block grant program would be a suitable model. HUD has recommended that PHAs be selected for the MTW program based on evaluation capacity, innovation, and local support. It is uncertain if the current MTW program or a fully deregulated block grant program would be suitable for small PHAs. Congress may consider adding a small number of additional agencies to the program. HUD has taken steps to address critics' concerns by increasing reporting requirements and standardizing agreements. If the program continues as is, participating PHAs will continue to experiment. HUD has taken steps to address concerns raised by critics of the existing Moving to Work (MTW) program, such as increasing reporting requirements and standardizing agreements. Participating Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) will continue to experiment with new policies that may influence assisted housing programs. Both HUD and policymakers are considering incorporating reforms adopted by MTW agencies into mainstream programs, including changes to inspection rules, income calculation rules, and rent policies. PHAs may adopt policies experimented with by MTW PHAs, including changes to inspection, income calculation, and rent policies. Bipartisan consensus is forming in favor of some reforms, but controversial policies remain, such as changing assistance amounts and placing conditions on receipt of assistance. Tenant advocates and researchers have concerns about the effects of these policies on tenant outcomes."
