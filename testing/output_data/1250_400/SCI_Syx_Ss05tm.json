    "content": "Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks in computer vision, where perturbations to images can cause the model to make mistakes. A new attack method reprograms the target model to perform a task chosen by the attacker without specifying the desired output for each input. This single perturbation can be added to all inputs to make the model perform the desired task, even if it was not trained for it. Adversarial reprogramming was demonstrated on ImageNet models for tasks like counting and classification of MNIST and CIFAR-10 examples. Adversarial reprogramming was demonstrated on ImageNet models for tasks like counting and classification of MNIST and CIFAR-10 examples. Various methods have been proposed to construct and defend against adversarial attacks, which aim to cause model prediction errors with small changes to the input. In this work, the focus is on a new adversarial goal: reprogramming the model to perform a task chosen by the attacker without needing to compute the specific desired output. This differs from traditional adversarial attacks that aim to degrade model performance or induce specific outputs. The goal is to anticipate and address unexplored adversarial goals to enhance the security of machine learning systems. In this study, the focus is on reprogramming machine learning models to perform tasks chosen by attackers without needing to compute specific desired outputs. Adversaries aim to achieve this by learning reprogramming functions that map between different tasks, adjusting parameters to accomplish the desired task. The approach involves converting inputs from one domain to another and mapping outputs accordingly. In this study, the focus is on adversarial reprogramming of machine learning models. The parameters are adjusted to achieve the desired task without needing specific outputs. The attack does not have to be imperceptible to humans to be successful. Adversarial reprogramming can lead to theft of computational resources and repurposing of models. The attack in adversarial reprogramming does not require being imperceptible to humans to succeed.

These programs target convolutional neural networks designed for ImageNet classification and demonstrate the network's flexibility in adapting to new objectives. The study also explores the susceptibility of trained and untrained networks to adversarial reprogramming, as well as the concealment of adversarial programs and data. Adversarial reprogramming involves crafting adversarial programs to train neural networks for new tasks. Adversarial examples are intentionally designed inputs to cause machine learning models to make mistakes. These attacks can be untargeted or targeted, affecting various domains like malware detection and generative models. The network predicts ImageNet labels that map to the adversarial task labels when presented with adversarial images. In the domain of adversarial reprogramming, researchers are developing methods to create specific functionality in neural networks rather than hardcoded outputs. By crafting adversarial programs, a single program can be used to manipulate multiple input images to produce desired results. This approach extends the concept of adversarial examples, where intentional inputs cause machine learning models to make errors. Parasitic computing exploits network communication to force systems to perform complex tasks they were not originally designed for. Adversarial reprogramming involves using a single program to manipulate multiple input images in neural networks. It is a form of parasitic computing that repurposes networks to perform new tasks, similar to transfer learning methods. This approach does not involve leveraging communication protocols or gaining access to the host computer. Transfer learning and adversarial reprogramming both aim to repurpose neural networks for new tasks. Transfer learning uses knowledge from one task to learn another, while adversarial reprogramming manipulates networks without altering the model parameters. Neural networks have versatile properties useful for various tasks, such as image feature development resembling Gabor filters. Empirical work shows that a network trained for one task can be adapted for others with simple adjustments like training a linear SVM classifier. Transfer learning involves using a convolutional neural network trained for one task to perform another task by training a linear SVM classifier. Adversarial reprogramming, on the other hand, allows for changing model parameters to achieve new tasks through manipulation of input. The adversary's objective is to reprogram the network by crafting an adversarial program to be included in the input, making it more challenging than transfer learning. The network was initially designed for ImageNet classification, but the methods discussed can be extended to other settings. The adversarial program is formulated as an additive contribution to network input, not specific to a single image but applied to all images. It is defined by parameters W, a masking matrix M, and bounded by tanh to be in range (-1, 1). The central region of the adversarial program is masked out for visualization purposes. The adversarial program is designed to enhance visualization of actions, using tanh to limit perturbation. It aims to maximize the probability of ImageNet labels through a mapping function. The optimization problem includes a weight norm penalty to prevent overfitting. The adversarial program aims to maximize the probability of ImageNet labels by assigning classes to adversarial labels. It utilizes a weight norm penalty to prevent overfitting and optimizes the loss with Adam while exponentially decaying the learning rate. The program has minimal computation cost for the adversary post-optimization, as it only requires computing X adv and mapping the resulting ImageNet label to the correct class. Adversarial reprogramming exploits the nonlinear behavior of the target model, unlike traditional adversarial examples that rely on linear approximations.

Adversarial attacks on models with random weights revealed the importance of the original task performed by neural networks in adversarial reprogramming. Random networks had difficulty training and produced qualitatively different adversarial programs compared to pretrained ImageNet models. Randomly initialized networks may perform poorly due to poor scaling of network weights at initialization, while trained weights are better conditioned. Adversarial reprogramming may rely on similarities between original and adversarial data, as demonstrated by reprogramming ImageNet networks to classify shuffled MNIST digits with almost equal accuracy to standard MNIST. The study successfully reprogrammed pretrained ImageNet networks to classify shuffled MNIST digits with high accuracy, indicating the possibility of reprogramming across tasks with unrelated datasets. Reprogramming shuffled CIFAR-10 images was also attempted, showing decreased accuracy due to the convolutional structure not being useful for classifying shuffled images. This suggests that transferring knowledge between original and adversarial data does not fully explain susceptibility to reprogramming. The study demonstrated the successful reprogramming of pretrained ImageNet networks to classify MNIST digits with limited visibility of adversarial perturbations. By reducing the size and scale of the adversarial program, reprogramming across tasks and domains was still achievable, albeit with lower accuracy. The study showed successful reprogramming of ImageNet networks to classify MNIST digits with limited visibility of adversarial perturbations. Adversarial reprogramming remained successful even with nearly imperceptible programs and concealing the task within a normal ImageNet image. The study successfully reprogrammed ImageNet networks to classify MNIST digits by hiding the adversarial task within a random ImageNet image. The resulting adversarial images closely resembled normal ImageNet images, demonstrating the possibility of concealing the adversarial task effectively. Our study demonstrated the effectiveness of hiding adversarial tasks within ImageNet images for reprogramming neural networks. Trained networks were more susceptible to reprogramming than random networks, showing flexibility in repurposing weights for new tasks. This suggests the potential for more practical and efficient machine learning systems with shared compute. Recent work in machine learning has focused on building large dynamically connected networks with reusable components, showing the potential for more practical and efficient machine learning systems with shared compute. It remains unclear whether limitations in expressivity or trainability are responsible for reduced performance in certain situations, and further research is needed to disentangle these factors. Adversarial reprogramming across different domains such as audio, video, and text is an interesting area for future exploration, with the possibility of reprogramming trained networks for tasks beyond image classification. Trained networks can be reprogrammed to classify shuffled images, suggesting reprogramming across domains is possible.
