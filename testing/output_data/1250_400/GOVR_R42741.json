Participation is voluntary, with about 85% of employees and 90% of retirees enrolled. Plans are either fee-for-service (FFS) or health maintenance organizations (HMOs), with shared premiums between the government and individuals. All plans cover basic services like hospital and physician care, with varying cost sharing through deductibles, co-payments, or coinsurance. The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program offers private health insurance to federal employees, retirees, and their dependents through fee-for-service (FFS) or health maintenance organizations (HMOs). Premiums are shared between the government and individuals, with all plans covering basic services like hospital and physician care. Prior to FEHB's creation in 1959, federal employees had to obtain health insurance on their own or through union plans. President Truman's Commission recommended federal government health insurance coverage in 1951, leading to the passage of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (FEHBA) established parameters for eligibility, coverage options, and premium cost-sharing between federal employees and the government. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) oversees the program and has the authority to contract with insurers. The general model of FEHB, where enrollees choose from various private insurance plans, has remained consistent despite amendments to the act. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (FEHBA) established the model of FEHB where enrollees choose from competing private insurers. While the general model has remained consistent, aspects such as premium cost-sharing and eligibility have been modified over time through legislative changes. Policymakers and researchers have shown interest in FEHB as a model for health insurance programs and for expanding coverage to certain individuals. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (FEHBA) established the FEHB model where enrollees choose from competing private insurers. Policymakers and researchers have been interested in using FEHB as a model for expanding health insurance coverage to various individuals. The FEHB model is seen as successful in allowing enrollees to make cost-conscious choices and controlling overall program costs. There have been suggestions to export aspects of the FEHB model to other health care programs, expand access to FEHB, or create new programs based on FEHB for coverage of non-federal workers or retirees. Some policymakers have introduced legislation to create new programs or expand FEHB eligibility, while others have considered using FEHB features for state-level health insurance exchanges. Some policymakers have embraced the idea of expanding FEHB eligibility for individuals like small business employees or the uninsured. Lessons from FEHB may be useful for state and federal officials establishing health insurance exchanges under the ACA. Congressional interest in FEHB extends beyond its potential as a model for other programs, as Congress has a financial interest and legislative authority to maintain its function. This report aims to explain how FEHB has evolved and Congress's role in its viability and sustainability. Congress has a financial interest in the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program and has the authority to restructure it. The report details how Congress has interacted with FEHB, including conditioning federal funds on policy changes, adjusting the government's share of premiums, modifying eligibility, and impacting the relationship between Medicare and FEHB. Congress can place conditions on federal funds to make changes to FEHB, as seen in past legislation. The Appendix provides a summary of the enacting FEHB legislation and a list of laws that have amended FEHB. Congress can impose conditions on federal funds to make changes to FEHB, such as prohibiting the use of funds for abortions except in certain circumstances. The government's share of premiums in FEHB has increased over the years, with changes made to the percentage and dollar range in 1971. The government's share of premiums in FEHB has increased over the years, with changes made to the percentage and dollar range in 1971. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 introduced the current formula where the government contributes 72% of the weighted average premium of all plans, not exceeding 75% of any one plan's premium. Eligible participants include current federal employees, retirees who retired after July 1, 1960, and their family members. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act (FEHBA) was enacted to provide health insurance coverage for federal employees, retirees, and their family members. Eligibility has been extended over the years to include part-time employees, certain temporary workers, and those eligible for temporary continuation of coverage (TCC). TCC enrollees must pay the entire premium, including the government's share and an administrative fee. In 1988, Congress authorized temporary continuation of coverage (TCC) for separating employees and their dependents in the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program. TCC enrollees must pay the full premium and a 2% administrative fee. TCC is generally available for up to 18 months, with exceptions for children aging out of their parents' plans. FEHB was established before Medicare, but in 1982, federal workers became eligible for Medicare due to the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act. In 1982, Congress passed the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (P.L. 97-248), which allowed federal workers to be eligible for Medicare based on their federal employment. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (P.L. 86-382) established the FEHB program for federal employees, outlining eligibility, benefits, premiums, and the role of the Office of Personnel Management. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (P.L. 86-382) established the FEHB program for federal employees, allowing current federal employees, retirees, and their family members to enroll in approved health benefit plans through the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Eligible participants must meet specific criteria such as having at least 12 years of service, being enrolled in an FEHB plan for a certain period, and retirees must have retired after July 1, 1960. OPM can contract or approve different types of health benefit plans for participation in FEHB, including Service Benefit Plans, Indemnity Benefit Plans, and Employee Organization Plans. Under P.L. 86-382, the government's share of premiums in FEHB plans was 50% for service benefit and indemnity plans, and varied based on the type of plan and enrollee. Employee Organization Plans provide health benefits to members of organizations, while Comprehensive Medical Plans offer prepaid health services either through group-practice or individual-practice prepayment plans. The government's share of premiums in FEHB plans under P.L. 86-382 varied based on the type of plan and enrollee. For service benefit and indemnity plans, the government's share was 50% of the lowest carrier rate. Different biweekly government shares were specified for individual and family coverage, with varying amounts for female employees with family coverage. Employee organization and comprehensive medical plans had different government share percentages based on biweekly premium amounts. The government's share of FEHB premiums varied based on plan type and enrollee, with different percentages for individual and family coverage. P.L. 86-568 authorized FEHB coverage for employees of county committees under the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act. P.L. 88-59 extended the deadline for applications from qualified employee organizations to participate in FEHB and eliminated the requirement for prior health care benefits. P.L. 88-284, passed on March 17, 1964, extended the deadline for FEHB applications to December 31, 1963, and removed the requirement for employee organizations to offer health care benefits prior to applying. It broadened FEHB coverage to include employees with work-related injuries, foster children, and unmarried children up to age 21. The act also allowed retirees to continue FEHB coverage if enrolled by December 31, 1964, and gave OPM authority to terminate contracts with carriers not enrolling at least 300 employees and retirees. The Federal Employees' Health Benefits Act of 1959 was extended by P.L. 88-531 on August 31, 1964, to include certain United States commissioners and their dependents. The act also made changes to premium shares for employee organization plans and comprehensive medical plans. P.L. 88-531 and P.L. 88-631 authorized FEHB coverage for specific groups, including United States commissioners and teachers in the District of Columbia, with certain eligibility criteria. P.L. 88-631 authorized FEHB coverage for teachers in the District of Columbia who had been employed for at least two school years. P.L. 89-379 extended FEHB coverage to congressional employees with certain staff fellowships. P.L. 89-504 amended FEHB to change government share of premiums and extended coverage for dependent children up to age 22. The government share for all plan types increased to $1.62 for individual enrollment and $3.94 for family enrollment, not exceeding 50% of the total premium. FEHB coverage was extended to dependent children up to age 22. Various acts granted FEHB coverage to National Guard technicians, United States magistrates, and federal employees transferring to international organizations. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1969 (P.L. 91-175) granted federal employees the option to continue FEHB participation during employment transfer to international organizations. The To Increase the Contribution by the Federal Government to the Cost of Health Benefits Insurance Act (P.L. 91-418) established the \"big six\" formula for government contribution to health benefit premiums based on the average of six benefit plans. The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program includes various plans such as the fee-for-service plan, the indemnity plan, and two employee organization plans. The government's share of premiums is set at 40% of the average of the big six premiums. The program also allows family members of deceased employees with less than five years of service to continue enrollment. Additionally, noncitizen employees in the Panama Canal Zone are eligible for FEHB coverage. The Intergovernmental Personnel Act of 1970 extended FEHB coverage to federal employees assigned to state or local governments.

Employees must be enrolled in an FEHB plan for at least five years prior to retirement to continue coverage. Various amendments and acts redefined the term \"employee\" for FEHB eligibility, excluding certain individuals. The amendments in P.L. 96-179 and P.L. 97-248 changed FEHB eligibility requirements for federal employees, including eliminating the \"lives with\" requirement for natural children and requiring payment of the Medicare Hospital Insurance tax. The amendments in P.L. 97-346 required federal employees to pay the Medicare Hospital Insurance tax to count their federal employment towards entitlement for premium-free benefits under Medicare Part A. Additionally, the act made Medicare payments secondary for employees aged 65 to 69 covered under certain employer group health plans.

Starting in 2018, a 40% tax will be imposed on health insurers and health plan administrators for coverage exceeding certain thresholds. This includes employer and employee premium payments, dental and vision coverage premiums, and payments towards health-related accounts. The thresholds are $10,200 for single coverage and $27,500 for family coverage, subject to inflation adjustments. The ACA requires the Director of OPM to offer at least two multistate plans through each exchange in each state. These plans will provide individual or group coverage, with separate risk pools from FEHB. The Director can establish separate units within OPM to ensure MSP administration does not interfere with FEHB. FEHB plans are not required to offer an MSP. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 allowed FEHB enrollees to select \"self plus one\" coverage in addition to individual and family coverage. The government's share of premiums for self plus one coverage is determined based on the weighted average premium of all plans in FEHB."
