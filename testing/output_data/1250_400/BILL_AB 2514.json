    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 34171 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to define terms related to administrative budget and administrative cost allowance for successor agencies. The administrative cost allowance is set at 5% of property tax allocated to the successor agency for a specific period, with a minimum amount of $250,000 unless reduced by the oversight board or by agreement with the successor agency. Starting July 1, 2016, the administrative cost allowance for successor agencies is up to 3% of property tax distributed by the county auditor-controller in the previous fiscal year. The allowance cannot be less than $250,000 unless reduced by the oversight board or by agreement with the department. Starting July 1, 2016, a successor agency's annual administrative costs cannot exceed 50% of the total Redevelopment Property Tax Trust Fund distributed to pay enforceable obligations in the previous fiscal year. This limit applies to administrative costs regardless of payment source, except for costs paid from bond proceeds or grant funds. The administrative cost allowance approved by the oversight board is the sole funding source for legal expenses related to civil actions. Employee costs for project implementation activities are not considered administrative costs. \"Designated local authority\" refers to a public entity formed under specific sections. \"Enforceable obligation\" is defined as certain obligations. The \"designated local authority\" is a public entity formed under specific sections. An \"enforceable obligation\" includes bonds, loans, and payments required by the federal government or state law. Loans borrowed by the redevelopment agency for lawful purposes, required to be repaid according to a repayment schedule or mandatory terms. Payments mandated by the federal government, preexisting obligations to the state, and obligations imposed by state law, including federal base reuse obligations for the former Norton Air Force Base as outlined in agreements. Costs incurred for fulfilling collective bargaining agreements for layoffs or terminations of city employees who worked directly for the former redevelopment agency are considered enforceable obligations payable from property tax funds. These obligations remain payable if the employee is transferred to the entity assuming the housing functions of the former agency. The successor agency must reimburse the housing entity for any employee-related costs. The oversight board, along with the successor agency, has the authority to appeal judgments or settlements against the former redevelopment agency. They can also terminate agreements or contracts with approval and provide necessary compensation. Titles or headings in documents do not determine enforceable obligations. Contracts or agreements required for the successor agency's operation, including litigation expenses, settlements, office space, equipment, supplies, and insurance costs, must be in accordance with the law. Legal expenses for civil actions challenging the validity of certain parts can only be paid from the administrative cost allowance starting January 1, 2016. A sponsoring entity may provide funds to a successor agency for legal expenses related to civil actions, including challenges to the validity of certain parts. If the successor agency wins the case, the funds are repayable; if not, they are considered a grant. Repayments of amounts borrowed from the Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund of a redevelopment agency must be approved by the oversight board and transferred to the Low and Moderate Income Housing Asset Fund for affordable housing purposes. The enforceable obligations under this part do not include agreements between the city, county, or city and county that created the redevelopment agency and the former agency. Written agreements for indebtedness obligations issued by December 31, 2010, or for refunding prior obligations by June 27, 2011, may be deemed enforceable. Loan agreements within two years of the agency's creation may also be considered enforceable obligations. Loan agreements entered into within two years of the creation of the redevelopment agency, agreements related to state highway infrastructure improvements committed funds prior to June 28, 2011, and agreements requiring repayment of outstanding loans or development obligations imposed by federal agencies are considered enforceable obligations. Contracts or agreements between the former redevelopment agency and other public agencies outside of redevelopment project areas not properly authorized under Part 1 shall be void, except for housing-related contracts. Indebtedness obligations refer to financing instruments issued for redevelopment projects. Oversight board refers to entities established under Section 34179. The condensed text chunk provides definitions for key terms related to redevelopment agencies, including oversight board, recognized obligation, recognized obligation payment schedule, school entity, successor agency, and taxing entities. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to redevelopment agencies, including taxing entities, property taxes, department, sponsoring entity, and final judicial determination. The curr_chunk defines the \"sponsoring entity\" as the entity authorizing a redevelopment agency, and the \"housing entity administrative cost allowance\" as an amount allocated for administrative costs from 2014 to 2018. The housing entity administrative cost allowance is up to 1% of property tax allocated to the Redevelopment Obligation Retirement Fund from 2014 to 2018, with a minimum of $150,000 per fiscal year. If a local housing authority assumed housing functions from a former redevelopment agency, the allowance is listed on the Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule and remitted to the authority twice a year. If there are insufficient funds in the Redevelopment Obligations Retirement Fund, the unpaid amount can be carried over to future Recognized Obligation Payment Schedules without a five-year limit."
