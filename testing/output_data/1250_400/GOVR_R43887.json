    "content": "The Older Americans Act (OAA), enacted in 1965, provides social services and programs for individuals aged 60 and older. Services include nutrition programs, caregiver support, employment services, and abuse prevention. The OAA has seven titles, with most programs administered by the Administration on Aging (AOA) in the Department of Health and Human Services. Funding for different titles comes from either HHS or the Department of Labor. Congress has reauthorized and amended the act multiple times since its inception. The Older Americans Act (OAA) is administered by the Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration. Funding for OAA Titles II, III, IV, VI, and VII comes from annual HHS appropriations, while Title V funding is provided in the annual DOL appropriations. Congress has reauthorized and amended the act multiple times, with the last reauthorization in 2006. Despite the expiration of authorizations of appropriations in FY2011, Congress continues to appropriate funding for OAA programs and activities. This report discusses OAA funding, including an overview of FY2015 funding, a breakdown of current-year funding, funding history since FY2001, and legislative activity in FY2015. The report provides an overview of OAA funding, including a breakdown of current-year funding for programs and activities, funding history since FY2001, and legislative activity in FY2015. The FY2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act funded OAA programs at $1.878 billion, a slight increase from FY2014. Appendices offer more detailed funding information and history. The FY2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act funded OAA programs at $1.878 billion, with Title III programs receiving the largest proportion of funding for nutrition, supportive services, family caregivers, and health promotion activities. Title V, the CSEOA Program, received almost one-fourth of the funding, while the remaining funds were allocated to various other OAA programs. The FY2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act allocated $1.878 billion for OAA programs, with Title III receiving the largest share for nutrition, supportive services, family caregivers, and health promotion. Funding for Title IV included support for Holocaust survivors and an Elder Justice Initiative. Overall OAA funding levels have fluctuated over the years, with a steady increase from FY2006 to FY2010, but remaining below the FY2010 level since then. Total discretionary funding for OAA programs increased slightly from FY2001 to FY2002 and remained relatively flat through FY2006. Overall, OAA program funding increased steadily from $1.783 billion in FY2006 to $2.328 billion in FY2010, with additional funding provided in FY2009 and a one-time special appropriation in FY2010. However, total discretionary funding for OAA programs declined from FY2011 to FY2013, with FY2013 funding falling below the FY2007 level. Funding for FY2014 and FY2015 was slightly below the FY2012 level. President Obama signed the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-235) on December 16, 2014, providing $1.878 billion in FY2015 funding for OAA programs. The FY2015 appropriations law reflected the new consolidated ACL account structure, combining aging and disability services programs. Prior to this, FY2015 discretionary funding for OAA programs was provided through three continuing resolutions. The FY2015 appropriations law (P.L. 113-235) provided $1.878 billion for aging and disability services programs administered by ACL, not just aging services programs administered by AOA as in prior years. Prior to this, FY2015 discretionary funding for most federal government agencies was provided through three continuing resolutions. The FY2015 appropriations law (P.L. 113-235) allocated $1.878 billion for aging and disability services programs under ACL. The House and Senate proposed different funding levels for OAA programs in FY2015, with the House bill introducing H.R. 5464 to increase funding for certain programs. The Senate Appropriations Labor-HHS-Education Subcommittee approved an FY2015 appropriations bill on June 10, 2014, funding OAA programs at $1.871 billion. The bill proposed changes in funding levels for family caregiver and Nutrition Services Incentive Program, as well as $10.0 million for the Elder Justice Initiative. President Obama's FY2015 budget request proposed $1.819 billion for OAA programs, with some exceptions in funding levels. President Obama's FY2015 budget request proposed $1.819 billion for OAA programs, with changes in funding levels for various programs including $20.0 million for Aging and Disability Resource Centers, $380.0 million for the CSEOA Program, $5.0 million for a Holocaust Survivor Assistance Fund, and $3.0 million for the White House Conference on Aging. Additionally, $25.0 million was requested for an \"Elder Justice Initiative\" and the administration of the CSEOA program was proposed to be transferred. The FY2015 budget proposed funding changes for various OAA programs, including $20.0 million for Aging and Disability Resource Centers, $380.0 million for the CSEOA Program, $5.0 million for a Holocaust Survivor Assistance Fund, and $3.0 million for the White House Conference on Aging. Additionally, $25.0 million was requested for an \"Elder Justice Initiative\" and the administration of the CSEOA program was proposed to be transferred to ACL. The FY2015 budget proposed funding changes for various OAA programs, including $380.0 million for the CSEOA Program, which aims to provide part-time opportunities in community service for unemployed low-income individuals aged 55 and older. The program was proposed to be transferred from DOL to ACL to integrate with other aging services programs. This transfer would consolidate Federal oversight of the OAA under one department. The FY2015 proposal suggested transferring the CSEOA Program from DOL to ACL to align with other aging services programs, aiming to consolidate Federal oversight of the OAA under one department. This transfer would require congressional legislation for implementation. ACL's proposed changes included targeting the program to those with the greatest need, considering all sources of income for eligibility, and focusing funds on areas with the potential for the largest impact. ACL proposed restructuring the CSEOA program to consider all sources of income for eligibility and target funds to areas with the potential for the largest impact. The program would remain funded and administered under DOL for FY2015, with no changes to program administration. H.R. 5464 would have funded CSEOA under the DOL account at $448.3 million for FY2015, with no changes to program administration. The President's FY2015 budget proposed $5.0 million for a Holocaust Survivor Assistance Fund, but the Senate bill did not allocate funds due to budget constraints. Approximately 130,000 Holocaust survivors live in the US, with 25% living in poverty. The Senate bill and H.R. 5464 did not allocate funding for the Holocaust Survivor Assistance Fund due to budget constraints. However, FY2015 final funding included $2.5 million for supportive services for aging Holocaust survivors. Aging and Disability Resource Centers (ADRCs) aim to provide information and counseling on long-term services and supports, as well as access to public programs like Medicaid and Department of Veterans Affairs programs. ADRCs also offer discharge planning and care transition services to help individuals stay in their homes after hospitalization or rehabilitation. ADRCs offer counseling on LTSS options, public programs like Medicaid, and discharge planning to help individuals stay at home post-hospitalization. There are over 500 ADRC sites nationwide, with $10 million in mandatory funding from ACA and $6.1 million in discretionary funding from OAA Title II in FY2014. The President's FY2015 budget proposed no discretionary funding but $20.0 million annually for five years in renewed mandatory funding. AOA and CMS have provided $100 million since 2003 to develop ADRC services. The FY2015 budget did not allocate discretionary funding for ADRCs, but proposed $20.0 million annually for five years in renewed mandatory funding. The Senate bill included $6.1 million in discretionary funding for ADRCs and urged better coordination among ADRCs, AAAs, and CILs. Final FY2015 funding provided $6.1 million in discretionary funding, not meeting the President's request for additional mandatory funding. The FY2015 budget did not allocate discretionary funding for ADRCs. Final FY2015 funding provided $6.1 million in discretionary funding to ADRCs, the same as the FY2014 amount. The President's budget request for additional mandatory funding was not fulfilled. White House Conferences on Aging have historically focused attention on concerns of older individuals and provided direction to federal policymakers. The President's FY2015 budget proposed $3.0 million for a White House Conference on Aging in 2015, but the Senate bill did not provide dedicated funding, suggesting support from existing resources. The FY2015 budget proposed $3.0 million for a White House Conference on Aging in 2015, but no dedicated funding was provided in the final appropriations. The conference will focus on retirement security, healthy aging, long-term services and supports, and elder justice. The White House plans to use technology to engage more people for the conference. The White House Conference on Aging will commemorate the anniversaries of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the Older Americans Act. Policy areas such as retirement security, healthy aging, long-term services and supports, and elder justice will be highlighted. Regional forums and listening sessions will be held to gather input for the conference. For more information, visit http://www.whitehouseconferenceonaging.gov. Older Americans Act authorizations and funding history are also provided in the appendices."
