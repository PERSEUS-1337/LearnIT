    "content": "The House and Senate Armed Services Committees annually review national defense authorization bills with provisions affecting military personnel, retirees, and their families. Differences between the House and Senate versions are resolved by a conference committee. This report highlights personnel-related issues in the FY2016 NDAA, comparing House and Senate versions. The FY2016 NDAA, S. 1356, was passed by the House and Senate, signed by the President after vetoing an earlier version due to exceeding defense spending caps. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 raised spending caps for both defense and nondefense spending. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 raised spending caps for both defense and nondefense spending, allowing defense-related spending for FY2016 to exceed the BCA defense spending cap. The FY2016 NDAA was modified to comply with the revised spending caps and passed by the House and Senate. The Congressional Budget Office issued cost estimates for bills related to defense spending in 2015. Background information on authorized active duty end-strengths for FY2001 and subsequent increases in personnel strength in response to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are provided. The authorized active duty end-strengths for FY2001 were: Army (480,000), Navy (372,642), Marine Corps (172,600), and Air Force (357,000). Congress increased Army and Marine Corps personnel strength in response to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but began reversing these increases due to withdrawals and budget constraints. End-strengths for the Air Force and Navy have been declining since 2001. In FY2015, authorized end-strengths were: Army (490,000), Navy (323,600), Marine Corps (184,100), and Air Force (312,980). The Army plans to reduce personnel strength to 420,000-450,000 by FY2017, while the Marine Corps plans to reduce to 175,000-182,000 in the FY2017-2019 timeframe. The Army plans to reduce its active personnel strength to between 420,000 and 450,000 by FY2017, while the Marine Corps plans to reduce to between 175,000 and 182,000 in the FY2017-2019 timeframe. The Administration request proposed continuing the reduction in Army strength, with Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force strengths remaining essentially level or increasing compared to FY2015. The final bill authorized end-strengths identical to the Administration's request, except for the Air Force, which was 3,715 higher. Section 402 of the initial Senate-passed bill would have repealed minimum end-strengths for the armed forces. The final bill (P.L. 114-92 / S. 1356) adjusted the minimum end-strengths required by 10 USC 619 downward, allowing reductions in personnel numbers for active components, National Guard, and Reserve components. The final bill (P.L. 114-92 / S. 1356) adjusted the minimum end-strengths required by 10 USC 619 downward, allowing reductions in personnel numbers for active components, National Guard, and Reserve components by up to 2%. This change expanded the Secretary of Defense's authority to decrease minimum strengths, with a decrease of up to 2% now permitted. The overall authorized end strength of the Selected Reserves has declined by about 5% over the past 14 years, with reductions in Navy Reserve strength being a significant factor. The overall authorized end strength of the Selected Reserves has declined by about 5% over the past 14 years, with significant reductions in Navy Reserve strength. Authorized end strengths for the Selected Reserves in FY2001 were: Army National Guard (350,526), Army Reserve (205,300), Navy Reserve (88,900), Marine Corps Reserve (39,558), Air National Guard (108,022), Air Force Reserve (74,358), and Coast Guard Reserve (8,000). The largest shifts in authorized end strength between FY2001 and FY2015 have occurred in the Navy Reserve (-31,600 or -35.5%), Air Force Reserve (-7,258 or -9.8%), and Coast Guard Reserve (-1,000 or -12.5%). For FY2016, the Administration proposed reductions in authorized Selected Reserve end strength for three components: Army National Guard (-8,200), Army Reserve (-4,000), and Marine Corps Reserve (-300). Increases were proposed for Navy Reserve (+100), Air National Guard (+500), and Air Force Reserve (+2,100). No change was proposed for Coast Guard Reserve. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) matched the Administration's request. The FY2016 enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) matched the Administration's proposed reductions in authorized Selected Reserve end strength for various components, with no change proposed for the Coast Guard Reserve. The military pay raise for 2016 was set at 2.3% unless Congress or the President specified otherwise. The FY2016 enacted bill matched the Administration's proposed reductions in authorized Selected Reserve end strength for various components, with no change proposed for the Coast Guard Reserve. The annual increase in the Employment Cost Index (ECI) would be 2.3% unless Congress or the President specified otherwise. The FY2016 President's Budget requested a 1.3% military pay raise, lower than the statutory formula of 2.3%, in line with DOD plans to limit pay increases through FY2020. The DOD Budget Request Overview estimated ECI increases of 2.3% per year for the next four years, with limited pay raises planned through FY2020. The initial House bill contained no provision for the rate of pay increase, emphasizing the importance of robust compensation programs for maintaining a high-quality, combat-ready force. The initial House bill (H.R. 1735) did not specify the rate of increase in basic pay, but the accompanying report supported a 2.3 percent military pay raise for fiscal year 2016 to keep pace with private sector pay increases. The initial Senate version proposed a 1.3% pay increase for servicemembers below the O-7 paygrade and maintained the pay cap for higher-ranking officers. President Obama invoked 37 U.S.C. 1009(e) to set the pay raise. President Obama set the military pay raise for 2016 at 1.3%, freezing the basic pay of generals and admirals at 2014 levels. The final bill did not include a general pay raise provision, maintaining the 1.3% increase specified by President Obama. The military retirement system underwent changes with the enactment of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2013, which established a commission to modernize pay and benefits. The final recommendations were delivered to Congress in January 2015, and many of these changes were included in the enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356). The retirement system is a key incentive for retaining a career military force, and active duty military and veteran's groups closely monitor any alterations to the system. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) will change the military retirement system to a blended defined-benefit, defined-contribution system with reduced benefits and continuation pay at 12 years of service. Existing servicemembers and those entering before January 1, 2018 will be grandfathered into the current system, while others can elect the new system. Cost of Living Allowance adjustments are repealed by this Act. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) changes the military retirement system to a blended defined-benefit, defined-contribution system with reduced benefits and continuation pay at 12 years of service. Servicemembers entering before January 1, 2018 will be grandfathered into the current system, while others can elect the new system. Cost of Living Allowance adjustments are repealed by this Act. The issue of sexual assault in the military has received congressional and media attention, leading to changes in previous NDAAs. The final bill contains provisions on legal procedures, policies, programs, and data collection for military sexual assaults. The final version of the bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) addresses concerns about sexual assault in the military, including provisions on legal procedures, policies, programs, and data collection. A report highlighted social retaliation faced by victims, with 53% experiencing some form of retaliation. The Government Accountability Office identified a need for better care for male victims, which the bill aims to improve. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) addresses concerns about sexual assault in the military, including improving care for male victims and enhancing the Special Victims' Counsel Program. It also modifies requirements for judicial proceedings, reporting, and sentencing in sex-related offenses. On January 24, 2013, the Department of Defense rescinded the 1994 Direct Combat Exclusion Rule to allow women in combat roles. By December 3, 2015, all military occupations were open to women with no exceptions. Congress has established requirements for gender-neutral occupational standards, directing the DOD on their development and application. In 1994, Congress established gender-neutral occupational performance standards for the military. The FY2015 NDAA emphasized that performance standards must be related to actual duties and measure individual capabilities. The FY2016 NDAA added criteria for combat unit readiness standards, requiring validation efforts. DOD must notify Congress of changes to assignment policies for females. Under the law (10 U.S.C. \u00a7652), DOD must notify Congress of changes to assignment policies for females. The waiting period for Congress to review these changes has been shortened to 30 calendar days under the enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356). This change provides a more definitive timeline for DOD implementation and reduces the amount of time Congress has to review and act on proposed changes. The congressionally mandated Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission found weaknesses in financial literacy programs for military servicemembers, potentially impacting readiness. Improving financial literacy could save DOD between $13 million and $137 million annually and reduce troops separated due to financial distress. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) includes provisions for financial literacy training at various career points. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) requires financial literacy training for military servicemembers at different career stages, including entry and life transitions. Statutory requirements for enlistment differ between active and reserve components. The Military Accessions Vital to National Interest (MAVNI) program allows exceptions for enlistment if vital to national interest. Enlistment requirements include being a citizen, lawful permanent resident, or having previously served in the armed forces. The enacted bill requires financial literacy training for military servicemembers at different career stages. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) did not include the provision linking eligibility requirements for enlisting in the reserve component with the active component. Congress established the Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) in 2004 to provide enhanced educational benefits to reservists called to active service during war or national emergencies. The Post\u20109/11 GI Bill, approved four years later, offered more generous benefits, leading to a recommendation to terminate REAP. The initial Senate-passed bill (H.R. 1735) proposed a sunset date for REAP four years after enactment. The Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission recommended terminating the Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP), with current beneficiaries allowed to exhaust their entitlement. The Senate-passed bill established a sunset date for REAP and limited eligibility to those enrolled prior to the enactment date. The enacted bill contained the Senate provision. For more information on REAP and the Post 9/11 GI Bill, see CRS Report RL30802 and CRS Report R42785. The Senate-passed bill (H.R. 1735) would entitle individuals undergoing discharge from the Armed Forces to a \"Recognition of Service ID Card\" one year after enactment. The card must identify the bearer as a veteran with their name and photo. The Secretary of Defense can negotiate with national retail chains for discounts for veterans. The Senate-passed bill (H.R. 1735) would entitle individuals undergoing discharge from the Armed Forces to a \"Recognition of Service ID Card\" one year after enactment. The card must identify the bearer as a veteran with their name and photo. The Secretary of Defense can negotiate with national retail chains for discounts for veterans. Additionally, honorably discharged veterans can utilize state-issued ID cards or obtain an ID card through the joint DOD-VA eBenefits web portal. President Obama signed the Veterans Identification Card Act of 2015 into law on July 20, 2015. In January 2014, honorably separated members of the Uniformed Services can get an ID card through the DOD-VA eBenefits web portal. President Obama signed the Veterans Identification Card Act of 2015 into law on July 20, 2015, requiring the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide ID cards to veterans showing military service. Congress is interested in recruiting and retaining high-quality personnel in the armed forces through various incentives like bonuses and educational benefits. The House-passed bill authorizes service secretaries to offer recruitment incentives for officers and warrant officers. A wide array of bonus and incentive pay authorities is contained in chapter 5 of Title 37 of the United States Code. Section 531 of the House-passed bill authorizes service secretaries to provide recruitment incentives for officers, warrant officers, and enlisted personnel. The proposed incentives would be subject to a 30-day congressional review and approval period. Reservists called into active federal service are eligible for legal protections, including the right to reemployment under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994. Reservists called into active federal service are eligible for legal protections, including the right to reemployment under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994. USERRA exempts certain types of duty from counting towards the five year limit, such as activations under Full Mobilization, Partial Mobilization, and Presidential Reserve Call-Up. New mobilization authorities created in 2011 allow for 120-day activations for disaster response and 365 day activations for preplanned missions in support of combatant commands. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 created new mobilization authorities for reservists, allowing 120-day activations for disaster response and 365-day activations for preplanned missions. Section 565 of the bill exempts military duty under these authorities from counting towards the five-year limit on military service for reemployment protection under USERRA. A veteran is defined as a person who served in active military, naval, or air service under conditions other than dishonorable. Active service includes full-time service in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, Public Health Service, or National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Active duty for training is not considered active service for VA benefits. Active service for veterans includes full-time service in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, Public Health Service, or National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Additional circumstances of service are outlined in law. National Guard and reserves must be activated for active duty military service to meet the statutory definition of a veteran. Reservists become eligible for retirement after 20 years of qualifying service. Reservists qualify for retirement after 20 years of service, but may not be considered veterans unless they have completed required active service. The House bill initially honored reservists as veterans without additional benefits, but this provision was not included in the enacted bill. For more information on veteran eligibility and benefits, refer to CRS reports R42324 and R41386. The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 established a pilot Career Intermission Program (CIP) allowing servicemembers to take up to 3 years off for work/life balance or broadening opportunities. Contact CRS for more information on veterans' burial benefits and Reserve Component retirement benefits. The Career Intermission Program (CIP) allows servicemembers to take up to 3 years off for work/life balance or broadening opportunities. The program aims to retain high-performing servicemembers by providing career flexibility and increasing retention rates. Participants accept an additional active duty service obligation. DOD must submit a final assessment to Congress by March 1, 2016. The Career Intermission Program (CIP) allows servicemembers to take up to 3 years off for work/life balance or broadening opportunities, with an additional active duty service obligation. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) removes prohibitions on program participation for certain members and increases the number of annual participants. Congress aims to improve recruitment, retention, and career management for the acquisition workforce, including incentives for high-performing military personnel in acquisition roles. Military acquisition professionals oversee significant funding for defense programs. Improving the quality of the acquisition workforce involves incentives for high-performing military personnel in acquisition roles and enhanced professional military education. The Goldwater-Nichols Act created incentives for officers in joint matters, and the NDAA extends joint duty credit to include acquisition-related assignments. Officers can pursue a dual career track with a primary specialty in combat arms and a sub-specialty in acquisition. The Secretary of Defense is encouraged to ensure the curriculum for Phase II joint professional education includes acquisition. The NDAA extends joint duty credit to include service in acquisition-related assignments, allowing officers to pursue a dual career track in combat arms and acquisition fields. The Secretary of Defense is encouraged to include acquisition matters in Phase II joint professional military education. The current DOD policies restrict the carrying of firearms on military bases to personnel on duty. Recent active shooter incidents have raised concerns about the adequacy of force protection measures. A bill has been enacted to give commanders more flexibility in establishing protocols for carrying personal or government-issued firearms on military installations. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) compels DOD to give commanders more flexibility in establishing protocols for servicemembers to carry firearms for force protection. The Purple Heart is awarded to Armed Forces members killed or wounded in action, including in terrorist attacks. On April 19, 1995, a domestic terrorist bomb attack in Oklahoma City killed 168 people, including six servicemembers. There is debate over whether these servicemembers should be eligible for the Purple Heart, as they were victims of domestic terrorism. Eligibility for the Purple Heart was expanded in 2015 to include servicemembers wounded and killed in terrorist attacks at Little Rock and Fort Hood. The eligibility for the Purple Heart was expanded in 2015 to include servicemembers wounded and killed in terrorist attacks at Little Rock and Fort Hood. The law redefined what should be considered an attack by a \"foreign terrorist organization\" for purposes of determining eligibility for the Purple Heart. The eligibility for the Purple Heart was expanded in 2015 to include servicemembers wounded and killed in terrorist attacks at Little Rock and Fort Hood. The law redefined criteria for considering an attack by a foreign terrorist organization for Purple Heart eligibility. The provision in Section 583 of the initial House-passed bill was not adopted, meaning victims of the Oklahoma City bombing are not eligible for the Purple Heart under the enacted bill. The issue of military working dogs (MWDs) has received congressional and media attention over the years. Congress passed \"Robby's Law\" in November 2000 to prevent the euthanizing of MWDs and facilitate their adoption by law enforcement agencies and former handlers. The NDAA for FY2012 expanded eligibility to adopt MWDs to include handlers, family members, and limited liability claims arising from the transfer of these dogs. Military working dogs were classified as \"equipment\" and adopters paid for transporting the dogs stateside. The NDAA for FY2012 expanded eligibility to adopt MWDs to include handlers, family members, and limited liability claims. The NDAA for FY2013 allowed retiring MWDs to be transferred for adoption. Current law does not require DOD to transfer retired MWDs overseas back to the United States. Section 342 of the enacted bill requires DOD to transfer retiring MWDs located overseas to the United States and give adoption priority to former handlers. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) requires DOD to transfer retiring military working dogs located overseas to the United States and prioritize adoption for former handlers. This change from \"may\" to \"shall\" mandates that all MWDs be retired only after being returned to the U.S., facilitating domestic adoption. However, opponents argue that the lack of appropriated funds for this transfer will be costly. The President's FY2015 and FY2016 budget proposals included cuts to the Defense Commissary System, with reductions in subsidies leading to potential cuts in operating days and hours. However, the FY2015 NDAA added $100 million to the commissary budget to reverse the proposed cuts and required a study of possible cost reductions. The President's FY2016 budget request proposed cutting $300 million in subsidies for commissaries, reducing the budget from $1.3 billion to $400 million in three years. This could lead to reduced operating days and hours for commissary patrons and potentially increase costs for goods and services. Authorized patrons include active duty military members, retirees, disabled veterans, and DOD civilians stationed overseas. The enacted bill requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a plan for budget-neutrality for the Defense Commissary System and military exchange system by March 1, 2016. The enacted bill requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a report by March 1, 2016, outlining a plan to achieve budget-neutrality for the Defense Commissary System and military exchange system. The plan must include meeting benchmarks for customer service satisfaction, product quality, and discount savings for eligible patrons by October 1, 2018. It should also address potential modifications to the systems, pricing constructs, and the impact on Morale, Welfare, and Recreation programs. The report should consider previous legislation and studies. The Defense Secretary is required to submit a report by March 1, 2016, outlining a plan for budget-neutrality for the Defense Commissary System and military exchange system. The plan must address customer service satisfaction, product quality, and discount savings for eligible patrons by October 1, 2018, considering potential modifications to pricing and their impact on Morale, Welfare, and Recreation programs. This report should also consider Section 634 of the Carl Levin and Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 and Section 652 of P.L. 114-92. The bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) requires the Comptroller General to submit a report on the Commissary Surcharge, Non-appropriated Fund, and Privately-Financed Major Construction Program to the Committees on Armed Services within 180 days. TRICARE is a health care program for uniformed servicemembers, retirees, and their dependents. The Administration proposed to replace TRICARE Prime, Standard, and Extra with a consolidated plan in the FY2016 budget request. In its FY2016 budget request, the Administration proposed changes to TRICARE, including replacing multiple health plan options with a consolidated plan, increasing pharmaceutical copays, and establishing a new enrollment fee for future TRICARE-for-Life enrollees. However, these proposals were not adopted by Congress, despite recommendations for changes from the Military Compensation and Retirement Compensation Modernization Commission. Congress may still consider major changes to the TRICARE benefit in the future. The President did not endorse recommendations for TRICARE changes from the Military Compensation and Retirement Compensation Modernization Commission. Congress may consider major changes in the future, but a deliberate approach is advised to understand implications and unintended consequences. Provisions in the Act aim to improve access to care, health outcomes, beneficiary experience, and control costs, laying the foundation for future TRICARE reform legislation. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) aims to improve access to care, health outcomes, beneficiary experience, and control costs, laying the foundation for comprehensive TRICARE modernization and reform legislation in the near future. Comprehensive reform of the military health care system is essential to improve access, quality, and the experience of care for all beneficiaries, maintain medical readiness, and ensure long-term viability and cost-effectiveness. Modernizing the system will require reevaluating all elements and potentially increasing fees and co-pays. The current military healthcare system needs to be modernized and improved to meet future needs. Reevaluating all elements and potentially increasing fees and co-pays will be necessary for comprehensive reform. TRICARE beneficiaries have access to various pharmacy options with different copayment policies. Military pharmacies provide free 90-day supplies of formulary medications for prescriptions written by civilian and military personnel. TRICARE beneficiaries have access to various pharmacy options with different copayment policies. Military pharmacies offer free 90-day supplies of formulary medications for prescriptions written by civilian and military providers. The 2015 NDAA allowed a one-time $3 increase in pharmacy copays and required maintenance drug prescriptions to be filled through lower cost mail order or military pharmacies. The Administration's FY2016 budget proposed annual copayment increases from 2016 to 2025. Section 702 of the enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) provides for smaller pharmacy copayment increases than initially proposed. The FY2016 budget proposed annual increases in pharmacy copayments from 2016 to 2025. Section 702 of the enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) includes smaller copayment increases than initially proposed, with a one-time increase for retail and mail order prescriptions. This change is estimated to reduce direct spending by about $1.5 billion over 10 years. The military health system underwent a review resulting in an action plan, with some Members of Congress monitoring its implementation. The initial Senate bill proposed actions to increase visibility of health quality metrics, estimated to cost $95 million over 2016-2020. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) had less demanding and presumably less costly provisions. The 2014 annual report of the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Service highlighted concerns about access to contraception for Service members. TRICARE covers various forms of birth control when prescribed by an authorized provider, but does not cover condoms or nonprescription spermicidal products. TRICARE covers various forms of birth control, including intrauterine devices, prescription contraceptives, and surgical sterilization for both male and female members. The enacted bill requires the Secretary of Defense to establish clinical practice guidelines for contraception and ensure comprehensive counseling on contraception methods for all women in the Armed Forces."
