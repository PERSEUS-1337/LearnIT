    "content": "This report summarizes the USDA's efforts to establish a national animal traceability system for rapid disease outbreak response. Despite economic benefits, federal proposals face controversy within the U.S. cattle industry. The report discusses background on animal ID and traceability, reviews arguments for and against a national system, and outlines unresolved issues. Appendices provide a timeline of the U.S. National Animal Identification System and information on international organizations setting standards for animal health and trade. On February 5, 2010, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack announced the revision of the U.S. National Animal Identification System (NAIS) to a new approach called Animal Disease Traceability. This new framework allows states and tribal nations to choose their own level of animal identification and traceability for livestock populations. However, all animals moving in interstate commerce must have a form of ID for traceability back to their originating state. The USDA is implementing a new Animal Disease Traceability framework for livestock moving in interstate commerce. States and tribal nations can choose their own level of animal identification, but all animals must have traceable ID back to their originating state. A Traceability Regulation Working Group has been established to make recommendations for a proposed rule, with collaboration from state, tribal, and APHIS officials. The USDA's Animal Disease Traceability framework involves collaboration with state, tribal, and APHIS officials. Public meetings were held to gather feedback on the proposed rule, with publications outlining current recommendations. The framework emphasizes that states and tribal nations are responsible for managing traceability programs. The USDA's traceability framework involves collaboration with state, tribal, and APHIS officials. States and tribal nations are responsible for managing traceability programs, with federal rules applying only to livestock in interstate commerce. Livestock moving interstate must have official identification and an Interstate Certificate of Veterinary Inspection. Exemptions for identification and ICVI requirements will be defined. The federal rules for livestock traceability will apply only to animals moving in interstate commerce. Livestock must have official identification and an Interstate Certificate of Veterinary Inspection. Exemptions will be defined, and states and tribal nations will evaluate their traceability capacity according to performance standards. Federal funding will be provided through annual agreements with APHIS. The USDA will define performance standards for animal disease traceability, leaving the method up to states and tribal nations. Federal funding will be provided through annual cooperative agreements, with no designated funding in the FY2011 agriculture appropriations bill. The program will be implemented through federal regulations, with a proposed rule expected in April 2011. The USDA will implement animal disease traceability programs through federal regulations, defining it in Title 9 of the Code of Federal Regulations. A proposed rule could be published in April 2011, with a final rule expected 12 to 15 months later. Major outbreaks of harmful animal diseases have caused economic damages and disruptions in domestic and international markets. The United States has been fortunate in avoiding catastrophic outbreaks like those seen in Taiwan in 1997. The potential economic consequences of a catastrophic animal disease outbreak, such as Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD), in the United States could range from $30 billion to $100 billion for the cattle industry alone. This has led to the development and implementation of animal identification and traceability systems in many countries, with varying levels of voluntary or mandatory participation. The animal disease outbreaks in the 1990s and early 2000s led to the development of animal identification and traceability systems in many countries. Programs vary from voluntary in the United States to mandatory in the EU, Japan, and South Korea. Discussions are ongoing in Japan and South Korea about requiring traceability on imported meat products, which could impact market access. Any changes in domestic or international markets regarding animal health, food safety, and import standards could have significant economic implications for the U.S. livestock industries. The United States is a major producer and exporter of livestock and animal products, leading in beef and poultry production. It ranks third in pork production behind China and the EU. The US is the top exporter of pork, second in poultry, and third in beef. Animal identification is crucial for tracking animals from birth to market. Animal identification (ID) involves keeping records on individual farm animals or groups for tracking purposes. It includes information on the animal's origins, traceability, and a national database accessible via a high-speed computer network. Different countries have variations in their animal ID systems based on the information collected and the extent of traceability. Animal ID systems exist in various countries with differences in the information collected, including birthplace, owner details, movements, and slaughter information. More advanced systems include data on sex, breed, parentage, feeds, pharmaceuticals, and product movement. The purpose is for rapid response to health and safety concerns, verification of premium production processes, and in the US, the focus is on animal health traceability. In the United States, animal ID focuses on health traceability from birth to slaughter. Other countries like the EU, Japan, and South Korea have more comprehensive systems that track products to the retail consumer. International buyers are demanding more information on product history, leading to the need for traceability systems. In the United States, animal ID focuses on health traceability from birth to slaughter. International buyers of U.S. animal products are demanding better information on product history, leading to the need for traceability systems. Proponents argue that a national animal ID and traceability system enhances animal health surveillance and disease eradication. A national animal ID and traceability program can help in early detection and containment of dangerous animal disease outbreaks, reducing disease testing costs for producers. Regionalization or compartmentalization limits the economic impact of outbreaks by containing the disease to specific zones, minimizing the need to destroy or remove animals from the market. Rapid response to outbreaks also helps in re-establishing international market access. Compartmentalization limits disease spread, reduces economic damage, and aids in re-establishing international market access. Farmers track animals for premium markets like organic or grass-fed. Bar codes on food help manage inventory and verify production methods. Government programs support these efforts. Retailers use traceability to manage inventories, add value to products, and monitor consumer buying. Government-coordinated programs, such as USDA's Process Verified program, help livestock and meat producers assure customers of consistent quality products. Traceability programs include national organic certification, country-of-origin labeling, and domestic origin requirements for USDA-purchased commodities. Traceability is a valuable management tool for producers. A traceability program provides valuable management tools for producers by tracking animal products to consumers, offering post-mortem information on cattle, and enhancing transparency in the supply chain. It also addresses food safety and national security concerns by collaborating with federal and state food safety agencies to protect the food supply. A traceability program helps livestock producers reduce liability claims and maintain records on animal movements, health, and marketing activities. It also addresses food safety and national security concerns by collaborating with food safety agencies to protect the food supply from threats like tuberculosis and foodborne illnesses. Some believe a more rigorous traceback and animal ID system could facilitate food recalls and contain the spread of illnesses, while others disagree, citing concerns about cost and feasibility. Some argue for a more rigorous traceback and animal ID system to aid in food recalls and contain foodborne illnesses, while others, especially in the food industry, oppose it due to concerns about cost and feasibility. Traceability systems also enhance foreign marketing opportunities for animal products by reassuring buyers about the health of U.S. animals and meeting foreign veterinary and food safety requirements. This helps in capturing niche markets and certifying production processes for export programs. The USDA's AMS developed an export verification program for U.S. plants after BSE appeared in North America in 2003. This program establishes standards for U.S. suppliers to meet beef import specifications of countries like Japan. The lack of a national animal identification system hindered the U.S. from receiving \"negligible risk\" status for BSE from the World Organization for Animal Health. Establishing traceability is seen as crucial for enhancing U.S. exports of animals and animal products. The lack of a standardized national animal identification system hindered the US from receiving \"negligible risk\" status for BSE from the World Organization for Animal Health. This status would enhance the US's ability to compete internationally and support domestic price structures. An animal ID system could also enhance animal welfare during natural disasters by locating and rescuing at-risk animal populations. Critics argue that an animal ID system invades privacy and could lead to the disclosure of proprietary information. Critics of a national animal ID program argue that it invades privacy, increases costs and technical complexity, and rewards vertical integration. Critics argue that a national animal ID program disadvantages family farms in the cattle industry by imposing high costs and technical requirements, favoring vertically integrated operations, and reducing market power in price structures. Critics argue that a national animal ID program disadvantages family farms in the cattle industry by imposing high costs and technical requirements, favoring vertically integrated operations, reducing market power in price structures, and facing objections on religious grounds. Additionally, some producers are concerned that increased transparency at the farm level may lead to higher tax liabilities. Greater transparency at the farm level through thorough counting and reporting of livestock numbers may lead to increased income and property tax liabilities for producers who previously provided incomplete information. A national animal ID and traceability program, managed by USDA's APHIS, has evolved from state and national disease eradication programs. For example, brucellosis ID tags were used successfully in eradicating the disease from U.S. commercial herds. While some livestock classes have long had ID requirements under APHIS programs, the use of animal ID has decreased as certain diseases have been controlled. Uniquely numbered brucellosis ID tags were attached to animals for vaccination or testing, leading to successful eradication of the disease from U.S. commercial herds. Official identification requirements exist for livestock entering interstate commerce, such as for pseudorabies in swine and scrapie in sheep. Various state laws and breed association rules also mandate animal identification for participation in shows or races. However, U.S. animal ID programs lack national scope and consistency, with limitations highlighted after the discovery of mad cow disease in 2003. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) program was proposed in 2002 to address U.S. animal ID limitations highlighted after the discovery of mad cow disease in 2003. It aimed to improve animal identification, record keeping, and data management through a state-federal-industry partnership. While some states mandated certain components of animal identification, NAIS at the federal level remained a voluntary program. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) was a voluntary program proposed in 2002 by USDA's APHIS to improve animal identification in response to the discovery of mad cow disease. However, due to criticism from the U.S. cattle sector, NAIS was replaced in 2010 with a more flexible, state-based program that mandates traceability only for livestock moving in interstate commerce. NAIS aimed to cover all major commercial livestock and poultry species in the U.S., including beef and dairy cattle, hogs, sheep, goats, chickens, turkeys, and horses. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) aimed to cover all major commercial livestock and poultry species in the U.S., excluding household pets. It was a voluntary program focused on identifying animals entering commerce or commingling with others at different premises. USDA's role was to popularize the program, provide information, and address implementation issues by species/sectors. The USDA's involvement in the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) focused on popularizing the program, providing information to participants, and addressing implementation issues by species/sectors. Reports were published to guide participants on how to join the program and its future direction. The USDA published reports providing guidance on the NAIS program, including participant guidance, technical standards, and implementation strategies. Three key reports detailed the status of NAIS, how to participate, and future program direction. The Business Plan outlined strategies to enhance animal disease traceability, the NAIS User Guide offered guidance for participation, and the Program Standards document established data standards for NAIS. The USDA published reports providing guidance on the NAIS program, including participant guidance, technical standards, and implementation strategies. The Program Standards and Technical Reference document established data standards for NAIS to ensure system effectiveness and protect U.S. agriculture from potential harm. NAIS was not intended as a food safety program but could have positive public safety effects. The USDA established the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) to protect U.S. agriculture from disease outbreaks. The goals of NAIS were to increase disease response capabilities, limit disease spread, minimize economic impact, and maintain market access. The long-term goal was to identify and trace animals within 48 hours of a disease problem. Rapid access to reliable data on animal ID and movement history was crucial for containing outbreaks. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) was established by the USDA to quickly trace animals in case of disease outbreaks. It required reliable data on animal ID and movement history to identify infected animals, their current location, and potential exposure to the disease. NAIS consisted of three components: premises registration, animal identification, and animal tracking. The first phase involved registering the location where livestock or poultry were raised, housed, or boarded. States and tribes had to collect specific information to meet USDA's data standards for premises registration. The first phase of NAIS involved registering the geographic location where livestock or poultry were raised, housed, or boarded. States and tribes had to collect specific information to meet USDA's data standards for premises registration, including a premises identification number (PIN), contact information, operation type, and dates of activation and retirement. Premises were registered at state or tribal animal health authorities, and the PIN was a unique seven-digit number permanently assigned to a location. The USDA implemented the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) to register premises where livestock or poultry were raised, housed, or boarded. Premises registration was free and aimed to quickly notify producers of disease outbreaks. By 2009, only 37% of premises were registered out of an estimated 1.4 million U.S. animal and poultry operations. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) aimed to register premises to aid disease eradication efforts. By September 6, 2009, only 37% of premises were registered out of an estimated 1.4 million U.S. animal and poultry operations. The second phase of NAIS involved assigning unique numbers to individual animals or groups. An animal identification number (AIN) is a 15-digit number with the first three numbers as the country code (840 for the U.S.). Tags and devices complying with the 15-digit AIN system are known as 840 devices. The 15-digit Animal Identification Number (AIN) includes the country code 840 for the U.S. Tags and devices complying with this system are known as 840 devices, which can be traditional visual ear-tags, RFID tags, or injectable transponders. These devices allow for faster access to ID information as they can be read electronically and fed into computer databases. The use of RFID devices and injectable transponders for official animal identification is becoming more common. These devices allow for faster access to ID information and eliminate the need to approach or restrain animals, reducing stress and improving data quality. Some animals are exempt from identification under NAIS, but USDA encourages all animal owners to register their premises due to the risk of disease spread. USDA encourages animal owners to register their premises for disease control. Animals should have an ID before moving to another location. Producers can choose when to attach ID devices, either at birth or later. Tagging services are available at auction markets for animals ready to be marketed. Producers bringing animals into their operation must maintain official identification. When animals are ready for market, they should be tagged before being commingled with others. Tagging services are available in some areas. Producers bringing animals into their operation must maintain the official identification already on the animal. Group/lot identification numbers can be used for animals moving through the production chain as a group. The GIN is a 15-character number self-generated by the producer. The GIN is a 15-character number self-generated by the producer to link each producer's livestock or poultry flock to the animal's birthplace or premises of origin. The ID remains with the animal for its lifetime. The NAIS involves access to timely, accurate animal movement records to quickly locate at-risk animals in the event of a disease outbreak. NAIS required access to accurate animal movement records for disease outbreak response. Producers selected NAIS-compliant databases to report animal movements with minimum standardized information. This included national premises ID, animal ID, date of event, and event type. Additional animal-specific data was standardized but not required for participation. Traceback information was recorded for notable movements between locations. The voluntary animal tracing component of NAIS was a public/private partnership where industry and states would maintain Animal Tracking Databases (ATDs) containing animal location and movement records. The federal government would operate the Animal Trace Processing System (ATPS) for officials to request information during disease investigations. The USDA's plan for the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) involved industry and states maintaining Animal Tracking Databases (ATDs) for confidentiality. The federal government operated the Animal Trace Processing System (ATPS) for officials to request information during disease investigations. ATDs were designed to provide timely reports during disease outbreaks, with optimal data retrieval within 48 hours. The system was used in specific situations such as foreign animal disease tests, animal disease emergencies, and traceback for program diseases. As of September 2008, 40% of potential premises in the United States had been registered in the National Animal Identification System (NAIS), with varying participation levels across species. By September 2009, 36.9% of estimated livestock and poultry farms had been registered. Adequate participation is necessary for an effective response to animal disease outbreaks. As of September 2009, 36.9% of estimated livestock and poultry farms in the United States were registered in the National Animal Identification System (NAIS). Adequate participation is crucial for an effective response to animal disease outbreaks, with a suggested participation rate of 70% to achieve necessary traceability levels. Some critics have called for faster progress and a clearer path towards universal animal identification. Dr. Clifford suggested a higher participation rate of 90% for effective traceability in the National Animal Identification System (NAIS). Critics have pointed out problems hindering implementation, such as lack of prioritization among animal species, integration with existing requirements, and data requirements. USDA's slow progress is attributed to unresolved issues and low participation rates, raising concerns about achieving the 48-hour traceback window. USDA's slow progress in implementing the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) has been attributed to unresolved issues and low participation rates. Concerns have been raised about achieving the 48-hour traceback window, leading to calls for mandatory participation from USDA officials, state animal health officials, the American Veterinary Medical Association, consumer advocacy groups, and livestock industry groups. The National Assembly of State Animal Health Officials and the U.S. Animal Health Association approved a recommendation for mandatory animal ID for U.S. breeding cattle as a step towards a national system. Various groups, including consumer advocacy groups and industry organizations like NPPC, NMPF, and AMI, supported this. Some lawmakers also expressed interest in implementing NAIS as a mandatory program to prevent losses from diseases. On the other hand, groups like R-CALF, NCBA, and Farm-to-Consumer Legal Defense Fund opposed mandatory NAIS. Opponents of a mandatory NAIS program, including cattle industry groups like R-CALF and NCBA, fear high costs and industry concentration. Some lawmakers question USDA's ability to keep information confidential. In response to concerns, USDA announced NAIS would remain voluntary. The U.S. Secretary of Agriculture has the authority to determine if NAIS is voluntary or mandatory. In 2006, Secretary Johanns announced NAIS would be voluntary. Proponents argue Secretary Vilsack should make it mandatory. The costs of an animal ID system vary, with questions on who should pay - industry, government, or both. USDA suggests sharing expenses. The costs of a national animal ID system vary, with questions on who should pay - industry, government, or both. USDA suggests sharing expenses. Larger, more vertically integrated operations are more likely to survive, while smaller, independent ones may struggle. On April 29, 2009, APHIS released a study on the economic benefits and costs of adopting USDA's NAIS. The costs of implementing a national animal ID system were analyzed in a study by APHIS on April 29, 2009. The study, conducted by economists from Kansas State University, Colorado State University, Michigan State University, and Montana State University, estimated annual costs to be around $228 million for the livestock industry. The study included assumptions on individual and group ID tagging for cattle, swine, and poultry. The costs of implementing a national animal ID system were analyzed in a study by APHIS on April 29, 2009. The KSU Benefit-Cost Study (2009) estimated annual costs to be approximately $228 million for full pre-harvest traceability with 100% participation in the livestock industry. Cattle sector bears over 90% of the costs due to individual animal ID requirements, with estimated tag and tagging costs ranging from $3.30 to $5.22 per animal for cattle producers. Identification tags and tagging cattle make up 75% of the annual adoption costs in the cattle sector, ranging from $3.30 to $5.22 per animal. Other livestock sectors have lower costs per animal: $0.059 per swine, $1.39 per sheep, $0.0007 per broiler, $0.002 per turkey, and $0.0195 per layer. The study shows that the economic benefits of the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) with full participation outweigh the costs, including savings in disease control programs, market access, and consumer demand. The study found that the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) could bring economic benefits such as savings in disease control programs, market access, and increased consumer demand. However, concerns exist regarding liability for contamination and public scrutiny of producers' records. The cost-effectiveness of NAIS depends on the level of participation, with full participation being more economically viable. The federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) allows public access to records held by federal agencies, raising concerns among producers about potential misuse of information by animal rights extremists. Some producers worry about revealing proprietary information, but FOIA exempts certain business information like trade secrets. In the 110th Congress, a provision in the farm bill addressing protection of trade secrets was deleted. Congress removed a provision in the 2008 farm bill that would have required USDA regulations to protect trade secrets and confidential business information in an animal ID system. South Korea plans to impose traceability requirements on imported beef by December 2010, while the EU mandates traceability for all suppliers. Japan currently does not require traceability for imported beef but has other specifications in place. The Democratic Party of Japan aims to pass laws for traceability on imported beef, following their election victory in August 2009. Japan's Democratic Party (DPJ) plans to pass laws for traceability on imported beef following their election victory in August 2009. The DPJ aims to align imported beef with domestic traceability requirements. The issue may not be a top priority initially, but global trends suggest that beef traceability could become a standard for international trade. Brett Stuart emphasizes the importance of beef traceability for global market access. The WTO's rules on non-tariff trade barriers, like traceability requirements, aim to restrict market access. Traceability measures for imports must be scientifically justified and equivalent to domestic standards. Despite a significant investment in the NAIS program by the USDA, participation remained low among livestock producers. Substantial criticism of the national program came from the U.S. cattle sector. Despite a large investment in the NAIS program by the USDA, participation remained low among livestock producers. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack held listening sessions to gather feedback on NAIS implementation. This feedback led to the abandonment of NAIS in favor of a more flexible, state-based system in 2010. Secretary Vilsack announced the abandonment of NAIS in 2010 due to feedback from listening sessions and written comments. Congress expressed frustration with the slow pace of NAIS implementation despite $142 million appropriated from FY2004 to FY2009. Funding for NAIS was eliminated from the FY2010 appropriations. The Administration proposed increasing funding for the NAIS to $14.6 million in FY2010, but the House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee voted to eliminate funding for USDA's NAIS from the appropriations bill. Subcommittee members expressed frustration with the slow pace of national sign-up for NAIS and stated that continued investments in the current NAIS are unwarranted until USDA provides details on implementing an effective ID system. The Senate version of H.R. 2997 proposed $14.6 million for the NAIS, but funding was reduced to $5.3 million for FY2010. The bill was signed into law as P.L. 111-80 by President Obama on October 21, 2009. USDA claimed authority under the Animal Health Protection Act for the ID system. The FY2010 funding level for NAIS was set at $5.3 million in the Agriculture appropriations bill signed into law as P.L. 111-80 by President Obama on October 21, 2009. Several bills in the 110th Congress aimed at clarifying USDA's authority for an animal ID program, including H.R. 1018, H.R. 2301, and S. 1292. H.R. 3485 proposed new traceability systems for USDA-regulated meat and poultry and FDA-regulated foods. In the 111th Congress, bills were introduced to establish comprehensive traceability systems for USDA-regulated meat and poultry, as well as FDA-regulated foods. These bills required the tracing of animals and products from slaughter through distribution to the consumer, with provisions for record-keeping and access. Similar traceability provisions were included in food safety legislation approved by the House and expected to be included in a Senate bill, but these would apply to FDA-regulated foods, not meat and poultry products regulated by FSIS. The 111th Congress introduced bills for traceability systems for USDA-regulated meat and poultry, as well as FDA-regulated foods. Traceability provisions were included in food safety legislation approved by the House, but would not apply to meat and poultry regulated by FSIS. Hearings were held on the National Animal Identification System, dating back to the 1800s in the United States. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) was reviewed by Congress, with a history dating back to the 1800s when hot iron brands were used for animal identification. In the 1940s, a successful program for cattle identification was initiated by USDA, but phased out as brucellosis neared eradication. Plans for a national animal identification system began in the 1950s-1980s, driven by the need to quickly contain disease outbreaks. The development of NAIS was influenced by the Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) outbreak in the late 1980s. In the 1980s, the USDA started planning a national animal identification system after recognizing the importance of early detection in disease outbreaks. The outbreak of Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in the UK in 1986 led to the slaughter of 3.7 million cattle. Subsequent outbreaks of foot and mouth disease in Taiwan and Classical Swine Fever in the Netherlands resulted in significant economic losses and mass culling of animals. In 2001, an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the UK led to the slaughter of over 10 million sheep and cattle. In 2001, an outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease in the UK led to the slaughter of over 10 million sheep and cattle. In the Netherlands, a major outbreak of Classical Swine Fever resulted in the destruction of 12 million hogs and economic losses totaling $2.3 billion. In the US, APHIS officials worked on drafting an early version of an animal ID plan in 2002, which led to the development of the U.S. Animal Identification Plan (USAIP) in 2003. In December 2003, a draft of the U.S. Animal Identification Plan (USAIP) was published, calling for recording the movement of individual animals in a central database. APHIS was tasked with designing an ID numbering system and coordinating data collection. The plan aimed for all states to have an animal premises ID system by July 2004 and for major species to be identified by July 2006. Following the detection of mad cow disease in the US, USDA accelerated the implementation of a national animal ID system, with Secretary Ann Veneman transferring funds for this purpose in April 2004. In April 2004, Secretary Ann Veneman transferred $18.8 million to APHIS for implementing the National Animal Identification System (NAIS). The program's framework was announced in April 2004, with revisions made periodically. By August 2006, the NAIS program was designed to transition from voluntary to potentially mandatory participation if needed for effectiveness. The NAIS program, initially voluntary, set a timeline for full implementation by 2009. In response to concerns, it was announced to remain entirely voluntary at the federal level. A draft user guide in November 2006 outlined a three-step approach for premises registration, animal ID, and traceability, assuring producers of the program's voluntary nature and commitment to privacy protection. The user guide outlines a three-step approach for implementing a national animal ID program, emphasizing voluntary participation and privacy protection. The Business Plan aims to clarify implementation strategies and set benchmarks for achieving 48-hour traceback of animals in case of disease outbreak. Livestock species are prioritized into Tier 1 and Tier 2 categories based on commercial importance. The USDA is working towards a 48-hour traceback of animals in case of disease outbreak, prioritizing species into Tier 1 and Tier 2 categories. They aim to bring 70% of the cattle breeding herd into the National Animal Identification System by the end of 2009. Public listening sessions were held to gather feedback on the future direction of animal identification and traceability in the United States. In April 2009, public listening sessions were held to gather feedback on the National Animal Identification System (NAIS). In February 2010, USDA announced a new approach for animal disease traceability, allowing states to choose their own level of animal identification. By March 2010, USDA began public meetings on the Animal Disease Traceability framework for state and tribal officials to provide feedback. The USDA proposed a revision requiring all animals in interstate commerce to have traceable ID back to their originating state. Public meetings were held from March to August 2010 to discuss the Animal Disease Traceability framework. The US participates in international organizations like CODEX, OIE, and WTO for animal health and trade standards. The United States participates in international organizations such as the CODEX alimentarius, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), and the World Trade Organization (WTO) for animal health, food safety, and trade in livestock and animal products. These organizations provide guidelines and standards, with the WTO specifically addressing non-tariff trade barriers. The World Trade Organization (WTO) and CODEX provide guidelines and standards for traceability measures in imports. WTO restricts traceability requirements to be scientifically justified and equivalent to domestic standards. CODEX aims to protect consumer health and promote fair trade practices in the food industry. The Joint FAO/WHO Food Standards Program focuses on protecting consumer health and ensuring fair trade practices in the food industry. The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) is responsible for improving animal health globally and setting standards for animal identification and traceability to enhance disease prevention, food safety, and export certification. The OIE established guidelines on animal identification and traceability to improve disease prevention, food safety, and export certification. The Director General called for global implementation of these systems from farm to fork to allow for compartmentalization and regionalization during disease outbreaks. The OIE's guidelines call for global implementation of traceability systems from \"farm to fork\" to allow for compartmentalization and regionalization during disease outbreaks. Export certification, handled by USDA's FSIS in the United States, ensures compliance with importing countries' standards. The OIE contributes to harmonizing international certification standards. The OIE contributes to harmonization of international certification standards through various programs and promotes transparency and reliance on scientific information for evaluation. Many countries have adopted national animal identification systems with traceability capabilities. Canada's national individual identification system is managed by the Canadian Cattle Identification Agency. Canada's national animal identification system is managed by the Canadian Cattle Identification Agency (CCIA), a nonprofit organization led by industry representatives. Initially voluntary, the program became mandatory in 2002, with cattle required to be tagged with Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) since 2006. The CCIA works closely with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and Agriculture Canada to ensure funding for development initiatives. The Canadian Cattle Identification Agency (CCIA) established a voluntary program in 2001, which became mandatory in 2002. By 2006, all cattle leaving their farm of origin had to be tagged with a CCIA-approved RFID tag. Benefits of RFID tags include tag retention, data integrity, and animal movement tracking. The compliance rate for Canadian cattle ID was nearly 100% in 2009. Personal information associated with the tags is securely maintained in a national database for authorized personnel access in case of animal health issues. The Canadian Livestock Traceability System (CLTS) securely maintains personal information associated with ear tag numbers for various industry and species groups. Mandatory sheep and hog identification programs were established in 2004 and 2008. Australia's National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) tracks livestock from birth to slaughter, with mandatory cattle identification since 2005 and tracing systems for sheep and goats since 2009. Australia's animal identification system began in the 1960s to eradicate bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis. Australia implemented its animal identification system in the early 1960s to eradicate bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis. A mandatory property identification system for cattle was established in 1967, using Property Identification Codes (PICs) to trace cattle back to their last property of residence. In the mid-1990s, the system was upgraded to electronic individual cattle identification using Radio Frequency Identification Devices (RFIDs) to ensure biosecurity, food safety, and market access. Individual identification became compulsory for producers supplying the European Union in 1998. In 1999, the NLIS was introduced in Australia, expanding to mandatory animal identification for all cattle leaving their property of birth. All stock movements must be read at points of transfer including saleyards and slaughterhouses. Each individual animal is assigned a unique ID number at slaughter, linked to live animals, carcasses, hides, and byproducts. At slaughter in Australia, each animal is assigned a unique ID number linked to live animals, carcasses, hides, and byproducts. The animals are generally grouped into lots by harvest date and time, with individual animal information not readily available unless specific agreements are made. The NLIS is a partnership between the Australian Government and industry, with the Federal government providing funding and policy coordination, while state governments have legal jurisdiction over livestock movement and health. State governments work with industry to develop and implement legislation for the animal identification program. The state governments collaborate with industry to manage the national animal identification program, including developing legislation and coordinating education programs. Meat and Livestock Australia administers the database for NLIS, ensuring data protection under Australian FOI laws. The European Union also emphasizes animal identification for food safety. The European Union has mandatory programs for animal identification as part of food safety measures, with a focus on localization and tracing for veterinary purposes. Various animal ID systems in the EU incorporate traceability goals in response to disease events like classical swine fever and foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks. In 1997, the EU implemented a mandatory system for permanent identification of individual bovine animals for reliable traceability. In response to the 1997 BSE crisis, the EU implemented a mandatory system for permanent identification of individual bovine animals for reliable traceability. This system includes double ear tags, cattle passports, and a national database for tracking animals from birth to harvest. Additionally, regulations require labeling of meat products with a reference number linking them to the animal of origin and identifying the member state where the meat was processed. The EU has a bovine ID and traceability system in place, requiring meat products to be labeled with a reference number linking them to the animal of origin. Mandatory food traceability has been in effect since January 1, 2005. Equidae, porcine, ovine, and caprine animals also have mandatory identification systems. Japan has a similar system for domestic bovine animals since December 1, 2004. The EU's ID system for ovine and caprine animals was fully implemented in July 2005. Japan has a mandatory bovine ID and traceability system since December 1, 2004, tracking animals from birth to consumer purchase. Imported beef currently lacks the same traceability requirements as domestic beef, but pressure for change is growing due to past food safety crises. Japan implemented animal traceability regulations and food safety oversight in response to these crises, starting with the Law Relating to Special BSE Countermeasures in July 2002. Japan implemented bovine animal traceability and identification laws in response to the Law Relating to Special BSE Countermeasures. The laws required traceability of domestically produced beef from farms to slaughterhouses by December 1, 2003, and extended traceability to processors, distributors, and retailers by December 1, 2004. Japanese retailers and restaurants now display animal identification numbers for consumer reference. Additionally, a Japan Agricultural Standard (JAS) program was introduced to certify the traceability of imported beef, requiring exporters to provide detailed information. Japan implemented bovine animal traceability laws in response to the Law Relating to Special BSE Countermeasures. The laws required traceability of domestically produced beef from farms to slaughterhouses by December 1, 2003, and extended traceability to processors, distributors, and retailers by December 1, 2004. Japanese retailers and restaurants now display animal identification numbers for consumer reference. South Korea has a mandatory Beef Traceability System (BTS) for domestically produced beef, tracking each animal from birth to consumer, providing detailed information to consumers. South Korea has a mandatory Beef Traceability System (BTS) for domestically produced beef, providing detailed information to consumers including sex, breed, quality grade, location of birth, feed administered, medications given, and date of slaughter. In contrast, New Zealand does not have a fully functioning national animal ID system but has partial systems for traceability at herd levels. The Animal Identification and Traceability Governance Group (AITGG) in New Zealand oversees the development of the NAIT system for individual animal traceability. Currently, the focus is on cattle and deer populations, with plans to expand to other species once the system is fully operational. Existing systems like MINDA and NBTIP provide partial bovine ID under the Bio-security Act of 1993. New Zealand has two existing animal ID systems: MINDA for dairy herd management and NBTIP for bovine tuberculosis identification. MINDA has high participation but is not ideal for traceability, while NBTIP is mandatory for cattle and deer movement. Other traceability databases are available for voluntary use. Brazil has SISBOV for cattle identification. A new mandatory animal ID system for cattle and possibly deer is proposed for June 2011. A new mandatory animal identification system for cattle and possibly deer is proposed to be in place by June 2011 in Brazil. The system, initially intended for individual animal identification, remains voluntary and focuses on premises supplying slaughterhouses for foreign markets with strict traceability requirements, such as the EU. Brazil's animal identification system for slaughterhouses supplying products to foreign markets, particularly the EU, has faced scrutiny for lacking individual animal identification and traceability. The EU imposed restrictions on Brazilian beef imports due to these shortcomings, with concerns about information robustness and the potential spread of foot-and-mouth disease. Argentina also implemented a limited mandatory animal identification system in 2003. The EU/FVO report from August 4, 2009, highlighted concerns about Brazil's animal identification system and the potential risk of foot-and-mouth disease entering the EU from Brazil. Argentina also implemented a limited mandatory animal identification system in 2003, focusing on cattle destined for export markets. Starting in 2007, official ID tagging became required for all calves born after September 2007 in Argentina, with plans to tag the entire beef herd by 2017. Argentina's history of disease outbreaks, particularly foot and mouth disease, has impacted its beef exports to the United States. Argentina implemented a mandatory animal identification system in 2003 for cattle destined for export markets. Official ID tagging for all calves born after September 2007 is required, with plans to tag the entire beef herd by 2017. Disease outbreaks, particularly foot and mouth disease, have impacted Argentina's beef exports to the United States. Uruguay, heavily reliant on foreign markets, began a comprehensive national animal identification program in late 2006 to meet demands of foreign buyers. Uruguay implemented a mandatory animal identification system called the National Livestock Information System (SNIG) in 2006. All individual animals must be tagged before six months of age or before transport. Two tags are required for all cattle, one visible and one electronic. The government aims to have all herds registered and cattle tagged by 2010, with traceability extended to all cuts of beef back to specific animals at their farm of origin. The Uruguayan government plans to have all herds registered and cattle tagged by 2010, with traceability extended to all cuts of beef back to specific animals at their farm of origin. SNIG database includes premises and animal identification, movements, and termination data. The government currently pays for ID tags, but plans to shift the cost to producers in the future. Some countries like Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, and Russia do not have ongoing animal ID programs. Not all countries with large animal populations have ongoing animal ID programs like Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, and Russia. Reasons for the absence of these programs include large agrarian populations, lack of technological advancement, and limited national distribution chains for animal products. In poorer countries, consumers may not be willing to pay extra for identified and traceable food."
