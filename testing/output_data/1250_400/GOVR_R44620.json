    "content": "A biologic or biological product is a therapeutic drug or vaccine made from living organisms, such as human, animal, yeast, or microorganisms. Biologics are composed of proteins, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, or cells used in transplantation. Biosimilars are similar but not identical to brand-name biologics. In contrast, chemical drugs are synthesized and have a simpler molecular structure. The FDA regulates both biologics and chemical drugs. The Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) within FDA regulates traditional biologics, gene therapy products, and human tissue used in transplantation. The FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) regulates prescription brand-name and generic drugs, over-the-counter drugs, and most therapeutic biologics. Inflectra, a biosimilar to Remicade, was approved by the FDA in April 2016. The FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) regulates prescription brand-name and generic drugs, over-the-counter drugs, and most therapeutic biologics. Examples of therapeutic biologics regulated by CDER include monoclonal antibodies, cytokines, and growth factors. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that bind to specific substances in the body and may carry drugs or toxins. Cytokines control the immune system and are used to fight cancer and infections. Growth factors regulate cell division and survival. Biologics and biosimilars, such as cytokines, growth factors, enzymes, and immunomodulators, are used to fight various diseases like cancer and infections. These substances require special handling and are usually administered via injection or infusion. They are often referred to as specialty drugs due to their unique characteristics. Biologics and biosimilars, known as specialty drugs, require special handling and are often administered via injection or infusion. These drugs can be expensive, with some biologics costing over $250,000 per patient annually. Spending on biologics in the United States reached $105.5 billion in 2016, with $3.2 billion spent on biologics subject to biosimilar competition. Spending on biologics in the United States totaled $105.5 billion in 2016, with a 13% increase over 2015. Biologics subject to biosimilar competition accounted for $3.2 billion, with $2.9 billion spent on \"original\" biologics and $0.3 billion on biosimilars. Biologics spending has been increasing by 10% annually since 2011. In Europe, the introduction of biosimilars has reduced prices for biologics by up to 33%. In the United States, biologic drugs account for 63% of prescription drug spending in Part B. The introduction of biosimilars in Europe has reduced prices for biologics by up to 33%, with some drugs in Portugal seeing a price reduction of 61%. Congress passed the Hatch-Waxman Act in 1984 to lower the cost of generic chemical drugs, resulting in price decreases of 60% to 90% for branded oral-solid medications. The Hatch-Waxman Act has significantly reduced drug costs for consumers by allowing the U.S. generic drug industry to expand. Generic medications can decrease prices by 60% to 90% compared to branded oral-solid medications. Generic drugs must demonstrate to the FDA that they are identical to the original product before approval for marketing. This \"sameness\" allows generic drugs to be interchangeable with their reference (brand-name) drug and other generic products. The generic drug sponsor must also meet manufacturing process standards and reporting requirements. The biotechnology industry developed its first biologics for human therapeutic use during the time Hatch-Waxman was debated and implemented. FDA approved human insulin (Humulin-R) in 1982, followed by human growth hormone (Protropin), alpha interferon (Intron-A), tissue plasminogen activator (Activase), and erythropoietin (Epogen) in subsequent years. Biological products are regulated by FDA through a biologics license application (BLA) under the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). The regulation of biological products was transferred to the FDA in 1972 from the NIH. Chemical prescription drugs are regulated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act allowed for the approval of generic drugs but not for follow-on biologics. Companies were limited in submitting follow-on biologics applications for FDA review. Certain biological products were historically regulated as drugs rather than biologics. Congress granted FDA authority over the marketing of insulin in 1941. In 1941, Congress granted the FDA authority over the marketing of insulin, a small protein regulating carbohydrate metabolism. Besides insulin, other natural source biological products like glucagon and human growth hormone were regulated as drugs under the FFDCA instead of biologics under the PHSA. This limited market competition for specialty biologic drug products even as patent protection approached expiration. The FDA lacked clear regulatory authority to approve biosimilars, hindering market competition for specialty biologic drug products. In contrast, Europe had fewer barriers, with the European Medicines Agency authorizing the marketing of the first biosimilar product in 2006. In Europe, the European Medicines Agency authorized the marketing of the first biosimilar product, Omnitrope, in 2006. The FDA approved Omnitrope in the United States in 2006 through the 505(b)(2) pathway after a court ruling in favor of the sponsor, Sandoz. The FDA approved Omnitrope in 2006 through the 505(b)(2) pathway after a court ruling in favor of the sponsor, Sandoz. Congress established a new regulatory authority for FDA in March 2010 with the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, allowing for biosimilar products to be approved. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) of 2009 authorized the FDA to approve biosimilar and interchangeable biological products. A biosimilar product must be highly similar to the reference product with no clinically meaningful differences in safety, purity, and potency. Interchangeability requires demonstrating the same clinical result as the reference product in any patient. The FDA authorized biosimilar and interchangeable biological products under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009. Interchangeability requires demonstrating the same clinical result as the reference product in any patient. FDA released guidance documents and held public meetings to gather feedback before finalizing guidance on biosimilars. The FDA released guidance documents and held public meetings to gather feedback before finalizing guidance on the new biosimilars pathway, including requirements for submitting an application demonstrating biosimilarity based on analytical, animal, and clinical studies. The agency may determine if certain studies are unnecessary in a biosimilar application, and any changes to the approved manufacturing process require demonstration to the FDA. The FDA may decide that certain studies are unnecessary in a biosimilar application. Changes to the approved manufacturing process require a demonstration of comparability to ensure product quality and safety. Brand-name biologics like Remicade underwent multiple manufacturing changes, each requiring a demonstration of comparability. FDA states that variability in biological products can be effectively managed. Sales of some biosimilars in the US have been delayed. The FDA states that variability in biological products can be effectively managed. Sales of some biosimilars in the US have been delayed due to patent infringement lawsuits and anticompetitive practices by brand-name manufacturers. Seven biosimilars were approved by the FDA between March 2015 and October 2017. The FDA approved seven biosimilars between March 2015 and October 2017, with concerns about anticompetitive practices by brand-name manufacturers affecting sales. One of the first biosimilar products approved was Zarxio, marketed by Sandoz Inc., which is biosimilar to Neupogen by Amgen Inc. In March 2015, FDA approved Zarxio, the first biosimilar in the US, marketed by Sandoz Inc. It is biosimilar to Neupogen by Amgen Inc. In April 2016, FDA approved Inflectra, a biosimilar to Remicade by Janssen Biotech, made by Celltrion, Inc. Pfizer began marketing Inflectra in the US in late November 2016 at a 15% lower price. In late November 2016, Pfizer began marketing Inflectra in the United States at a price 15% below Remicade. Pfizer filed a lawsuit against J&J in September 2017 for anticompetitive practices related to biosimilar-exclusion contracts. Another infliximab biosimilar, Renflexis, was approved by the FDA in April 2017. Insurers are incentivized to prefer the higher-priced brand-name biologic over biosimilars due to rebates offered by brand-name manufacturers. A \"rebate trap\" can be created by branded manufacturers by withdrawing rebates on the biologic if biosimilar manufacturers offer substantial price discounts. This can result in a doubling of costs for patients continuing the branded biologic. Even with a 60% price difference between the biosimilar and the brand after rebates and discounts, insurers may only be able to convert 50% of patient users to the biosimilar. The rebate trap created by branded biologic manufacturers can double costs for patients if rebates are withdrawn. Even with a 60% price difference between biosimilar and brand, insurers may only convert 50% of patient users to the biosimilar. To avoid increased costs, a near-complete switch of patient users from branded biologic to biosimilar is necessary, but many chronic disease patients are unlikely to switch. Pfizer's lawsuit indicates providers are hesitant to purchase biosimilars even for covered patients. According to Pfizer's lawsuit, providers are reluctant to purchase Inflectra, a biosimilar to infliximab, even for covered patients. Inflectra has only secured less than 4% of total infliximab unit sales in the US since its FDA approval in April 2016. J&J, the manufacturer of Remicade, has raised its list price and government reimbursement, potentially hindering competition from biosimilars. Pfizer warns that if J&J's anticompetitive practices continue, it could set a precedent for other biologic originator firms to maintain dominance over biosimilar competition. Pfizer is suing J&J for anticompetitive practices, alleging a price increase of over $190 per dose for Remicade. J&J denies the claims, stating they compete on value and price. FDA approved a third biosimilar, Erelzi, which is similar to Enbrel. Erelzi, a biosimilar to Enbrel, is manufactured by Sandoz and approved for all indications of the reference product. Clinical data confirms its similarity to Enbrel, a top-selling drug in the US. Marketing release is pending due to a lawsuit. Erelzi, a biosimilar to Enbrel, manufactured by Sandoz, is awaiting marketing release due to a lawsuit filed by Amgen. Amjevita, a biosimilar to Humira, was approved by the FDA in September 2016. Humira, a top-selling drug approved for 10 indications, faces patent infringement litigation with Amjevita. Renflexis, a biosimilar to Remicade, was approved by the FDA in April 2017 and launched in the US at a lower price. In August 2017, FDA approved Cyltezo, a biosimilar to Humira, manufactured by Boehringer Ingelheim. AbbVie filed a lawsuit against BI for patent infringement. In September 2017, FDA approved Mvasi, a biosimilar to Avastin, manufactured by Amgen. Humira (adalimumab) is a top-selling drug globally and in the US. AbbVie sued BI for patent infringement on Humira. FDA approved Mvasi, a biosimilar to Avastin, made by Amgen. Avastin is also a top-selling drug in the US. The Purple Book lists licensed biological products by FDA. The Purple Book lists biological products licensed by FDA, including biosimilars and interchangeable products, with proprietary and nonproprietary names. FDA released guidance on nonproprietary naming of biological products in 2017, using \"proper name\" instead of \"nonproprietary name\" for biosimilars. The FDA finalized guidance on naming conventions for biosimilars in 2017, using \"proper name\" instead of \"nonproprietary name\" due to PHSA nomenclature. The nonproprietary name for each originator biological product, related biological product, and biosimilar product will be a combination of a core name and a distinguishing suffix. FDA is considering the appropriate suffix format for interchangeable products. Core names for originator biological products will be adopted by the USAN Council. In Europe, reference drugs and biosimilars use the same International Nonproprietary Name (INN). In Europe and the US, biosimilars and reference products are named using nonproprietary names selected by the USAN Council and the WHO, respectively. The WHO introduced the Biological Qualifier (BQ) proposal in 2016 to uniquely identify biological substances. The biosimilar industry supports shared nonproprietary names, while innovator companies prefer distinct naming schemes. The BQ is a code formed of four random consonants in two 2-letter blocks separated by a 2-digit checksum. Biosimilar industry groups support shared nonproprietary names, while innovator companies prefer distinct naming schemes. The FTC expressed concern that FDA's naming proposal could lead to misconceptions about biosimilars, potentially hindering market development and competition. The FTC expressed concern that differences in nonproprietary names of biosimilars could lead to misconceptions about their similarity to reference biologics, potentially hindering market development and competition. The term \"identical\" in biosimilars is misleading and fosters misunderstanding. Biosimilars are not required to be identical to reference biologics, as variability is inherent in biologics. FDA-approved labeling provides information on a drug's safety and effectiveness for healthcare providers to determine suitability for patients. FDA-approved labeling for prescription drug products, including biological products, contains essential information for safe and effective use, tailored for healthcare practitioners. It includes warnings, indications, dosage, contraindications, adverse reactions, drug interactions, and more. The FDA-recommended elements of drug labeling include indications, dosage, contraindications, warnings, adverse reactions, drug interactions, and more. FDA's draft guidance on biosimilar labeling suggests including a \"Biosimilarity Statement\" in the highlights section. Comparative data demonstrating biosimilarity is not required in the labeling to prevent confusion, but it is available on the FDA website. Comments on the FDA guidance showed differing views, with the generic industry advocating for less information in labeling. The FDA recommends excluding comparative data demonstrating biosimilarity from biosimilar product labeling to prevent confusion, although this information is available on the FDA website. Comments on the FDA guidance showed differing views, with the generic industry advocating for less information in labeling, while the brand-name industry prefers more information to be included. The FDA recommends excluding comparative data demonstrating biosimilarity from biosimilar product labeling to prevent confusion. The labeling should provide access to all relevant information for the prescribing physician, with transparency to identify the conducted studies. The BPCIA provision affects specific biological products transitioning to biological licenses under the PHSA in March 2020. FDA released draft guidance in March 2016 regarding this provision. The FDA provided guidance on the BPCIA provision in March 2016, stating that biological product applications must be submitted under section 351 of the PHS Act, with exceptions until March 23, 2020. Applications under section 505 of the FD&C Act are allowed for certain products until 2020, but not if there is a reference product approved under section 351(a) of the PHS Act. Applications under section 505 will be deemed as licenses under section 351 on March 23, 2020. The FDA's interpretation of the BPCIA provision states that applications for biological products approved under the FD&C Act will no longer exist after March 23, 2020, and will be replaced by approved BLAs under the PHS Act. Any pending applications under the FD&C Act should be withdrawn and resubmitted under the PHS Act. Industry representatives have raised concerns about potential delays in the approval of biosimilar products. The FDA's proposed policy on exclusivity for biological products has raised concerns among industry groups, such as the Generic Pharmaceutical Association's Biosimilars Council and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. The policy could delay the approval and availability of biosimilar products that compete with brand name biologics. Any unexpired period of exclusivity associated with an approved NDA would cease to have effect, except for orphan drug exclusivity. Transitional biological products will not be eligible for the 12-year biologics exclusivity period. The FDA's policy on exclusivity for biological products has raised concerns among industry groups. Transitional biological products will not be eligible for the 12-year biologics exclusivity period. The FDA states that interchangeable products must produce the same clinical result as the reference product and may be substituted by a pharmacist. The FDA's policy on exclusivity for biological products has raised concerns among industry groups. Transitional biological products will not be eligible for the 12-year biologics exclusivity period. Interchangeable products must produce the same clinical result as the reference product and may be substituted by a pharmacist without the intervention of the prescribing health care provider. Assessing interchangeability for biosimilars is a separate process from generic drugs. FDA released draft guidance on interchangeability in January 2017, with the comment period extended to May 19, 2017. FDA has not yet approved an interchangeable product. The FDA released draft guidance on interchangeability in January 2017, with the comment period extended to May 19, 2017. FDA has not approved an interchangeable product yet. In Europe, the EMA does not determine interchangeability, and individual member states decide their own policies. In Denmark, all originators and biosimilars are considered interchangeable unless proven otherwise. Ireland allows a single switch but not multiple switches. In the United States, FDA regulates drug products while states regulate pharmacies. 37 states have considered legislation on biosimilar substitution, with 27 states and Puerto Rico enacting laws with varying provisions. FDA gained authority to collect user fees from manufacturers in 1992 through the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA). In 1992, Congress passed the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), allowing FDA to negotiate performance goals with industry and use fees solely for new product application reviews. User fees, comprising 43% of the FY2016 FDA budget, have reduced review times. The Biosimilar User Fee Act of 2012 (BsUFA I) authorized FDA to collect fees for biosimilar reviews until September 2017. The Biosimilar User Fee Act of 2012 (BsUFA I) authorized FDA to collect fees for biosimilar reviews from October 2012 to September 2017. Fees were based on PDUFA human drug application fee amounts and included fees for products in the Biosimilar Product Development (BPD) program. The BPD program assists industry sponsors in developing new biosimilar products, with 64 programs for 23 reference products as of February 2017. Companies can discontinue participation but would need to pay a reactivation fee. In 2017, there were 64 BPD programs developing biosimilar products to 23 reference products. Companies can discontinue participation but must pay a reactivation fee. The biosimilar biological product application fee could be waived for small businesses. FDA held meetings for the reauthorization of BsUFA II from 2015 to 2016, with a final recommendation submitted to Congress after a comment period. The agency conducted negotiation sessions with the industry for the reauthorization agreement. In September 2016, the draft BsUFA II agreement was posted on the FDA website for FY2018 through FY2022. A final BsUFA recommendation was submitted to Congress after a 30-day comment period. Congress reauthorized the biosimilar user fee program via the FDARA in 2017. FDA faced challenges in meeting BsUFA I goals for advisory meetings due to staff shortages. Hiring authorities in the 21st Century Cures Act are expected to strengthen staff capacity. The FDA anticipates using new hiring authorities from the 21st Century Cures Act to strengthen staff capacity and modernize hiring processes. These enhancements aim to meet performance goals, save time and resources for applicants, and encourage price competition to lower healthcare costs. Changes under BsUFA II include dropping the supplement and establishment fees, retaining BPD fees, and renaming the product fee to BsUFA Program fee with a limit of five fees per application per fiscal year. FDA and industry estimate a need for approximately $45 million in FY2018. The product fee is renamed the BsUFA Program fee with a limit of five fees per application per fiscal year. FDA and industry estimate a need for approximately $45 million in FY2018 to cover the BsUFA program costs. The federal government focuses more on basic or preclinical research, while the pharmaceutical industry concentrates on clinical trials. Assigning credit for therapeutic advancements can be challenging, with concerns over high pharmaceutical costs leading to closer scrutiny. Assigning credit for therapeutic advancements can be challenging, with concerns over high pharmaceutical costs leading to closer scrutiny. Studies have attempted to quantify the contribution of publicly funded research to the discovery of new drugs, with a focus on innovative new drugs known as new molecular entities (NMEs). A study by Stevens et al. in 2011 found that 9.3% of drugs approved by the FDA from 1990 to 2007 resulted from publicly funded research. Priority review was granted to 19% of these drugs, compared to 20% based on private-sector research. The authors found that 46.2% of new-drug applications from public-sector research institutions received priority reviews, compared to 20.0% from private-sector research. FDA priority review is for drugs that would be significant improvements in treating serious conditions. Public-sector research institutions tend to discover drugs with important clinical effects. The methodology excluded the role of public-sector research institutions in developing platform technologies. The Stevens study excluded the role of public-sector research institutions in developing platform technologies that led to the discovery of drugs and created intellectual property transferred to companies through commercial licenses. Key platform technologies excluded from the study include recombinant DNA technology, bacterial production methods, antibody production methods, glycosylated protein production methods, and gene silencing methods. These technologies enabled the development of FDA-approved products but were not used to develop specific drug candidates by PSRI scientists. The study excluded key platform technologies developed by public-sector research institutions, such as gene silencing with small interfering RNAs. These technologies enabled the development of FDA-approved products but were not used to develop specific drug candidates by PSRI scientists. The regulation of biological products falls under the Public Health Service Act, while chemical drugs are regulated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The regulation of biological products falls under the Public Health Service Act, while chemical drugs are regulated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Biologics Control Act of 1902 was the first national regulation for pharmaceutical products, focusing on premarket approval and manufacturing processes in response to contamination incidents. The Biologics Control Act of 1902 was passed in response to deaths from tetanus contamination of vaccines. It required inspection of facilities before issuing federal licenses for biological products. The act predates the Pure Food and Drugs Act and was later revised under the Public Health Service Act in 1944. The FFDCA, enacted in 1938, required drug manufacturers to submit a new drug application demonstrating product safety before marketing. The Public Health Service Act of 1944 revised the Biologics Control Act, specifying that licensed biological products are subject to regulation under the FFDCA. Biological products under the PHSA include viruses, vaccines, blood products, and allergenic products for disease prevention or treatment. The PHSA, amended by the FDA Modernization Act of 1997 and the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, regulates biological products that meet the definition of a drug under the FFDCA. It requires a single biological license application (BLA) and provides authority to suspend a license immediately in case of public health danger. The PHSA, amended by the BPCIA of 2009, allows for immediate license suspension in case of public health danger. The BPCIA created a pathway for biosimilar products and FDA-administered regulatory exclusivity periods. Regulatory responsibility for biologics was transferred to the FDA in 1972. Regulatory responsibility for biologics was initially with the Hygienic Laboratory, then transferred to the FDA's Bureau of Biologics in 1972. The FDA's Bureau of Drugs and Bureau of Biologics merged in 1982 to form the National Center for Drugs and Biologics. In 1988, the Center split into CDER and CBER. CBER moved to the FDA headquarters in 2014. Determining jurisdiction for biotechnology products has been challenging. An Intercenter Agreement was published in 1991 between CBER and CDER to address this issue. In 2002, the FDA announced a reorganization of review responsibilities, transferring most therapeutic biologics from CBER to CDER. This allowed CDER to focus on new pharmaceutical products while CBER concentrated on vaccines, blood safety, gene therapy, and tissue transplantation. Examples of products transferred to CDER include monoclonal antibodies and immunomodulators. On June 30, 2003, responsibility for most therapeutic biologics was transferred from CBER to CDER. Biological products transferred to CDER are regulated as licensed biologics under Section 351 of the PHSA. Examples of products transferred to CDER include monoclonal antibodies, immunomodulators, growth factors, and cytokines. Remaining at CBER are traditional biologics such as vaccines, allergenic products, and blood products."
