    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Environmental Improvement Timber Contract Extension Act\" and involves the modification of a long-term contract regarding the Tongass National Forest. The \"Environmental Improvement Timber Contract Extension Act\" involves definitions such as board feet, contract, contracting officer, mid-market criteria, proportionality, and purchaser. Congress finds the following regarding the Act. The Forest Service and the purchaser entered into a contract in 1951 to harvest timber from the Tongass National Forest in Alaska. The contract aims to provide timber for the purchaser's facilities on a long-term basis. The legislation is necessary to fulfill this intent and support the economy in southeast Alaska. A pulp mill in southeast Alaska is essential for creating year-round, high-paying jobs, utilizing low-grade wood, and maintaining a stable economy. The purchaser plans to improve the mill's environmental and operational aspects, with estimated capital expenditures of $200 million. A 15-year contract extension is needed for amortizing these improvements. The purchaser has already invested $25,000,000 in power generation equipment. A 15-year contract extension is necessary for amortizing environmental improvements and energy efficiency projects. Ketchikan's economy heavily relies on the contract, providing year-round employment. The purchaser aims to maintain a long-term commitment to Ketchikan and southeast Alaska, supporting local businesses and workforce. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of utilizing Alaskan contractors, vendors, and suppliers to support local businesses and workforce. It also emphasizes participation in land management planning, adherence to sustainable forest resource principles, and protection of air, water, and land. Commitment to exploring new processes is also highlighted. The national interest in the Tongass National Forest is served by proper stewardship of publicly owned assets, fair return for public timber, and a balance among multiple use interests to enhance forest health and economic growth in southeast Alaska and the United States. This includes protection of air, water, and land, commitment to exploring new processes, and maximizing the use of harvested timber. The Tongass National Forest aims to balance multiple use interests to improve forest health, sustainable harvest, and economic growth in southeast Alaska and the United States. Contract modifications include a 15-year extension, a sale offering plan, and volume requirements in 5-year increments. The contract requires the purchaser to harvest 962,500,000 board feet of timber in 5-year increments, with the Forest Service providing at least 192,500,000 board feet per year until the next increment. Roads must be constructed in advance to ensure orderly harvest. The contracting officer ensures orderly timber harvest by requiring road construction in advance and selecting timber based on mid-market criteria. Appraisals and rates are determined using national forest procedures, with rates set to prevent competitive disadvantage. The Forest Service measures proportionality in timber provision. The purchaser is not to be disadvantaged in rates for timber provided. Proportionality is measured by the Forest Service using specific criteria. The purchaser can convert or replace their pulp mill with another facility. The unilateral termination clause is removed from the contract. Any further modifications to the contract must adhere to the changes made in this subsection. The unilateral termination clause is eliminated from the contract, and subsequent modifications can only be made by mutual agreement between the Forest Service and the purchaser. The modifications made by subsection (c) will take effect 45 days after the enactment of this Act, and the contracting officer must make necessary changes to the contract text to implement the modifications. The contracting officer must ensure that the contract text conforms to modifications made by subsection (c) and implement the changes. Timber volume under the contract will continue as modified by subsection (c) to meet the annual requirement."
