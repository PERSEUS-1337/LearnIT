    "content": "H.R. 3962, Affordable Health Care for America Act, passed by the House of Representatives on November 7, 2009, is based on H.R. 3200. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would reduce federal deficits by $109 billion over 10 years and insure 96% of the non-elderly, legally present U.S. population by 2019. The total cost of the coverage provisions is projected to be $1.052 trillion. The Affordable Health Care for America Act, passed by the House of Representatives on November 7, 2009, aims to reduce the number of uninsured individuals and restructure the private health insurance market. The 10-year cost of coverage provisions is estimated at $1.052 trillion, with a net cost of $891 billion after accounting for various factors. The bill includes provisions for financial assistance and sets minimum standards for health benefits. The Affordable Health Care for America Act, passed by the House of Representatives on November 7, 2009, focuses on reducing the number of uninsured individuals and restructuring the private health insurance market. It includes provisions for individuals to maintain health insurance, employers to provide insurance or pay a payroll assessment, market reforms like modified community rating and guaranteed issue and renewal, and acceptable health insurance coverage standards. Acceptable coverage would include qualified health benefits plans offered through the Exchange or new employer plans. The bill aims to establish an Exchange under a new federal agency, offering private plans and a public option. Subsidies are available for individuals with incomes below 400% of the federal poverty level. Plans in the individual market can be grandfathered if no changes are made. Additionally, a Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan (CO-OP) program would be established. The bill establishes an Exchange offering private plans and a public option with subsidies for individuals below 400% of the federal poverty level. Plans in the individual market can be grandfathered with no changes. A Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan (CO-OP) program would be created to encourage not-for-profit health insurance cooperatives. H.R. 3962 would reform health insurance by affecting private health insurance provisions, including not excluding enrollees based on pre-existing conditions. The bill establishes an Exchange with private plans and a public option for individuals below 400% of the federal poverty level. H.R. 3962 aims to reform private health insurance markets by prohibiting insurers from excluding individuals or charging higher premiums based on pre-existing conditions. To prevent adverse selection, insurers may require individuals to purchase coverage. However, affordability remains a concern, and adequate premium subsidies may be necessary from the government or employers. The private health insurance provisions in H.R. 3962 include requirements for individuals to maintain health insurance, employer mandates, penalties for noncompliance, and market reforms to address affordability concerns. Adequate premium subsidies may be necessary to make the individual mandate practical and ensure the success of market reforms. Health insurance provisions in H.R. 3962 include individual and employer mandates, private health insurance market reforms, immediate reforms, Health Insurance Exchange with a public option, subsidies, CO-OP Program, revenue provisions, and other provisions like abortion and end-of-life care. Americans obtain health insurance through various methods, including employment-based coverage, private sector, or publicly funded programs like Medicare or Medicaid. There is no federal law mandating health insurance for individuals. In 2008, 60% of the U.S. population had employment-based health insurance, with employers choosing to offer coverage through insurance or self-funding. Approximately 46 million Americans were uninsured in 2008, with individuals and employers purchasing health insurance in the large group, small group, or nongroup market segments. Large employers, who make up more than 95% of the market, enjoy lower premiums due to economies of scale and a larger risk pool. Large employers can obtain lower premiums for health insurance packages compared to small employers and individuals seeking nongroup coverage due to economies of scale and a larger risk pool. Employers offer subsidies towards health insurance, attracting both healthier and sicker workers. States have experimented with creating single sites for comparing insurance plans and pooling risk, with some models proving more sustainable. Private-sector companies also facilitate comparing health insurance plans for individuals and small groups. Less than half of small employers offer health insurance. Private-sector companies like eHealthInsurance help individuals and small groups compare health insurance plans. Less than half of small employers offer health insurance due to cost concerns and limited ability to spread risk. Small firms face challenges in negotiating benefits and rates with insurers and lack economies of scale. Small employers face challenges in providing health insurance due to factors such as being medically underwritten, having limited market power, and lacking economies of scale. Purchasing insurance through a larger pool could lower premiums for high-cost employees. State and federal regulations impact the private health insurance market, affecting premiums based on age, health, and behaviors. Reforms affecting premiums ratings would likely increase premiums for some and lower premiums for others based on age, health, behaviors, and other factors. States primarily regulate the private health insurance market, with some federal regulations applying to employer-sponsored health insurance. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires coverage for small groups to be sold on a guaranteed issue basis. Most states impose premium rating rules on insurance carriers in the small group and individual markets. In the individual market, 15 states require issuers to offer insurance products on a guaranteed issue basis to non-HIPAA eligible individuals. Most states impose premium rating rules on insurance carriers in the small group and individual markets, ranging from pure community rating to rate bands. Only two states use pure community rating in nongroup markets, while adjusted community rating and rate bands are also common. Federal law prohibits issuers from pricing health insurance policies based on health factors, allowing it for other factors like age or gender. Rate bands limit premium variation based on health within a specified range set by the state. Group health plans must limit the exclusion period for preexisting conditions. States have additional rules for preexisting condition exclusions in both small group and individual markets. There are over 2,000 state benefit mandates for health insurance, with some federal mandates for group coverage. Congressional attention is focused on this issue. In 2008, 42 states limit the exclusion period for preexisting health conditions in the individual market. There is a debate in Congress about offering a publicly sponsored health insurance plan as part of market reform, with proponents arguing it could be cheaper and increase competition, while opponents fear it could drive private plans out of the market. Some opponents question whether a public health insurance plan would give the government an unfair advantage in setting prices and fear it could drive private plans out of the market. Studies have shown that non-profit health insurance organizations perform better in quality measures compared to for-profit organizations. Non-profit health insurance organizations, including Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs), have shown higher performance on quality measures compared to for-profit organizations. Studies have highlighted the success of health insurance co-operatives like Group Health Cooperative of Seattle and HealthPartners of Minnesota. Advocates suggest incentivizing the creation of new co-operatives to reinvest earnings into lower premiums, cost-sharing, and innovative healthcare programs. Opponents argue against the proposal, citing limited success of co-operatives in the country. Advocates argue that co-operatives reinvest earnings into lower premiums, cost-sharing, and innovative healthcare programs. Opponents doubt the success of co-operatives in the country. Some provisions of the bill would take effect before January 1, 2013, including prohibiting postretirement reductions in retiree health benefits and allowing individuals to keep COBRA coverage until the Exchange is operational. The provisions effective before January 1, 2013 include prohibiting postretirement reductions in retiree health benefits, allowing individuals to keep COBRA coverage until the Exchange is operational, establishing a temporary national high-risk pool program, requiring health insurance issuers to provide rebates for low medical loss ratios, allowing individuals up to age 26 to remain on their parents' plans, and mandating justification for any premium increases. The bill aims to stabilize the individual market by requiring health insurance issuers to justify premium increases. It allows individuals up to age 26 to stay on their parents' plans and reduces the look-back period for pre-existing conditions. The bill also prohibits domestic violence from being considered a pre-existing condition and eliminates lifetime limits on benefits. Additionally, it mandates coverage for congenital or developmental disorders in dependent children. The bill prohibits lifetime limits on benefits and mandates coverage for congenital or developmental disorders in dependent children. It also includes a mandate for most individuals to have health insurance, with penalties for noncompliance. Additionally, the Secretary would issue guidance on rescission limitations in the group and individual markets. The bill mandates most individuals to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty, with exemptions for certain groups. Subsidies are provided to help with premium and cost-sharing expenses. H.R. 3962 mandates individuals to have health insurance or pay a penalty, with exemptions for certain groups. Employers must offer coverage or contribute to the Exchange. Employers, including private-sector employers, churches, and federal, state, local, and tribal governments, would have to offer health insurance following specific rules. They could offer employment-based coverage or coverage through an Exchange plan. Current health plans would be grandfathered for five years before having to meet essential benefits package requirements. Employers must contribute at least 72.5% of the lowest-cost plan they offer, prorated for part-time employees. Employees would be automatically enrolled in the plan with the lowest premium unless they opt out. Employers must provide written notice of employee rights and obligations. Employers would automatically enroll employees in the plan with the lowest premium unless they opt out. Employers must provide written notice of employee rights and obligations. Employers with aggregate wages over $750,000 not offering coverage would face an 8% excise tax. Compliance with health coverage participation requirements would be monitored, and noncompliant employers could have their health insurance election terminated. Employers with aggregate wages over $750,000 not offering coverage would be subject to an 8% excise tax. Employees could opt out of employer-provided coverage and enroll in an Exchange plan, with the employer facing a payroll assessment of 8% of average wages for those who decline coverage. Employers with aggregate wages above $750,000 would be assessed 8% of average wages for employees who decline coverage. The payroll assessment for these individuals would go into the Exchange but not apply toward the individual's premium. Full-time employees offered qualifying coverage by their employer would generally not be eligible for premium or cost-sharing credits. Small businesses could receive a 50% credit towards the cost of qualified employee health coverage for up to two taxable years, phased out as average employee compensation and number of employees increased. Certain small businesses could receive a 50% credit towards the cost of qualified employee health coverage for up to two taxable years. The credit would be phased out as average employee compensation increased from $20,000 to $40,000 and as the number of employees increased from 10 to 25. Adjustments for inflation would be applied, and the credit would not apply to highly compensated employees. The credit would be part of the general business credit and only available to businesses with a tax liability. Non-profit organizations would be ineligible for the credit. Additionally, new federal health insurance standards would be established for qualified health benefits plans (QHBPs) under H.R. 3962. H.R. 3962 establishes new federal health insurance standards for qualified health benefits plans (QHBPs), including prohibiting coverage exclusions based on pre-existing conditions and requiring guaranteed issue and renewal. Non-profit organizations are ineligible for the small business credit. The health insurance standards under H.R. 3962 include prohibiting coverage exclusions based on pre-existing conditions, requiring guaranteed issue and renewal, and determining premiums using adjusted community rating rules. Under H.R. 3962, health plans must use adjusted community rating rules for determining premiums, allowing variation based on age, premium rating area, and family enrollment. New non-discrimination and adequacy standards for provider networks are imposed, along with mental health parity rules. The coverage must offer the option to keep dependent children under 27 on the family policy, and enrollees must be notified of any changes in coverage or cost-sharing at least 90 days in advance. H.R. 3962 requires health plans to follow adjusted community rating rules for premiums, provide mental health parity, and offer the option to keep dependent children under 27 on the family policy. It also mandates notification of any changes in coverage or cost-sharing 90 days in advance. QHBPs must cover specific benefits, limit out-of-pocket spending, comply with network adequacy standards, and be equivalent to the average employer health plan. New individual policies after 2013 can only be offered as Exchange plans, while existing group plans must meet QHBP standards by 2018. Existing nongroup insurance policies are grandfathered if there are no changes to coverage terms or conditions. H.R. 3962 mandates health plans to adhere to adjusted community rating rules for premiums, provide mental health parity, and allow dependent children under 27 to stay on the family policy. New individual policies issued after 2013 must be Exchange plans, while existing group plans need to meet QHBP standards by 2018. Existing nongroup insurance policies can be grandfathered if there are no changes to coverage terms or conditions. States can form Health Care Choice Compacts for cross-state insurance sales, with coverage subject to the laws of one primary state. The Secretary would provide grants to states for regulating health insurance coverage sold in multiple states under a compact. QHBPs must cover the essential benefits package and could offer additional benefits. The package includes specified items and services, limits on out-of-pocket spending, network adequacy standards, and must be equivalent to the average employer health plan in 2013. It covers hospitalization, outpatient services, physician services, and supplies incident to physician services. The essential benefits package required to be covered includes hospitalization, outpatient services, physician services, prescription drugs, mental health services, preventive services, maternity care, and more. The annual out-of-pocket limit in 2013 would be $5,000 for an individual and $10,000 for a family. The essential benefits package includes services, equipment, and supplies for those under age 21, durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and related supplies. The annual out-of-pocket limit in 2013 would be no more than $5,000 for an individual and $10,000 for a family. Cost-sharing levels would be established using copayments, covering an average of 70% of covered health care claims. Plans offered through the Exchange could have less cost-sharing or richer benefit packages as Enhanced, Premium, and/or Premium-Plus plans. Employer plans would have the flexibility to offer plans with employee cost-sharing less than the levels specified for the essential benefits package. The Health Benefits Advisory Committee (HBAC) would recommend essential benefits package coverage for plans offered through the Health Insurance Exchange, including cost-sharing levels. The Committee would consider innovation in healthcare, reduce health disparities, and allow for public input. The Secretary would adopt the benefit standards within 45 days of receiving recommendations. H.R. 3962 proposes federalizing private health insurance standards and creating a Health Insurance Exchange to facilitate the purchase of Qualified Health Benefit Plans (QHBPs) by individuals and small businesses. The Exchange would not be an insurer but provide access to insurers' plans. The Secretary must adopt benefit standards within 18 months, incorporating HBAC recommendations or proposing initial standards if necessary. H.R. 3962 proposes creating a Health Insurance Exchange to facilitate the purchase of Qualified Health Benefit Plans by individuals and small businesses. The Exchange, not an insurer, would provide access to insurers' plans and be overseen by a new federal agency, the Health Choices Administration. Startup and operating costs would be covered by a Health Insurance Exchange Trust Fund funded by taxes on certain individuals. The Health Insurance Exchange under H.R. 3962 would be established by a new federal agency, the Health Choices Administration, funded by a Health Insurance Exchange Trust Fund. Costs would be covered by taxes on individuals and penalties for non-compliant employers. Only one Exchange could operate in a state, with the Commissioner approving state-based Exchanges meeting specific criteria. State-based Exchanges would receive federal matching grants. The Commissioner would approve state-based Exchanges meeting criteria, funded through federal grants. New nongroup coverage after 2013 would be through the Exchange, with options like public health insurance and income-based credits available. CBO estimated 30 million people would have Exchange coverage by 2019. Individuals would be eligible for Exchange coverage unless they have other insurance, such as a group plan through a full-time employer, Medicare, or Medicaid. Once enrolled in an Exchange plan, individuals can continue until they are no longer enrolled. An annual open-enrollment period would be offered, with special enrollment periods available. The Exchange offers coverage to individuals not covered by other insurance. Once enrolled, individuals can continue until they are no longer enrolled. An annual open-enrollment period is offered, with special enrollment periods available for certain circumstances. Employers can meet the mandate by enrolling employees through the Exchange. Employer eligibility criteria varies by year. In 2013, employers with 25 or fewer employees would be Exchange-eligible. In 2014, employers with 50 or fewer employees would be Exchange-eligible. In 2015, employers with 100 or fewer employees would be Exchange-eligible. The Commissioner could permit larger employers to participate in the Exchange starting in 2015. Exchange plans must meet federal requirements and have standardized cost-sharing options. The insurer must offer one Basic plan with minimum essential benefits. They can also offer an Enhanced plan with lower cost-sharing and a Premium plan with even lower cost-sharing. Premium-Plus plans can also be offered with additional benefits like oral health and vision care. Plans must follow specified cost-sharing levels but can vary by up to 10%. The Secretary would establish a public health insurance option through the Exchange under H.R. 3962, with eligibility for income-based premium and cost-sharing credits. The public option must meet requirements for benefits, provider networks, consumer protections, and cost-sharing. The public option under H.R. 3962 would offer Basic, Enhanced, and Premium plans, with the possibility of Premium-Plus plans. Geographically adjusted premiums would be set to cover costs, with limited start-up funding to be repaid within 10 years. The Secretary would negotiate payment rates for healthcare providers, ensuring rates are not lower than Medicare and not higher than average rates paid by other qualified health plans. Insolvency would result in the public option being prohibited from receiving federal funds. Under H.R. 3962, the Secretary would negotiate payment rates for healthcare providers under the public option, ensuring rates are not lower than Medicare and not higher than average rates paid by other qualified health plans. Physicians could participate as preferred or non-preferred providers, with preferred physicians prohibited from balance-billing. Non-physician providers would also be prohibited from balance-billing, and the Secretary could use innovative payment methods. The Secretary would have the authority to use innovative payment methods under the public option, including bundling of services and performance-based payments. Non-physician providers would be prohibited from balance-billing, and the Secretary could enter into no-risk contracts for the administration of the public option. Administrative functions would include determination of payment amounts, beneficiary education, provider consultative services, and communication with providers. The Secretary would be required to enter into a memorandum of understanding with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for the collection of costs associated with nonservice-connected care provided in VA facilities to public health insurance enrollees. Enrollment in the public option would be voluntary, allowing individuals, including Members of Congress, to choose health insurance through any Exchange plan. The bill also mandates the establishment of a Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan (CO-OP) program for not-for-profit health insurance cooperatives. The bill mandates the establishment of a Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan (CO-OP) program for not-for-profit health insurance cooperatives in the Exchange, with an appropriation of $5 billion for fiscal years 2010 through 2014. Loans and grants would be provided for start-up costs and solvency requirements, with specific conditions to be met for eligibility. The CO-OP program mandates the establishment of not-for-profit health insurance cooperatives in the Exchange with specific eligibility conditions. The cooperatives must have ethical standards, offer QHBPs through exchanges, be licensed in each state, governed by member majority vote, operate with a consumer focus, and use profits to benefit members. The CO-OP program mandates the establishment of not-for-profit health insurance cooperatives in the Exchange with specific eligibility conditions. These cooperatives operate with a strong consumer focus, using profits to lower premiums or improve benefits. Grants and loans are given priority to cooperatives that operate statewide or have financial support from nongovernmental sources. Violations of program terms would result in repayment of funds. Premium credits may be available based on income, but cost-sharing could still be a barrier to obtaining health care. Individuals eligible for premium credits under H.R. 3962 may also receive cost-sharing credits towards their required purchase of health insurance. These subsidies would be available for Basic plans in 2013 and 2014, and for Enhanced or Premium plans starting in 2015. Exchange-eligible individuals must be lawfully present in the United States and not enrolled in an Exchange plan through an employer to receive these credits. Under H.R. 3962, Exchange-eligible individuals could receive a credit in the Exchange if they are lawfully present in a state in the United States, have modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) of less than 400% of the federal poverty level (FPL), and meet certain eligibility criteria. The premium credit is based on an \"affordable premium amount\" for individuals to pay, calculated as a percentage of their income relative to the poverty level. The premium credit under H.R. 3962 is based on an affordable premium amount for individuals to pay, calculated as a percentage of their income relative to the poverty level. The Commissioner would adjust percentages to maintain the government versus enrollees' premium payment ratio in 2013. The affordability premium credit is determined by comparing the enrollee's premium to the affordable premium amount or the reference premium to the affordable premium amount. Premium percentage limits would be established for individuals within different income tiers. The \"affordability premium credit\" in H.R. 3962 is calculated based on income levels relative to the poverty level. Premium percentage limits are set for different income tiers, with adjustments made to maintain the government versus enrollees' premium payment ratio. Eligible individuals can also receive assistance with cost-sharing for health services, with reductions in cost-sharing amounts specified by the Commissioner. The House bill includes provisions on cost-sharing under a Basic plan, with the Commissioner adjusting percentages to match actuarial values. Out-of-pocket maximums are shown in Table 3, doubled for family coverage, and increased annually based on premium growth. Insurers receive additional payments to cover reduced cost-sharing for credit-eligible individuals. Revenues are raised through employer deduction limits and modifications to tax-advantaged accounts for health care spending. The bill includes provisions to raise revenues for expanded health insurance coverage, such as limiting employer deductions for certain health insurance plans and modifying tax-advantaged accounts for health care spending. Employers providing prescription drug coverage to retirees can receive subsidy payments from the federal government, which are excludable from gross income. H.R. 3962 would make changes to these provisions. H.R. 3962 would require employers to coordinate the subsidy and the deduction for retiree prescription drug coverage. The amount allowable as a deduction for retiree prescription drug coverage would be reduced by the amount of the federal subsidy received, raising $2.2 billion over a 10-year period. Tax-advantaged accounts and deductions for health care spending will be affected by the revenue provisions in H.R. 3962. Under current law, tax-advantaged accounts like FSAs, HSAs, HRAs, and MSAs allow workers to exclude qualified medical expenses from income taxes. FSAs reimburse employees for health care expenses and are funded through salary reduction. H.R. 3962 would limit annual FSA contributions to $2,500 per person starting in 2013, raising $13.3 billion over 10 years. HSAs also allow pre-tax funding for medical expenses. H.R. 3962 would limit annual FSA contributions to $2,500 per person starting in 2013, raising $13.3 billion over 10 years. HSAs allow pre-tax funding for medical expenses and have penalties for non-qualified distributions. H.R. 3962 increases penalty tax on non-qualified distributions to 20% and modifies qualified medical expenses for tax-advantaged accounts. It also addresses state laws on abortion coverage and federal conscience protection laws. H.R. 3962 prohibits discrimination against healthcare entities that do not provide or cover abortions. It also restricts the adoption of abortion-related standards in the essential benefits package. The bill does not prohibit Qualified Health Benefit Plans from covering elective abortions. H.R. 3962 prohibits discrimination against healthcare entities that do not provide or cover abortions. The Stupak Amendment adds additional restrictions on the use of funds for abortions, except in cases of rape, incest, or danger to the woman's life. The Stupak Amendment prohibits the use of funds for abortions in health plans, except in cases of physical danger, rape, or incest. It allows for separate supplemental coverage for elective abortions, paid for with non-H.R. 3962 funds. Premiums for this coverage cannot be paid with affordability credits or nonfederal funds receiving affordability credits. Nonfederal entities can offer separate coverage for elective abortions, but it must be funded independently. The Stupak Amendment allows for separate supplemental coverage for elective abortions, funded independently from H.R. 3962. Nonfederal QHBP offering entities can offer plans covering abortions, but must also offer identical plans without abortion coverage. Exchange plans cannot discriminate against healthcare providers unwilling to provide or cover abortions. States can receive incentive payments for enacting alternative medical liability laws compliant with the bill. Exchange plans prohibited from discriminating against healthcare providers unwilling to provide abortions. States can receive incentive payments for enacting compliant alternative medical liability laws. Compliance determined by effectiveness in improving medical liability system, encouraging error disclosure, and maintaining access to affordable insurance. Laws must include early offer system, certificate of merit program, and cannot limit attorneys' fees or impose damage caps. The state law requires an \"early offer\" system and a \"certificate of merit\" program for medical malpractice suits. The early offer system allows defendants to offer periodic payments for economic losses within 180 days of a claim being filed. If the offer is declined and litigation proceeds, the standards of misconduct and proof are raised. The certificate of merit program mandates testimony from a medical expert to establish the claim's merit at the filing of a suit. The bill authorizes incentive payments for states to improve healthcare, but does not provide funds for the payments. It clarifies that state laws governing legal standards in medical malpractice cases will not be modified. QHBPs must provide information on end-of-life planning and offer options for advance directives and life-sustaining treatment, following state laws. QHBPs must provide information on end-of-life planning, including advance directives and physician's orders for life-sustaining treatment, while prohibited from promoting suicide or hastening death."
