Section 319 of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include a temporary program for West Nile Virus and related arboviral diseases. The Secretary may make grants to States for prevention and control, with preference given to states with substantial incidence or prevalence of the diseases. The amended Section 319 of the Public Health Service Act allows for grants to States for prevention and control of West Nile Virus and related arboviral diseases. Funds can be used for developing mosquito control plans and programs on vector-borne diseases to support prevention efforts and training for workforce development. The amended Section 319 of the Public Health Service Act allows for grants to States for prevention and control of West Nile Virus and related arboviral diseases. States must provide matching funds for programs on medical entomology, arbovirology, and vector-borne diseases to support prevention efforts and training for workforce development. Non-Federal contributions must cover at least 50% of costs for grants under the amended Section 319 of the Public Health Service Act. Contributions can be in cash or in kind, excluding federal assistance. Grants should supplement, not replace, state and local funds for relevant activities. The Secretary has the authority to waive contribution requirements in certain cases. The grant funds must supplement, not replace, state and local funds for mosquito control plans. The Secretary can waive requirements for states facing economic challenges. States must involve localities in planning and ensure 85% of funds are used locally for public health improvement. The grant funds must supplement state and local funds for mosquito control plans. States must ensure 85% of funds are used locally for public health improvement related to West Nile Virus and arboviral diseases. Amounts can be used for technical assistance to support CDC in implementing and evaluating mosquito control programs. The Secretary, in consultation with health and mosquito control organizations, will develop guidelines for sustainable mosquito control programs to enhance public health infrastructure. The guidelines will focus on building, implementing, and evaluating locally managed integrated mosquito control programs. The guidelines for sustainable mosquito control programs aim to enhance public health infrastructure by identifying new cases, tracking disease spread, providing laboratory support, increasing surveillance participation, conducting educational campaigns, and outlining mosquito control procedures. Evaluation of these programs is also emphasized. The West Nile Virus and Arboviral Disease Act mandates educational outreach campaigns to reduce arbovirus exposure, outlines mosquito control procedures, and requires an evaluation of the program within 18 months of enactment. The subsection includes the evaluation results, sustainable mosquito abatement program development, progress on guidelines implementation, and overall program costs and benefits. Authorization of appropriations is provided for fiscal years 2003 and 2004, with additional funding for emergency control programs related to the West Nile Virus.

The Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new section for an Arbovirus Research Program. The President is mandated to enhance research on controlling insect populations that transmit diseases like West Nile Virus, develop screening tools, pathogen inactivation technologies, and methodologies for containing virus spread. Activities may involve examining existing and new control methods and can be carried out by various entities including the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. The President is required to promote research on controlling insect populations that transmit diseases like West Nile Virus. This includes developing new methodologies and coordinating activities with various government entities and experts in public health, entomology, arbovirology, and veterinary health. Funding is authorized for fiscal years 2003 through 2007."
