They introduce a deep autoencoder network that excels in reconstruction quality and generalization. The learned representations surpass current methods in 3D recognition tasks and enable shape editing through simple algebraic manipulations. Additionally, the study includes various generative models like GANs and Gaussian mixture models, with GMMs trained in the autoencoder's latent space producing the best fidelity and diversity in samples. The curr_chunk discusses the limitations of current 3D object representations in generative modeling, highlighting the challenges in creating realistic and semantically meaningful objects. It emphasizes the complexity and expertise required in designing new objects using existing high-dimensional representations. Recent advances in deep learning, such as autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks, have revolutionized the design of generative models by eliminating the need for complex parametric models. These deep learning architectures are successful at learning complex data representations and generating realistic samples from underlying distributions. Point clouds, a relatively unexplored 3D modality, are now being explored in the 3D machine learning literature. In this paper, the focus is on point clouds, a 3D modality that provides a compact representation of surface geometry. Point clouds are commonly generated by range-scanning devices like the Kinect and iPhone's face identification feature. Deep architectures for 3D point clouds are relatively scarce in the literature, with PointNet being successful in classification and segmentation tasks. This paper presents the first results using deep architectures to learn representations and generative models for point clouds. Generative models for point clouds have gained increased attention in recent research. The focus of this paper is on deep architectures for point clouds, with a new AE architecture designed for learning representations and generative models. Generative models for point clouds have gained attention, but training them is challenging and evaluating them is complex. The paper addresses these issues and introduces methods to improve training and evaluation in the target domain. The paper introduces a new AE architecture for learning representations and generative models for point clouds. It addresses challenges in training and evaluating generative models, providing methods to improve both aspects in the target domain. The proposed workflow involves training an AE with a compact bottleneck layer to learn a representation, followed by training a plain GAN in that fixed latent representation for easier training. The paper proposes a workflow involving training an AE with a compact bottleneck layer to learn a representation, followed by training a plain GAN in that fixed latent representation for easier training. Latent GANs are easier to train and achieve superior reconstruction compared to raw GANs. Multi-class GANs perform almost as well as dedicated GANs when trained in the latent space. Various metrics are evaluated for learning good representations and evaluating generated samples, with the Chamfer distance metric found to have limitations. The paper introduces evaluation metrics for learning good representations and assessing generated samples, highlighting limitations of the Chamfer distance metric. It also proposes fidelity and coverage metrics for generative models. The rest of the paper outlines the background, introduces models for latent representations and point cloud generation, and evaluates the models quantitatively and qualitatively. The code for all models is publicly available. In Section 4, the models are evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively, with results and further evaluation in the appendix. Autoencoders aim to reproduce input data through a bottleneck layer, while Generative Adversarial Networks involve a generator and discriminator in an adversarial game to synthesize realistic samples. The paper introduces evaluation metrics for representations and generated samples, proposing fidelity and coverage metrics for generative models. The curr_chunk discusses the adversarial game between a generator and discriminator in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), focusing on the challenges specific to point cloud geometry. It mentions the use of improved Wasserstein GAN for stability during training and the difficulties in encoding raw point clouds due to the lack of grid-like structures. The operator in image-processing pipelines requires geometry to be defined on a grid-like structure, which is lacking in raw point clouds, making them harder to encode. Point clouds are unordered, complicating comparisons between sets, leading to the need for permutation-invariant features. Two metrics for comparing unordered point sets are the Earth Mover's distance and another proposed in the literature. The Earth Mover's distance (EMD) and Chamfer distance (CD) are metrics for comparing unordered point sets. EMD transforms one set to another through a transportation problem, while CD measures the squared distance between points and their nearest neighbors. These metrics are used to evaluate representations and generative models by comparing reconstructed or synthesized point clouds to their ground truth counterparts. When evaluating representation or generative models, metrics like Coverage, MMD, EMD, and CD are used to compare reconstructed or synthesized point clouds to their ground truth counterparts. Coverage measures how well point clouds match, while MMD captures fidelity by calculating the average distance between matched point clouds. In this section, the architectures of representation and generative models for point clouds are described, starting with an autoencoder design. A GAN architecture tailored to point-cloud data is introduced, followed by a more efficient pipeline that learns an AE. Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) is used to measure the similarity in point cloud locations between two sets. The architecture of the representation and generative models for point clouds is described, starting with an autoencoder design. The encoder uses 1-D convolutional layers with increasing features, followed by a symmetric function to create a joint representation. The input is a point cloud with 2048 points, and the decoder consists of three fully connected layers. The architecture for point cloud representation and generation involves a permutation-invariant function using 1-D conv layers. The output is a k-dimensional vector for the latent space. Two AE models, AE-EMD and AE-CD, are explored with different structural losses. The optimal latent space size was found to be k = 128 for generalization and minimal reconstruction errors. The study explored AE models with bottleneck sizes ranging from 4 to 512, finding k = 128 to have the best generalization error. The raw point cloud GAN operates directly on the input, while the latent-space GAN passes data through a pre-trained autoencoder. The l-GAN in this study operates on a 128-dimensional bottleneck variable of a pre-trained autoencoder, producing realistic results with shallow designs for the generator and discriminator. Additionally, Gaussian Mixture Models are trained on the latent spaces learned by the autoencoders. Gaussian Mixture Models are trained on the latent spaces learned by autoencoders to generate point-cloud shapes. Shapes are reconstructed using class-specific autoencoders trained on ShapeNet data with a 85%-5%-10% split for training/testing/validation sets. The quality of unsupervised representation learning algorithms is evaluated by applying them as feature extractors on supervised datasets. For evaluation, specific per-class models are trained on ShapeNet data with an 85%-5%-10% split. The latent features computed by an autoencoder are used as input for a linear classification SVM on ModelNet BID32, showing comparative results with previous state-of-the-art methods. The 512-dimensional bottleneck layer vector extracted from the input 3D shape is processed by a linear classification SVM trained on ModelNet BID32. Comparative results with the previous state of the art BID31 are shown in Table 1, highlighting the more intuitive and parsimonious nature of the 512-dimensional feature. The experiment also demonstrates the domain-robustness of the learned features, with CD producing better results when variation within the collection increases due to its more local and less smooth nature. The experiment demonstrates the domain-robustness of the learned features, with CD producing better results due to its local and less smooth nature. The qualitative evaluation shows the ability of the learned representation to generalize to unseen shapes, enabling shape editing applications like interpolations and part editing. The AEs can reconstruct unseen shapes, as shown in the results and quantitative measurements. The experiment showcases the domain-robustness of learned features with CD producing superior results. AEs demonstrate the ability to reconstruct unseen shapes, enabling shape editing applications like interpolations and part editing. Five generative models are trained on point-cloud data of the chair category, including AE-CD, AE-EMD, l-GANs, GMMs, and r-GAN. In the experiment, various generative models are trained on point-cloud data of the chair category, including AE-CD, AE-EMD, l-GANs, GMMs, and r-GAN. The models are trained for a maximum of 2000 epochs, with model selection based on how well the synthetic results match the ground-truth distribution using JSD or MMD-CD metrics. The distance between the synthetic dataset and the validation set is measured to select the final model, with selection criteria shown in TAB10. In the experiment, various generative models are trained on chair point-cloud data, with model selection based on JSD or MMD-CD metrics. The optimal number of Gaussian components for GMM is determined, and models are compared based on their ability to generate. In the experiment, 5 generators are evaluated on the train-split of a chair dataset based on minimal JSD selection. The models are compared for their ability to generate synthetic samples resembling the ground truth distribution. The average classification score for the ground-truth point clouds is 84.7%. The experiment also includes testing on the test-split and comparing against the PointNet classifier for chair recognition. The PointNet classifier BID17 is used to evaluate the probability of samples being recognized as a chair. A Gaussian mixture model in the latent space of the EMD-based AE yields the best results in terms of fidelity and coverage. The achieved fidelity and coverage are close to the reconstruction baseline. The achieved fidelity and coverage of the AE-EMD model are comparable to the reconstruction baseline. The generalization ability of the models is demonstrated by their performance on training vs. testing splits. Synthetic datasets are generated for experiments, with different sizes for training, testing, and validation sets to reduce sampling bias when measuring MMD or Coverage statistics. The synthetic datasets generated for model selection comparisons are three times bigger than the ground truth dataset to reduce sampling bias when measuring MMD or Coverage statistics. The MMD-CD distance to the test set for r-GANs appears small, but qualitative inspection shows otherwise due to the inadequacy of the chamfer distance in distinguishing pathological cases. Examples are showcased in Fig. 3 with triplets of images comparing r-GANs and l-GANs generating synthetic point clouds. The study compares r-GANs and l-GANs in generating synthetic point clouds. The chamfer distance metric fails to capture the lower quality of r-GAN results, as r-GANs tend to concentrate points in areas most likely to be occupied in the shape class. This results in smaller distances between synthetic and ground truth point clouds for r-GANs, leading to a misleading coverage metric. The study analyzed the performance of r-GANs in generating synthetic point clouds. The Chamfer distance metric is not sensitive to the lower quality of r-GAN results, leading to misleading coverage metrics. Training trends show that r-GAN struggles to provide good coverage of the test set, indicating the difficulty of end-to-end GANs. The study compared the performance of different GAN models in generating synthetic point clouds. r-GAN struggled to provide good coverage of the test set, indicating the difficulty of training end-to-end GANs. l-GAN (AE-EMD) showed improved coverage and fidelity compared to l-GAN (AE-CD), with a dramatic improvement in results. Both l-GAN models experienced mode collapse halfway through training. Switching to a latent WGAN largely eliminates the issue of mode collapse experienced by l-GANs, resulting in improved coverage and fidelity. The study also compares GANs on point-cloud data to voxel-based methods, showing promising results in terms of JSD on the training set of the chair category.

The r-GAN outperforms BID31 in diversity and realism, while l-GANs perform even better with less training epochs. Training time for l-GAN is significantly smaller than r-GAN due to its smaller architecture. The l-GAN outperforms the r-GAN in generating synthetic point clouds with higher quality and less noise. The training time for l-GAN is significantly shorter due to its smaller architecture. Results from both models trained on the AE-EMD latent space show high quality outputs, highlighting the strength of the learned representation. The l-GAN produces crisper results, demonstrating the advantage of using a good structural loss. The l-GAN produces crisper results compared to the r-GAN, showing the advantage of using a good structural loss. Synthetic point clouds were generated using l-GAN and a 32-component GMM trained on an AE with EMD loss. Experiments were conducted with a multi-class AE trained on a mixed set of point clouds from 5 categories. Six AEs were compared against class-specific AEs, with l-WGANs trained for fidelity evaluation using MMD-CD. The study involved training AEs with a 85-5-10 split for 500 epochs and then training six l-WGANs for 2K epochs. Results showed that l-WGANs based on multi-class AE performed similarly to class-specific ones. Limitations included failure cases in decoding chairs with rare geometries and missing high-frequency geometric details. The study trained AEs with an 85-5-10 split for 500 epochs and then trained six l-WGANs for 2K epochs. Limitations included failure cases in decoding chairs with rare geometries and missing high-frequency geometric details. The r-GAN struggled to create realistic shapes for some classes, particularly cars. Future work includes designing more robust raw-GANs for point clouds. Some issues with VAEs include over-regularization, affecting reconstruction quality. The space of an autoencoder is closely related to VAEs. One issue with VAEs is over-regularization, which can impact reconstruction quality. Methods exist to gradually increase the regularizer weight. Fixing the AE before training generative models can yield good results. Novel architectures for 3D point-cloud representation learning and generation were presented, showing good generalization and meaningful semantics. The best-performing generative model in the experiments was a GMM trained in the fixed latent space of an AE, suggesting that simple tools should not be overlooked. In experiments, a GMM trained in the fixed latent space of an AE performed well, indicating the importance of simple classic tools. The AE used for SVM-related experiments had specific encoder and decoder configurations, with batch normalization and data augmentation. Other AEs had different layer configurations and were trained for a maximum of 500 epochs. The AE was trained for 1000 epochs with CD loss and 1100 with EMD. Encoder had filters at each layer, decoder had 3 FC-ReLU layers. Different AE setups showed no advantage. Dropout layers led to worse reconstructions. Batch-norm on encoder sped up training. Discriminator had 1D-convolutions with filters, followed by max-pool. Generator had FC-ReLU layers with neurons. r-GAN was trained with Adam. The generator and discriminator architectures for the r-GAN model were detailed, including the number of layers, neurons, activation functions, and training parameters such as learning rate and batch size. Additionally, the use of a linear SVM classifier with specific penalties and class weights for classification experiments was mentioned. For the classification experiments, a linear SVM classifier with specific penalties and class weights was used. The training parameters for the SVMs in each dataset with different structural losses of the AE were detailed in Table 5. The reconstruction quality of the two AEs (CD and EMD-based) was compared in terms of JSD with their ground truth counterparts, showing comparable results between training and test datasets. The extra dimension is added to center input features; SVM's optimization loss function is used. The reconstruction quality of AEs (CD and EMD-based) is compared in terms of JSD with ground truth datasets, showing generalization ability. The AE-EMD is trained across all object classes for shape editing applications, showcasing its feature encoding capability. Editing parts in point clouds using vector arithmetic on AE latent space is demonstrated. The text discusses tuning the appearance of objects by modifying their shapes using a latent representation model. It demonstrates how structural differences between object categories can be encoded and manipulated in the latent space. Linear interpolation between shapes and transforming latent representations are used for shape editing applications. The text demonstrates how objects' properties can be changed by transforming their latent representation. It shows linear interpolation between shapes, enabling morphing between shapes of different appearances and classes. Additionally, shape analogies are explored through a combination of linear manipulations and euclidean nearest-neighbor searching in the latent space. The text demonstrates finding shape analogies through linear manipulations and euclidean nearest-neighbor searching in the latent space. Preliminary results of point-cloud generators working with voxel-based AEs are included, using a full-GMM model with 32 centers on ShapeNet's chair class. The text discusses using a point-cloud autoencoder to learn a latent space with occupancy grids of 3D shapes. A full-GMM model with 32 centers is used for generation, outperforming voxel-based GAN architectures. The latent representation provides a significant improvement in coverage for shape analogies. The use of latent representations in voxel GAN architecture provides a significant coverage improvement for shape analogies. The performance of 64^3 voxel-based GMM is comparable to the one at 32^3 resolution, indicating fidelity is not solely dependent on high-frequency details. Point-cloud-based models outperform voxel-based models in fidelity, as measured by MMD. The coverage boost of voxel-based latent-space models compared to MMD is attributed to how the coverage metric is computed. The coverage boost of voxel-based latent-space models compared to MMD is likely due to how the coverage metric is computed, matching all generated shapes against the ground truth regardless of quality. Voxel-based models often produce shapes with missing components, leading to poor quality matchings and artificially inflated coverage. The voxel-based models often produce shapes with poor quality due to using partial shapes, leading to artificially inflated coverage metrics. The volumetric models use GMMs with full covariances and different dimensional latent codes for mesh conversion. The voxel-based AEs have fully-convolutional encoders and decoders with specific layer parameters. The voxel-based AE models have fully-convolutional encoders and decoders with specific layer parameters. The models are trained for 100 epochs with Adam using binary cross-entropy loss. Reconstruction quality is compared to the state-of-the-art method BID28 using a 0.5 occupancy threshold on the ShapeNetCars dataset. The comparison is based on the intersection-over-union between input and synthesized voxel grids. The GMM-generator is compared against a model that memorizes the training data of the chair class using the ShapeNetCars dataset. Evaluation metrics show that memorizing the training set produces good coverage/fidelity with respect to the test set, validating the metrics used. The advantage of using a learned representation lies in learning the structure of the underlying space instead of individual samples. The training set shows good coverage/fidelity with the test set when drawn from the same population, validating the metrics used. Using a learned representation allows for compactly representing data and generating novel shapes. Despite some mode collapse, the generative models achieve excellent fidelity. Additional comparisons with BID32 for ShapeNet classes are provided in Tables 10, 11, and 12, including JSD-based and MMD/Coverage comparisons. In Table 10, JSD-based comparisons are provided for two models, while in TAB12, MMD/Coverage comparisons are presented on the test split. The generalization error of various GAN models is shown in FIG0, with measurements using JSD and MMD-CD metrics. Figure 17 discusses GMM model selection based on the number of Gaussians and covariance type. Models with a full covariance matrix achieve smaller JSD, with 30 or more clusters being sufficient for minimal JSD. Models with full covariance achieve smaller JSD, with 30 or more clusters being sufficient for minimal JSD.
