Standards for data collection and statistical methodologies must be established by the Secretary. States must develop a plan to ensure coverage for low-income children to be approved for fiscal year 2010 and onwards. The Secretary must approve a plan within 6 months to ensure all qualified low-income children have health coverage starting in fiscal year 2010. Plans will be reviewed and approved based on their effectiveness in providing coverage. If a plan is disapproved, there is an opportunity for resubmission. The Secretary must approve a plan within 6 months to ensure all qualified low-income children have health coverage starting in fiscal year 2010. Plans will be reviewed and approved based on their effectiveness in providing coverage. If a plan is disapproved, there is an opportunity for resubmission, and the Secretary will promptly notify the State of the approval or disapproval. The term 'qualified low-income child' is defined as a child whose family gross income does not exceed 200 percent of the poverty line for the family size and meets all eligibility requirements except those related to income. The text discusses the eligibility criteria for a qualified low-income child under the State child health plan, emphasizing that the gross family income should not exceed 200 percent of the poverty line for the family size. Additionally, it mentions a limitation on the use of SCHIP funds based on increases in income eligibility levels set by the State. The paragraph discusses limitations on payments to States under the section for individuals with family incomes exceeding the eligibility level unless a small percentage of low-income children are not covered. There is a safe harbor provision for qualified low-income children and currently eligible children."
