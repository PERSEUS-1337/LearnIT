    "content": "Recent deep generative models have shown the potential to create realistic images and embeddings useful for computer vision and natural language processing tasks. To address limitations in control and understanding of these models, recent research focuses on studying the semantics of the latent space. This paper introduces a method to enhance interpretability by identifying meaningful directions in the latent space for precise control over image properties like object position and scale. The method is weakly supervised and suitable for simple image transformations. It has been successfully applied to GANs and variational auto-encoders. The method introduced in the current text chunk enhances interpretability by identifying meaningful directions in the latent space for precise control over image properties like object position and scale. It is weakly supervised and suitable for simple image transformations, demonstrating effectiveness for GANs and variational auto-encoders. The study explores modifying attributes of generated images by manipulating latent codes, revealing insights into the structure of generative models' latent space. It distinguishes between modal factors of variation (discrete values like object category) and continuous factors (such as object size or position). In this paper, the authors propose a method to find precise control over continuous factors of variations in generative models' latent space, which is often limited to discrete factors. The paper proposes a method to control specific continuous factors of variation in generative models' latent space without the need for labels or an encoder model. It focuses on factors like vertical position, horizontal position, and scale in image generation. The method proposed does not require a labeled dataset or encoder model. It focuses on controlling factors like position and scale in generative models' latent space. The method allows for precise control of generated images and provides insights into the structure of the latent space. Key contributions include finding interpretable directions in the latent space, controlling image properties through linear directions, introducing a novel reconstruction loss, and discussing the challenges of inverting generative models. The method allows for precise control of generated images by sampling latent representations along linear directions and inverting generative models with a novel reconstruction loss. It discusses the impacts of disentanglement on controlling generative models and finding interpretable directions in the latent space for transformations. The text discusses finding latent space directions corresponding to specific transformations in generative models, aiming to determine the latent code of an image by minimizing reconstruction error through optimization. This method allows for precise control of generated images and the discovery of interpretable directions in the latent space for transformations. The text discusses minimizing reconstruction error in generative models to find latent codes for images, aiming for precise control and interpretable transformations in the latent space. Different reconstruction errors are explored to address issues with pixel-wise losses producing blurry images. The text proposes studying the effect of Mean Square Error (MSE) on images in the frequency domain to address issues with pixel-wise errors producing blurry textures. The limited capacity of the generator's latent space leads to uncertainty in texture configurations, resulting in uniform regions. By reducing the weight of high frequencies in the loss function, sharper results can be achieved. In the Fourier domain, the text suggests reducing the weight of high frequencies in the loss function to improve image sharpness and texture details. This adjustment allows for a wider range of possibilities in generating more realistic images. In the Fourier domain, adjusting the weight of high frequencies in the loss function can enhance image sharpness and texture details. A qualitative comparison of reconstruction errors and choices of \u03c3 can be found in Appendix C. A quantitative comparison to other losses is also provided using the Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS). The optimization problem of finding z T such that G(z T ) \u2248 T T (I) can be solved by creating a dataset of trajectories in the latent space corresponding to a transformation T in the pixel space. This transformation is controlled by a parameter \u03b4t, with N = 10 and (\u03b4t n ) (0\u2264n\u2264N ) distributed regularly on the interval [0, T ]. In practice, creating a dataset of trajectories in the latent space corresponding to a transformation in the pixel space is essential for solving the optimization problem of finding z T such that G(z T ) \u2248 T T (I). The transformation is controlled by a parameter \u03b4t, with N = 10 and (\u03b4t n ) (0\u2264n\u2264N ) distributed regularly on the interval [0, T ]. Training a specific network to initialize this problem can be costly due to the highly curved nature of the manifold of natural images in pixel space. Our approach decomposes the transformation into smaller transformations to guide optimization on the manifold, avoiding the need for extra training. Ignoring undefined regions in images and handling the limitations of generative models are key challenges addressed in our method. Our method addresses challenges such as handling undefined regions in images and limitations of generative models. To reduce outliers, we discard latent codes with high reconstruction errors. Algorithm 1 is used to generate trajectories in the latent space, followed by defining a model for encoding factors of variations. After discarding latent codes with high reconstruction errors, Algorithm 1 is utilized to generate trajectories in the latent space. A model is then defined to encode factors of variations, hypothesizing that a factor can be predicted from the latent code coordinate along an axis. The distribution of t = g( z, u ) when z \u223c N (0, I) is given by \u03d5 : R \u2192 R +. For example, in the dSprite dataset, the horizontal position factor x follows a uniform distribution U([\u22120.5, 0.5]) while the projection of z onto axis u follows a normal distribution N (0, 1). To estimate u and \u03b8, a parametrized model g \u03b8 : R \u2192 R is used with trainable parameters. The model is trained to minimize the MSE between \u03b4 t and f (\u03b8,u) (z \u03b4t ) \u2212 f (\u03b8,u) (z 0 ) using gradient descent on a dataset produced by Algorithm 1 for a given transformation. The method involves modeling \u03b4t instead of t to estimate u and \u03b8 by minimizing the MSE between \u03b4t and f(\u03b8,u) using gradient descent. This approach allows for control over the distribution of images generated by G. The results can be applied to reveal potential bias in training datasets. Experiments were conducted on two datasets, including dSprites with binary 64x64 images. The experiments were conducted on two datasets: dSprites, consisting of binary 64x64 images with varying shapes, and ILSVRC, containing 1.2M natural images from one thousand categories. The implementation details include the use of TensorFlow 2.0 and a BigGAN model for image generation. The study utilized a BigGAN model with TensorFlow-Hub weights for image generation. Latent vector z and one-hot vector inputs were used to condition the model. Multiple \u03b2-VAEs were trained to explore disentanglement importance. Training was done on dSprites dataset with Adam optimizer. Evaluation focused on position and scale variations. The study focused on evaluating the effectiveness of their method on position and scale variations using 128 images and a learning rate of 5e\u22124. Saliency detection was used for natural images sampled with the BigGAN model to estimate the position of objects. The scale was evaluated by the proportion of salient pixels. The evaluation procedure involved sampling latent codes and generating images to estimate the real value of the factor of variation. The study evaluated their method by sampling latent codes and generating images to estimate the factor of variation. Results showed precise control over object position and scale for selected categories of objects in ILSVRC. The proposed approach was more generic compared to an alternative method by Jahanian et al. (2019). The study demonstrated precise control over object position and scale for selected categories in ILSVRC using latent space directions. Results showed shared directions for factors of variation across all categories. The latent code hierarchy in BigGAN was analyzed to determine which parts encode position and scale. The study analyzed the latent code hierarchy in BigGAN to determine how object position and scale are encoded. Results showed that spatial variations are mainly encoded in the first part of the latent code. The algorithm showed precise control over object position and scale for selected categories in ILSVRC, but struggled with large scales due to poor performance of the saliency model. The algorithm struggles with large scales due to poor saliency model performance. This is likely caused by correlations between object position and background due to the non-invariance of the background to vertical translation. Testing the effect of disentanglement on performance, \u03b2-VAE models were trained on dSprites with varying \u03b2 values. Results show better control over object position in the image with higher \u03b2 values, indicating the method's effectiveness depends on the degree of disentanglement in the latent space. The effectiveness of controlling object position in images depends on the degree of disentanglement in the latent space, as shown in Figure 5. Increasing parameter \u03b2 leads to a more precise control, motivating the use of disentangled representations in generative models. Conditional GANs and VAEs provide ways to control the generative process with labeled datasets, while InfoGan shows disentanglement of latent space. Our method, however, does not require labels for control. Our method focuses on finding meaningful directions in the latent space of generative models without the need for labels. Unlike previous works that analyze network activations, we concentrate on the latent space itself. Additionally, we have developed a procedure to determine the latent representation of an image without an encoder, a contribution not explored in prior research. Our method introduces a procedure to find the latent representation of an image within a generator without the need for an encoder. Previous works have focused on inverting the generator of a GAN to find the latent code of an image, but our approach improves reconstruction quality significantly, especially on complex datasets like ILSVRC. Additionally, we provide theoretical justification for the challenges of inverting a generative model. The curr_chunk discusses improvements in reconstruction quality by adapting 2.1.1 to the problem, using spherical interpolation to reduce blurriness, and proposing a data augmentation method called \"synthetic attribute\" with a VAE. It also mentions recent works on finding interpretable directions in the latent space of generative models. The authors describe a method to find interpretable directions in the latent space of the BigGAN model, highlighting differences in training and evaluation procedures compared to another method. They also discuss the impact of disentangled representations on control and propose an alternative reconstruction error. Their model allows for more precise control over the generative process and can be adapted to more cases. The authors propose a method to extract meaningful directions in the latent space of BigGAN for precise control over generative image properties. They show that a linear subspace of the latent space can represent intuitive factors like translation and scale. The authors discuss the importance of understanding representations learned by generative models through a target image I and a generated image \u00ce. They analyze the contribution of high frequencies in the Fourier space to the loss function, showing that minimizing the loss leads to smoother images with fewer high frequencies. The \u03b2-VAE framework is also mentioned. The \u03b2-VAE framework aims to discover interpretable latent representations in images without supervision. A simple convolutional VAE architecture is designed for generating 64x64 images, with a decoder network consisting of transposed convolutions and dense layers. The curr_chunk discusses the architecture and results of a VAE model, including the use of different loss functions and constraints on the latent code. Results show that certain values of sigma lead to better reconstruction quality. A comparison with other approaches like MSE and DSSIM is also presented. The curr_chunk presents a comparison of the VAE model's approach with MSE and DSSIM, showing improved reconstruction accuracy and reduced artifacts. Results from reconstructing images using the proposed method outperformed MSE and DSSIM in perceptual similarity evaluations. The comparison of the VAE model's approach with MSE and DSSIM shows improved reconstruction accuracy and reduced artifacts. Results indicate that images reconstructed using the proposed method are perceptually closer to the target image. The optimization problem of Equation 2 is challenging due to the curvature of the natural image manifold, especially for factors like translation or rotation. An experiment with common transformations (translation, rotation, scaling) on images from the dSprites dataset illustrates the curved trajectory in pixel space. The PCA analysis of the resulting trajectories is visualized in Figure 8. The experiment with common transformations on images from the dSprites dataset shows that large translations and rotations result in trajectories in pixel space that are near orthogonal to the manifold. This causes challenges during optimization of the latent code as the gradient of the reconstruction loss is small in these cases. When optimizing the latent code for images, near orthogonality between the gradient of the error and the generative model's manifold can slow down or halt optimization progress. For instance, in an ideal GAN scenario with a small white circle on a black background, moving the circle from left to right may result in a gradient of zero if the circles do not intersect, as small translations do not affect the reconstruction error. Moving a circle from left to right may result in a gradient of zero if the circles do not intersect, as small translations do not affect the reconstruction error. Additional qualitative examples show results for different geometric transformations and brightness levels using the BigGAN model. The latent codes are sampled to produce interesting results, with some categories showing difficulty in controlling brightness due to training data limitations."
