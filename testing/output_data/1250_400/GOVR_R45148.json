    "content": "Economics is the study of efficient resource use and trade for mutual enrichment. Countries benefit from trade by producing efficiently and importing goods that are costly to produce domestically. Imports in the United States include goods not produced in sufficient quantities domestically or more efficiently by foreign firms, leading to consumer welfare benefits. Global value chains often involve U.S.-made components or raw materials in imported goods, providing consumers with a greater variety of products at lower costs. Trade benefits consumers by providing access to a variety of goods at lower costs, improving purchasing power, and controlling inflation. It also allows producers to access lower-cost inputs, improve competitiveness, and expand production. Trade leads to greater competition, innovation, and investment in research and development, supporting increased productivity and economic growth. Trade benefits consumers by providing access to a variety of goods at lower costs, improving purchasing power, and controlling inflation. It also allows producers to access lower-cost inputs, improve competitiveness, and expand production. Economist David Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage explains how countries trade by focusing on specialization and trade's mutual benefits, regardless of absolute production efficiency. Opportunity cost, not absolute cost, determines comparative advantage in producing goods. The theory of comparative advantage, as proposed by economist David Ricardo, emphasizes that countries should specialize in goods they can produce relatively well and trade for goods they produce less efficiently. This theory focuses on opportunity cost rather than absolute production costs. Modern economic theories have further developed the concept of comparative advantage to explain complex trade patterns in the 21st century, including global value chains and digital trade. Complex trade patterns in the 21st century are influenced by global value chains, services, digital trade, and factors of production like labor, capital, human capital, and technology. Countries have a comparative advantage in activities that utilize their abundant factors of production. For example, the United States excels in producing goods that require high-skilled labor due to its relative abundance of such labor. Differences in productive technology also play a role in determining comparative advantage. The United States has a comparative advantage in producing goods that use high-skilled labor intensively, such as aircraft. Governments can influence comparative advantage through policies like eliminating corruption and supporting mass education. Industrial policies can also directly nurture advantages in specific industries. Industrial policy can have both indirect and direct influences on a country's economy. Indirect influences include policies to eliminate corruption, enforce property rights, liberalize trade barriers, and support education. Direct influences involve policies like subsidies or tariffs to promote strategic industries. There is debate on the effectiveness of such policies, with concerns about distorting trade flows and reducing efficiency. Intra-industry trade, where countries trade similar goods within the same industry, is common among advanced economies with similar resources and development levels. Intra-industry trade between advanced economies suggests trade based on economies of scale rather than comparative advantage. Countries specialize in producing a subset of goods due to limited productive capacity. Trade impacts employment, wages, income distribution, and standard of living in the US economy. Trade is a key driver of changes in employment, wages, income distribution, and standard of living in the US economy. It has a net positive effect on economic well-being by promoting efficient resource use, competition, economies of scale, and consumer welfare. However, the benefits of trade are not evenly distributed, with some sectors experiencing disruptions and certain regions and industries facing job losses and stagnant wages. Despite these challenges, liberalizing trade globally has significantly reduced extreme poverty over the past 25 years according to the World Bank. Trade has reduced global extreme poverty by half in the past 25 years, but its benefits are not evenly distributed. Job losses and stagnant wages from trade disruptions are concentrated in certain regions and industries. Economists debate the impact of trade on jobs and wages, with policies needed to help those affected by market forces. Adjustment assistance is seen as crucial for maintaining political support for free trade. Trade can lead to job losses and stagnant wages in certain regions and industries. Economists debate the impact of trade on jobs and wages, with adjustment assistance seen as crucial for maintaining political support for free trade. Trade causes job shifts into industries with comparative advantage and away from industries with comparative disadvantage, leading to disruptions in employment composition. Trade liberalization can result in job shifts within industries and between sectors of the economy. While some jobs may be displaced, estimates show that job loss due to trade is a small share of overall job losses. Studies suggest that increased import competition, particularly from China, has negatively impacted local labor markets and manufacturing jobs in the U.S. Some workers may face substantial costs when trying to switch occupations or industries to find new jobs, including reduced wages. Increased import competition from China has negatively affected U.S. local labor markets and manufacturing jobs. While some workers may face substantial costs when switching occupations due to trade liberalization, most economists argue that equating trade deficit with unemployment is questionable. International trade can both positively and negatively impact worker wages, with no overall consensus on the impact of trade agreements on U.S. workers' wages. International trade can impact worker wages positively and negatively, with no consensus on the effect of trade agreements on U.S. workers' wages. Trade tends to benefit capital and high-skilled workers while potentially lowering wages for low-skilled workers, especially in import-sensitive industries facing competition from countries like China. The growth of global value chains has led some U.S. multinational corporations to shift low-value, labor-intensive production overseas, impacting wages of low-skilled U.S. workers in import-sensitive industries. On the other hand, U.S. workers in export-oriented industries earn more than workers in non-exporting industries, with an earnings premium in export-intensive manufacturing industries and services. Economic globalization refers to the increasing integration of national economies through trade and financial activities. The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) estimated a 16% earnings premium in export-intensive manufacturing industries and a 15.5% premium in services. Economic globalization involves trade in goods and services, capital flows, technology transfer, and international labor flows. Global trade as a percentage of global GDP increased from 25% to 57% from 1960 to 2017, and global foreign direct investment (FDI) grew from 6% to 39% of global GDP from 1980 to 2017. Globalization has increased global trade as a percentage of global GDP from 25% to 57% between 1960 and 2017. The stock of global foreign direct investment (FDI) also grew significantly during this period. The integration of the world economy has been facilitated by advancements in transport and communication, as well as policies that have reduced barriers to international exchange. There is ongoing debate about the inclusivity and impact of globalization on inequality within countries. Global value chains (GVCs) involve interconnected organizations, resources, and processes that deliver products to consumers. Globalization has lifted living standards worldwide, with ongoing debate about economic integration's inclusivity and impact on inequality. Global value chains (GVCs) involve multinational corporations (MNCs) assembling products from parts produced in multiple countries. Over half of global manufacturing imports are intermediate goods within supply chains, while over 75% of global services imports are intermediate services. GVCs have driven globalization, with a significant foreign value-added share in national exports. The OECD suggests that over a quarter of national exports include foreign content. The foreign value-added share in U.S. exports has increased in most industries. Global value chains are crucial for the global economy, driving globalization and blurring the distinction between domestic and foreign activities in trade. Trade in intermediates has made imports essential for exports, complicating the interpretation of bilateral trade balances. Global value chains have blurred the distinction between exports and imports, making it difficult to determine who benefits from global trade. Trade in intermediates means imports are crucial for exports, impacting policies that affect both. Foreign direct investment drives trade, with multinational corporations sourcing production globally within their chains. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) involves obtaining a lasting interest and influence in a business enterprise in another country. FDI has led to the development of global value chains by multinational corporations (MNCs), resulting in the majority of trade occurring within MNCs. U.S. firms invest abroad to sell goods and services to foreign markets and to understand local preferences. In 2016, 11% of sales from U.S. foreign affiliates went to U.S. parent companies, while 59% went to the local market of the host country. Foreign firms invest in the United States to access the consumer market, skilled labor, and resources. Global integration through trade and investment flows can disrupt markets, leading to concerns about offshoring and outsourcing. U.S. multinational corporations focus on high-end activities like research and development while outsourcing production. The impact of globalization on wealth distribution and U.S. employment is a concern due to offshoring and outsourcing. U.S. multinational corporations focus on high-end activities like research and development while outsourcing production abroad. This can lead to a reduction in U.S. manufacturing jobs but an increase in service-related jobs. Globalization may also dampen wages for lower-skilled U.S. workers compared to higher-skilled workers, leading to higher returns to capital over labor. The impact of globalization on wealth distribution includes dampening wages for U.S. lower-skilled workers facing foreign competition and increasing returns to capital over labor. Studies show globalization has marginally contributed to rising U.S. wage inequality by 10% to 20%. Most-favored-nation treatment (MFN) in the World Trade Organization requires equal treatment among member countries. Most-favored-nation treatment (MFN) in the World Trade Organization requires equal treatment among member countries, granting each other member country treatment at least as favorable as its most-favored trade partner. Exceptions include trade agreements outside the WTO and special treatment for developing countries. National treatment prohibits discrimination between domestic and foreign products once imported. National treatment and most-favored nation (MFN) trade status are key principles in the multilateral trading system. National treatment ensures that imported products are treated no less favorably than domestic products, while MFN status guarantees nondiscriminatory treatment of trading partners. Countries without permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) face higher duty rates on imports. The Trade Act of 1974 prohibits granting PNTR status to countries not receiving such treatment at the time of the law's enactment. Title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 prohibits granting PNTR status to countries without NTR status. The Jackson-Vanik amendment further denies PNTR status for countries restricting emigration. The United States must extend MFN treatment to all WTO members. The Harmonized Tariff Schedule determines tariffs on imported goods using the Harmonized System. The Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) determines tariffs on imported goods using a structure of tariff classification based on standard commodity codes and descriptions developed by the World Customs Organization (WCO). The HS groups products into chapters and subheadings at different digit levels for detailed categorization. HS codes are standard worldwide up to the 6-digit level, with the HTSUS further subdividing into unique 8-digit and 10-digit tariff lines for the United States. The U.S. International Trade Commission publishes and updates the HTS. The HTSUS uses standard commodity codes to determine tariffs on imported goods. The U.S. International Trade Commission publishes and updates the HTS. U.S. Customs and Border Protection enforces the tariff code, while rules of origin (ROO) determine the nationality of imported products for various purposes. Origin determination can be complex in today's global economy due to products being assembled with parts from multiple countries. The U.S. negotiates different ROO within its FTAs to ensure only eligible trading partners receive tariff benefits. In today's global economy, determining the origin of goods can be complex as products are assembled with parts from multiple countries. The United States negotiates rules of origin (ROO) within its Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) to ensure only eligible trading partners receive tariff benefits. The \"yarn-forward\" rule in the apparel industry requires yarn and fabric to come from FTA partners, impacting import-sensitive industries. Global trade plays a crucial role in the global economy, with trade reforms linked to higher growth in productivity and reduced poverty worldwide. Global trade is crucial for the global economy, with trade reforms leading to higher productivity and reduced poverty worldwide. Trade growth has rebounded, increasing from 2% in 2016 to above 5% in 2017, driven by factors such as increased investment and consumption expenditure. Trade growth rebounded from 2% in 2016 to over 5% in 2017, driven by increased investment and consumption expenditure. Despite a positive global economic outlook, trade growth is expected to slow due to rising trade tensions and policy uncertainty. The United States and its trading partners have imposed restrictive trade measures, impacting trade flows and prices in targeted sectors. Analysts warn of disruptions to supply chains and potential increases in trade restrictions. In 2017, the top-five largest trading economies were the United States, China, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom. The EU would be the largest trading economy if treated as a single bloc. China was the largest exporter, while the United States was the largest importer. The U.S. share of global goods exports fell from 15% in 1960 to 9% in 2017. U.S. exports and imports combined were equivalent to 27% of GDP in 2017. In 2017, the U.S. was both the largest importer and exporter, with a share of global goods exports falling from 15% in 1960 to 9%. U.S. exports and imports combined were equivalent to 27% of GDP. The U.S. export share of global services is 14%. Various organizations have developed indexes to assess the \"openness\" or \"competitiveness\" of the U.S. economy, with the United States ranking first in the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index. In 2017, the U.S. exported $2.4 trillion in goods and services and imported $2.9 trillion. Trade relative to GDP has risen markedly since 1960. In 2017, the U.S. exported $2.4 trillion in goods and services and imported $2.9 trillion. U.S. exports have grown more than 40% over the past decade, while imports have grown more than 20%. Trade relative to GDP has risen significantly since 1960, with U.S. exports as a percent of GDP expanding from 5% to 12% in 2017, and imports expanding from 4% to 15%. China was the top U.S. trading partner, followed by Canada, Mexico, Japan, and Germany. The EU is the largest export destination and source of imports for the United States. About 65% of U.S. global trade is with countries without a free trade agreement. Multinational corporations (MNCs) produce worldwide, using inputs from various countries, leading to complex global value chains. Traditional trade statistics do not fully reflect the true source of resources used in production. For example, products like iPhones, developed in the U.S. but assembled in China, show how trade data can be misleading. Apple benefits the most from the sale of its products, despite the value being attributed to China in trade statistics. When the United States imports iPhones, the full value is attributed to China, even though most of the design, development, and high-wage functions occur in the U.S. This leads to an inflated bilateral trade deficit between the two countries. The \"trade deficit\" could be reduced by one-third if trade flows were measured based on the origin of value added. The trade deficit between the United States and China could be reduced by one-third if trade flows were measured based on the origin of value added. The trade deficit generally refers to the balance of trade in goods and services, with the U.S. running deficits annually for most of the post-WWII period. In 2017, the U.S. had a global trade deficit of $552.3 billion, driven mainly by goods trade. The United States has a trade deficit in goods and services, with a deficit of $552.3 billion in 2017. The deficit is driven by goods trade, which was $807.5 billion. The U.S. also has a services trade surplus of $255.2 billion. The current account deficit in 2017 was $449.1 billion, down from its peak in 2006. The United States has experienced an annual current account deficit since the mid-1970s, with a deficit of $449.1 billion in 2017, down from its peak in 2006. The shrinking deficit was due to the economic slowdown post-global financial crisis in 2008, reduced demand for imports, and lower commodity prices. The trade deficit reflects that the U.S. consumes more than it produces and imports more than it exports, primarily due to low domestic savings relative to investment needs, leading to borrowing from countries with excess savings like China. The U.S. trade deficit is driven by low domestic savings relative to investment needs, leading to borrowing from countries like China. The role of the dollar as a global reserve currency facilitates the deficit by increasing the availability of dollar-denominated assets. Foreign investors, both governments and private entities, continue to finance the deficit by purchasing U.S. Treasury securities. Investors seek dollar-denominated assets as safe-haven assets during economic stress. Foreigners finance the U.S. trade deficit by buying U.S. Treasury securities. The U.S. current account deficit relative to GDP has declined from a historic high in 2006 to 2.3% in 2017. Countries with current account deficits are net borrowers, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. The United States, United Kingdom, and Canada have the largest current account deficits as a percent of GDP, while the Netherlands, Germany, and South Korea have the largest surpluses. U.S. bilateral trade deficits with countries like China are seen as unfair due to market-distorting trade policies. High tariffs and trade barriers do not necessarily reduce overall trade deficits. The U.S. trade deficit is mainly due to low savings, not high tariffs. Reduction of protectionist measures may not significantly impact the deficit if consumption and savings behavior remain unchanged. Bilateral trade balances are influenced by various factors beyond trade barriers, such as economic development and technological change. Trade balances provide a snapshot of the U.S. trade relationship with a country, influenced by factors like economic development, raw materials, and technological change. Bilateral trade deficits with certain partners reflect complex supply chain relationships. A trade deficit causes adjustments in the economy, affecting exchange rates. Net imports lead to a surplus of U.S. dollars flowing abroad, potentially lowering the dollar's value and gradually reducing the trade deficit. The value of the dollar relative to other currencies is influenced by net imports, causing a surplus of U.S. dollars to flow abroad. This surplus can lower the dollar's value, making imports more expensive for Americans and exports cheaper for foreign buyers. However, the dollar's special status in global financial markets, as a medium of exchange and reserve currency, can impact its value. Foreign investments in U.S. Treasury securities can appreciate the dollar, making U.S. exports more expensive. Some countries intervene in currency markets to prevent their currency from appreciating relative to the dollar. Some analysts argue that foreign governments intervene in currency markets to keep their currency from appreciating relative to the dollar, impacting global trade balances. Trade deficits reflect a savings/investment shortfall, leading to the United States borrowing from abroad. Concerns arise from the debt accumulation due to sustained trade deficits. Borrowing to finance imports can be beneficial if used for productive investments, but detrimental if used for current consumption. Borrowing to finance new technology and productivity-enhancing products can lead to higher economic growth in the long run. However, borrowing for consumer purchases pushes repayment to future generations without improving the ability to finance those repayments. A rising U.S. trade deficit could result in a sudden fall in the value of the dollar, risking financial turmoil. Attempting to reduce the trade deficit without addressing underlying macroeconomic imbalances may negatively impact economic growth. Boosting domestic savings could help reduce the current account deficit. Many economists argue that reducing the U.S. trade deficit without addressing underlying macroeconomic imbalances could harm the economy and have little impact on the trade balance in the long run. Ways to reduce the current account deficit include boosting domestic savings or reducing foreign investment. Realigning exchange rates or preventing currency manipulation by other countries are also options. Trade policies are not seen as the most effective tools for balancing trade. In 2017, the U.S. exported $1.3 trillion in manufactured goods and imported $2.0 trillion, resulting in a merchandise trade deficit of $698 billion. U.S. manufactured exports accounted for 56% of total exports and 70% of total imports. In 2017, the United States had a merchandise trade deficit of $698 billion, with manufactured goods accounting for 56% of total exports and 70% of total imports. The growth of global value chains has transformed U.S. manufacturing, leading to the outsourcing of labor-intensive activities and the expansion of production requiring advanced technology. Reports of factory closings and layoffs have highlighted the shift in manufacturing processes. The U.S. manufacturing sector has seen a shift towards design, product development, and distribution driving the process, while labor-intensive activities have moved abroad. Despite reports of factory closings and layoffs, manufacturing output has increased due to higher productivity. While manufacturing's importance relative to the economy has declined, it remains a significant component. From 1980 to 2017, U.S. manufacturing real output increased over 80%, but its share of GDP decreased to 11% in 2017. Despite a decline in its relative importance to the economy, manufacturing remains a significant component of the U.S. economy. From 1980 to 2017, U.S. manufacturing real output increased by over 80%, with a 20% increase since 2009. However, the value-added of manufacturing as a share of GDP decreased to 11% in 2017 from 21% in 1980, while services increased to 70% of GDP. Employment in manufacturing fell from 19.4 million in 1979 to 12.4 million in 2017, but has been rising since 2010. In 2017, manufacturing accounted for 8.5% of total nonfarm employment, down from 20.7% in 1980. The decline in employment and importance of physical production are trends seen in most advanced economies. The decline in U.S. manufacturing employment and the shift towards services are not unique to the country, but are trends seen in most advanced economies. Factors such as technology, consumer preferences, and trade have contributed to the restructuring of the manufacturing sector. The impact of trade on manufacturing employment is debated, with some attributing job losses to increased imports from China, while others argue that job gains in services offset these losses. Overall, the manufacturing sector has been undergoing fundamental changes for over two decades, with the role of automation and other factors also playing a significant role. The U.S. manufacturing sector has been undergoing fundamental changes for over two decades, with automation and other factors playing a significant role. Despite a decline in global manufacturing value-added, the U.S. remains a top global manufacturer, with significant contributions to research and development and exports. In 2017, the U.S. had a trade surplus of $17 billion in agricultural goods, accounting for 6% of total U.S. exports. In 2017, the U.S. had a trade surplus of $17 billion in agricultural goods, accounting for 6% of total U.S. exports. Agriculture's share of U.S. exports has fallen slightly below the average of 8% over the past decade, while the import share remains on trend. Foreign markets are a major outlet for many agricultural goods, with exports accounting for about 20% of total farm production by value. In recent years, services have accounted for a large share of U.S. food consumption. These services include a wide range of economic activities like audiovisual, construction, computer services, energy, express delivery, e-commerce, financial services, transportation, tourism, and telecommunications. They not only serve as end-use products but also support the overall economy by facilitating the movement of goods and providing credits for manufacturing. Barriers to trade in services are often different from those for goods, with restrictions mainly occurring within the importing country as \"behind the border\" barriers. Barriers to trade in services are often different from those for goods, with restrictions mainly occurring within the importing country as \"behind the border\" barriers. In 2017, the United States exported $798 billion in services and imported $542 billion, creating a trade surplus of $255 billion. Services trade plays an important role in the U.S. economy, accounting for about 79% of total U.S. exports of goods and services. In 2017, the United States had a trade surplus of $255 billion from exporting $798 billion in services and importing $542 billion. Services trade accounts for 79% of total U.S. exports and plays a significant role in the economy, contributing to 79% of U.S. GDP and 82% of private sector full-time employment. Trade deficits in goods are partially offset by surpluses in services trade. Services trade includes various inputs like transportation, R&D, design, engineering, and business services, which are often underestimated in conventional trade data. The value of services in trade can be captured in value-added statistics, including transportation, R&D, design, engineering, and business services. Digital trade facilitates economic activity through online shopping, information transmission, online health and educational services, communication channels, and financial services. ICT services are growing faster than trade in ICT goods, with digital trade facing tariff and nontariff barriers. Digital trade is growing faster than trade in ICT goods, with barriers such as localization requirements restricting cross-border data flows and limiting the type of services that firms can offer. Data transfer regulations may also hinder communication and data sharing with subsidiaries or headquarters abroad. The United States has historically played a key role in shaping the global economic order post-World War II, focusing on promoting open trade, reducing barriers, enforcing trade commitments, and supporting economic growth. Data localization barriers can restrict cross-border data flows and limit services that firms can offer, hindering communication and data sharing with subsidiaries or headquarters abroad. The United States has historically been involved in shaping the global economic order by promoting open trade, reducing barriers, enforcing trade commitments, and supporting economic growth. U.S. trade policy focuses on trade agreements, negotiations, enforcing commitments, and providing relief to companies facing unfair competition. Key objectives include supporting economic development, strengthening alliances, and advancing strategic goals. The U.S. Trade Representative outlines trade policy objectives annually, including supporting national security, negotiating new trade deals, enforcing trade laws, and reforming the multilateral trading system. Key functions of the U.S. government in trade include formulating policy, negotiating agreements, enforcing laws, and administering trade programs. The U.S. government plays a major role in trade policy by formulating and coordinating trade policy, negotiating agreements, enforcing trade laws, and administering trade programs. The USTR and various U.S. agencies are involved in implementing trade policy, with interagency coordination being crucial. Agency roles have evolved over time, with the USTR serving as the President's principal advisor on trade policy and chief U.S. trade negotiator. Other agencies, such as the Commerce Department and Department of Agriculture, also have specific roles in promoting and regulating trade. The U.S. government plays a major role in trade policy, with the USTR serving as the chief trade negotiator. Other agencies like the Commerce Department and Department of Agriculture have specific roles in trade promotion and regulation. Congress holds primary authority over trade policy, enacting laws governing tariffs, trade remedies, and reciprocal trade agreements. Trade policy is based on statutory authorities passed by Congress. Congress plays a significant role in U.S. trade policy by enacting laws governing tariffs, trade remedies, and reciprocal trade agreements. This includes setting trade negotiating objectives, conducting oversight hearings, and delegating certain powers to the President for trade negotiations. The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 authorized the President to enter into agreements to reduce tariffs within congressionally approved levels. The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 delegated powers to the President to negotiate trade agreements and reduce tariffs within approved levels. The Trade Act of 1974 expanded this authority to include opening markets and addressing nontariff barriers. Congressional committees like the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committees oversee trade matters, with other committees also playing a role in trade issues under their jurisdiction. The House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee have primary responsibility for trade matters, with subcommittees dedicated to trade issues. Other committees may also be involved in trade agreements and policies within their jurisdiction. Congressional Advisory Groups on Negotiations provide advice to USTR, with separate groups for the House and Senate. Individual Members influence trade policy through voting and committee membership. Trade promotion authority (TPA), also known as \"fast track,\" streamlines the approval and implementation process for most trade agreements. Congress is responsible for implementing agreements that require changes in U.S. law through legislation. TPA ensures expedited consideration of implementing legislation with a guaranteed, up-or-down vote and no amendments, provided certain requirements are met. Individual Members influence trade policy through voting, committee membership, testimony, written letters to USTR, and informal influence over other Members. Trade promotion authority (TPA), also known as \"fast track,\" streamlines the approval and implementation process for trade agreements requiring changes in U.S. law. TPA ensures expedited consideration of implementing legislation through a guaranteed, up-or-down vote with no amendments, provided certain requirements are met. Congress first enacted TPA in 1974 and has renewed it four times, with some aspects evolving over time. The most recent legislation was signed into law. The President enhances negotiating credibility by assuring U.S. trading partners that the final trade agreement will be considered by Congress without amendments. Trade promotion authority (TPA) was first enacted in 1974 and has been renewed four times, with the most recent legislation signed into law on June 29, 2015. The executive branch is responsible for executing trade policy, negotiating treaties, customs enforcement, trade remedy laws, budget proposals, and administering export and import policies under the President's direction. The President directs overall trade policy, adjusts tariff rates, and appoints the USTR as the chief adviser on trade policy. The USTR is responsible for developing, coordinating, and implementing trade policy, negotiating trade agreements, and enforcing U.S. trade laws. Congress created the USTR in 1962 to provide better balance in U.S. trade policy and negotiations. The USTR was established in 1962 to enhance trade profile and balance domestic and international interests in US trade policy. Various departments and agencies within the executive branch handle trade functions, with the USTR primarily responsible for trade negotiations and policy decisions. Other key agencies involved in trade policymaking and enforcement include Commerce, Agriculture, State, Treasury, Homeland Security, and Labor. Congress established the Trade Policy Committee to facilitate a multidepartment interagency process for trade decisions. The USTR has primary responsibility for trade negotiations and policy decisions, involving other Cabinet-level departments in a multidepartment interagency process. Congress established the Trade Policy Committee, chaired by USTR and including key department heads. The executive branch also seeks advice from a three-tier trade advisory committee system. The President influences trade legislation and policies when necessary for the national interest or political environment. The President plays a crucial role in influencing trade legislation and policies, making specific decisions on U.S. trade policies, and engaging in trade relations with foreign heads of state. The private sector and other stakeholders contribute to U.S. trade policy through a three-tiered committee system established by Congress in the Trade Act of 1974. The U.S. trade policy is shaped by a three-tiered committee system established by Congress in the Trade Act of 1974. The system includes 28 committees with citizen advisors, administered by USTR's Office of Intergovernmental Affairs & Public Engagement. The committees provide information and advice on negotiating objectives for trade agreements, ensuring public and private sector views are considered. Industry, NGOs, labor groups, and other stakeholders also influence U.S. trade policy through various channels. The private sector, NGOs, labor groups, and other stakeholders play a significant role in shaping U.S. trade policy. They provide input through testifying before congressional committees and government bodies, submitting comments on trade initiatives, and lobbying Congress and the executive branch. Trade is vital to the U.S. economy, with various goods being exportable. Trade is a crucial aspect of the U.S. economy, with a wide range of goods and services being tradeable. Various stakeholders, including the private sector, NGOs, and labor groups, actively participate in shaping U.S. trade policies and agreements. Their efforts influence decisions on trade agreements, antidumping cases, and market access in different countries. Additionally, the focus on nontariff issues in trade agreements has expanded the scope of stakeholder involvement. Stakeholders representing businesses, farmers, workers, consumers, and public interest groups are actively involved in shaping U.S. trade policies. Legal challenges in federal court may arise from importers, exporters, and domestic manufacturers regarding trade decisions and actions. This includes disputes over customs classification, antidumping proceedings, national security investigations, and state economic sanctions. The federal government can initiate legal proceedings to enforce customs laws and restrictions on imports and exports, including antidumping and countervailing duty proceedings. Some trade statutes may limit judicial review, such as preliminary determinations in AD and CVD cases. Court decisions, often heard in the U.S. Court of International Trade, can impact U.S. trade policy by examining agency interpretations of statutory mandates and actions. The U.S. Court of International Trade (USCIT) in New York City has exclusive jurisdiction over various trade-related matters, including customs decisions, trade remedy determinations, and import embargoes. It consists of nine judges appointed by the President with Senate approval. USCIT decisions can be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The U.S. Court of International Trade (USCIT), formerly known as the Customs Court, has nine judges appointed by the President with Senate approval. Its jurisdiction was expanded in 1980. USCIT decisions can be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and possibly to the U.S. Supreme Court. Trade liberalizing agreements are negotiated by the United States for economic, commercial, foreign policy, and national security reasons. The United States participates in various trade agreements to eliminate barriers, increase market access for exporters, gain competitive advantages, access lower-cost imports, and strengthen alliances. These agreements include multilateral agreements in the World Trade Organization, bilateral free trade agreements, and regional agreements like NAFTA and CPTPP. The United States has 14 FTAs in force, covering 20 countries, with nearly 300 trade agreements globally. U.S. FTAs mainly involve small, developing countries, while only 35% of total U.S. trade is with FTA partners. Over 99% of U.S. trade is with WTO member countries, with 65% of trade with WTO members without an FTA. The Trump Administration has brought a shift in U.S. trade policy. The Trump Administration has shifted U.S. trade policy by withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and focusing on bilateral trade deals. The U.S. has renegotiated NAFTA into the USMCA and made amendments to the U.S.-South Korea FTA. These changes impact a small portion of U.S. trade, as the majority is with WTO member countries. The USMCA was renegotiated under TPA procedures, allowing for expedited consideration by Congress. Amendments to the U.S.-South Korea FTA were also made, including the delayed reduction of the U.S. light truck tariff. USTR notified Congress of intent to negotiate new trade agreements with Japan, the EU, and UK. U.S. FTAs are comprehensive, going beyond WTO rules and often include tariff elimination and barrier reduction. The United States' Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) are more comprehensive than those of other countries, covering tariff elimination, services trade barriers, foreign investment rules, intellectual property rights, government procurement, labor standards, and environmental provisions. The US seeks to establish new trading rules in recent agreements, including digital trade and state-owned enterprises. Trade and Investment Framework Agreements (TIFAs) are used to consult on mutual economic interests and promote trade and investment, with the USTR leading TIFA talks. The US has over 50 TIFAs, mostly with developing countries, and can establish joint ministerial-level councils with TIFA partners. The United States uses Trade and Investment Framework Agreements (TIFAs) to consult with other countries on mutual economic interests and promote trade and investment. The USTR leads TIFA talks, and the US has over 50 TIFAs, mostly with developing countries. TIFAs do not require congressional approval and can lead to Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) or bilateral investment treaty (BIT) negotiations. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was created in 1947 and governed international trade until the establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995. The GATT was the main set of rules for international trade for 47 years until the creation of the WTO in 1995. The core principles of the GATT aimed to lower tariffs and apply them in a nondiscriminatory manner. The WTO, with 164 member countries including the US, administers trade rules, eliminates barriers, and resolves disputes. The US played a significant role in establishing the WTO and shaping new trade agreements. The WTO, established in 1995 with the US as a key player, oversees trade agreements and negotiations, including GATT, GATS, TRIPS, and others. It also manages disputes and negotiations like the Doha Development Agenda, though facing challenges with major issues like agriculture. The WTO oversees multilateral and plurilateral negotiations among subsets of members, with the Doha Development Agenda facing challenges since 2001. The latest Ministerial Conference in 2017 did not yield major results, leading to calls for reforms to enhance the WTO's role in global trade. The effectiveness of the WTO in trade liberalization and dispute resolution is being questioned post the collapse of the Doha Round. Members are pushing for reforms to strengthen the global trading system, including improvements to the dispute settlement system. The Trump Administration is withholding approval for appointments to the WTO Appellate Body, risking the system's functionality by late 2019. Dispute settlement proceedings can be initiated by a WTO member to challenge trade practices violating WTO agreements, starting with consultations and potentially leading to adjudication by a dispute panel and appeal to the WTO Appellate Body. The WTO dispute settlement process involves challenging trade practices that violate WTO agreements through consultations, dispute panels, and appeals to the WTO Appellate Body. The United States has been heavily involved in WTO disputes, including recent challenges to tariff measures. WTO decisions do not directly impact U.S. law. The United States is heavily involved in WTO disputes, including challenges to recent tariff measures. WTO decisions do not directly impact U.S. law, and compliance with rulings is typically sought. If a U.S. statute is found to be inconsistent with WTO obligations, legislative action is required for implementation. Compliance actions are determined by USTR, which may involve amending regulations or providing compensation to complainant countries. The United States generally complies with WTO decisions and seeks to resolve disputes through consultations in both state-to-state and investor-state fora under U.S. FTAs. If a dispute is common to both FTA and WTO rules, a country may choose the forum in which to bring the dispute. State-state dispute settlement is not frequently used under U.S. FTAs, with most disputes being adjudicated under WTO rules. The United States generally complies with WTO decisions and seeks to resolve disputes through consultations in both state-to-state and investor-state fora under U.S. FTAs. Disputes common to both FTA and WTO rules allow countries to choose the forum for resolution. State-state dispute settlement is not frequently used under U.S. FTAs, with most disputes being resolved under WTO rules. NAFTA and USMCA have unique dispute settlement mechanisms, including investor-state dispute settlement and binational panel systems. Trade preference programs offer duty-free access to the U.S. market for eligible developing countries. Trade preference programs provide duty-free access to the U.S. market for selected exports from eligible developing countries. Congress has created six programs since 1974, including GSP, CBERA, AGOA, and others. GSP is the largest program, covering 120 countries and territories and importing $21 billion worth of goods in 2017. Countries must meet specific criteria to be eligible, such as protecting intellectual property and worker rights. USTR is currently conducting eligibility reviews. The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) is a trade preference program that provides duty-free access to the U.S. market for selected exports from eligible developing countries. In 2017, $21 billion worth of imports entered the United States under the program. Countries must meet specific criteria, including protecting intellectual property and worker rights, to be eligible. The U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) is currently conducting eligibility reviews for several GSP beneficiary countries. Trade capacity building (TCB) involves U.S. assistance, such as funding and training, to support developing countries' integration and participation in international trade. In FY2016, the United States invested about $1.2 billion in 651 TCB activities across 134 countries. The U.S. government sees TCB as crucial for helping developing countries negotiate trade agreements and improve their capacity to benefit from increased trade. The U.S. views Trade Capacity Building (TCB) as crucial for helping developing countries negotiate trade agreements and improve their capacity to benefit from increased trade. Currently, no single agency is responsible for coordinating U.S. government TCB efforts, with USAID typically receiving the most funding for TCB activities. Other agencies involved in TCB include the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), Departments of Agriculture, Labor, and State, and the Trade and Development Agency. The Constitution empowers Congress to set tariffs, which has been partially delegated to the President. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) administers the collection of tariffs at U.S. ports of entry. The United States historically used tariffs as a primary means of collecting government revenue, but now relies on other methods. U.S. Customs and Border Protection collected $32 billion in tariffs in 2016, just 1% of total federal revenue. Over the past 80 years, the U.S. has reduced or eliminated many tariffs through trade negotiations to promote global trade liberalization. Global tariffs had fallen to less than 7% on average by 2012, with the U.S. supporting a rules-based trading system under the GATT and WTO. The United States has historically used tariffs for revenue collection but now relies on other methods. Congress authorized the President to negotiate tariff reductions bilaterally starting in 1934. Global tariffs fell to less than 7% by 2012, with the U.S. supporting a rules-based trading system. The U.S. has the lowest average tariffs among the top five global economies. The Trump Administration has increased tariffs on certain goods from key trading partners. Trade laws include antidumping and countervailing duty laws to address unfair trade practices. The United States uses trade remedies like antidumping and countervailing duty laws to address unfair trade practices, administered by the Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration and the U.S. International Trade Commission. Other trade remedy laws focus on import surges, violations of trade agreements, patent and copyright infringements, and counterfeit goods, all complying with U.S. WTO obligations. The United States uses trade remedies like antidumping and countervailing duty laws to address unfair trade practices, focusing on patent and copyright infringements, and counterfeit goods. These laws must comply with U.S. WTO obligations, including the Antidumping Agreement, Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, and the Agreement on Safeguards. Supporters argue that trade remedies are necessary to protect U.S. industries and workers from unfair competition, while others are concerned about potential inefficiencies in the world trading system. Antidumping is the most frequently used U.S. trade remedy law, targeting unfair trade practices such as dumping. Dumping is an unfair trade practice where exporters sell goods at lower prices in one market to gain market share or deter competition. U.S. law allows for the assessment of antidumping (AD) duties when goods are sold at \"less than fair value\" and cause injury to U.S. industries. AD orders are subject to annual review and sunset review every five years. The U.S. had 354 AD orders in place as of mid-December 2018, with over one-third against China. Countervailing duty (CVD) is another commonly used trade remedy to offset competitive advantages from foreign subsidies. The purpose of the CVD law is to offset injurious competitive advantage that foreign manufacturers might enjoy over U.S. producers due to subsidies. Countervailing duties are designed to offset the foreign subsidy and are levied on imports of subsidized goods into the United States. The U.S. had 113 CVD orders in place as of mid-December 2018, with nearly half against China. Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 authorizes the President to restrict imports causing serious injury to domestic industry through safeguard actions like additional tariffs or quotas. Unlike AD and CVD cases, safeguard actions do not involve allegations of \"unfair\" trade. The President can temporarily restrict imports causing serious injury to domestic industry through safeguard actions, without the need for allegations of unfair trade practices. The ITC conducts investigations based on petitions, and if imports are found to cause substantial injury, recommendations are made to the President for final action. In 2017, two safeguard investigations were initiated, leading to safeguard measures on solar cells and large residential washing machines in 2018. The last safeguard investigation prior to that was in 2001. In January 2018, the President imposed safeguard measures on imports of solar cells and large residential washing machines. The ITC conducted 73 investigations from 1975 to 2001, with 19 cases resulting in safeguard measures. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act allows the President to restrict imports threatening national security after consultation with relevant agencies. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act allows the President to impose tariffs, quotas, or other measures on imports that threaten national security. The Commerce Department consults with relevant agencies and conducts investigations to determine the impact of U.S. imports. In February 2018, steel and aluminum imports were deemed a threat, leading to tariffs being imposed. Currently, investigations are ongoing for uranium, autos, and auto parts. Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 is used to enforce U.S. rights under trade agreements and address unfair barriers to U.S. exports. The Administration is conducting Section 232 investigations on uranium imports, autos, and auto parts. Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 is used to enforce U.S. rights under trade agreements and address unfair barriers to U.S. exports, including intellectual property rights violations. USTR can initiate cases through petitions or self-initiation, seeking negotiated settlements with trading partners. If no resolution is reached, tariffs may be imposed on selected products. The USTR enforces U.S. rights under trade agreements and addresses unfair barriers to exports through Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. If disputes are not resolved, tariffs may be imposed. The USTR also reports annually to Congress on countries with inadequate intellectual property rights protection, with a focus on Priority Foreign Countries. In 2017, an investigation was launched into China's IPR technology policies, leading to findings of discriminatory practices. Since 1974, USTR has initiated 125 Section 301 cases, retaliating in 16 instances. In 2017, a new investigation of China's IPR technology policies was launched. USTR found certain Chinese policies to be unreasonable or discriminatory, leading to increased tariffs on imports from China. China responded with tariffs on U.S. products. Both sides pursued dispute cases at the WTO. In November 2018, USTR reported that China had not fundamentally altered its unfair practices. President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to negotiate structural changes related to IP and technology issues. President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to negotiate \"structural changes\" regarding IP, technology, agriculture, and services within 90 days. China agreed to make significant purchases of U.S. products, while the U.S. suspended planned tariff increases under Section 301. Section 337 of the Tariff Act prohibits unfair competition in importing goods to the U.S., increasingly used for IPR enforcement. Section 337 of the Tariff Act prohibits imports infringing U.S. patents, copyrights, trademarks, and more without proof of injury. The ITC conducts investigations and may issue exclusion orders. Trade Adjustment Assistance programs provide federal aid to workers and firms affected by trade, last reauthorized in 2015. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) programs offer federal aid to workers and firms impacted by trade, authorized by the Trade Act of 1974. TAA for Workers (TAAW) is the main program, providing assistance to workers affected by foreign competition through job loss. Administered by the Department of Labor, it offers benefits like career services, training, and income support. Smaller programs exist for affected firms and farmers. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) programs provide federal aid to workers and firms impacted by trade, with benefits like career services, training, and income support. TAA is justified for economic efficiency, equity, and generating support for international trade. Critics argue that it is costly and may reduce incentives for workers and firms to adjust to increased competition. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) programs aim to help workers and firms affected by trade, providing aid such as career services, training, and income support. Critics argue that TAA is costly and may reduce incentives for adjustment to competition. Despite disagreements, Congress has maintained the program for over five decades. Federal agencies like the Export-Import Bank and the Department of Agriculture support U.S. exports and investments through various finance programs. The Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im Bank), Department of Agriculture, and Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) administer finance programs to help U.S. firms export and invest in developing countries. The BUILD Act of 2018 establishes a new agency for OPIC. U.S. trade financing aims to level the playing field against foreign firms with subsidized financing. The Ex-Im Bank provides loans, guarantees, and insurance to finance U.S. exports to developing economies. The Ex-Im Bank, the official U.S. export credit agency, provides support services for U.S. exports to developing economies. Despite its reauthorization, the Ex-Im Bank has faced operational challenges due to unfilled board positions, limiting approval of export financing above $10 million. Presidential appointments to the board require Senate approval, sparking debates over the role of government in export financing. Congress has authorized the President to control exports for national security, foreign policy, and economic reasons. The United States restricts exports for national security, foreign policy, and economic reasons through various acts and authorities. Export controls aim to balance national security goals with export competitiveness, covering defense items, dual-use goods, nuclear materials, and items related to weapons proliferation. Export controls also restrict trade with sanctioned countries, administered by multiple government departments and requiring various licenses. The Export Control Act (ECA) provides broad authority for the President to implement dual-use export controls, replacing the expired Export Administration Act of 1979. The ECA allows the Department of Commerce to establish controls on the export of \"emerging and foundational technologies\" essential to national security. Dual-use goods have both civilian and military applications, such as nuclear materials and electronics. Exports of dual-use goods and technologies are licensed by the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) based on technical characteristics, destination, end use, and activities of the end user. Foreign direct investment (FDI) involves acquiring real assets like real estate or controlling interest in an enterprise, while foreign portfolio investment (FPI) includes purchasing foreign equities or bonds. FDI can stimulate direct employment. Foreign direct investment (FDI) involves acquiring real assets like real estate or controlling interest in an enterprise from another country. FDI often stimulates direct employment for the host country. Portfolio investments, on the other hand, are highly liquid and can be withdrawn easily. Official capital flows are generated by governments for various purposes. Global trade in goods and services grew significantly from 1990 to 2017, as did gross capital flows, with a pre-crisis peak in 2007. The period saw a significant increase in gross capital flows, reaching $4 trillion annually with a peak of over $12 trillion in 2007. There was also growth in foreign exchange and derivatives markets, impacting the international exchange value of the dollar. Firms invest abroad to boost profits, with multinational corporations investing due to specialized knowledge or managerial abilities. The total daily trading of foreign currencies exceeded $5.1 trillion in 2016. The total daily trading of foreign currencies exceeded $5.1 trillion in 2016. Multinational corporations invest abroad to gain competitive advantages, access low-cost resources, and improve efficiency. Foreign markets allow firms to operate close to customers and access various resources. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) supports global value chains by multinational corporations (MNCs) sourcing production globally. Operating close to foreign customers allows firms to access resources like a well-educated workforce for R&D activities. FDI transactions, including mergers and acquisitions, enhance global competitiveness. The total stock of global outward FDI in 2017 was $31 trillion, with the United States as the largest source and recipient of FDI. Developing Asia accounted for the largest share of global FDI inflows. The United States is the largest source and recipient of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), with significant investments in Europe. FDI to and from the United States has increased rapidly over the past few decades, with the stock of U.S. FDI abroad rising from $238 billion to $6.0 trillion. The largest destinations for U.S. FDI outflows include the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Luxembourg, and Ireland, while the largest sources of FDI inflows include the United Kingdom, Japan, and Canada. The largest sources of U.S. FDI outflows through 2017 were the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Ireland, Canada, Singapore, Australia, Germany, and Japan. Inward FDI in the United States mainly comes from the United Kingdom, Japan, Canada, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, and France and Ireland. U.S. outward FDI is concentrated in high-technology, finance, and services, while inward FDI is primarily in the manufacturing sector, particularly chemicals and transport industries. Economists advocate for unrestricted international capital flows like FDI, as they benefit both home and host economies by enhancing firms' competitive advantages and skills in foreign markets. Direct investment benefits both home and host economies. For the home country, firms investing abroad can exploit competitive advantages, acquire additional skills, and strengthen their competitive position. Inward FDI benefits host countries by adding to the capital stock, bringing technological advances, boosting capital formation, and contributing to a more competitive business environment. FDI also promotes international trade and global economic integration. In 2016, foreign firms in the United States employed 7.1 million workers, exported $369.8 billion in goods, and imported $649.9 billion in goods. Foreign firms investing in the United States play a significant role in trade and global economic integration. In 2016, these firms employed 7.1 million workers, exported $369.8 billion in goods, and imported $649.9 billion in goods. They contributed $894.0 billion in value-added to the U.S. GDP, with higher growth compared to other U.S. firms. Concerns have been raised about U.S. firms investing abroad leading to job losses domestically, but data on this is mostly anecdotal. Most U.S. outward FDI is concentrated in high-income developed countries with similar markets to the U.S. Most U.S. outward foreign direct investment (FDI) is focused on high-income developed countries with similar markets to the U.S. Economists argue that there is no conclusive evidence that U.S. direct investment abroad leads to fewer jobs or lower incomes overall for Americans. International investment agreements (IIAs) establish binding rules on investment protections, as there are no comprehensive multilateral rules on investment. International investment agreements (IIAs) play a crucial role in establishing binding rules on investment protections globally. With over 2,600 IIAs in force, these agreements aim to reduce FDI restrictions, ensure nondiscriminatory treatment of investors, and safeguard a government's right to regulate in the public interest. U.S. IIAs, such as bilateral investment treaties (BITs) and investment chapters in free trade agreements (FTAs), involve reciprocal commitments to protect foreign investors in the United States and U.S. investors in partner countries. The negotiation of U.S. IIAs is conducted by USTR and the State Department. The United States has bilateral investment treaties (BITs) with 40 countries, mainly developing countries. The latest BIT ratified with Rwanda in 2012. BIT negotiations with China and India have stalled. The US also has 14 FTAs covering 20 countries, most including investment chapters. Investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) allows investors to bring claims against host countries for alleged violations before an international arbitration panel. Investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) allows private investors to bring claims against host country governments for alleged violations of investment agreements before an international arbitration panel, such as the ICSID. The number of ISDS cases has increased with global FDI growth, with U.S. investors accounting for about one-fifth of claims worldwide. While successful claims can result in monetary penalties, countries cannot be forced to change their laws. ISDS provisions are included in most U.S. BITs and FTAs, with the majority of cases brought against the U.S. under NAFTA. The use of ISDS has sparked debate in recent U.S. trade negotiations. The U.S. government has not lost an ISDS case yet, with most cases under NAFTA. ISDS is debated in U.S. trade negotiations for investor protections and government regulation. The USMCA would eliminate ISDS with Canada and limit it with Mexico. ISDS was contentious in T-TIP talks, and the EU aims to replace it with an investment court system. Foreign investment, especially by government-owned firms, raises national security concerns. CFIUS is an interagency committee that reviews such investments. The EU has been advocating for an investment court system in place of ISDS in recent trade agreements. CFIUS, established in 1975 and expanded in 2007, oversees foreign investment transactions that could impact U.S. national security. The committee, chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury, conducts risk-based analyses of potential threats posed by foreign investments. The Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007 established CFIUS to review foreign direct investment transactions that could impact homeland security and critical industries. The President has the authority to block proposed transactions, which has been invoked five times since 1988. The Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 expands the scope of transactions subject to review by CFIUS. The Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 (FIRRMA) amends the process for investment reviews under CFIUS, expanding the scope of transactions subject to review. Some have objected to this expansion, citing concerns about an open investment climate. The United States promotes both inward and outward foreign direct investment (FDI). The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) provides services to facilitate U.S. private investments abroad, while the BUILD Act establishes a new U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) to expand and consolidate development finance. The BUILD Act of 2018 establishes the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) to promote U.S. private investments in developing countries and emerging markets. SelectUSA, a Department of Commerce program, coordinates efforts to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) to the United States by providing information and advocating for investments in the U.S."
