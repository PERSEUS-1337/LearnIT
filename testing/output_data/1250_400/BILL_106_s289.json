    "content": "The \"Faith-Based Drug Treatment Enhancement Act\" is cited as the short title. It amends Title V of the Public Health Service Act to include services provided through religious organizations for the prevention and treatment of substance abuse. This new section, Part G, specifies the applicability to designated programs. This part of the Act applies to programs providing Federal financial assistance for substance abuse prevention or treatment. It excludes awards for other purposes. Definitions include 'designated award recipient' and 'designated direct award'. The Act applies to programs offering Federal financial assistance for substance abuse prevention or treatment, excluding awards for other purposes. A 'designated award recipient' is an entity that has received an award under a designated program, either as a direct award from the Federal Government or as a subaward from a non-Federal entity. Financial assistance includes grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, or voucherized assistance. Program beneficiaries are individuals who receive program services. The Act defines terms related to financial assistance for substance abuse programs, including program beneficiaries, participants, services, religious organizations, and voucherized assistance. Voucherized assistance involves selecting and reimbursing program services using a document or authorization. The Act defines financial assistance for substance abuse programs as a system where beneficiaries are given authorization to pay for services, choose a service provider, and have the provider reimbursed by the award recipient. SEC. 582. RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS AS PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS. Religious organizations have the authority to be designated award recipients, make subawards to other entities, provide program services through voucherized assistance, and be service providers under designated programs. The term \"program participant\" includes entities that have received direct awards or subawards, even if they only provide services through voucherized assistance. Religious organizations can participate in designated programs as award recipients, subawarding entities, and service providers through voucherized assistance. The section aims to ensure equal treatment for religious organizations without compromising their religious character or the freedom of program beneficiaries. The Congress acknowledges that social-welfare programs should not discriminate against faith-based service providers or require them to abandon their religious identity to participate in Federal programs. Religious organizations participating in Federal programs are not required to discriminate against faith-based providers or censor their religious expression. They are eligible for program participation on an equal basis with other nonprofit organizations, and the government cannot discriminate against them based on their religious character. Religious organizations in these programs must maintain independence from government control over their religious practices and expressions. Religious organizations in Federal programs can maintain their independence and control over their religious beliefs. They are not required to alter their governance or remove religious symbols. Additionally, they are protected from discrimination in employment based on religion. Religious organizations in Federal programs can require employees to adhere to their religious beliefs and rules on drug/alcohol use. Program beneficiaries can object to religious organizations, but if the organization received a designated direct award, they must arrange for an alternative provider. If a program beneficiary objects to a religious organization in a Federal program, arrangements must be made for the individual to receive program services through an alternative entity. This applies to organizations that received designated direct awards, subawards, or provide services through voucherized assistance. The award recipient operating the voucherized assistance program must ensure that individuals can receive program services from an alternative provider if they object to a religious organization. The alternative entity must provide services of equal value to those offered by the religious organization. Additionally, religious organizations participating in the program cannot discriminate against beneficiaries based on religion, except in certain circumstances. Religious organizations participating in the program cannot discriminate against beneficiaries based on religion. They may require beneficiaries to participate in religious activities and follow religious rules. Additionally, they must be fiscally accountable like other recipients of federal financial assistance. Religious organizations in the program must adhere to fiscal accountability regulations similar to other recipients of federal financial assistance. If the organization keeps federal funds separate from non-federal funds, only the federal funds are subject to audit. Additionally, they have the right to seek judicial review of agency actions for compliance with the regulations. SEC. 583 prohibits the use of funds for sectarian worship or instruction, except for assistance that allows the beneficiary to choose where it is redeemed. SEC. 584 outlines the administration of the program and treatment of funds. SEC. 584 details the administration of the program and treatment of funds, clarifying that financial assistance is aid to the beneficiary, not the organization providing services. It also prohibits state discrimination in the use of funds in religious facilities or by religious organizations. The Congress finds that formal educational qualifications for counselors in drug treatment programs may hinder the effectiveness and provision of services. States must recognize the value of religious education and training for personnel in program services. In applying educational qualifications for personnel in religious organizations, State or local government shall give credit for religious education and training equivalent to secular course work in drug treatment or any other similar subject. State or local government program participants may establish formal educational qualifications for personnel in organizations providing services to reduce drug use among beneficiaries, with exceptions for individual religious organizations upon Secretary's waiver. The Secretary may waive educational qualifications for personnel in religious organizations if the organization has a successful drug treatment record, the qualifications have hindered their participation, they have applied for a waiver, and the government has not proven the necessity of the qualifications."
