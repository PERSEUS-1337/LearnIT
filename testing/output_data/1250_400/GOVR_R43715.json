Airlines rely on private insurance markets for coverage, but after 9/11, the U.S. government expanded the federal Aviation War Risk Insurance Program to ensure coverage for U.S. carriers. The commercial insurance market has since stabilized, and many airlines are now purchasing war risk coverage from private insurers. The federal Aviation War Risk Insurance Program was expanded to guarantee insurance coverage for U.S. air carriers not provided by the commercial market. Private insurers now offer coverage for loss or damage to passengers and aircraft hulls in terrorist attacks, but limited coverage for third-party damage from war or terrorism. Airline insurance costs are a small percentage of total operating costs, with airlines paying around $2.3 billion in 2011, translating to about $60 per flight or $0.80 per passenger. Insurance prices vary based on airline location, size, fleet age, safety record, network spread, and level of risk. The study estimated that airlines paid around $2.3 billion for basic insurance in 2011, averaging $60 per flight or $0.80 per passenger. Insurance prices vary based on factors like airline location, size, safety record, and network spread. The private market for aviation risk insurance is considered adequate, but could change in the event of a major terrorist incident. Commercial insurers provide war risk coverage for most airlines, with availability and lower prices in recent years. A series of airliner losses in 2014, including Malaysia Airlines flight 370, may lead to increases in aviation insurance premiums. The aviation insurance market has been soft in recent years, with ample availability and lower prices. However, a series of losses in 2014, including Malaysia Airlines flights 370 and 17, may lead to increased premiums. Insurers estimate premiums could rise by up to 50%, with war risk insurance potentially tripling. Some officials caution against premature speculation on price rises, as major carriers have not yet renewed their war risk insurance. Losses in 2014 may also impact premiums for \"all-risk\" policies. The potential increase in war risk insurance premiums, possibly tripling, is a concern following insurance losses in 2014. Speculation on price rises is cautioned by some officials as major carriers have not renewed their war risk insurance yet. The impact on premiums for \"all-risk\" policies remains uncertain, with questions on how the commercial market will react and the possibility of private coverage becoming expensive or unavailable, particularly affecting U.S. air carriers flying to EU destinations. EU regulations mandate insurance for aviation-specific liabilities, including war and terrorism risks, for carriers operating within EU territory. EU regulations require aviation-specific liabilities, including war and terrorism risks, to be insured for carriers operating within EU territory. For overflights by non-EU air carriers, insurance against third-party liability is mandatory under EU Regulation 785/2004. The regulation has made war risk insurance mandatory for non-EU carriers operating to and from the EU, even if their home countries do not require it. War risk insurance was historically provided to the merchant fleet during World War I and World War II, but aviation war risk insurance was commercially available before 1951 with worrisome cancellation clauses. Before 1951, aviation war risk insurance was available but with 48-hour cancellation clauses, causing concern for operators during the Korean War airlift. In 1951, a law was passed allowing the Secretary of Commerce to provide war risk insurance for U.S. and foreign-flag aircraft operating in the interest of national defense or economy. Coverage included aircraft, cargo, personal effects, and liabilities, with rates set by the Secretary of Commerce. The Federal Aviation Act of 1958 established a revolving fund within the Treasury for aviation war risk insurance, funded through premiums and recoveries from losses. The program allowed any authorized aviation insurance company to underwrite the insurance, with disputes adjudicated in federal court. Responsibility for the program was later delegated to the FAA under the Department of Transportation in 1966. The aviation war risk insurance fund was continued under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 and later delegated to the FAA in 1966. In 1968, the hijacking of an El Al Boeing 707 in Rome by PFLP marked the start of international terrorism. This was followed by a TWA flight hijacking in 1969 and multiple attempted hijackings in 1970, known as the Dawson's Field hijackings. The PFLP attempted to hijack four airliners on September 6, 1970, successfully hijacking three. The fourth, an El Al Boeing 707, was thwarted by an armed Israeli guard. The hijacked aircraft were taken to Dawson's Field in Jordan, where they were burned. The fate of a Pan Am 747 hijacked on the same day is relevant for discussing insurance coverage for terrorist acts. The hijackers diverted the plane to Beirut and then Cairo, where it was destroyed by an explosive, although all on board escaped. The aircraft was insured under various policies split between FAA and commercial. After hijacking a Pan Am 747, the aircraft was flown to Beirut and then Cairo, where it was destroyed by an explosive. All passengers managed to escape. The commercial insurance industry was shaken by the incident, as they were already hesitant to insure the larger and more costly Boeing 747s. The government expanded federal aviation war risk insurance coverage in response to growing concerns over terrorist hijackings. The FAA expanded federal aviation war risk insurance coverage after Dawson Field hijackings, setting the rate at 20 cents per $100 of insurance. This emergency response to the Middle East crisis was offered on a limited basis. A landmark 1973 court decision ruled that the Pan Am 747 destroyed in Cairo was covered under the airline's standard \"all risk\" policy, not its war risk policies. The court defined \"act of war\" as an operation intended to gain a military advantage, which was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals. The court ruling in a landmark 1973 case determined that Egypt was covered under the airline's standard \"all risk\" policy, not its war risk policies. The definition of \"act of war\" was clarified as an operation intended to gain a military advantage, with the court specifying that combatants must have significant attributes of sovereignty. Insurers offering \"all risk\" policies were held liable for the claim on the destroyed aircraft, as large terrorist organizations did not possess the sovereignty characteristic of war. Prior to the 9/11 attacks, aviation war risk insurance was primarily issued without premiums under indemnification agreements with the Department of Defense. Prior to the 9/11 attacks, aviation war risk insurance was primarily issued without premiums under indemnification agreements with the Department of Defense. Over 99% of war risk insurance issued by FAA in the 1990s was for DOD charter flights, with premium war risk insurance only available for specific foreign policy interests. Premiums soared prior to Operation Desert Storm, leading to flight cancellations to the Middle East. During the first Gulf War in 1990 and 1991, air carriers canceled flights to the Middle East due to soaring war risk insurance rates. Premiums for flights to Israel increased twentyfold, leading to suspensions of flights by Trans World Airlines and Pan Am. Tower Air was the only U.S. carrier to continue flights from Israel under a government-issued war risk policy. FAA did not insure Tower Air's flights from New York to Tel Aviv after Iraqi Scud missiles were fired into Israel. Tower Air operated flights from Israel under a government-issued war risk policy. FAA did not insure their flights from New York to Tel Aviv after Iraqi Scud missiles were fired into Israel. In response to 9/11, commercial insurers canceled war risk coverage for airlines, leading to the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act of 2001. This act expanded coverage to include acts of terrorism. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 extended the program, which has been extended multiple times, most recently in 2014. The current program authority expires in September 2014. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 expanded coverage to include acts of terrorism and extended the program through December 31, 2003. It has been extended several times, most recently in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014. The program authority under that act expires September 30, 2014. The scope of policies issued under the federal program was expanded to include coverage for losses or injuries to aircraft hulls, passengers, and crew. Rates were set to match commercial rates in force on the date of enactment on November 25, 2002. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program, established by P.L. 107-296, set liability limits for airlines and capped rates to match commercial rates in force on November 25, 2002. The program also ensured coverage for terrorism damage and created a broader reinsurance program under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA, P.L. 107-297). The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA) created a reinsurance program for terrorism losses in the insurance market, including coverage for airlines. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program provides coverage to U.S. air carriers, with total maximum per occurrence coverage of $68 billion. Premiums collected totaled $163 million in FY2013. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program provides coverage to U.S. air carriers, with total maximum per occurrence coverage of $68 billion. Premiums collected totaled $163 million in FY2013. Insurance coverage ranges from $100 million to $4 billion per carrier, with the average falling between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion. FAA reports a balance of approximately $2.2 billion in the Aviation Insurance Revolving Fund as of July 31, 2014. 17 U.S. air carriers cancelled their FAA war risk insurance policies between April 2014 and August 2014. Currently, FAA insures 27 air carriers estimated to cover approximately 4% of total RPMs flown by U.S. airlines. Total maximum per occurrence exposure of all premium insurance currently in force is $31 billion, a 55% reduction from January 2014. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program provides coverage to U.S. air carriers with a total maximum per occurrence exposure of $31 billion, a 55% reduction from January 2014. FAA estimates premium collections to be $18 million in FY2015, with coverage including hull insurance, comprehensive liability insurance, and third-party war risk liability. The program reimburses 100% of losses with no deductibles or coinsurance, covering risks beyond war or terrorist attacks. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program covers hull insurance, comprehensive liability insurance, and third-party war risk liability. The term \"war risk occurrence\" includes various risks such as war, invasion, acts of foreign enemies, civil war, rebellion, strikes, riots, acts of sabotage, vandalism, confiscation, and nationalization. Payments for ransom or extortion demands are not covered under this policy. The policy does not cover payments for ransom or extortion demands. It also excludes malicious acts, confiscation by foreign governments, hijacking, and the discharge of weapons or explosives on the aircraft. The policy excludes coverage for hijacking, unlawful seizure, and detonation of weapons on the aircraft. The FAA Premium War Risk Insurance Program has limited premiums and has paid over $10 million for losses since the 9/11 attacks. The FAA FY2014 budget justification links four civilian positions to the aviation war risk revolving fund. Claims under the FAA Premium War Risk Insurance Program have totaled over $10 million since 9/11. Specific incidents include the attempted bombing of Northwest Airlines Flight 253 in 2009, the seizure of a SkyWest aircraft in 2012 resulting in $9.6 million in claims, and damage to the center wing box in 2014 totaling $256,890. The incident in Colorado involved a pilot who taxied an aircraft through airport fencing, damaging the terminal building and parked cars before taking his own life. This resulted in a total loss of the aircraft, damage to airport facilities, and personal vehicles, with claims paid totaling $9.6 million. In April 2014, the FAA paid claims for repair of damage to a Boeing 767-223 aircraft allegedly caused by gunfire over Afghanistan in 2012. The Secretary of Transportation proposed legislative reforms to the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program, including providing war risk coverage for airline losses involving NBCR weapons and full aviation war risk coverage for 90 days in the event of widespread coverage cancellation. The FAA proposed changes to the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program, including providing war risk coverage for losses involving NBCR weapons and full aviation war risk coverage for 90 days in case of widespread cancellation by private insurers. The President's FY2014 budget also suggested cooperation with commercial insurers to establish a shared-risk model for aviation war risk coverage. The FAA proposed a shared-risk model with commercial insurers for aviation war risk coverage, aiming for commercial insurers to take on 80% of the risk by FY2018. The airline industry has opposed changes, citing concerns about cost and inadequate insurance protection. A4A opposes ending the War Risk Insurance program, citing economic viability concerns for the airline industry. The Secretary of Transportation's proposal argues against extending the program due to budgetary costs. Two approaches to reducing costs from government insurance programs are increasing funds or reducing expenses. The current Administration proposal aims to reduce budgetary costs of over $1 billion over 10 years by either increasing premiums or reducing risk assumed in government insurance programs. Raising the statutory cap on premiums could potentially eliminate implicit subsidies and increase funds coming into the program. Raising the statutory cap on premiums could potentially increase funds coming into the program and eliminate implicit subsidies. Premiums received by insurers are typically invested in U.S. Treasury securities, but private insurers invest in instruments with higher returns. Private insurers invest in a wide range of instruments with higher returns compared to U.S. Treasury securities. In 2013, private property/casualty insurers earned approximately $67.6 billion on $1.48 trillion in cash and investments. If the Aviation Insurance Revolving Fund had similar investments, it could have earned around $91 million instead of $26 million. Private insurance policies involve risk-sharing mechanisms like deductibles and co-insurance to discourage behavior that may lead to losses. The government offers aviation insurance coverage with no deductibles or co-insurance since 2002, covering losses up to maximum limits. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program also covers non-war risks like vandalism and labor disturbances. Placing more risk on airlines could lead to significant budgetary savings, similar to risk-sharing practices in private insurance. The government's Aviation War Risk Insurance Program covers non-war risks like vandalism and labor disturbances. Placing more risk on airlines could result in significant budgetary savings, similar to risk-sharing practices in private insurance. Insurers often share risks among multiple parties to spread the financial risk of future losses. The sharing of financial risk through reinsurance or other loss-sharing arrangements allows parties with different expertise or capacity to benefit. For example, insurers may collaborate to leverage expertise in risk assessment and financial capital. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act utilizes a program structure combining loss sharing based on the level of loss and a percentage of the loss, with government coverage starting at 20% of an insurer's premiums and increasing to 85%. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act established a program with loss sharing based on the level of loss and a percentage of the loss. Government coverage starts at 20% of an insurer's premiums and increases to 85%. The program was intended to expire quickly, but has been reauthorized with a gradual decrease in government share of losses. Improved international guidance for risk decisions in conflict zones could stabilize private market war risk insurance. Increased interest in threat information dissemination and risk-based decisions for civilian flights in high-risk regions followed the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight 17 in 2014. Insurance underwriters are considering withdrawing coverage for flights in conflict zones due to concerns about inconsistent risk assessment by airlines. The International Civil Aviation Organization is involved in discussions on disseminating threat information for civilian flight operations in high-risk regions. Airlines flew over Iraqi airspace until FAA restrictions in August 2014. Concerns arise over flying over conflict zones after Malaysia Airlines crash. ICAO task force formed to assess conflict zone risks for civilian aircraft. Countries responsible for air traffic services in conflict zones should identify risks and establish safety procedures. Some countries do not share conflict risk information or take necessary precautions, impacting travel and tourism. Countries may not always share conflict risk information or take necessary precautions to mitigate risks to civil aviation. This reluctance could be due to the significant impacts on travel and tourism that restricting flights may cause. Disparate views on risk and precautions exist among regulators, airlines, and insurers, leading to varying practices in issuing warnings or restrictions on flight operations. In a specific instance in July 2014, FAA imposed restrictions on flights to and from Israel during an armed conflict, prompting international air carriers to suspend service. Israeli authorities eventually convinced airlines to resume flights by arguing that risks to civil aircraft had been adequately mitigated. The explosion near Ben Gurion Airport led to foreign airlines suspending service to Israel, prompting Israeli authorities to request resumption of flights. Governments may hesitate to issue warnings affecting travel, contrasting with cautious approaches post-Malaysia Airlines incident. Improved conflict zone hazard assessment and flight restrictions could reduce uncertainties in risk evaluation. EU Regulation 785/2004 mandates insurance for air carriers' liability towards passengers, baggage, and third parties. EU Regulation 785/2004 requires air carriers and aircraft operators to have insurance coverage for aviation-specific liability, including passenger, baggage, cargo, and third-party risks. The minimum insurance coverage for passenger liability is 250,000 SDRs ($378,523) per passenger, higher than the Montreal Convention requirement. Non-commercial aircraft operations with a MTOM of 2,700 kg have a lower minimum of 100,000 SDRs ($151,409) per passenger. Baggage liability requires 1,131 SDRs ($1,712) per passenger, and cargo liability requires 19 SDRs ($29) per kilogram in commercial operations. EU Regulation 785/2004 mandates insurance coverage for aviation-specific liability, including passenger, baggage, cargo, and third-party risks. The minimum coverage for passenger liability is 250,000 SDRs ($378,523) per passenger, higher than the Montreal Convention requirement. For non-commercial aircraft operations with a MTOM of 2,700 kg, the minimum is 100,000 SDRs ($151,409) per passenger. Baggage liability requires 1,131 SDRs ($1,712) per passenger, and cargo liability requires 19 SDRs ($29) per kilogram in commercial operations. Sanctions for non-compliance are effective, proportional, and dissuasive, including license withdrawal for EU carriers and landing refusal for non-EU carriers. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program is similar to the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program created after 9/11 to provide federal coverage for losses from terrorist attacks when private insurance was expensive or unavailable. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (TRIA) was created to provide federal coverage for losses from terrorist attacks when private insurance was expensive or unavailable in the aviation insurance market. Insurers were hesitant to cover terrorism risk, leading to the reauthorization of the program multiple times. The current version of the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program differs from TRIA as it provides government reinsurance for private insurers offering specific lines of commercial coverage. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (TRIA) provides government reinsurance for private insurers offering specific lines of commercial coverage, unlike the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program. TRIA does not directly cover businesses at risk of terrorism losses but reimburses private insurers for losses under certain conditions. There are no upfront premiums for TRIA coverage, and any losses are paid from the government's general fund with a post-event recoupment fee on commercial insurance policies. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (TRIA) provides government reinsurance for private insurers offering specific lines of commercial coverage. There are no upfront premiums for TRIA coverage, and any losses are paid from the government's general fund with a post-event recoupment fee on commercial insurance policies. TRIA coverage is more limited than federal aviation war risk insurance, operating through private insurers with limits and deductibles applying from private insurance policies. Before federal funds flow under TRIA, a minimum of $100 million in insured losses must occur due to a terrorist act, with narrower certified acts compared to aviation war risk insurance. There are no federal limits on the cost of terrorism coverage under TRIA. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (TRIA) requires a minimum of $100 million in insured losses from a terrorist act to trigger coverage. Private insurers must offer terrorism coverage on the same terms as other causes of loss, but can charge a separate premium. State laws may limit terrorism premiums."
