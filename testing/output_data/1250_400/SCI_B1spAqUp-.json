It can replace deconvolutional layers in a plug-and-play manner, overcoming efficiency issues through implementation tricks. Deconvolutional layers are widely used in deep models for applications such as semantic segmentation and generative models. Deconvolutional operations involve up-sampling output feature maps by shuffling intermediate feature maps obtained through convolutional operations. This process can be decomposed into multiple convolutional operations based on the up-sampling factor. The intermediate feature maps are generated independently by convolutional kernels, with no direct relationship between them. The deconvolution process involves shuffling and combining intermediate feature maps generated by convolutional kernels.
