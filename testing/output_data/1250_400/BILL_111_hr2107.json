    "content": "The \"Cord Blood Education and Awareness Act of 2009\" includes sections on findings, public education campaign, patient informed consent, duty of professionals to disclose information to pregnant patients, professional education, targeted education grants, and authorization of appropriations. Congress finds that leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma are responsible for a significant number of deaths in the United States, especially among children and young adults. Approximately 16,000 leukemia patients annually require a bone marrow transplant but lack a suitable match. Cord blood cells have been successfully used in treating these conditions, with over 14,000 transplants performed globally in the last 20 years. Cord blood cells have been effectively used in treating various blood diseases, including leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma. They have been used in over 14,000 transplants worldwide in the last 20 years, showing lower rates of graft versus host disease compared to bone marrow. Researchers have found that cord blood cells contain different types of stem cells, making them valuable for treating nonmalignant blood, immune, and metabolic disorders. Cord blood cells have shown promise in treating various diseases and disorders, including blood diseases, diabetes, brain injury, and hearing loss. They are pluripotent and can differentiate into different cell types. Despite their potential, over 90 percent of cord blood cells are discarded as medical waste in the US each year. Cord blood cells have shown promise in treating various conditions like hearing loss, renal failure, spinal cord injury, and heart valve defects. Over 90 percent of cord blood cells in the US are discarded annually. Only a few states mandate information on cord blood banking for expectant parents. The Institute of Medicine recommended clear information and informed consent for cord blood banking. The public education campaign aims to increase awareness about cord blood banking and its potential benefits for treating various conditions. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will develop a publication on umbilical cord blood within a year of the Act, explaining its uses, differences between autologous and allogeneic use, public vs private banking, and options for mothers regarding stem cells. The publication on umbilical cord blood will explain the differences between public and private banking, options for mothers, medical processes for collection, and criteria impacting usage. The publication on umbilical cord blood covers the differences between public and private banking, medical processes for collection, family history criteria, ownership options, and costs of banking. It also includes information on public and private cord blood banks, including accredited private banks and availability of free family banking. The curr_chunk provides a list of public and accredited private cord blood banks in the United States, along with information on free family banking and sibling donor programs. It also explains the specific racial and ethnic groups in need of publicly donated cord blood samples based on medical data. The Secretary will develop a patient informed consent document regarding cord blood disposition to be signed by expectant women before delivery. The document will include information on cord blood banking options, the medical value of cord blood stem cells, and a declaration of the chosen option. Certain professionals are required to disclose information and obtain informed consent from pregnant patients. Effective 1 year after enactment, healthcare professionals must provide pregnant women with information on umbilical cord blood banking options before the third trimester. Written consent must be obtained or documented before the woman's estimated delivery date. Medicaid regulations will be amended to accommodate these requirements. Effective 1 year after enactment, healthcare professionals must provide pregnant women with information on cord blood stem cell disposition options before the third trimester. Written consent must be obtained or documented before the woman's estimated delivery date. Medicaid regulations will be amended to enforce compliance with these requirements. Healthcare providers offering ambulatory prenatal care to pregnant women must comply with informing them about cord blood banking options. Non-compliance by states may result in payment reductions under Medicaid and CHIP programs. Healthcare providers must inform pregnant women about cord blood banking options to comply with regulations. This requirement applies to group health plans and insurance issuers providing prenatal care benefits. Compliance is necessary to avoid payment reductions under Medicaid and CHIP programs. Insurance issuers offering group health insurance coverage must ensure that physicians providing ambulatory prenatal care to pregnant women comply with regulations. The amendments made by this subsection apply to agreements and arrangements entered into or renewed on or after the enactment of this Act. The Secretary will develop professional educational materials on umbilical cord blood stem cells for health care providers offering prenatal services. Grants may be provided for targeted education on cord blood stem cells to various groups, including health care providers, ethnic minorities, families with genetic diseases, and populations affected by conditions treated with cord blood stem cells. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorization of appropriations totaling $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2010 and $5,000,000 annually from 2011 to 2014 is provided to carry out the Act."
