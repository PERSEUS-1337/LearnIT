    "content": "The \"Facilitating Access to Speedy Transmissions for Networks, E-commerce and Telecommunications (FASTNET) Act\" is the short title of the legislation. The purpose of the Act is to facilitate access to speedy transmissions for networks, e-commerce, and telecommunications. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 aimed to promote competition and reduce regulation in telecommunications markets to deploy advanced technologies nationwide. It recognized the unique position of local exchange carriers with fewer than two percent of the Nation's subscriber lines, enabling them to accelerate the deployment of advanced services in less densely populated regions. Existing regulations tailored to larger carriers often burden these smaller carriers, hindering their deployment of advanced telecommunications services. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 aimed to reduce regulatory burdens on carriers with less than two percent of the Nation's subscriber lines, enabling them to deploy advanced services in less densely populated regions. Reducing regulations on these carriers will allow them to allocate more resources to benefit consumers in these areas by accelerating the deployment of advanced services and competitive initiatives. The Act aims to accelerate the deployment of advanced services and promote competition in the telecommunications industry for the benefit of consumers nationwide. It reduces regulatory burdens on local exchange carriers with less than two percent of the Nation's subscriber lines, allowing them to redirect resources towards investing in initiatives and improving flexibility. The Communications Act of 1934 is amended to define a 'two percent carrier' as an incumbent local exchange carrier with fewer than two percent of the Nation's subscriber lines. Regulatory relief is provided for these carriers through reduced regulatory requirements in a new part IV of the Act. The Commission must consider the impact of regulatory requirements on two percent carriers when adopting rules for incumbent local exchange carriers. If the Commission fails to do so, the rule cannot be enforced on two percent carriers until a separate evaluation is conducted. No additional review is needed if the rules do not apply to two percent carriers or if they are exempted. Size-based differentiation among carriers is not prohibited by this section. The Commission is not required to conduct a separate evaluation if rules do not apply to two percent carriers or if they are exempted. Differentiation based on carrier size is allowed. These provisions apply to rules adopted after the enactment of this section. SEC. 282 limits reporting requirements for two percent carriers, exempting them from filing cost allocation manuals or ARMIS reports, except for section 224. The Commission can still access information under specific sections. The Commission will not require two percent carriers to establish separate affiliates for various services, nor maintain separate personnel, facilities, or operations. Additionally, two percent carriers are exempt from participating in tariff pools and price cap regulation. The Commission allows two percent carriers to participate or withdraw from common line tariffs administered by NECA for specific study areas without obligation for others. Carriers can also choose price cap rate regulation for certain study areas, with elections binding for one year. The Commission permits two percent carriers to opt in or out of common line tariffs for specific study areas without being obligated for others. Carriers can also select price cap rate regulation for certain study areas, with elections binding for one year. The Commission allows two percent carriers to introduce new interstate telecommunications services with only one day's notice, without needing approval for the rate structure. This expands service options for ratepayers. Additionally, competing carriers can enter the market under specific regulations. Two percent carriers can adjust their interstate rates with minimal notice and file contract-based tariffs immediately upon certification of competition in their service area. This allows for streamlined pricing regulation and encourages facilities-based entry by other carriers. Upon certification of competition in their service area, two percent carriers can adjust interstate rates with minimal notice and file contract-based tariffs immediately. This streamlined pricing regulation encourages facilities-based entry by other carriers. The Commission will regulate the two percent carrier as non-dominant if a local exchange carrier or its affiliate, or a local exchange carrier owned by a governmental authority, is engaged in facilities-based entry within the two percent carrier's service area. The two percent carrier meeting certain requirements can participate in the common line tariff administered by the National Exchange Carrier Association. The section defines \"facilities-based entry\" as providing local telephone exchange switching and service to at least one unaffiliated customer. It also defines \"contract-based tariff\" as a tariff based on a service contract with terms, service descriptions, and volume commitments. The contract-based tariff must include the contract term, service descriptions, volume commitments, prices, volume discounts, and other relevant regulations. The term \"service area\" has the same meaning as in section 214(e)(5). SEC. 287. SAVINGS PROVISIONS: Commission retains authority under sections 201-208. Rural telephone companies' rights preserved. States' authority over intrastate communications unaffected. SEC. 5. LIMITATION ON MERGER REVIEW. Amendment to the Communications Act of 1934 sets a deadline for the Commission to make public interest determinations regarding mergers or acquisitions involving two percent carriers. If no action is taken within 60 days of the application submission, the application is deemed approved. The Commission must approve or deny applications for mergers or acquisitions involving two percent carriers within a specified period. If no action is taken, the application is deemed approved without conditions. Two percent carriers can elect to make decisions regarding local exchange facilities acquired through mergers or acquisitions. Effective immediately for new applications, existing applications will be subject to these requirements as if filed on the enactment date. SEC. 6. TIME LIMITS FOR ACTION ON PETITIONS FOR RECONSIDERATION OR WAIVER. Section 405 of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended to include expedited action requirements. The Commission must issue an order granting or denying petitions within 90 days. Failure to act within this period results in relief being deemed granted or enforcement of a rule being stayed. The Commission must issue a final order on petitions within 90 days, failure to do so results in relief being granted or enforcement of a rule being stayed. This provision applies to petitions submitted after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 7. NATIONAL SECURITY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT EXCEPTIONS.\n\nExceptions to the 60-day and 90-day time periods for petitions or applications under sections 310 and 405 of the Communications Act of 1934 if national security, law enforcement, or public safety concerns are raised by Executive Branch agencies like the Department of Defense or Department of Justice."
