The paper introduces a unified architecture based on RNN to improve solar forecasting techniques. It discusses the shortcomings of current forecasting approaches and presents a novel algorithm to bridge the gap. Different forecasting methods for renewable generation and electric load prediction are classified into five categories, including regressive methods and artificial intelligence techniques. Prediction methods can be classified into five categories: regressive methods like AR, ARIMA, and ES models, AI techniques such as ANN and k-nearest neighbors, NWP, sensing, and hybrid models like neuro-fuzzy systems. NWP models are based on physical laws but have limitations in predicting cloud fields accurately due to coarse spatial resolution. NWP models have limitations in predicting cloud fields accurately due to coarse spatial resolution and temporal-resolution. To improve accuracy, regional NWP models are downscaled for site-specific forecasts. Satellite-based irradiance measurement is useful in areas without ground-based measurements, analyzing air mass evolution through radiometer recordings. Satellite-based irradiance measurement is a useful tool where ground-based measurements are unavailable. The limitations of satellite sensing include the need for accurate data under clear sky and dense cloud conditions, as well as reliance on empirical or statistical algorithms for solar irradiance forecasting. Ground-based solar data is still required for these satellite statistical algorithms.
