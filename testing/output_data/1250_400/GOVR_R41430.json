    "content": "Inland waterways, managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, cover 38 states and handle half of all inland waterway freight. The Corps funds maintenance and construction through appropriations and user fees. Maintenance on the Inland Waterway System is fully funded by the Corps, while new construction costs are shared equally. The Corps and commercial industry share costs for new construction and major rehabilitation on inland waterways. Congress is considering proposals for future financing due to current revenue sources being insufficient. This shortfall limits construction projects, requiring changes to the financing system. The ongoing shortfall in funding for inland waterway construction projects is limiting new developments. Recent proposals suggest changes to the financing system, including increasing fuel taxes and federal shares. Inland waterways have been crucial for commerce since before the nation's founding, with federal support starting in the early 1800s. Inland waterways have been important for commerce since the early 1800s, with federal support increasing after the Supreme Court granted authority over interstate commerce in 1824. While other forms of transportation have reduced reliance on waterways, they still account for 4%-5% of total commercial tonnage shipped annually. In some regions, especially for bulk goods over long distances, waterways remain a significant transportation route, particularly for grain and oilseed exports. In some regions, inland waterways remain important for transporting bulk goods over long distances, including grain, oilseed, coal, petroleum, chemicals, and metals. Despite projections for increased traffic, actual inland waterway traffic has remained relatively flat over the past 20 years. Overall freight tonnage is expected to double in the next 25 years, with inland waterway traffic projected to increase at a slower rate compared to rail and highway shipping. The Department of Transportation projects a 1.2% increase in overall freight tonnage from 1997 to 2007, with inland waterway traffic expected to grow at a slower rate compared to rail and highway shipping. The federal government invests in inland waterways due to their value to the nation, with investments dating back to the early 1800s and funding provided through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Legislation in the 1970s and 1980s introduced user cost-sharing requirements for some of these costs. In the early 1800s, federal investment in inland waterways was fully funded by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Legislation in the 1970s and 1980s introduced user cost-sharing requirements for some costs, with the Inland Waterways Revenue Act of 1978 and the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 establishing a fuel tax on commercial barges and cost-share requirements for projects. This shifted financial responsibility to commercial operators on the inland waterway system. The acts of 1978 and 1986 established a fuel tax on commercial barges, cost-share requirements for inland waterway projects, and a trust fund to hold revenues for construction investments. Commercial operators on the inland waterway system gained greater financial and decision-making responsibility. The Inland Waterways Revenue Act of 1978 codified the federal policy of taxing fuel on commercial barge traffic and established the Inland Waterways Trust Fund (IWTF). The IWTF was funded by a fuel tax, gradually increasing to $0.10 per gallon in FY1986. WRDA 1986 authorized additional fuel tax increases, rising to $0.20 per gallon in 1994, and laid out a cost-sharing process for inland waterway projects. WRDA 1986 authorized additional fuel tax increases, reaching $0.20 per gallon in 1994. It established a 50/50 cost-sharing process for inland waterway projects, with construction funded by IWTF and Treasury's GR fund. O&M costs remained a federal responsibility. Projects funded by IWTF required congressional authorization and annual appropriations. The WRDA 1986 authorized projects funded by the IWTF with 100% federal funding for inland waterway costs, excluding construction and major maintenance. It also established the Inland Waterways Users Board (IWUB) as a federal advisory committee with 11 members. The Inland Waterways Users Board (IWUB) was established by WRDA 1986 as a federal advisory committee with 11 members representing shipping interests on inland waterways. The board meets regularly to make recommendations to the Secretary of the Army and Congress regarding investments in IWTF projects. The IWTF balance has varied significantly between 1986 and 2011, with proposals to increase fees on the user industry to fund operations. Between 1986 and 2011, the IWTF balance fluctuated, peaking at $413 million in 2002. The executive branch proposed fee increases in 1996 and 2004, but Congress did not enact them. From FY2005, appropriations for IWTF-funded projects rose significantly, surpassing fuel tax collections and interest on the balance. Some projects exceeded cost estimates, leading to a sharp decline in balances from 2005 to 2010. Congress implemented \"stopgap\" measures to prevent unsustainable levels. Between 2005 and 2010, the IWTF balance fell sharply due to projects exceeding cost estimates. Congress implemented \"stopgap\" measures to prevent unsustainable levels, such as exempting major rehabilitation projects from cost-sharing requirements and limiting access to the IWTF for certain projects. Additionally, Congress provided over $400 million in construction funding for inland waterway projects under the ARRA, exempting this funding from IWTF cost-share requirements. More recent measures include prohibiting new contracts requiring IWTF funding since FY2009 and limiting appropriations from the IWTF to expected fuel tax revenues for the coming year. The IWTF balance stabilized due to stopgap measures by Congress, limiting new contracts requiring IWTF funding since FY2009. Funding for new projects is expected to be limited, with most going to the Olmsted Locks and Dam project on the Ohio River. Concerns have been raised about structural inefficiencies and inequities in the Corps project planning process. Inland Waterway Financing Proposals and other concerns have been raised regarding structural inefficiencies and inequities in the Corps project planning process for inland waterways investments. Reforms were implemented in FY2006 to address some of these concerns, but additional structural reforms are still being advocated for by many, particularly in relation to cost overruns and project planning issues at the Olmsted Locks and Dam. Many advocate for structural reforms in the planning process of inland waterways projects, citing cost overruns and project planning issues at the Olmsted Locks and Dam project. The estimated cost for the Olmsted project has significantly increased over time, with completion expected in 2020 and 2024. Concerns about the solvency of the Inland Waterways Trust Fund and the equity of the financing system have led to various proposals for reform. As of January 1, 2013, the project was 49% complete with lock components finished. The dam and demolition components are scheduled for completion in 2020 and 2024. Recent proposals aim to address concerns about the Inland Waterways Trust Fund's solvency and financing system equity, with differing recommendations from the Administration and user industry. Past administrations have also proposed increasing commercial user fees on inland waterways. The Bush Administration proposed a lock usage fee to replace the fuel tax for inland waterways in 2008. The fee would have phased in charges for commercial barges and tied IWTF balances to user fees after 2012. This approach aimed to improve equity in waterborne commerce investments. The Bush Administration proposed a lock usage fee in 2008 to replace the fuel tax for inland waterways. The fee would adjust based on IWTF balances, raising fees when the balance fell below $25 million and lowering fees when it rose above $75 million. The House and Senate appropriations committees rejected this approach, citing it as burdensome for lock users. The Obama Administration also proposed new user fees for inland waterways, with the FY2010 budget including a similar proposal to the Bush Administration's, with the option to increase fees at high-traffic locks for increased efficiency. The FY2010 budget included a proposal for new user fees for inland waterways, similar to the Bush Administration's proposal. The Obama Administration continued to propose user fees to replace or supplement the fuel tax, but Congress generally rejected these proposals. Recent budgets assumed new revenues from an unspecified inland waterway user fee, but none of these proposals have been enacted. The Obama Administration proposed a new inland waterway financing structure in the FY2013 and FY2014 budgets, including a two-tier annual fee for commercial shippers. The proposal aimed to maintain the existing fuel tax and implement a new fee set by the Corps to achieve revenue targets. Shippers using locks would pay a higher fee under this structure. The Administration did not specify the fee amount but outlined revenue targets in its proposed legislation. The Obama Administration proposed a new inland waterway financing structure in the FY2013 and FY2014 budgets, including a two-tier annual fee for commercial shippers. Shippers using locks would pay a higher fee under this structure, with revenue targets set by the Corps. The proposal aimed to generate approximately $1 billion in additional revenues for the IWTF over 10 years. Additionally, the proposal included the addition of 39 new segments to the existing inland waterway system, but faced opposition from the user industry. The Inland Waterways Users Board (IWUB) proposed a new financing structure in response to the Obama Administration's budget proposals. The IWUB report, although not formally endorsed by the Corps or the Administration, has been introduced as legislation in Congress. Many of its recommendations have been opposed by the Obama Administration. The IWUB report recommended increasing user fees, the federal share of inland waterway costs, overall spending on inland waterways, and increasing IWUB involvement in projects. These recommendations have been introduced as legislation in Congress but have been opposed by the Obama Administration. The IWUB report recommends increasing user fees, federal share of inland waterway costs, and overall spending on inland waterways. It also suggests increasing IWUB involvement in project planning and construction, along with proposing an increase in the inland waterway fuel tax rate to generate more revenue for the IWTF. The IWUB report proposes increasing the fuel tax rate to generate more revenue for the IWTF, projecting approximately $112 million per year. The report also recommends shifting more costs for inland waterway projects to the federal government and exempting certain expenses from cost-sharing requirements. The IWUB report recommends exempting certain dam-related expenses and rehabilitation projects from cost-sharing requirements under WRDA 1986. It also proposes establishing a cap on IWTF funds to discourage construction cost overruns, potentially increasing the federal share for new investments to around 70%. Additionally, the report suggests increasing funding for inland waterways from both the IWTF and the General Revenue fund. The IWUB report proposes an overall increase in funding for inland waterways, with full funding requiring annual expenditures averaging approximately $380 million, a significant increase over historical averages. Most of the increase needed would come from the General Revenue fund in the immediate future. Federal funding would need to be $1.33 billion over the first five years to meet the IWUB proposal's requirements. The IWUB report proposes increased funding for inland waterways, with most of the initial increase coming from the General Revenue fund. Federal funding of $1.33 billion over the first five years is needed to meet the proposal's requirements. The report suggests reforms to improve cost-effectiveness and recommends greater involvement of the IWUB in overseeing Corps projects. The report proposes reforms to increase IWUB involvement in Corps projects for cost-effective IWTF investments. Recommendations include appointing IWUB representatives to project design teams, obtaining sign-off on project plans, and providing status updates. Concerns about conflicts of interest and federal control are raised. Specific projects are prioritized for funding once changes to the financing system are implemented. The IWUB report proposes reforms to increase involvement in Corps projects for cost-effective IWTF investments. Specific projects are prioritized for funding based on various factors, but final decisions still require approval from Congress or the Corps. The report recommends the Corps establish selection criteria similar to those used in the report to improve project selection. The proposal suggests criteria for selecting inland waterway projects to increase project likelihood. Advocates propose shifting costs from the federal government to users to address spending inequalities. Congressional Budget Office analysis in the 1990s found the current tax system distorts operational costs, recommending a user fee structure for economic efficiency. The Congressional Budget Office found that the current tax system distorts operational costs of maintaining the inland waterway system. They recommended a user fee structure to recover true costs and increase economic efficiency. Various proposals have been made to increase user contributions for inland waterway expenditures, with estimated savings of $1 billion over the next five years. The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform also suggested making the inland waterways \"self-funding.\" The 2011 \"Green Scissors\" report and other organizations proposed increasing user fees for inland waterways to save $1 billion over five years. The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform suggested making the waterways \"self-funding\" for $500 million in savings. The CBO recommended raising user fees to cover costs, projecting $4 billion in savings over 10 years. These proposals aim to shift more financial responsibility to users without specifying fee structures. The 1992 CBO report suggested various forms of user fees to better reflect the cost of operating inland waterways, such as annual licensing fees, congestion pricing, tolls, and lockage fees. Different proposals aim to address issues with the current financing system by proposing new investment levels and revenue sources. Congress faces questions on the level of investment needed for inland waterways, potential changes to the fuel tax, and cost-share arrangements for projects. Changes to inland waterways financing were enacted in the 113th Congress through the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014. The Act made limited changes, including authorizing project delivery recommendations, shifting responsibility for certain rehabilitation costs to the federal government, and reducing the cost-sharing requirement for the Olmsted Locks and Dam Project. The Act did not alter the inland waterways fuel tax but aimed to provide more information about policy options. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 reduced the cost-sharing requirement for the Olmsted Locks and Dam Project from 50% to 15% from the Inland Waterways Trust Fund (IWTF), allowing for more funding from the General Fund. Efforts were also authorized to study revenue collection efficiency, potential use of bonds or new fees for IWTF financing, and convening a stakeholder roundtable to evaluate inland waterways alternatives. The House Appropriations Committee funded the Olmsted Project at the 15% cost-share level, freeing up funds for other inland waterways projects for the first time in five years. The WRRDA reduced cost-sharing for the Olmsted Project to 15% from the IWTF, allowing more funding for other inland waterways projects. Observers believe these changes may not be enough to finance all needed upgrades long-term. Legislation like H.R. 1149 (WAVE4 Act) proposes fuel tax increases and alterations to cost-sharing to address IWTF solvency. The WAVE4 Act and RIVER Act propose fuel tax increases and alterations to cost-sharing for infrastructure investments on federal waterways. The bills would make the federal government responsible for dam construction and rehabilitation costs. Commercial users argue for additional investment due to aging infrastructure and the need for expanded capacity. Congress is considering infrastructure investments on federal waterways, with commercial users advocating for increased funding due to aging infrastructure and capacity needs. However, taxpayer and environmental groups oppose additional federal funding, arguing that the benefits are overstated. Despite disagreements, most agree that the current financing system is inadequate for future needs. The Corps is expected to have limited appropriations for ongoing lock replacement projects. Despite disagreements, most agree that the current financing system for inland waterways is inadequate for future needs. The Corps is expected to have limited appropriations for ongoing lock replacement projects, with the majority of locks in the United States now past their intended design age of 50 years. Aging infrastructure has led to a decline in efficiency, resulting in increased lock unavailability in recent years. The Corps of Engineers notes that most locks in the United States are past their intended design age of 50 years, leading to increased lock unavailability. Some advocate for new lock construction and expanded capacity, while others argue against significant new investments, favoring maintenance to extend the life of existing locks. They believe that the costs of new lock construction outweigh the benefits and suggest small-scale improvements instead. Some groups argue that the costs of new lock construction exceed the benefits, advocating for small-scale improvements to aging inland waterways infrastructure. The Corps notes that new navigation alternatives depend on uncertain traffic forecasts, with total domestic freight traffic expected to increase by 70% by 2020. Domestic freight traffic is projected to increase by 70% by 2020, with a focus on rail and highway traffic. Waterway traffic is expected to grow by 2% annually between 2010 and 2035. Efficiency improvements in inland waterways could reduce pressure on highways and railways. Future lock upgrades may boost demand for waterways, but their impact depends on various external factors. Some critics question the need for new lock construction based on flat or declining traffic at certain locks. Some groups have criticized the Corps' traffic projections for inland waterways as overly optimistic. Shipping interests advocate for increased investment in waterways, citing studies showing barge shipping is more efficient and environmentally friendly than rail or highway transportation. Studies also highlight the lower greenhouse gas emissions of inland waterways compared to other freight transportation modes. Inland waterways are considered more fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly than rail or highway shipping. Industry studies show that railroads are less fuel-efficient than waterways, with lower greenhouse gas emissions. However, there are concerns about the accuracy of fuel-efficiency calculations and the need to consider technical factors like river flow constraints. Environmental groups advocate for a more accurate comparison of fuel efficiency between barge and rail shipping. Inland waterway projects can negatively affect riparian habitat and species by altering natural flows through structural changes like locks, dams, and levees. Waterway traffic may also cause bank erosion. Congress may consider changes to financing these projects, including proposed options for additional revenue like an increase in the fuel tax. The expansion of inland waterways can have negative environmental effects. Congress may consider changes to financing these projects, including proposed options for additional revenue like an increase in the fuel tax, new annual fees, lock usage fees, or toll systems. The IWUB-proposed fuel tax increase aims to rebuild the trust fund balance and fund new investments, but some groups argue that the associated increases in federal cost share responsibilities are unacceptable. The user industry's stance on accepting fuel tax increases without changes to cost-sharing arrangements is unclear. The Obama Administration proposed new user fees in 2011 to address inadequate revenues from commercial users on the inland waterway system. The fees would include fuel taxes and new fees for non-lock users, with lock users paying even higher fees. The Administration also plans to add new waterway segments to the fuel-taxed list to increase revenues, arguing that commercial shippers, especially lock users, should bear the costs for new capital investments. The Administration proposes new user fees on the inland waterway system, including fuel taxes and higher fees for lock users. The IWUB and Congress oppose the proposal, arguing it unfairly burdens waterway users and goes against the system's interconnected benefits. The user industry also objects to the proposal delegating fee-setting authority to the Secretary of the Army. Previous attempts to raise revenue included a lock usage fee in the Inland Waterways Revenue Act of 1978. The user industry has opposed the proposed new fee on the inland waterway system, arguing that it delegates fee-setting authority to the Secretary of the Army. Various alternative means to raise revenue have been considered, such as lock usage fees, annual licensing fees, tolls, ton-mile charges, and capital recovery user fees. The 1978 legislation included a concept called \"capital recovery\" where user fees would adjust to recover government capital investments. This concept is also seen in the Obama Administration proposal, tying user fees to trust fund balances after FY2022. Critics argue that capital recovery could lead to unpredictable tax changes and cost increases for users. Congress may explore other options to ensure a reliable revenue stream for inland waterways. Some argue against capital recovery due to unpredictable tax changes and cost increases. Congress could consider automatic inflation adjustments for revenue stream reliability. Without a long-term solution, Congress may need to cap withdrawals or halt new contracts to address revenue shortfall. If a solution is not found for the IWTF revenue shortfall, Congress may need to cap withdrawals or halt new contracts to ensure trust fund solvency. Options include exempting IWTF investments from cost-sharing requirements, which would increase taxpayer costs. Congress is also considering if the current cost-share arrangement for inland waterway projects is balanced. The IWUB proposal aims to modify cost-sharing arrangements for inland waterway projects, excluding dams and minor rehabilitation from cost-share requirements. This would shift funding for these projects to 100% federal funding. The proposal also suggests a new threshold of $100 million for major lock rehabilitation, distinguishing it from routine operations and maintenance. The IWUB proposes redefining the threshold for major lock rehabilitation to $100 million, increasing federally funded maintenance projects. It also suggests making all cost overruns for IWTF construction projects a 100% federal responsibility, shifting costs towards the federal government for inland waterway projects. The IWUB's proposed changes would shift the cost-share arrangement for IWTF construction projects towards the federal government, with federal costs increasing to approximately 68% and non-federal costs decreasing to 32%. Critics argue that this represents an additional hidden cost to the federal government not reflected in the IWUB report's estimates. The Obama Administration's proposals recommend altering user fees but not the cost-share between federal and nonfederal expenditures for inland waterways. Some argue for shifting cost shares away from the federal government and increasing user responsibility for construction, operations, and maintenance. The IWTF system cost-share structure would remain at 50/50, with some advocating for increased user responsibility for construction, operations, and maintenance costs. Congress may reconsider these proposals to cut government costs. The IWUB has requested reforms to Corps IWTF planning processes to improve project prioritization and reduce cost overruns. The IWUB has proposed reforms to increase its involvement in Corps IWTF planning processes and improve project prioritization to reduce cost overruns. Industry users believe these reforms will address factors contributing to cost overruns, such as inaccurate construction schedules and costs. Congressional attention may also focus on the Corps' method for prioritizing inland waterway projects, as current decisions lack formal criteria and are left to the Corps, Administration, and Congress. Concerns about conflicts of interest may arise due to non-federal entity involvement in decision-making processes. The IWUB report proposes a priority ranking system for inland waterway projects, aiming to change the decision-making process currently led by the Corps, Administration, and Congress. If implemented as a regulation, Congress's role may shift to providing project authorizations and overall funding levels, rather than directing specific projects. If the system for prioritizing investments recommended in the IWUB report becomes a regulation, the Corps would use these criteria to select projects for funding. Congress's role could be limited to providing project authorizations and overall funding levels, which would be a departure from its previous role in directing Corps projects. Some argue that this approach is consistent with federal project allocations for other agency programs."
