    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Police Gun Buyback Assistance Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings section. Congress finds that decommissioned firearms, including those sold by law enforcement agencies, have been used in numerous crimes, including homicides, assaults, and drug-related offenses. Additionally, firearms stolen during shipment from police departments have been linked to criminal activities, highlighting the need for stricter regulations on the resale of confiscated firearms by State and local law enforcement agencies. The Act aims to reduce the number of firearms on the streets by stopping the practice of reselling confiscated firearms, particularly assault weapons, by State and local law enforcement agencies. Some departments destroy decommissioned firearms instead of reselling them. The Attorney General may provide grants to States or local governments to purchase new firearms and destroy decommissioned firearms. To be eligible for a grant, a State or local government must have a policy that prohibits transferring decommissioned firearms to individuals and requires their destruction, with an exception for law enforcement agencies. Grants can only be used to purchase new firearms. To apply for a grant under this Act, the chief executive of a State or unit of local government must submit an application to the Attorney General with required information. The Attorney General will establish regulations within 90 days of the Act's enactment for grant applications. The Attorney General must create regulations within 90 days of the Act's enactment for grant applications. States and local governments must report on the Act's implementation within 2 years of receiving funds. Budget assurances are required for future law enforcement firearm purchases. SEC. 7.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n    Authorizes $10,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2001 to 2005 to implement the Act."
