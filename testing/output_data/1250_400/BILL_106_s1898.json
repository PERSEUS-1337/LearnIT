    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Interstate Transportation of Dangerous Criminals Act of 2000\" or \"Jeanna's Act.\" Congress finds that States are increasingly using private prisoner transport companies for violent prisoners due to fiscal or logistical concerns. Escapes have occurred during these transports, necessitating oversight by the Attorney General. While most prefer using trained law enforcement officers, using specialized private companies is an option. Government entities are not required to contract with private companies but may do so when opting for private transport. Private prisoner transport companies are being used by states for violent prisoners due to fiscal or logistical concerns. While government entities are not obligated to contract with these companies, if they choose to do so, the companies should be regulated to ensure public safety. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n(1) Crime of violence.--Defined as in section 924(c)(3) of title 18, United States Code.\n(2) Private prisoner transport company.--Any entity, other than government entities, that transports individuals committed to state custody for compensation.\n(3) Violent prisoner.--An individual in state custody previously convicted of or charged with a crime of violence.\n\nSEC. 4. FEDERAL REGULATION OF PRISONER TRANSPORT COMPANIES. The Attorney General, in consultation with relevant organizations, will establish regulations for transporting violent prisoners across state lines. These regulations will cover background checks, drug testing, and training requirements for employees involved in prisoner transport. State laws outline minimum standards for training, duty hours, supervision ratios, and employee uniforms for transporting prisoners. Training includes topics like restraints, searches, use of force, CPR, map reading, and defensive driving. Duty hour restrictions must comply with federal regulations. Supervision standards require 1 agent for every 6 violent prisoners. Employees must wear uniforms with badges or insignias. State laws set minimum standards for transporting prisoners, including employee uniforms with badges, categories of violent prisoners in brightly colored clothing, restraints like leg shackles and double-locked handcuffs, and notification requirements for scheduled stops and escapes. Transport entities must have 1 agent for every 6 violent prisoners. Private prisoner transport companies must notify local law enforcement 24 hours in advance of scheduled stops. In case of an escape by a violent prisoner, immediate notification to appropriate law enforcement and the contracting governmental entity is required. Minimum safety standards for violent prisoners must be followed according to Federal and State laws. Federal regulations for private prisoner transport companies should not be stricter than those for the United States Marshals Service, Federal Bureau of Prisons, and Immigration and Naturalization Service. SEC. 5. ENFORCEMENT. Any person violating regulations under this Act may face a civil penalty up to $10,000 per violation, along with prosecution costs. Restitution must be made to entities that incur expenses due to apprehending escaped violent prisoners."
