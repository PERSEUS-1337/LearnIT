    "content": "The United States has a history of abundant natural resources, but growing dependence on foreign energy sources prompted federal efforts to increase energy independence. Programs focusing on energy efficiency, conservation, and renewable energy development have been established over the past 40 years to reduce domestic consumption and reliance on foreign energy. Many energy programs in the US have roots dating back 40 years and have been periodically reauthorized and redesigned to meet changing economic conditions and national interests. Congress has enacted major energy laws since 2005, establishing various research, development, demonstration, and deployment programs for energy efficiency and renewable energy. The Department of Energy operates the most incentive programs in this area. The Stabilization Act (EESA; P.L. 110-343) and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA; P.L. 111-5) established energy efficiency and renewable energy programs. The Department of Energy operates the most programs, with other agencies also offering incentives. This report outlines federal programs providing grants, loans, and incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy RDD&D, grouped by administering agency. Program descriptions are compiled from statutes and budget documents. The report outlines federal programs for energy efficiency, renewable energy RDD&D, and incentives from various agencies. Program descriptions are compiled from statutes, budget documents, and other sources like DSIRE and Energy Star websites. Budget figures are sourced from agency justifications and congressional reports. For more information on related grant programs, refer to CRS Report R43416 for agriculture and CRS Report R42566 for alternative fuels and advanced vehicle technology incentives. The 2014 Farm Bill (P.L. 113-79) includes provisions for alternative fuels and engines in transportation. Tax credits for biofuels and vehicles are covered in another CRS Report. The report also includes a summary of federal renewable energy and energy efficiency incentives and programs. Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Incentive Programs include various initiatives such as the Assisted Housing Stability and Energy and Green Retrofit Investments Program, Clean Renewable Energy Bonds, Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grants Program, and more. These programs aim to promote energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies."
