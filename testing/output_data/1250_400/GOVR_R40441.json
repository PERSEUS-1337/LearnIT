    "content": "The Navy conducted training exercises off the coast of southern California using mid-frequency active sonar, which environmentalists claimed harmed whales. The Navy issued an environmental assessment stating minimal harm to marine mammals. Environmental groups sought relief, leading to a preliminary injunction granted by the district court. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the injunction, requiring mitigation measures for sonar use. The Ninth Circuit affirmed a preliminary injunction allowing the Navy to use sonar with mitigation measures. The Supreme Court ruled that plaintiffs must show likely irreparable injury for an injunction, but the Navy's training interests outweighed the harm. The Supreme Court ruled that plaintiffs must show likely irreparable injury for an injunction, but the Navy's training interests outweighed the harm to marine mammals. The Court reversed the decision and vacated the preliminary injunction, emphasizing the national security interest in the challenged training. The Court did not address the merits of the lawsuit regarding violations of environmental laws. The Supreme Court accepted a case challenging a preliminary injunction on Navy training exercises, emphasizing national security interests over potential environmental law violations. The Court overturned the injunction, highlighting the importance of the Navy's training activities. The Ninth Circuit Court invalidated Forest Service regulations that limited public input on timber sales, leading to a nationwide injunction. The Ninth Circuit Court invalidated Forest Service regulations limiting public input on timber sales, issuing a nationwide injunction. The court found plaintiffs had standing due to procedural rights deprivation and reduced recreational enjoyment of national forests. The regulations conflicted with the plain language of the ARA, leading to the Supreme Court granting certiorari. The Ninth Circuit Court invalidated Forest Service regulations limiting public input on timber sales, issuing a nationwide injunction. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the case, which raises questions about judicial review, standing of environmental groups, ripeness of challenges, and the Ninth Circuit's affirmation of the injunction. The case was argued before the Supreme Court but has not yet been decided. Environmental groups have long used site-specific challenges to achieve program-wide reform. The stakes in this case are potentially large as a defeat could increase the burden on public interest groups seeking to invalidate a government program. The case involves power plants and industrial operations withdrawing water from waterways, trapping large aquatic organisms. The Supreme Court has yet to decide on the case. The Clean Water Act requires cooling water intake structures at power plants to reflect the best technology available for minimizing environmental impact. The EPA issued a rule in 2004 allowing cost-benefit analysis to determine the best technology. The Second Circuit invalidated the use of cost-benefit analysis in Riverkeeper Inc. v. United States. In 2004, EPA issued a rule governing cooling water intake structures at power plants, allowing cost-benefit analysis to determine the best technology. The Second Circuit invalidated the use of cost-benefit analysis in Riverkeeper Inc. v. United States. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to determine if CWA section 316(b) authorizes EPA to compare costs with benefits in determining the best technology. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to determine if CWA section 316(b) authorizes EPA to compare costs with benefits in determining the \"best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact\" at cooling water intake structures. The case will test whether the justices, generally viewed as conservative, will continue the shift towards greater acceptance of cost-benefit analysis in environmental laws. The Supreme Court case will test if conservative justices will continue to accept cost-benefit analysis in environmental laws. Coeur Alaska wants to revive a gold mine in Alaska's Tongass National Forest and dispose of wastewater in a nearby lake. Justice Breyer's past views on government regulation and cost considerations are highlighted in the case. Coeur Alaska plans to revive a gold mine in Alaska's Tongass National Forest and dispose of wastewater in a nearby lake, which would harm aquatic life. The Corps of Engineers issued a permit under the Clean Water Act in 2005, leading to a legal dispute over conflicting regulations. In v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Ninth Circuit addressed conflicting CWA regulations regarding Coeur Alaska's proposed discharge. The court ruled that the CWA's Section 306 performance standard must apply through an NPDES permit, despite the discharge meeting the definition of \"fill material\" under Section 404. EPA's prohibition on discharges from Coeur Alaska's ore processing into waters of the United States must be incorporated into the permit. The Ninth Circuit ruled that the Clean Water Act's Section 306 performance standard must apply through an NPDES permit, even if the discharge qualifies as \"fill material\" under Section 404. The court found that the Corps should not have issued a 404 permit in this case, and the district court's decision was overturned. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to determine if the Corps' permitting authority under CWA section 404 should be reallocated to the EPA under CWA section 402. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to determine if the Corps' permitting authority under CWA section 404 should be reallocated to the EPA under CWA section 402. The case was argued on Jan. 12, 2009. The consequences of a reversal could be significant if the Court gives the Corps wide latitude to remove discharges from EPA's NPDES program by redefining \"fill material.\" EPA and the State of California sued to recover cleanup costs under CERCLA from the company that operated a contaminated facility. The EPA and the state sued past and present owners and operators of a contaminated site, including a defunct company, two railroads, and Shell Oil Co. The district court found the railroads and Shell liable for a percentage of total cleanup costs. In United States v. Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Co., the Ninth Circuit addressed whether the railroads and Shell are liable for all cleanup costs or only some of them. In United States v. Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Co., the Ninth Circuit addressed the liability of the railroads and Shell for cleanup costs. The court determined that the harm could be apportioned, but neither party provided a reasonable basis for it. Additionally, the court discussed the broader concept of arranger liability, not limited to direct arrangements for disposal of hazardous substances. The court addressed Shell's liability as an \"arranger\" for disposal of hazardous substances under CERCLA. The court ruled that arranger liability is not limited to direct arrangements for disposal, but also includes broader arrangements where disposal is a part of the transaction. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the Ninth Circuit's decision on apportionment of responsibility under CERCLA. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to review a case involving liability for \"arranging\" disposal of hazardous substances under CERCLA, raising questions about joint and several liability and divisibility. This case is considered significant as it challenges the expansive liability scheme of the Superfund Act. The Supreme Court is reviewing a significant Superfund case involving liability for hazardous substances disposal. The case questions joint and several liability under the Superfund Act, potentially impacting the government's ability to recover cleanup costs. If a lax standard is adopted, the federal treasury may have to cover more cleanup costs. The Supreme Court is considering a Superfund case that could affect the government's ability to recover cleanup costs. If a lax standard is adopted, the federal treasury may have to cover more costs, and industry is concerned about liability for manufacturers selling products. The outcome of this case and others accepted by the Court will reveal the environmental direction of the Roberts Court. The Supreme Court is set to hear five cases that are important for their individual programs and may reveal the environmental direction of the Roberts Court. Industry is optimistic while the environmental community is apprehensive, as the environmental side won in the lower courts for all five cases. The fact that four of the cases are from the Ninth Circuit, known for a high reversal rate, suggests potential decisions favoring industry in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court is set to hear five important environmental cases, with industry optimistic and the environmental community apprehensive. Four cases are from the Ninth Circuit, known for a high reversal rate, potentially favoring industry in the Supreme Court. The Court has historically voted against environmental positions in NEPA cases, and the current Court is less tolerant of regulation. The increase in environmental cases this term may be due to the Court's certiorari-granting process or conservative justices wanting to resolve issues before potential changes in appointments. Eminent Supreme Court practitioners are also taking a greater interest in environmental cases.

The increase in environmental cases this term may be due to the Court's certiorari-granting process or conservative justices wanting to resolve issues before potential changes in appointments. Eminent Supreme Court practitioners are also taking a greater interest in environmental cases. The Court continues to reject petitions for certiorari in difficult cases, including those related to the Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act. The Supreme Court has rejected petitions for certiorari in cases related to the Clean Water Act, including Rapanos v. United States, due to the justices' lack of consensus on the issue. This has led to confusion in lower courts regarding the interpretation of the law."
