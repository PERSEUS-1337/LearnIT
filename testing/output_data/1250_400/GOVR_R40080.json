    "content": "Total nonfarm employment declined steadily between December 2007 and October 2009, falling from 137,951,000 to 129,633,000, with the majority of job losses occurring after November 2008. Despite a slight increase in employment in November 2009, job numbers fell the following month. Both private and public employers have since increased aggregate employment, with the number of jobs in July 2010 rising to 130,470,000. The goods-producing sector, including mining, construction, and manufacturing, has been most affected by job losses, while some service-providing industries like education and health services have continued to add workers. The financial activities industry also experienced job losses before the economic downturn. The recession that began in December 2007 led to job losses in various sectors, with the financial activities industry and construction being particularly affected. Despite some industries like education and health services adding workers, job losses outweighed gains. The housing market collapse negatively impacted components of financial activities, such as brokerage firms and banks. While there was a slight increase in employment in November 2009, sustained job growth following the recession is expected to be gradual based on historical trends. The pattern following the end of postwar recessions suggests that sustained job growth may not be immediate. Job growth typically occurred within three to five months of the start of recoveries, but in some cases, it took up to 22 months. Congress has historically directed funds to infrastructure projects to create jobs in response to recessions. Public works activities, including green jobs, have been a common focus for job creation efforts. Historically, public works, including green jobs, have been used for job creation efforts in response to recessions. Green jobs involve industries utilizing renewable resources and producing energy-efficient goods and services. The job-generating impact of infrastructure spending is discussed, focusing on the development of job creation estimates and models to calculate nationwide job numbers dependent on construction demand. The discussion focuses on the job-generating impact of infrastructure spending, examining how job creation estimates are developed and models used to calculate nationwide and state-specific job numbers. Researchers face difficulties in estimating jobs supported by green economic activities, caution is advised when using these estimates. Policymakers are interested in comparing stimulus options during economic downturns or shifting expenditures between federal budget categories. An input-output (I-O) model of the economy is often used to estimate the number of jobs created by a specific economic activity. This model shows the interrelationships between industries in the production process and how the dollar value of a sale is distributed across industries. It is cost-effective and reflects the impact of shifting expenditures between federal budget categories. An input-output (I-O) model of the economy estimates job creation by showing how the dollar value of a sale is distributed across industries. This includes the output requirements from each industry converted to employment requirements, reflecting direct and indirect employment dependent on economic activity. Employment requirements are expressed as the number of jobs per billion dollars of expenditures in a specific year. An employment requirements table is an approximation of direct and indirect employment supported by economic activity, expressed as the number of jobs per billion dollars of expenditures. It shows the impact of expenditures on different industries and the job-generating potential of various kinds of expenditures. An employment requirements table allows for estimating the impact of expenditures on different industries and job creation potential. Input-output models freeze technology and productivity, leading to potential differences in job creation over time. Estimates are based on a billion dollars of expenditures, but actual job creation may vary due to resource constraints and changes in price levels. The Input-Output models used for estimating job creation may not always align with actual numbers due to resource constraints and differences in imported versus domestically produced goods. Additionally, the models do not differentiate between full-time and part-time jobs, potentially overstating job creation in certain industries. A more comprehensive estimate of job creation considers direct employment, industry reliance on part-time workers, and full-time equivalents. Estimates of job creation from economic activities include direct, indirect, and induced jobs. Induced jobs depend on spending by workers in direct and indirect jobs. Calculating the multiplier effect involves estimating how much additional money will be spent versus saved. The actual number of jobs created through this spending depends on economic conditions.

Calculating the multiplier effect involves estimating how much additional money will be spent versus saved. The actual number of jobs created through this spending depends on economic conditions. The Federal Highway Administration's estimate of the employment impact of federal spending on roads is widely used, with varying estimates of the multiplier effect. The Federal Highway Administration's estimate shows that $1 billion in federal funds for highway construction can support 27,822 jobs, with decreases over time due to rising input costs like asphalt and diesel fuel. This includes 9,536 construction jobs, 4,324 jobs in supporting industries, and 13,962 induced jobs.

This includes 9,536 construction jobs, 4,324 jobs in supporting industries, and 13,962 induced jobs. The job estimate utilizes the national average mix of construction materials and labor inputs, but specific projects and local utilization ratios can alter the estimated number of jobs supported.

Specific projects and local utilization ratios will alter the estimated number of jobs supported. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics provides employment requirements tables for assessing the impact on employment of different policies or actions, based on official I-O tables developed by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis every five years. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics utilizes the official I-O tables developed by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis every five years to create employment requirements tables. These tables reflect the 2006 technologies of production and distribution, as well as labor productivity, and are used to provide information for the construction industry. The construction industry is divided into three major subdivisions: construction of buildings, heavy and civil engineering construction, and specialty trade contractors. Around 11,768 jobs are dependent on $1 billion spending in construction, with the majority in the industry itself. The employment requirements from BLS may differ from FHWA due to various factors like industry definition and data sources. The employment requirements for construction expenditures are lower than the jobs figure for highway expenditures. Discrepancies may be due to differences in industry definition, data sources, and time period. BLS does not provide details on other construction types like public school construction. BEA offers estimates of employment, earnings, and output based on additional spending in various industries through RIMS II. The BEA provides estimates of employment, earnings, and output based on additional spending in various industries through the Input-Output Modeling System (RIMS II). These estimates vary by state due to differences in industry mix and earnings. Estimating job creation for green infrastructure activities is more challenging than traditional infrastructure projects. Data collection is based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) does not separately identify green industries, making it challenging to estimate the number of jobs supported by green infrastructure activities. Renewable energy sources like wind, solar, and biomass are grouped under the \"other\" category, which hinders accurate job estimations. The conventional Input-Output (I-O) model may not be suitable for estimating jobs in green activities due to their unique mix of inputs. The conventional Input-Output (I-O) model may not be suitable for estimating jobs in green activities due to their unique mix of inputs. NAICS does not have a unique category for retrofitting, making accurate job estimations challenging. One study addresses this issue by explaining the limitations of current government surveys and accounts in recognizing green industries like wind and solar. One study commissioned by the Center for American Progress addresses the limitations of current government surveys in recognizing green industries like wind, solar, biomass, building retrofitting, and new mass transit. Researchers created synthetic industries by combining parts of existing industries to estimate green job creation, with employment projections based on varying assumptions and time horizons. The context discusses limitations in recognizing green industries in government surveys. The curr_chunk highlights challenges in estimating green job creation due to varying assumptions, time horizons, and unclear methodologies in studies. The job creation estimates in green economy studies often lack clear articulation of assumptions and methodologies, making it challenging to review the results. Some studies were not originally intended to quickly stabilize or increase jobs in industries hit by the recession. One report commissioned by the Center for American Progress proposed a 10-year program to create almost 2 million jobs in a low-carbon economy. The 2008 report by the Department of Economics and Political Economy Research Institute proposes a two-year $100 billion \"green economic recovery program\" to create or preserve almost 2 million jobs. The program includes federal spending on public building retrofits, mass transit expansion, and tax credits for building retrofits. Some green activities can deliver results within a year, while others may take up to two years to implement. The Apollo Economic Recovery Act proposed by the Apollo Alliance in December 2008 aims to create 5 million green-collar jobs through a 10-year $500 billion program. The initiative calls for federal spending of $50 billion to create or maintain over 650,000 direct jobs and 1.3 million indirect jobs, with allocations for improving the electric transmission grid, repairing roads and bridges, and incentivizing localities. Job creation figures are based on spending-to-jobs relationships estimated by other organizations. The proposed allocation of federal funds includes $10 billion for improving the electric transmission grid (131,000 direct and indirect jobs), $8 billion for repairing roads and bridges (278,000 direct and indirect jobs), and $8 billion for replacing aging buses and trains with U.S.-made clean-energy vehicles (37,600 direct jobs in vehicle manufacturing and 167,000 indirect jobs). Congress emphasized timely tracking of job creation in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, requiring entities to report estimates of direct jobs created and retained by infrastructure projects. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act requires entities receiving funds to report estimates of direct jobs created and retained by infrastructure projects. Recipients must submit quarterly reports with job estimates, which are then reviewed by the Congressional Budget Office and the Government Accountability Office. As of September 30, 2009, 633,342 jobs were saved or retained. Based on self-reporting, 633,342 jobs were saved or retained through September 30, 2009. OMB revised its guidance on jobs saved to define them as positions funded by the Recovery Act. Recipients reported 608,311 jobs funded by ARRA in the fourth quarter of 2009. The updated guidance defines jobs created or retained as those funded by the Recovery Act. Recipients reported 608,311 jobs funded by ARRA in the fourth quarter of 2009 and another 682,370 jobs in the first quarter of 2010. The Council of Economic Advisers submits quarterly reports on the effect of ARRA provisions on employment and economic indicators. The first report in September 2009 estimated that ARRA might have added around one million jobs in August 2009. The first quarterly report of the CEA in September 2009 estimated that ARRA might have added around one million jobs to employer payrolls in August 2009. CBO also estimated that ARRA's tax cuts and outlay increases through September 2009 increased employment by 600,000 to 1.6 million compared to without the law. The CBO estimated that ARRA's tax cuts and outlay increases through September 2009 increased employment by 600,000 to 1.6 million. The CEA's estimates of additional jobs in August 2009 fell within this range. Subsequent reports by the CEA and CBO showed that ARRA may have raised employment by 1.7-1.9 million jobs by December 2009, 2.2-2.8 million jobs by March 2010. The CEA and CBO reports indicated that ARRA policies potentially increased employment by 1.0-2.1 million in the first quarter of 2010. The CEA's fourth quarterly report estimated a potential increase of 2.5-3.6 million jobs in the second quarter of 2010 due to public investment outlays under ARRA. Public investment outlays under ARRA, including clean energy, human capital, transportation, health care, and building construction, potentially increased total employment by over 627,000 jobs in the first quarter of 2010 and over 800,000 jobs in the second quarter."
