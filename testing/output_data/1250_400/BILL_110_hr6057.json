Congress finds that Americans value healthy oceans and wildlife, especially in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas of Alaska, which are home to various endangered species. These ecosystems are crucial for the survival of Alaska Native cultures and are being impacted by climate change. The Arctic is experiencing significant changes due to climate change, affecting sea ice habitat for polar bears, walrus, and seals. The polar bear was proposed as a threatened species in 2007 due to the loss of sea ice. In 2008, the Department of the Interior missed a deadline to provide protections for the polar bear under the Endangered Species Act and also approved oil and gas leasing in the Chukchi Sea. In 2008, the Department of the Interior missed the legal deadline to decide on providing Endangered Species Act protections to the polar bear. A court ruling mandated a decision by May 15, 2008, amidst projections of significant polar bear population loss due to sea ice decline. The declining Arctic sea ice conditions are projected to lead to a significant loss of polar bear population by the middle of the 21st century. Global warming is the major threat, but potential oil and gas development in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas poses additional risks to polar bears and marine life. The lack of effective means to recover spilled oil in these harsh environments raises concerns, especially during periods of solid and broken ice. The Minerals Management Service's leasing plan includes offering millions of acres in the Chukchi Sea for lease and expanding leasing in the Beaufort Sea. The Minerals Management Service's leasing plan includes offering millions of acres in the Chukchi Sea for lease and expanding leasing in the Beaufort Sea. A large oil spill in the Arctic Ocean could pose significant risks to the polar bear population and other marine mammals. There is a lack of information on marine mammal ecology and habitat use in the area. The agency warns that a large oil spill in the Arctic Ocean could harm marine mammals like whales and walruses. Onshore industrial activities to support oil and gas development can also damage important habitats and disturb polar bears. Tribal governments oppose offshore oil and gas development in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas due to threats to subsistence resources and cultural survival. Prohibition on leasing in Beaufort and Chukchi Sea planning areas due to opposition from tribal governments and concerns about harm to marine mammals and habitats. Prohibition on leasing in Beaufort and Chukchi Sea planning areas under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act until missing information on marine resources is identified by the National Research Council. The curr_chunk focuses on the impacts of climate changes on oil and gas-related activities in Alaska, including the effects on plant and animal species, marine environments, and Native communities. It also evaluates the adequacy of environmental, public health, and cultural studies conducted by the Alaska environmental studies program. The curr_chunk discusses the completion of environmental, public health, and cultural studies in Alaska related to oil and gas activities. It also addresses the need for additional research and recommendations for missing information. Additionally, it mentions the listing of polar bears as endangered or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The curr_chunk discusses requirements for providing missing information related to the listing of polar bears under the Endangered Species Act and conducting oil spill response analysis for arctic oil operations. The curr_chunk outlines standards for oil spill response in arctic oil operations, requiring at least 85 percent oil recovery within 30 days of a spill, consultation with stakeholders, and demonstration of recovery capability before leasing or exploration activities. The curr_chunk outlines standards for oil spill response in arctic oil operations, requiring 85 percent oil recovery in any ice condition, closing areas seasonally for response gap, and implementing prevention systems for safety. The curr_chunk discusses operating restrictions to enhance safety and minimize spill risks in arctic oil operations. It also highlights the conditions under which oil and gas exploration can be conducted in the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea Planning Areas without substantial adverse impacts on wildlife or subsistence. The term 'response gap' is defined as a period when the oil spill recovery standard cannot be met. The curr_chunk defines 'response gap' as a period when the oil spill recovery standard cannot be achieved, and it explains 'response gap analysis' as a calculation of response operating limits for spill response systems under various environmental factors. The curr_chunk discusses the methodology for assessing local response capabilities and oil spill contingency plans, considering factors that could cause variables to exceed system limits when combined. It involves calculating the frequency, duration, and timing of limiting factors, using environmental and climate data to quantify the percentage of time local conditions exceed limits. The curr_chunk discusses quantifying the percentage of time local conditions exceed spill response system limits based on environmental and climate data."
