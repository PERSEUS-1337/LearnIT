    "content": "The \"Child Care Quality Incentive Act of 2001\" is the short title of this Act. It aims to improve child care quality. The \"Child Care Quality Incentive Act of 2001\" highlights the importance of quality early care and education for children. Research shows that early learning and nurturing care significantly impact a child's growth and development. However, many child care centers do not provide adequate care, posing risks to children's safety and health. Despite the availability of Federal assistance, the cost of full-day child care remains high, making it unaffordable for many families. The cost of full-day child care is high, ranging from $4,000 to $10,000 per year. Federal assistance is limited, making it unaffordable for many families, especially those with a monthly income under $1,200. Low payment rates for child care providers affect the quality of care, leading to staff cuts and reduced educational activities for children. The Act aims to enhance child care quality and accessibility by increasing payment rates, which can help providers maintain staff, offer training, ensure a safe environment, and provide educational materials. Low payment rates result in compromised care quality, impacting children's development and behavior. Incentive grants are provided to improve the quality of child care. Funding for grants to improve the quality of child care is authorized under the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act. $500,000,000 is appropriated for fiscal year 2002, with additional funds for subsequent years. Block grant funds can be used for this purpose, with specific allocations outlined in the Act. The Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 is amended to improve the quality of child care by reallocating funds and establishing a new program. \"SEC. 658H. GRANTS TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF CHILD CARE.\" The Secretary will use funds to make grants to eligible States for child care services based on market rate surveys and grant applications. Eligible States must submit an application to receive the grant. To be eligible for a grant under this section, a State must submit an application detailing the market rates survey methodology, plans to increase payment rates, and how they will align with survey results. Continuing eligibility requires meeting the Secretary's requirements. The State must increase payment rates according to market survey results to receive annual payments under this section. Continuing eligibility requires progress in maintaining increased rates and updating the survey every two years. Matching funds from State sources are also required for grant eligibility.

State contributions must be in cash and federal funds cannot be included. Allotted funds for each fiscal year will be distributed among eligible States based on a specified formula. Grant funds must be used by the State to increase payment rates significantly. An eligible State receiving a grant must increase child care assistance payment rates up to the 100th percentile of the market rate survey. Once achieving this, funds can be used for activities enhancing child care quality. The funds should supplement, not replace, other Federal, State, or local funds.
