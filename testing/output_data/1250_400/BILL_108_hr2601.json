    "content": "The \"Public Domain Enhancement Act\" may be cited as the short title of this legislation. The Congress finds that the copyright clause in the US Constitution grants Congress the power to promote the progress of science and arts by securing exclusive rights to authors for limited times. This serves to provide economic incentives for creators and promote the free flow of ideas and commerce. The copyright term is limited to ensure the public is not permanently deprived of the benefits of an artist's work. Both commercial and noncommercial creators rely on copyright protection. The public domain is essential for both commercial and noncommercial creators, as it provides raw material for new productions and educational purposes. Various industries benefit from public domain content, such as book publishers offering titles at reduced prices and media sources like the World Wide Web utilizing historical materials. Under current law, copyright protection is granted to works published as early as 1923, but the majority of older works are no longer commercially available. Only 2 percent of works between 55 and 75 years old retain commercial value. This prevents entities from building upon and preserving abandoned works, which are valuable for historians. Abandoned works, which are valuable for historians, are prevented from entering the public domain for many years under current copyright law. This goes against the original intent of the Framers of the Constitution and Congress in enacting the Copyright Act. A mechanism is needed to allow abandoned American copyrights to enter the public domain. SEC. 3. MAINTENANCE FEE FOR PUBLISHED UNITED STATES WORKS. The definition of \"United States work\" in section 101 of title 17, United States Code, is amended for sections 306 and 411. Amendments to the duration of copyright for works created on or after January 1, 1978, and works created but not published or copyrighted before that date are made in sections 302 and 303(a) of title 17, United States Code. Amendments are made to copyright laws for works created before January 1, 1978. Section 303(a) of title 17, United States Code, is modified to include section 306. Section 304 is also amended for subsisting copyrights. Amendments are made to copyright laws for works created before January 1, 1978, including changes to section 303(a) and section 304 of title 17, United States Code. Section 306 is inserted in various subparagraphs and subsections, subject to certain conditions. Additionally, a new section on maintenance fees is added after section 305. Section 306 introduces a maintenance fee of $1 for published United States works to keep the copyright valid. The fee is due 50 years after first publication or on December 31, 2004, and every 10 years thereafter. Failure to pay the fee within a 6-month grace period will result in the copyright expiring. The copyright maintenance fee must be paid before the due date or within a 6-month grace period, or else the copyright will expire. Ancillary and promotional works related to the copyrighted material are also covered under this provision. The fee must be accompanied by a prescribed form and additional materials as required by the Register of Copyrights. The Register of Copyrights must establish procedures for easier submission and access to information regarding the maintenance fee for published United States works under section 306 of title 17, United States Code."
