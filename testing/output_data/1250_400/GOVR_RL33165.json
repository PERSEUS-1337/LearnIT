    "content": "The electric utility industry is a major source of air pollution, including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, and carbon dioxide. The EPA released an analysis comparing different approaches to controlling this pollution, including market-oriented mechanisms. The Administration's \"Clear Skies\" proposal was compared to bills by Senator Jeffords and Senator Carper, with the latter imposing more stringent requirements. The Administration initially resisted conducting the study but relented after the Clear Skies bill failed to advance in the Senate committee. The EPA conducted a cost-benefit analysis of the Clear Skies bill and other Senate bills after facing resistance. Electric utility generating facilities are a major source of air pollution, emitting gases like sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury. These pollutants pose risks to human health and are regulated under the Clean Air Act. Electric utility generating facilities emit pollutants like sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury, regulated under the Clean Air Act. Carbon dioxide emissions contribute to global warming. SO2 and NOx emissions have decreased due to regulations, while CO2 emissions continue to rise. Fossil-fuel-fired plants account for a significant portion of these emissions. Mercury emissions from utility facilities are estimated at around 45 tons annually. Fossil-fuel-fired electric generating plants in the US are major emitters of pollutants like SO2, NOx, CO2, and Hg. Emissions have been regulated over time, with ongoing efforts to control pollutants like NOx, SO2, and Hg. The US has voluntary limits on CO2 emissions but rejected mandatory limits under the Kyoto Protocol. The United States has voluntary limits on CO2 emissions and rejected mandatory limits under the Kyoto Protocol. Efforts are being made to control pollutants like NOx, SO2, and Hg from fossil-fuel-fired electric generating plants. There is a call for a simplified \"multi-pollutant\" approach to regulate utility emissions of SO2, NOx, Hg, and CO2. The new approach aims to regulate utility emissions of four pollutants - SO2, NOx, Hg, and CO2 - to balance environmental goals with industry stability. Existing rules like CAIR, CAMR, and CAVR have already implemented this approach. Further reductions in SO2, NOx, and mercury emissions are necessary due to new air quality standards. In the 109th Congress, legislation is being considered to impose multi-pollutant controls on utilities, including SO2, NOx, and Hg emissions from electric generating facilities. This comprehensive approach is seen as a more cost-effective way to achieve health and environmental goals. In the 109th Congress, legislation is being considered to impose multi-pollutant controls on utilities, including SO2, NOx, and Hg emissions from electric generating facilities. The proposed legislation, known as \"Clear Skies,\" aims to reduce emissions through a system of tradeable allowances, with key questions surrounding the stringency of caps and timeline for reductions. The Clear Skies bill would impose the least stringent standards and be phased in over a longer period, with final deadlines set for 2018. The Clear Skies bill (S. 131) would require a 70% to 80% reduction in NOx and SO2 emissions and a 70%-90% reduction in mercury emissions from 1998 levels. The bill would have the least stringent standards and be phased in over a longer period, with final deadlines set for 2018. Utilities may overcomply in the early years, leading to delays in meeting emission reduction targets due to banking provisions. EPA does not expect to achieve reductions as quickly as with a traditional regulatory approach. The Clear Skies bill allows banking of emission allowances, leading to delays in meeting reduction targets. EPA expects full compliance by 2026 or later. Jeffords and Carper bills have earlier, more stringent caps, achieving compliance at least a decade sooner. Clear Skies does not control CO2, while Jeffords and Carper bills do, affecting compliance strategies and market dynamics. EPA's cost-benefit analysis compared six options, including variants of Clear Skies bill. The EPA's cost-benefit analysis compared six options for achieving compliance with emission reduction targets. The analysis showed little difference between the four Clear Skies options, simplifying the discussion to three principal choices: Clear Skies, Carper, and Jeffords. The version of Clear Skies most recently drafted, the Managers' Mark version, was chosen for further consideration. EPA's Multi-Pollutant Regulatory Analysis assumes that without new legislation, EPA and the states will continue with current regulations. The EPA chose the Managers' Mark version of the Clear Skies option for further consideration. The baseline assumes no additional action will be taken to control emissions beyond rules finalized by mid-2004, despite three recently finalized rules by EPA. The decision not to include these rules in the analysis is unclear. The report uses the CAIR/CAMR/CAVR case as the baseline for clean air regulation. The EPA's cost analysis emphasizes three key parameters for controlling air pollution, highlighting the importance of working from updated baseline projections and assumptions. The uncertainty surrounding clean air regulations and legislation underscores the need for flexibility in addressing evolving proposals and potential delays in implementation. The EPA's cost analysis focuses on three key parameters for controlling air pollution: Electric Demand Price Elasticity, Short-term Construction Constraints, and Electricity Demand Growth and Natural Gas Supply. The analysis considers different scenarios for each parameter to account for uncertainties and delays in implementing regulations. The EPA analyzed scenarios based on different assumptions regarding electricity demand growth and natural gas prices. These scenarios included variations in price demand elasticity and construction constraints. The EPA analyzed scenarios with different assumptions on electricity demand growth and natural gas prices, varying in price demand elasticity and construction constraints. The report uses EPA's Demand Response Scenario as a benchmark analysis, which includes short-term price elasticity and construction constraints. The choice is a compromise based on factors and lack of alternative combinations, with a strong case for including a short-term demand response function in the modeling. The strongest case can be made for including a short-term demand response function in the modeling, as it is well supported by literature. EPA's decision to only include this in one scenario is unclear, but CRS chose to incorporate it. Other assumptions in the Demand Response Scenario, such as limited boilermaker labor until 2010, have been debated. EPA's regulatory rulemaking on the Clean Air Interstate Rule has also been questioned for this constraint. The Institute of Clean Air Companies (ICAC) questioned the assumption of limited boilermaker labor until 2010 for constructing SO2 and NOx control equipment, which was incorporated into EPA's regulatory rulemaking on the Clean Air Interstate Rule. ICAC conducted their own analysis and found no constraint on construction, stating that the air pollution control industry has demonstrated the ability to install significant amounts of equipment in short periods of time. The air pollution control industry has shown the ability to install significant amounts of equipment in short periods of time, including SCRs for NOx control in various countries. The resources needed for projected installations are not expected to be limited, with modular construction methods and non-union labor reducing demand for union boilermakers. Additional boilermaker labor can be sourced from Canadian unions, ship builders, and iron workers if needed. There will be sufficient capacity to meet the IAQR and control installation requirements for 2010 and 2015, with the possibility of completing the 2015 requirements by 2010. Limited availability of boilermakers will not be a constraint. The air pollution control industry has the capacity to install equipment quickly, with resources available from various sources like Canadian unions, ship builders, and iron workers. There will be enough boilermaker capacity to meet the IAQR and control installation requirements for 2010 and 2015, with the possibility of completing the 2015 requirements by 2010. Limited availability of boilermakers will not be a constraint. EPA's demand response scenario is chosen as the base case for analysis. Future natural gas supply is uncertain, requiring sensitivity analysis. The analysis prioritizes including a demand elasticity function in the benchmark analysis over removing a questionable feasibility constraint. EPA's demand response scenario is chosen as the base case. There are uncertainties regarding future natural gas supply, with EPA projecting more availability at lower prices compared to EIA. The EIA supply curves may be more representative of future supplies, considering the historic volatility of the natural gas market. Sensitivity analysis is crucial to understand the robustness of cost estimates. The analysis uses the Demand Response Scenario as the basis for discussion, prioritizing a demand elasticity function over feasibility constraints. Clear Skies bill has lower costs and weaker provisions for Hg and no provisions for CO2 compared to other bills. The Clear Skies bill has lower costs and weaker provisions for Hg and no provisions for CO2 compared to other bills. Clear Skies' benefits are substantially less than the Carper and Jeffords bills, with benefits of $6 billion annually in 2010 compared to $51 billion (Carper) and $83 billion (Jeffords). The benefits of Clear Skies almost merge with the baseline increase in later years and continue to lag the two other bills. The Carper and Jeffords bills have higher benefits due to more stringent pollution caps and a faster implementation schedule. EPA compares the effects of the three bills. The Clear Skies bill has lower costs and weaker provisions for Hg and no provisions for CO2 compared to other bills. Its benefits almost merge with the baseline increase in later years and lag behind the Carper and Jeffords bills. The higher benefits of the Carper and Jeffords bills are due to more stringent pollution caps and a faster implementation schedule. EPA compares the effects of the three bills, with Senator Jeffords' bill having the greatest benefits. The EPA is analyzing the benefits of different multi-pollutant proposals, with Senator Jeffords' bill showing the greatest benefits in 2010 and 2020. The bill would have higher benefits compared to the Carper bill and Clear Skies, but it would also be the most costly option. The Jeffords bill, the most costly option, would reduce coal production and coal-fired electric generation by about 40%, leading to a shift towards renewable sources and additional oil- and gas-fired capacity. EPA predicts an increase in renewable generation and a decrease in coal use under this bill. The Jeffords bill would require vast numbers of natural gas and renewable fuel generators at great cost, leading to significant increases in renewable generation and oil- and gas-fired capacity. The net benefits of the bill far exceed those of other options, with lower costs and higher benefits. The bill aims for substantial emission reductions beyond current regulations while allowing time to avoid price increases. The phased-in schedule helps mitigate short-term constraints, and a flexible CO2 requirement is included. The Jeffords bill aims for substantial emission reductions beyond current regulations while allowing time to avoid price increases. The bill includes a phased-in schedule to mitigate short-term constraints and a flexible CO2 requirement at a nominal cost. EPA conducted sensitivity analyses on various variables, including price elasticity, construction constraints, and electricity growth. The benchmark analysis for this report assumes limited short-term price elasticity, construction constraints, and EPA's electricity growth and natural gas supply curves. EPA analyzed three other scenarios: No Construction Constraint Scenario, EPA Base Case Scenario, and Higher Electricity Growth and Natural Gas Scenario. The No Construction Constraint Scenario removes short-term construction constraints but includes zero demand price elasticity. This swap of assumptions has a minimal impact on the cost analysis for S. 843 and the Managers' Mark. The analysis compares different scenarios with varying assumptions on price elasticity and construction constraints. The removal of price elasticity assumption has a significant impact on the cost of S. 150, leading to a substantial increase in costs. The EPA Base Case Scenario replaces short-term price elasticity with zero elasticity assumption, maintaining construction constraints. The EPA Base Case Scenario replaces short-term price elasticity with zero elasticity assumption, leading to significant cost increases for S. 150 and S. 843 in the short term. Demand response and construction constraints heavily influence EPA's 2010 cost estimates for S. 843, while long-term and Managers' Mark estimates are less affected. The Higher Electricity Growth and Natural Gas Scenario combines zero demand response with higher electricity growth and steeper natural gas supply curves, resulting in higher costs, especially for S. 150. This scenario challenges EPA's assumption of zero demand price elasticity, particularly for 2020, with a more pronounced impact on S. 150 compared to S. 843. The impact of higher growth and natural gas costs on S. 150 is significant, challenging EPA's assumption of zero demand price elasticity. The effect is less dramatic for S. 843 and nonexistent for the Managers' Mark. A more comprehensive analysis of future natural gas availability is needed to determine appropriate targets for multi-pollutant legislation. EPA's assumption of zero demand price elasticity has a dramatic impact on short and long-term cost estimates for S. 150, especially when higher electricity growth and natural gas assumptions are considered. The EPA's assumptions regarding short-term construction constraints and zero demand price elasticity have significant effects on bills like S. 843 and S. 150. However, these effects decrease over the long term. The Managers' Mark, based on EPA's model, has minimal economic impact compared to existing laws and regulations. S. 150 sets an emissions cap to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The EPA analyzed two bills, S. 150 and S. 843, which aim to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. S. 150 sets an emissions cap of 2.05 billion tons annually starting in 2010, while S. 843 sets a cap of about 2.655 billion tons in 2009, decreasing to 2.454 billion tons in 2013. The costs for CO2 allowances are significantly lower under S. 843 compared to S. 150 due to a more modest reduction requirement and slower schedule. S. 150's costs are estimated at $19 per metric ton in 2010 and $33 per metric ton in 2020. The EPA analyzed bills S. 150 and S. 843 for carbon dioxide emissions reduction. S. 150's costs are $19 per metric ton in 2010 and $33 per metric ton in 2020, aligning with EU market prices. The analysis relied on 2003 data for cost estimates, potentially overstating mercury emission control costs. The analysis of mercury emission control costs in 2005 may overstate the actual costs due to advancements in technology since 2003. The air pollution control industry states that the cost of activated carbon injection controls is now one-fourth of what it was in 2003. EPA's analysis shows benefits outweighing costs for bills S. 150 and S. 843, mainly from reducing emissions of SO2 and fine particles. EPA's analysis and CRS's reanalysis show benefits outweighing costs for S. 150 and S. 843, mainly from reducing SO2 and fine particle emissions. The benefits represent monetized human health effects, while environmental benefits like acid deposition and regional haze from SO2 emissions are not estimated. Mercury deposition causing fish consumption advisories is also a concern. Reductions in SO2 emissions could have significant environmental benefits, including forest growth and reduced damage to building materials. The analysis did not estimate the effects of regional haze or the economic impacts of widespread fish consumption advisories due to mercury deposition. The omission of these environmental benefits has the greatest impact on S. 150 and S. 843, which have more aggressive control schemes for SO2, NOx, and Hg. Additionally, the analysis did not consider the health effects of mercury or the potential benefits of controlling CO2 emissions. The analysis did not estimate the benefits of controlling CO2 emissions, which may be a significant omission. The Jeffords bill is the most aggressive in controlling CO2, while the Clear Skies bill does not cap CO2 emissions at all. EPA's analysis found little cost and small benefits associated with Clear Skies legislation after adjusting for promulgated rules. In contrast, the Jeffords and Carper bills show benefits outweighing additional costs, with more stringent standards than the promulgated rules. The EPA's analysis found little cost and small benefits associated with Clear Skies legislation after adjusting for promulgated rules. In contrast, the Jeffords and Carper bills show benefits outweighing additional costs, with more stringent standards. Carbon dioxide costs depend on reduction requirements and implementation schedules, while mercury control costs are dependent on timeliness of data. EPA's benefit analysis is limited and incomplete, favoring Clear Skies alternatives by overstating Hg control costs. The EPA's analysis of Clear Skies alternatives is criticized for being outdated and incomplete, favoring the legislation by overstating costs and penalizing short-term pollution reduction efforts. The analysis fails to consider the impact of natural gas price volatility on implementation strategies and costs, making it less useful for congressional debate."
