    "content": "The Act titled \"Federal Crop Insurance Fairness Act\" allows for coverage levels exceeding 75 percent of recorded or appraised average yield. Subsection (a) of section 508 of the Federal Crop Insurance Act is amended to allow the Corporation to insure agricultural commodities against various unavoidable causes, including drought, flood, hail, wind, frost, and more. Insurance coverage shall not extend beyond the period the insured commodity is in the field. Insurance coverage for agricultural commodities includes protection against infestation, plant disease, and other unavoidable causes determined by the Board. Coverage shall not extend beyond the period the commodity is in the field. Yield insurance covers 75% of the average yield on the insured farm, with adjustments as prescribed by the Board. The Corporation offers yield coverage for agricultural commodities, including levels at 50% of the average yield, with adjustments made by the Board. Adjusted yields may be established by the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service for farming units. Insurance coverage may be provided based on adjusted yields established by the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, rather than recorded or appraised yields by the Corporation, with additional premiums set by the Board to reflect increased risk accurately and cover losses. The Corporation may offer coverage exceeding 75 percent of the average yield if normal yield variations haven't led to losses, with premiums set to cover losses and establish reserves. The maximum coverage level is limited, except in specific circumstances. The Corporation may offer coverage up to 75 percent of the average yield, with exceptions for specific circumstances. One price election must approximate the projected market price, and uninsured losses are not covered under this subsection. The subsection excludes losses due to neglect or malfeasance of the producer, failure to reseed in customary circumstances, or failure to follow good farming practices. The Board has the authority to limit or refuse insurance based on insurance risk. Insurance may not be provided for agricultural commodities in counties where income from the commodity is insignificant, except for farms in a local producing area bordering a county with a crop-insurance program. The Corporation must submit annual reports to Congress on its operations. The Corporation must report annually to Congress on its operations for each insured commodity. Starting in 1992, a minimum price level for each insured commodity will be set by the Corporation based on projected market prices determined by the Board. Insurance coverage will be available to producers at or below the price level established by the Board, quoted in dollars per acre. Late planting coverage is addressed in Section 3. Late planting coverage is addressed in Section 508 of the Federal Crop Insurance Act, allowing producers to plant after the final planting date for a commodity by up to 25 days with reduced yield guarantee for each day of delay. Late planting coverage is automatically included in the basic policy of insurance under the Federal Crop Insurance Act unless producers choose to waive it. If late planting coverage would significantly increase premiums, it can be offered as a separate endorsement. SEC. 4. PREVENTED PLANTING COVERAGE. Section 508 of the Federal Crop Insurance Act is amended to include prevented planting coverage for producers on a farm. This coverage applies if planting is prevented due to excess moisture, drought, or natural disaster, providing 50% of the guaranteed level of coverage for the crop. Producers also have the option to plant a substitute crop, with its value offsetting the remaining coverage for the insured crop. The Federal Crop Insurance Act now includes prevented planting coverage for producers on a farm. This coverage allows for planting a substitute crop, which offsets the remaining guaranteed level of coverage for the insured crop. Producers are presumed to have prevented planting coverage unless they opt out, and if the coverage would significantly increase premiums, it can be offered as a separate endorsement. SEC. 5. ELIMINATION OF PENALTY FOR DE MINIMIS YIELDS.\n\nThe Federal Crop Insurance Act now includes prevented planting coverage for producers on a farm. This coverage allows for planting a substitute crop, which offsets the remaining guaranteed level of coverage for the insured crop. Producers are presumed to have prevented planting coverage unless they opt out, and if the coverage would significantly increase premiums, it can be offered as a separate endorsement. The Act also amends Section 508 to establish a procedure where producers with disaster losses will not have deductions from indemnity payments if the market value of actual production is less than harvesting costs.\n\nSEC. 6. YIELD AVERAGES. Section 508A(b) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act is amended to include provisions for yield averages. Yield coverage will be based on a producer's actual proven crop yields over 4 to 10 crop years. The Corporation will establish a minimum insurance protection level for producers with reduced yields due to natural disasters. Transitional yield data can be used if actual production history is not established for the first 4 crop years on a farm. Transitional yield data can be used to establish yield for producers on a farm if actual production history is not established for the first 4 crop years. Producers can choose to use previous yield history for new parcels of land if deemed actuarially sound, or transitional yield data. The Corporation adjusts Nonstandard Classification procedures to address yield declines from natural disasters. Transitional yield is the countywide average used when no production records are available for producers on a farm."
