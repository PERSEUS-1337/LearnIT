The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act is amended to include a waiting period for unemployment benefits related to strikes. Benefits are not payable for the first 14 days of unemployment due to a strike, with subsequent days of unemployment eligible for benefits. If the strike continues after the initial period of unemployment ends, a new waiting period applies for the employee's next registration period. The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act now includes a waiting period for benefits during strikes. If the strike persists, a new waiting period applies for the employee's next registration period, defined as a period of continuing unemployment lasting more than 4 days. The period ends when the employee exhausts unemployment benefits. The succeeding registration period begins within 15 days after the last day of the previous registration period. A period of continuing unemployment ends when an employee exhausts unemployment benefits. No benefits are payable if the total remuneration exceeds the base year monthly compensation base. SEC. 3. WAITING PERIOD FOR SICKNESS BENEFITS. The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act is amended to specify the payment of sickness benefits for qualified employees, including waiting periods and definitions of continuing sickness periods. The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act is amended to specify sickness benefits for qualified employees, including definitions of continuing sickness periods. A period of continuing sickness is defined as consecutive days of sickness from one or more causes, or successive days of sickness due to a single cause without interruption of more than 90 consecutive days. The period ends when an employee exhausts sickness benefits under subsection (c) of this section. SEC. 4. MAXIMUM DAILY BENEFIT RATE. The maximum daily benefit rate is calculated based on the monthly compensation base multiplied by 5 percent. If the result is not a multiple of $1, it is rounded down to the nearest dollar.\n\nSEC. 5. MAXIMUM NUMBER OF DAYS FOR BENEFITS. The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act is amended to set the maximum number of days for benefits at 130 for both unemployment and sickness within a benefit year. The total benefits cannot exceed the employee's compensation in the base year. The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act limits benefits to 130 days for both unemployment and sickness in a benefit year, not exceeding the employee's compensation in the base year. Employees with 10 or more years of service may be eligible for extended benefits under certain conditions. The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act allows for extended benefits for employees who have exhausted their normal benefit rights for unemployment or sickness, with a maximum of 65 days within an extended benefit period. The extended benefit period begins on the first day of unemployment or sickness after exhausting normal benefits and lasts for 7 consecutive 14-day periods. The extended benefit period under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act begins on the employee's first day of unemployment or sickness after exhausting normal benefits and lasts for 7 consecutive 14-day periods. The period ends when the employee turns 65, except for unemployment benefits. The extended benefit period for sickness benefits under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act ends when the employee reaches age 65, but may continue for paying benefits for days of unemployment. Employees with 10 or more years of service, who did not voluntarily retire or leave work without good cause, and have consecutive days of unemployment or sickness, may have their succeeding benefit year start on the first day of the month in which the unemployment or sickness begins. The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act allows for the starting of a succeeding benefit year for qualified employees with consecutive days of unemployment or sickness. The extended benefit period for sickness ends at age 65, with benefits continuing for days of unemployment. The Board may use available age records for age determinations. Section 2(h) of the Act is repealed. The Board may rely on age records for determining age under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act. Section 2(h) and Section 17 of the Act are repealed.
