    "content": "The Act titled \"Mental Health and Substance Abuse Parity Amendments of 1998\" revises limits on mental health benefits. The Mental Health and Substance Abuse Parity Amendments of 1998 expand coverage under ERISA for group health plans and insurance to include mental health benefits without imposing treatment limitations or financial requirements if not imposed on medical and surgical benefits in comparable settings. The Mental Health and Substance Abuse Parity Amendments of 1998 allow group health plans to negotiate separate reimbursement rates and manage benefits through mechanisms like pre-admission screening, without requiring specific mental health benefits or preventing the application of subsection (a) for preventive care. The Mental Health and Substance Abuse Parity Amendments of 1998 do not require specific mental health benefits from group health plans but define treatment and financial limits for coverage. The Mental Health and Substance Abuse Parity Amendments of 1998 define treatment and financial limits for coverage under group health plans, including copayments, deductibles, and annual limits. Amendments eliminate cost exemptions and sunset provisions. The Mental Health and Substance Abuse Parity Amendments of 1998 amend group health plans to prevent treatment limitations or financial requirements on mental health benefits if not imposed on medical and surgical benefits. Group health plans can negotiate separate rates and manage benefits through pre-authorization mechanisms. The Mental Health and Substance Abuse Parity Amendments of 1998 amend group health plans to prevent treatment and financial limits on mental health benefits, ensuring coverage is on par with medical and surgical benefits. The amendments also allow for negotiation of separate rates and management of benefits through pre-authorization mechanisms. The Mental Health and Substance Abuse Parity Amendments of 1998 prohibit limits on mental health treatment and financial requirements in group health plans, ensuring equal coverage with medical and surgical benefits. Amendments include eliminating cost exemptions, removing sunset provisions, and making clerical amendments. \"SEC. 2752. PARITY IN THE APPLICATION OF LIMITS TO MENTAL HEALTH BENEFITS.\" The provisions of section 2705 apply to health insurance coverage in the individual market as they do in connection with a group health plan. Effective dates for group health plans begin on or after July 1, 1999, with exceptions for plans under collective bargaining agreements. Employers who ratified agreements before the enactment of this Act are exempt from certain plan amendments until the last collective bargaining agreement terminates or July 1, 1999. Plan amendments solely for compliance with new requirements do not count as termination. Individual health insurance coverage changes apply to policies offered, sold, or renewed. The amendment does not terminate collective bargaining agreements. Individual health insurance coverage changes apply to policies in the individual market from July 1, 1999. Coordination in implementation involves amending specific sections of existing laws. SEC. 3. PARITY IN THE APPLICATION OF LIMITS TO SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND CHEMICAL DEPENDENCY BENEFITS. This section amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Public Health Service Act to ensure parity in the application of limits to substance abuse and chemical dependency benefits. Sec. 713 amends the Public Health Service Act to ensure parity in the application of limits to substance abuse and chemical dependency benefits. It applies to group health plans and health insurance issuers, as well as group health plans under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Sec. 9813 ensures parity in the application of limits to substance abuse and chemical dependency benefits, similar to mental health benefits. It applies to group health plans and health insurance issuers under the Public Health Service Act. The provisions of section 2752 apply to substance abuse and chemical dependency benefits in the same way as mental health benefits. Effective dates for group health plans begin on or after July 1, 1999, with exceptions for plans under collective bargaining agreements ratified before the enactment of the Act. The amendments made by subsections (a), (b), and (c) do not apply to plan years before the later of the termination of collective bargaining agreements or July 1, 1999. Plan amendments made to conform to new requirements shall not be considered a termination of the collective bargaining agreement. Individual health insurance coverage changes apply after July 1, 1999."
