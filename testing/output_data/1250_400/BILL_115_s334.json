    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Fracturing Regulations are Effective in State Hands Act\". Congress acknowledges the effectiveness of state regulations in protecting water resources during hydraulic fracturing, citing reports from the Ground Water Protection Council and the Environmental Protection Agency. The effectiveness of state regulations in protecting water resources during hydraulic fracturing is supported by various studies and reports. These include a 2004 EPA study that found no evidence of drinking water contamination from fracture fluid, a 2009 report by the Ground Water Protection Council stating a lack of evidence of risks to groundwater, and a 2009 resolution by the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission confirming the safety measures in place. The Compact Commission, EPA Administrator, and Bureau of Land Management Director all stated that there is no verified evidence of groundwater contamination from hydraulic fracturing. Federal regulations already cover activities related to fracking to protect the environment. In 2011, the Secretary of the Interior announced plans for new Federal regulations on hydraulic fracturing on Federal land. A 2012 study by the Energy Institute at the University of Texas found the need for fact-based regulation for environmental protection in shale gas development. In 2014, the Ground Water Protection Council and State Oil and Gas Regulatory Exchange released a report on State-based oil and gas regulations improving groundwater protection laws and regulations. The term \"Federal land\" in this Act includes public lands, National Forest System land, Bureau of Reclamation land, and Corps of Engineers land. State authority is addressed in Section 4. State authority is granted to regulate the treatment of wells using fluids under pressure with propping agents for fracturing in order to enhance oil, gas, or geothermal production on State and Federal lands."
