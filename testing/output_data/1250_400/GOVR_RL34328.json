It includes provisions for research funding, early career grants, ARPA-E, and Innovation Institutes at National Laboratories. The America COMPETES Act authorizes programs at government agencies like OSTP, NASA, DOE, ED, NSF, NIST, and NOAA, including research funding, ARPA-E, and Innovation Institutes at National Laboratories. It also includes education scholarship and training programs for STEM teachers, student-focused STEM programs, and new STEM education activities. The America COMPETES Act authorizes programs at government agencies for research funding, education scholarships, and STEM education activities to foster innovation and competitiveness. The act includes initiatives such as scholarships for undergraduate and graduate students, mentoring for postdoctoral scholars, STEM education programs at various agencies, and White House efforts to promote innovation. These efforts aim to ensure the United States remains competitive in the global economy by encouraging scientific and technological advances. The United States must be competitive in a global economy by engaging in trade, retaining market shares, and offering high-quality products and services. Scientific and technological advances contribute to economic growth by creating new goods, services, jobs, and increasing productivity. Policy approaches include direct measures like budget outlays and indirect measures such as financial incentives to enhance competitiveness. Since World War II, the United States has used a combination of direct and indirect approaches to enhance competitiveness. Concerns about competition from other national economies were expressed in the Steelman report post-WWII. In the 1970s, experts worried about losing market share to Japan, Europe, and newly industrialized countries in various industries. There were also concerns about declining U.S. technological superiority in high-tech products. The United States has lost market share in various industries such as autos, cameras, stereos, television sets, steel, machine tools, and microelectronics. Concerns were raised about declining U.S. technological superiority in high-tech products, lower productivity growth compared to Japan, and a decrease in the number of patents granted to Americans. Congress responded by passing the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980. The United States lost market share in various industries due to declining technological superiority and productivity growth compared to Japan. Congress responded by passing several acts to boost civilian R&D, including the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 and the Bayh-Dole Act. Additional measures focused on increasing corporate spending on research and development, such as the R&E tax credit provided by the Tax Reform Act of 1986. In response to competitiveness concerns, congressional actions focused on increasing corporate spending on research and development through acts like the 1981 Economic Recovery Tax Act and the Tax Reform Act of 1986. The Small Business Development Act established federal R&D funds for innovative small firms. By the mid-1990s, the US economy and technological innovation improved, leading to success in industries like Internet applications and biotechnology. Today's competitiveness concerns revolve around globalization and federal science and engineering issues. Today's competitiveness concerns in the United States revolve around globalization, federal science and engineering funding, STEM education quality, and the impact of international markets on American companies and workers. Increasing integration with the global economy can lead to higher productivity and living standards, but also raises worries about job loss and lower wages. The impact of globalization on the economic futures of American companies, workers, and families can be both positive and negative. Increasing integration with the world economy can lead to higher productivity and living standards, but also raises concerns about job loss and lower wages. The America COMPETES Act addresses these issues by authorizing policies that tackle technology, labor supply, and government barriers to trade and investment. The America COMPETES Act addresses globalization's impact on the economy by authorizing policies to tackle technology, labor supply, and government barriers to trade and investment. It increases federal funding for basic research in key fields and supports high-risk research and development at small and medium-sized businesses. The America COMPETES Act aims to enhance competitiveness in technology and computer science, promote innovation and job creation. It addresses the need to improve the U.S. labor pool's competitiveness globally and increase the number of STEM teachers and students pursuing post-secondary STEM degrees. Additionally, the act authorizes actions to identify possible trade and investment policies to benefit U.S. businesses. The America COMPETES Act aims to enhance competitiveness in technology and computer science by promoting innovation, job creation, and increasing the number of STEM teachers and students pursuing post-secondary STEM degrees. It also authorizes actions to identify possible trade and investment policies to benefit U.S. businesses. The act has strong bipartisan support, but there are differing opinions on the best actions to take to improve competitiveness. The America COMPETES Act has bipartisan support but experts have differing opinions on the best actions to improve competitiveness. Competitiveness can vary depending on the perspective, such as from an individual domestic firm, a multinational corporation, or domestic labor. For domestic firms, competitiveness is focused on trade and market share against imports or foreign firms. The U.S. trade balance in advanced technology products is a key measure of competitiveness. The U.S. trade balance in advanced technology products shifted from a surplus to a deficit in 2002. The deficit grew to $55.5 billion in 2008, raising concerns about competitiveness. Many high technology imports are from U.S. companies, but the growing deficit may require closer policy scrutiny. The U.S. trade deficit in advanced technology products was $55.5 billion in 2008, raising concerns about competitiveness. High technology imports are often from U.S. companies, but the growing deficit may need closer policy scrutiny. Foreign direct investment in the U.S. declined after 2000 but rebounded to $184 billion by 2006. Foreign direct investment in the United States declined sharply after 2000 but rebounded to $184 billion by 2006. Domestic labor defines competitiveness as the firm's ability to compete against foreign firms. The United States is the largest recipient of foreign direct investments and the largest investor abroad. Investment by U.S. firms abroad was $249 billion in 2006. Some view these investments as an economic gain, while others express concern about displaced U.S. workers and lower wages. The United States is the largest recipient of foreign direct investments and the largest investor abroad. Investment by U.S. firms abroad was $249 billion in 2006. Concerns about displaced U.S. workers and lower wages exist, but most economists believe that direct investment abroad does not lead to fewer jobs or lower incomes overall for Americans. NSF identifies five broad categories of science and engineering occupations. The NSF identifies five broad categories of science and engineering occupations: computer and mathematical scientists, life scientists, physical scientists, social scientists, and engineers. However, this classification does not include all individuals with science and engineering degrees who use their knowledge in their occupations. For example, a chemist teaching high school chemistry or an engineer managing a manufacturing plant are classified as a teacher and a manager, respectively, not as part of the science and engineering workforce. Additionally, there are individuals in science- and engineering-related occupations who utilize their knowledge in fields such as patent law, medicine, writing, sales, finance, and law. The traditional accounting of science and engineering occupations may not fully capture the extent of the workforce, which could be larger than currently estimated. The science and engineering workforce extends beyond traditional occupations, with individuals using their knowledge in various fields like writing, sales, finance, and law. The size of this workforce could be considerably larger than government analyses suggest, ranging from 5.0 million to 21.4 million individuals in 2006, according to the National Science Board. This broader perspective highlights the diverse ways science and technical knowledge are applied in the United States. The National Science Board reported that the science and engineering workforce in 2006 could range from 5.0 million to 21.4 million individuals, including those with degrees in related fields like health or technology. This reflects the diverse applications of science and technical knowledge in the United States, beyond traditional occupations. The analysis shows how computerization has changed the skills needed for employment, shifting towards high-level tasks and favoring college-educated labor. The U.S. Census Bureau's data reveals significant growth in science and engineering occupations compared to the total labor force. Recent data from BLS indicates a decline in STEM professionals as a percentage of the employed civilian workforce. The STEM workforce grew significantly compared to the total labor force and all managers and professionals. Recent data from BLS shows a decline in STEM professionals as a percentage of the employed civilian workforce. Science and engineering occupations are projected to grow faster than all occupations, with a focus on computer-related occupations. Unemployment in science and engineering occupations was low in 2006. STEM workforce includes post-secondary teachers, healthcare practitioners, and science managers. Unemployment in STEM occupations was low in 2006. Compensation for most STEM occupations is above the U.S. labor force average. Median salaries for S&E bachelor's degree holders are higher than non-S&E degree holders. Variance exists among STEM occupations and fields. In 2003, S&E bachelor's degree holders had a median salary of $65,000, higher than non-S&E degree holders at $49,000. The Council on Competitiveness argues that traditional measures of competitiveness do not fully capture a nation's competitiveness in today's global economy. Factors like foreign affiliate sales, global supply chains, and intangibles like knowledge and intellectual property are not adequately considered in assessing competitiveness. The Council on Competitiveness suggests that traditional measures of competitiveness, like trade balance, are not as useful in today's global economy. They propose assessing prosperity through factors like pension funds, real estate, and purchasing power. The America COMPETES Act emphasizes the importance of STEM knowledge for all Americans and highlights the lack of proficiency in STEM among K-12 students. The America COMPETES Act emphasizes the necessity of STEM knowledge for all Americans, highlighting the lack of proficiency in STEM among K-12 students. STEM degrees are important for generating enthusiasm in students and creating a competitive workforce. The Act aims to encourage more Americans to pursue science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields to drive economic growth and innovation. STEM degrees are crucial for creating new industries and enhancing existing ones, leading to economic growth and competitiveness. Current funding for basic science and engineering research in the US is insufficient compared to other countries. Additional federal funding can help create new industries and jobs, based on analyses like the OECD's Program for International Student Assessment. The OECD's PISA compared U.S. 15-year-old students' science and math scores internationally in 2006. American students scored below the OECD average in both subjects. Inadequate teacher preparation and curriculum deficiencies contribute to lower scores for American middle-schoolers. The U.S. has one of the lowest rates of STEM degrees awarded compared to other countries. According to NSF data, STEM degrees accounted for 16.8% of all first university degrees awarded in the United States in 2002, compared to an international average of 26.4%. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, supported by the National Science Foundation, developed a research and development satellite account to estimate the impact of R&D investment on U.S. economic growth. Some question the exclusive benefits of U.S. federal research programs and whether other countries can benefit as well. STEM education is also seen as a state and local issue. Some question the extent of exclusive benefits from U.S. federal research programs and whether other countries can benefit. STEM education is viewed as a state and local issue, raising doubts about the influence of the federal government in this area. Concerns also exist about the time it takes for STEM education investments to yield results and whether these investments will create jobs for all Americans or just scientists and engineers. Additionally, there are doubts about whether actions to enhance U.S. competitiveness through STEM research and education are necessary, with some questioning the need for additional scientists and engineers in the country. STEM research and education's contribution to U.S. competitiveness is questioned by some analysts, who doubt the necessity of any action in this regard. Concerns include the need for additional scientists and engineers, the quality and number of scientists and engineers in China and India, and the possible unintended side-effects of increased funding. Proponents suggest both direct and indirect measures to address policymakers' concerns about U.S. competitiveness. The act focuses on direct and indirect measures to address policymakers' concerns about U.S. competitiveness in STEM research and education. Proponents argue for direct government assistance focusing on promising technologies, while others support indirect policies to enhance market opportunities. President Bush announced the American Competitiveness Initiative in January 2006 during his State of the Union address, responding to concerns about the United States' ability to compete economically in the future due to insufficient investment in science and technology research. The America COMPETES Act included provisions for increased research funding at NSF, NIST laboratories, and the DOE Office of Science, as well as STEM education programs like Math Now and the AP/IB program. The America COMPETES Act, part of the American Competitiveness Initiative, authorizes increased funding for research at NSF, NIST laboratories, and the DOE Office of Science. It also includes STEM education programs like Math Now and the AP/IB program. Additionally, the act calls for setting goals to fund high-risk, high-reward basic research projects and emphasizes the importance of funding NASA at authorized levels to enhance U.S. innovation and competitiveness. The America COMPETES Act authorizes increased funding for research at NSF, NIST laboratories, and the DOE Office of Science, as well as STEM education programs. It emphasizes the importance of funding NASA at authorized levels to enhance U.S. innovation and competitiveness. Many organizations advocate for increased research funding in physical sciences, engineering, mathematics, and computer science, based on the National Academies' recommendation to increase federal investment in long-term basic research by 10% annually over the next seven years. The National Academies committee recommends a 10% annual increase in federal funding for long-term basic research in physical sciences, engineering, mathematics, and information sciences over the next seven years. This is necessary due to stagnant federal funding in these fields for the past 15 years, which hinders support for high-potential high-risk research. Corporations are unlikely to fill this gap as they fund little basic research. The committee reviewed various proposals and determined that a 10% annual increase over seven years would be most appropriate. The National Academies committee recommends a 10% annual increase in federal funding for long-term basic research in physical sciences, engineering, mathematics, and information sciences over the next seven years. This rate of growth strikes a balance between urgency and efficiency in applying new funds. The Administration's chosen 7% annual rate for doubling research activities over 10 years has not been justified. Wide consensus exists on the importance of federally funded science for economic competitiveness, as highlighted in the National Academies' 2005 report \"Rising Above the Gathering Storm.\" The National Academies' 2005 report \"Rising Above the Gathering Storm\" emphasized the importance of federally funded science for economic competitiveness. It recommended increased funding for basic research in physical sciences, mathematics, and engineering, even suggesting reallocating existing funds if necessary. The American Competitiveness Initiative proposed doubling budgets for NSF, NIST, and the Department of Energy's Office of Science over ten years to support innovation and economic growth. The America COMPETES Act emphasizes the need for robust funding of NASA to promote innovation and economic competitiveness. It also calls for NASA to be a full participant in interagency efforts for basic scientific research, engineering development, and STEM education. The Act highlights the importance of balanced funding across NASA's programs and expresses concern over the President's FY2008 budget not being appropriately balanced. The Senate and House appropriations committees are concerned about the lack of balance in the President's FY2008 budget for NASA, as it may not provide enough funding for important initiatives like the Vision for Space Exploration. The National Research Council report suggests that NASA is being asked to do too much with too little resources, and calls for a reevaluation of the agency's responsibilities to ensure sustainability. The America COMPETES Act also stresses the need for NASA to allocate an appropriate percentage of its basic research funding for high-risk, high reward projects. The America COMPETES Act emphasizes the importance of NASA allocating a percentage of its basic research funding for high-risk, high reward projects. This provision aims to address concerns that current federal research funding review mechanisms may not be open to new, unproven ideas. Transformative research, which involves multidisciplinary work and a high degree of novelty, may not fit well within traditional research frameworks or review systems dominated by experts invested in current paradigms. Transformative research, which is revolutionary and cutting edge, faces challenges within traditional research frameworks dominated by experts invested in current paradigms. Funding agencies like NSF and NIH are addressing this issue by creating programs like the Pioneer's Award to support high-risk research. Despite conducting research that could be considered transformative, no dedicated funds are allocated for this purpose according to reports by the National Science Board. The National Science Foundation (NSF) conducts research that is considered transformative, but lacks dedicated funds for this purpose. The Appropriations Committees have directed NSF to review current practices supporting transformative research and provide reports on how to address this area. The House Committee on Appropriations suggests allocating $10 million for a new program emphasizing transformative research. The America COMPETES Act authorizes ARPA-E, a new federal organization in the Department of Energy aimed at enhancing economic and energy security. The House Committee on Appropriations recommends allocating $10 million for a new program emphasizing transformative research within the National Science Foundation (NSF). The America COMPETES Act authorizes ARPA-E, a new federal organization in the Department of Energy focused on enhancing economic and energy security through technological advancements. ARPA-E aims to reduce foreign energy imports, lower energy-related greenhouse gas emissions, improve energy efficiency, and establish the United States as a leader in advanced energy technologies. It follows the DARPA research management model to sponsor revolutionary energy technology projects. ARPA-E is a federal organization within the Department of Energy that aims to accelerate technological innovations in areas where industry may not invest due to uncertainty. It is based on the DARPA research management model and seeks to bridge the gap between fundamental discoveries and practical applications. Various similar initiatives have been proposed in the past, including the idea of a civilian technology agency for energy research. In the 100th and 101st Congresses, proposals for a civilian technology agency were made. In 1992, a National Academy of Sciences report suggested a civilian technology corporation for energy research. Presidential candidate Bill Clinton and Senator Al Gore also proposed a civilian advanced research agency for renewable technologies. ARPA-E, as recommended by the National Academies report, aims to bring excitement to energy research, focus on transformational research, and operate in a nimble and goal-oriented manner. The National Academies report proposed the creation of ARPA-E, a nimble organization focused on transformational energy research. It suggested starting funding at $300 million and increasing to $1 billion per year over five to six years, with a focus on sustaining promising projects and phasing out unproductive ones. The goal is to bridge gaps between basic energy research, development, and industrial innovation without jeopardizing DOE's basic research funding. The National Academies proposed creating ARPA-E with initial funding starting at $300 million and increasing to $1 billion per year over five to six years. The program's effectiveness would be evaluated before taking appropriate actions. It was emphasized that ARPA-E funding should not jeopardize basic research supported by the DOE's Office of Science. The organization and mission of ARPA-E should be determined through consultation with experts from the scientific and engineering communities. The America COMPETES Act directs DOE to establish multidisciplinary Discovery Science and Engineering Innovation Institutes at DOE National Laboratories. The America COMPETES Act directs DOE to establish Discovery Science and Engineering Innovation Institutes at National Laboratories to apply fundamental science to technological innovations. The institutes aim to support research on emerging technologies critical to global competitiveness, train science and engineering students, develop educational curricula, and collaborate with universities and industry partners. This initiative is seen as a way to reshape engineering research and education to address global challenges. The America COMPETES Act authorizes STEM education programs to train engineers in areas like nanoscience and microsystems, reshaping engineering research and education to meet global challenges. This initiative involves collaboration between DOE National Laboratories, universities, and various sectors of society to enhance STEM education through recruitment of teachers, skills enhancement, and student support programs. The America COMPETES Act authorizes new STEM education programs to recruit and enhance STEM teachers, support students in STEM education through various initiatives, with an emphasis on outreach and mentoring for women and minorities. Programs include grants for specialty high schools, internships for students at national labs, centers of excellence in STEM education, and summer institutes to improve teachers' STEM knowledge. The America COMPETES Act authorizes new STEM education programs to recruit and enhance STEM teachers, support students in STEM education through various initiatives, with an emphasis on outreach and mentoring for women and minorities. These programs include grants for specialty high schools, internships for students at DOE national labs, centers of excellence in STEM education, summer institutes to improve teachers' STEM knowledge, and new competitive grant programs at the Department of Education for teacher certification and master's degree programs. The Education (ED) program aims to improve STEM education by offering baccalaureate degrees with teacher certification, master's degree programs for current teachers, and a one-year program for STEM professionals. Additionally, Math Now and the AP/IB Program will enhance math instruction and expand access to advanced coursework for low-income students. Increased support for existing NSF programs, such as the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program, is also included. The Education program aims to improve STEM education by offering baccalaureate degrees with teacher certification, master's degree programs for current teachers, and a one-year program for STEM professionals. Increased support for existing NSF programs includes training more high school teachers for AP/IB courses in math, science, and critical foreign languages in high-need schools, as well as programs like the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program, Math and Science Partnerships, STEM talent expansion program, Advanced Technological Education program, Graduate Research Fellowships, and Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship program. The America COMPETES Act programs include Graduate Research Fellowships (GRF) and Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) program for STEM education. The DOE manages these programs, which aim to inspire K-12 students in math and science through interactions with DOE scientists and engineers. The Administration opposes some DOE-managed STEM initiatives, arguing they should not be DOE's responsibility. The DOE specialty schools for math and science are public secondary schools intended to offer a high-quality STEM curriculum to improve academic achievement. Supporters argue that these schools are crucial for inspiring students and teachers, as they have been successful in other states. The America COMPETES Act authorizes summer internship programs at DOE national laboratories for middle and secondary school students to provide hands-on learning in STEM fields. The America COMPETES Act authorizes summer internship programs at DOE national laboratories for middle and secondary school students to provide hands-on learning in STEM fields. Proponents believe these programs make a remarkable difference in education quality, while the Administration argues for improving existing efforts before starting new programs. DOE National Laboratory Centers of Excellence in STEM education aim to assist teachers and enhance STEM education in high-need public secondary schools. The Administration opposes establishing school-based centers, stating it would divert resources from national laboratories. The America COMPETES Act reauthorizes STEM education programs at NSF and authorizes a new program. The Administration opposes increasing funding for the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program and establishing funding for the Laboratory Science Pilot program. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 emphasizes NSF's role in promoting quality math and science education. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 emphasizes NSF's role in promoting quality math and science education by increasing funding for the Robert Noyce Scholarship program. This program encourages STEM students to become K-12 math and science teachers, aiming to create a new generation of innovators. An additional $5,000,000 is allocated for the Robert Noyce Scholarship program, bringing the total funding to $15,000,000. The program aims to recruit STEM students to become K-12 math and science teachers by providing scholarships and stipends in exchange for service in high-need school districts. This initiative is based on successful programs like UTeach and California Teach, which focus on better preparing teachers for the classroom. The program provides funds to higher education institutions to improve teacher preparation, based on successful models like UTeach and California Teach. It is considered radical for training teachers in science and math departments instead of education departments. Universities are changing their focus to prepare students for education careers, not just research. The program also includes grants for professional science master's degree programs emphasizing practical training for high-need fields. The program authorizes grants for institutions to create or improve professional science master's degree programs that focus on practical training for high-need fields. These programs aim to provide advanced training in science or mathematics while developing workplace skills valued by employers. About 120 PSM programs at 60 institutions offer academic training, internships, and cross-training in business and communications. Approximately 120 PSM programs at 60 institutions offer advanced training in science or mathematics, along with workplace skills highly valued by employers. The NSF Laboratory Science Pilot program aims to enhance STEM instruction by improving school laboratories and providing professional development for teachers, equipment, and hands-on laboratory experiences. A National Research Council report highlighted the poor quality of laboratory experiences for most high school students. The America COMPETES Act authorizes new programs in the Department of Education to improve STEM education. This includes the Teachers for a Competitive Tomorrow program, which aims to increase the number of STEM teachers through grants for training and certification. Schools with higher concentrations of non-Asian minorities and poor students are less likely to have adequate laboratory facilities. The Math Now program focuses on improving STEM instruction for undergraduate students pursuing teacher certification and current teachers enhancing their STEM knowledge. The America COMPETES Act mandates the establishment of a President's Council on Innovation and Competitiveness, chaired by the Secretary of Commerce. President Bush responded by creating a National Science and Technology Committee (NSTC) on Technology subcommittee. The America COMPETES Act mandates the establishment of a President's Council on Innovation and Competitiveness, chaired by the Secretary of Commerce. President Bush responded by creating a National Science and Technology Committee (NSTC) on Technology subcommittee, which held a summit in 2008 to examine the direction of U.S. science and technology enterprises. The Act also directs the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) to develop principles for data exchange among federal scientists and engineers. The America COMPETES Act mandates the establishment of a President's Council on Innovation and Competitiveness, chaired by the Secretary of Commerce. In response, the Bush Administration OSTP sent a memorandum to federal agencies, emphasizing the importance of open communication of scientific information and promoting a culture of scientific openness. NASA's science communications policy is highlighted as a model for other federal agencies. The Bush Administration OSTP emphasized scientific openness and communication in response to the America COMPETES Act. NASA's science communications policy is seen as a model for other federal agencies. Actions designated for OSTP by the Act include a study on barriers to innovation and a National Technology and Innovation Medal. Dr. John Holdren's nomination as OSTP Director was discussed in a Senate hearing on February 12, 2009. The Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation held a hearing on Dr. John Holdren's nomination as OSTP Director on February 12, 2009. Dr. Holdren emphasized the importance of ensuring objective and accurate science and technology advice to the President and Congress. Dr. Holdren emphasized the importance of ensuring objective and accurate science and technology advice to the President and Congress, including working with federal agencies to prevent censorship or distortion of scientific information. He highlighted the challenge of maintaining scientific integrity in the federal government and the need for clear policies on disseminating research results. President Obama issued a memorandum on Scientific Integrity in 2009, assigning OSTP the responsibility for ensuring integrity in the executive branch's involvement with scientific processes. This includes developing recommendations for guaranteeing scientific integrity based on principles such as selecting candidates based on knowledge, credentials, experience, and integrity. Agencies should have rules and procedures to ensure integrity in science and technology positions. The memorandum issued by President Obama in 2009 emphasized the importance of scientific integrity in the executive branch. It outlined principles for selecting candidates for science and technology positions based on knowledge, credentials, experience, and integrity. Agencies were required to have rules and procedures in place to ensure the integrity of the scientific process. Additionally, scientific or technological information used in policy decisions should undergo well-established scientific processes and be made available to the public, except for restricted information. Each agency should also address instances where the scientific process is compromised. Each agency should ensure the integrity of scientific and technological information used in policy decisions by making findings available to the public and addressing compromised processes. Coordination with the Director is necessary for interim procedures to maintain scientific decision-making integrity. The agencies must coordinate with the Director to develop interim procedures to maintain scientific decision-making integrity. Funding for America COMPETES Act programs varied in FY2008 and FY2009, with some programs funded at authorized levels while others were not funded as per Table 3. The combined funding from the Omnibus Appropriation Act and the American Investment and Recovery Act led to funding of some America COMPETES Act programs at authorized levels, while others were funded below or not at all. The future challenge lies in maintaining these funding levels without supplements, especially for research and education programs. The alignment of budget proposals with the America COMPETES Act has been a challenge for DOE, making it difficult to determine program statuses. The budget alignment with the America COMPETES Act has been a challenge for the DOE, making it difficult to determine the status of certain programs. There is insufficient evidence that new America COMPETES Act programs such as DOE Pilot Program of Grants to Specialty Schools and National Energy Education Development are funded. The America COMPETES Act programs face funding challenges as Congress deliberates FY2010 appropriations. The Obama Administration requested funding below authorized levels but argues it would still be the highest in U.S. history. Some newly authorized programs have never received funding, raising questions about their establishment. FY2010 appropriations for federal R&D programs are set to be the highest in U.S. history. Newly authorized programs in the America COMPETES Act may face funding challenges, as their establishment depends on receiving necessary funds. The act aims to invest in innovation and improve U.S. competitiveness, with indicators providing insight into the nation's economic performance compared to other countries. The United States currently ranks first on international competitiveness rankings, with indicators assessing the nation's ability to compete with other countries. Evaluation mechanisms within the America COMPETES Act aim to maintain this ranking amidst increasing science and technology investments globally. Various indicators of innovation activity are available, but there are no direct measures of innovation or competitiveness. In assessing the nation's competitiveness, it is important to consider that there are no direct measures of innovation. Quantitative assessments of innovation activities are available, but combining these indicators may not accurately reflect innovation or competitiveness. Other factors like necessity or serendipity also play a role. Evaluating the quality and value of innovation is limited and can vary depending on perspectives. Increased spending on research and development does not guarantee new technologies, and even if technologies are developed, there is no guarantee of their innovation or market adoption. Innovation can occur independently of research and development due to market forces. The federal government, industrial sector, and universities all play a major role in funding R&D and innovation. Innovation measures often focus on research and development funding without differentiating between the two. University-industry cooperation is critical in bridging basic research and industry through education and training. Funding R&D does not guarantee new technologies or their innovation and market adoption. Innovation can also occur independently of research and development due to market demand. The role of university-industry cooperation in technological innovation and advancement is crucial. Analyzing non-defense R&D funding can provide a different perspective on innovation. Industry R&D investment varies in terms of research versus development and across different sectors. Patent data may not fully capture all innovation resulting from R&D. The focus of government policy is on creating an environment where innovation can flourish, leading to competitiveness with other nations. Monitoring and assessing the effects of policies is crucial for making adjustments as other countries also enhance their innovation environments. The United States aims to remain competitive by enhancing its innovation environment, necessitating monitoring and assessment of policies. The President's Council on Innovation and Competitiveness plays a key role in advising on global trends, identifying opportunities, and developing metrics to measure progress in promoting innovation. The federal government aims to improve innovation by monitoring and evaluating research and education programs, such as ARPA-E and Discovery Science Institutes. Evaluation criteria include quality, relevance, and performance, with a merit-based funding process in place. DOE summer institutes are required to submit annual reports to Congress. The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (P.L. 103-62) mandates a merit-based, competitive process for agencies to determine funding for research activities, graduate students, and scientists. The DOE summer institutes and ED STEM programs must evaluate their impact on improving STEM teaching skills, increasing the number of STEM teachers, and enhancing student academic achievement. Annual independent evaluations are authorized to assess the effectiveness of these activities. The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 mandates a competitive process for agencies to determine funding for STEM programs. The act aims to increase the number of new STEM teachers in schools, especially from underrepresented groups, bring STEM professionals into teaching, and retain participating teachers. An annual independent evaluation assesses the impact on student academic achievement, with reports to relevant committees. Monitoring mechanisms outside the act include indicators like the WEF Global Competitiveness Report and OECD Science, Technology, and Industry Scoreboard. The WEF Global Competitiveness Report and OECD Science, Technology, and Industry Scoreboard provide valuable information on innovation and competitiveness. The reports use input and output indicators such as economic trade balance, foreign direct investment, employment, and wages. Various organizations like the BEA, BLS, Census Bureau, and NSF monitor these indicators regularly. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), U.S. Census Bureau, and National Science Foundation monitor output and input indicators related to competitiveness. The NSF releases a biannual Science and Engineering Indicators report. Input indicators include quality of education, STEM workforce availability, and innovation capacity. These indicators help identify policy areas for the United States to focus on relative to its competitors. The United States ranks number one overall in the WEF competitiveness analysis but not necessarily in each indicator. The United States monitors input indicators related to competitiveness, which can highlight policy areas for focus. While ranked number one overall in WEF analysis, it does not lead in all indicators. Key sub-indicators include quality of education, innovation capacity, and availability of scientists. State-level competitiveness analysis is also available, with factors influenced by the America COMPETES Act. The America COMPETES Act influences state-level competitiveness analysis through various indicators such as human capital investment, research and development inputs, and technology concentration. The Act is an authorization act that requires subsequent appropriation for new programs and increased funding for existing programs. The America COMPETES Act requires subsequent appropriations for new programs and increased funding for existing programs. The 110th and 111th Congress provided appropriations for various programs such as ED's Teachers for a Competitive Tomorrow program and DOE's ARPA-E. Congress is deliberating on the FY2010 budget for America COMPETES Act programs. The America COMPETES Act, originally the 21st Century Competitiveness Act of 2007, requires appropriations for new and existing programs.
