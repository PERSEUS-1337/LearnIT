It outlines circumstances for the US President to modify laws if China fails to uphold Hong Kong's autonomy. The Congress findings highlight the binding international agreement between the UK and China regarding the reversion of Hong Kong in 1997. China pledged autonomy, human rights, and elections for Hong Kong. Despite assurances from senior Chinese officials for a smooth transfer of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty and respect for its autonomy, there have been attempts to infringe upon Hong Kong's autonomy, such as proposals to obtain confidential files on civil servants or require them to take loyalty oaths. The initial proposals by officials of the Government of the People's Republic of China to obtain confidential files on civil servants of the Hong Kong Government, dissolve the democratically elected Legislative Council, delineate permitted speech and association types, issue warnings to religious institutions, and the decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on February 23, 1997.
