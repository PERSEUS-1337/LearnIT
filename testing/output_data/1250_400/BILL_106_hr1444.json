    "content": "The \"Fisheries Restoration and Irrigation Mitigation Act of 2000\" establishes the Fisheries Restoration and Irrigation Mitigation Program, defining terms like Pacific Ocean drainage area and Secretary of the Interior. The Fisheries Restoration and Irrigation Mitigation Program aims to reduce fish mortality caused by water withdrawals for irrigation without hindering water usage. Projects include fish screens and passage devices to mitigate impacts on fisheries in the Pacific Ocean drainage area. The Fisheries Restoration and Irrigation Mitigation Program focuses on projects in the Pacific Ocean drainage area, including the development of fish screens, fish passage devices, and related features. Priority is given to projects costing less than $5,000,000. The program allows voluntary participation of non-Federal entities, with no financial responsibility unless they apply. Federal projects on US-owned land are nonreimbursable. Project evaluation considers benefits to native fish species, water diversion size, funding sources, cost-effectiveness, and additional system benefits. Eligibility requirements are also outlined. Eligibility requirements for projects under the Program include meeting Secretary and State requirements, as well as approval from all relevant Federal and non-Federal entities. The Secretary will consult with various agencies and utilize available data to determine project eligibility. Non-Federal participants in projects under the Program must provide 35% of the cost for projects on non-Federal land. They are also responsible for providing necessary land, easements, and other resources. The value of these contributions can be credited towards their cost share. Non-Federal participants are responsible for all operating and maintenance costs, while the Federal Government has its own responsibilities. Non-Federal participants are responsible for costs associated with projects on non-Federal land, including operating, maintaining, and repairing the project. The Federal Government is responsible for costs on Federal land or at a Federal facility. SEC. 8. LIMITATION ON ELIGIBILITY FOR FUNDING. Projects funded under this Act cannot receive additional Federal funds for the same purpose. \n\nSEC. 9. REPORT. After three fiscal years, the Secretary must report to Congress on completed projects, those ongoing, and any recommended Program changes.\n\nSEC. 10. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. SEC. 10.
