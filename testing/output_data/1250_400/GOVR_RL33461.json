The House passed a bill with $100 million more funding for Yucca Mountain, but the Senate version does not include any funding for the project. The House passed a bill with $100 million more funding for Yucca Mountain, but the Senate version does not include any funding for the project. The Yucca Mountain site has been the only location under consideration by the Department of Energy for a national high-level radioactive waste repository. The Obama Administration halted funding for the project in 2010 and established the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future to develop a new nuclear waste policy. After FY2010, NWPA has not been amended, still naming Yucca Mountain as the sole repository candidate site. The Obama Administration terminated the Yucca Mountain project and established the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future to develop a new waste policy. The commission recommended creating a new organization for developing waste repositories and storage facilities through a consent-based process. DOE issued a strategy in 2013 for managing and disposing of nuclear waste, calling for a new waste management entity to develop consent-based storage and disposal. The DOE issued a strategy in 2013 for managing nuclear waste, proposing a new waste management entity to develop consent-based storage and disposal sites. A pilot interim spent fuel storage facility was planned to open by 2021, followed by a larger-scale storage facility by 2025. A geologic disposal facility was set to open by 2048. In 2017, a draft consent-based siting process was issued, and in 2018, a bill was approved to withdraw the Yucca Mountain site for nuclear waste disposal. The House approved a bill on May 10, 2018 (H.R. 3053, H.Rept. 115-355) to withdraw the Yucca Mountain site for nuclear waste disposal. The NRC completed a Safety Evaluation Report (SER) in response to a court order, determining the repository's compliance with safety standards. NRC stated that construction should not proceed until all land and water rights requirements are met and a supplemental environmental impact statement (EIS) is completed. The NRC completed a supplemental EIS in May 2016 for the Yucca Mountain repository, requiring additional appropriations of $330 million for the licensing process. The Trump Administration is requesting $47.7 million in FY2019 for NRC licensing activities for Yucca Mountain. The Trump Administration is requesting $47.7 million in FY2019 for NRC licensing activities for Yucca Mountain, along with $120 million for DOE to defend its license application for the repository and develop interim storage facilities. There is a proposal for a separate underground repository for high-level radioactive waste and spent fuel from nuclear defense activities, which could be easier to site, license, and construct compared to a combined defense-civilian repository. This defense-only repository could potentially be developed outside the framework of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. The Department of Energy (DOE) proposed a defense-only nuclear waste repository that could be developed outside the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. The repository would still need to be licensed by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and comply with NWPA requirements. However, a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report raised concerns about the cost and schedule estimates provided by the DOE. Republican leaders criticized the plan for the defense-only repository. Legislation introduced in January 2017 (H.R. 433) and May 2018 (H.R. 3053) aimed to block the development of a defense-only nuclear waste repository and prioritize the licensing decision on the Yucca Mountain repository. Additionally, provisions were included in the FY2019 appropriations bill (H.R. 5895) to authorize the development of consent-based pilot interim storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel. The FY2019 appropriations bill (H.R. 5895) included provisions for storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel, prioritizing storage at closed nuclear plant sites. The Department of Energy would need consent from the governor, localities, and Indian tribes for site selection. Congress would be updated on compensation for host jurisdictions and a plan for moving waste to a permanent repository. Previous bills also proposed a consent-based pilot program for interim storage, but were not enacted. The Senate Appropriations Committee included provisions for a consent-based siting process for underground repositories and interim storage facilities in past Energy and Water Development funding bills. The House did not include similar provisions in its bills. A nuclear waste bill passed by the House authorized the Department of Energy to store spent nuclear fuel at interim storage facilities with consent from the governor, local government, and affected Indian tribes. Legislation introduced in the 114th Congress aimed to implement recommendations for nuclear waste storage but was not enacted. In the 114th Congress, bipartisan legislation was introduced to implement major recommendations for nuclear waste storage. The Nuclear Waste Administration Act of 2015 (S. 854) aimed to establish an independent Nuclear Waste Administration to find storage and disposal sites with consent from state, local officials, and affected Indian tribes. A license application for a spent fuel storage facility in New Mexico was filed by Holtec International, with plans to hold 10,000 canisters of spent fuel in below-grade concrete silos over 20 years. Total storage capacity is expected to be about 120,000 metric tons. Holtec plans to develop a storage facility in New Mexico to hold 10,000 canisters of spent fuel in below-grade concrete silos over 20 years. Waste Control Specialists (WCS) filed an application for an interim storage facility in Texas but later formed a joint venture with Orano USA called Waste Control Partners. The proposed WCS spent fuel storage facility would be built near Andrews, TX, with local support. WCS had initially aimed to complete construction by 2022. The proposed Waste Control Specialists (WCS) spent fuel storage facility in Texas, near Andrews, would store spent fuel for up to 40 years with possible extensions. The Department of Energy (DOE) would ship the fuel to the site and pay WCS for storage. Legislation has been introduced to authorize DOE to enter into contracts with non-federal interim storage facilities for spent fuel. Legislation (H.R. 3053) passed by the House on May 10, 2018, includes provisions to authorize DOE to enter contracts with non-federal interim storage facilities for spent fuel. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget requested funding for Yucca Mountain, but it was not approved by Congress. For FY2019, the Administration is seeking funding for Yucca Mountain, including $110 million for DOE to seek an NRC license for the repository. The FY2018 budget request included funding for Yucca Mountain, but it was not approved by Congress. For FY2019, the Administration is seeking $110 million for DOE to seek an NRC license for the repository, along with $47.7 million for NRC to consider the application. Additionally, $10 million is allocated for interim nuclear waste storage facilities. The total funding of $120 million for nuclear waste in FY2019 would come from two appropriations accounts. The House passed a bill with $100 million more than requested for Yucca Mountain, while the Senate version included no funding for Yucca Mountain. The House passed the Legislative Branch Appropriations bill and the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bills (H.R. 5895) with $100 million more than requested for Yucca Mountain. The Senate version of the bill included no Yucca Mountain funding, continuing a pattern of funding not being approved. DOE stopped collecting nuclear waste fees from power generators in 2014 due to a court ruling, totaling about $750 million per year. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act authorized fees paid by nuclear power generators for waste disposal, totaling $750 million per year. The court ruled that DOE's waste plans were too vague for accurate cost estimates. The Trump Administration planned to restart the Yucca Mountain program and conduct a new cost assessment for determining the nuclear waste fee. NRC approved a final rule for continued storage of spent nuclear fuel, replacing the previous \"waste confidence\" rule. The NRC approved a final rule in August 2014 for continued storage of spent nuclear fuel, replacing the previous \"waste confidence\" rule that was struck down by the U.S. Court of Appeals. This new rule allows for the safe storage of spent nuclear fuel at nuclear plants for at least 60 years after shutdown, with permanent disposal available when necessary. The court required NRC to conduct an environmental review before issuing waste confidence findings in December 2010, leading to a halt in licensing new facilities generating radioactive waste. The NRC approved a final rule in August 2014 for continued storage of spent nuclear fuel, replacing the previous \"waste confidence\" rule that was struck down by the U.S. Court of Appeals. This new rule allows for safe storage of spent nuclear fuel at plants for at least 60 years after shutdown, with permanent disposal available when necessary. NRC halted licensing of new facilities generating radioactive waste after a court ruling in December 2010. The U.S. Court of Appeals rejected a consolidated lawsuit challenging NRC's continued storage rule on June 3, 2016. NRC proposed modifications to low-level waste disposal regulations in March 2015, with final regulations submitted for approval in September 2016. Further revisions were issued by the commission on September 8, 2017. The NRC staff submitted final regulations for commission approval on September 15, 2016, with further revisions issued on September 8, 2017. The regulations aim to establish time periods for technical analyses of low-level waste sites to protect the general population. Nuclear waste, including highly radioactive spent fuel, is a major concern in the industry. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act focuses on Yucca Mountain, NV, as a repository for nuclear waste, despite strong opposition from the State of Nevada. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act focuses on Yucca Mountain, NV, as a deep underground repository for radioactive waste, despite strong opposition from the State of Nevada. DOE submitted a license application for the repository in 2008, projecting waste acceptance in 2020. However, the Obama Administration decided not to open the Yucca Mountain repository due to Nevada's opposition. The Obama Administration halted funding for the Yucca Mountain repository in FY2011, leading to the shutdown of the project by DOE at the end of FY2010. President Trump plans to restart the licensing process, requesting $120 million for Yucca Mountain in his FY2019 budget submission. President Trump plans to restart the Yucca Mountain licensing process, requesting $120 million for Yucca Mountain and interim waste storage in his FY2019 budget submission. DOE would receive $110 million to seek an NRC license for the repository, and NRC would receive $47.7 million to consider DOE's application. DOE also would receive $10 million to develop interim nuclear waste storage facilities. Under the Obama Administration, DOE had filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application on March 3, 2010, with strong support from Nevada but opposition from other states. The DOE's motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application faced opposition from states with defense-related and civilian radioactive waste. The ASLB denied the withdrawal motion, citing the NWPA, and the NRC commissioners upheld this decision. NRC stopped further consideration of the application due to budget constraints. Lawsuits were filed to overturn the license withdrawal, leading to a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. NRC sustained the ASLB decision on a tie vote in 2011 but halted further consideration of the Yucca Mountain license application due to budget constraints. Lawsuits led to a court ruling in 2013, requiring NRC to continue work on the application as long as funding is available. NRC completed the Yucca Mountain safety evaluation report in 2015, concluding that the proposed repository design met safety and environmental standards for 1 million years. The NRC completed the Yucca Mountain Safety Evaluation Report (SER) in 2015, stating that the repository design would comply with safety and environmental standards for 1 million years. Additional funding of $330 million was needed to complete the licensing process, including adjudicatory hearings on various issues raised by Nevada and others. The Obama Administration established the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future to explore alternative waste disposal strategies. The Obama Administration halted the Yucca Mountain project in 2010 and established the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future to develop alternative waste disposal strategies. The BRC recommended creating a new organization for developing nuclear waste repositories using a consent-based process. In response, the DOE issued a strategy in 2013 calling for a new nuclear waste management entity to develop consent-based storage and disposal sites. The strategy included plans for a pilot interim spent fuel storage facility by 2021. The DOE issued a strategy in 2013 for the management and disposal of nuclear waste, calling for a new entity to develop consent-based storage and disposal sites. Plans included opening a pilot interim spent fuel storage facility by 2021 and a larger-scale storage facility by 2025. A geologic disposal facility was to open by 2048. Public input was sought to address various concerns in the siting process, leading to the issuance of a draft consent-based siting process in 2017. The DOE issued a draft consent-based siting process in 2017, outlining five phases for site selection and community involvement. Phase 1 involves initiation and outreach, Phase 2 includes preliminary site assessment, Phase 3 detailed site assessment, and Phase 4 negotiation of a siting agreement. The process for site selection and community involvement in hosting storage or disposal facilities involves detailed site assessment, negotiation of a siting agreement, and licensing, construction, operation, and closure phases. The Trump Administration's proposal includes funding for the Yucca Mountain project and interim storage planning. The FY2019 project includes funding for a Yucca Mountain program office, legal and technical support for the license application, and management of documents. The Administration's request for $10 million includes planning for storage services and waste shipments. The nuclear power industry supports completing NRC's licensing review of Yucca Mountain and pursuing alternative storage facilities. Geologic disposal of nuclear waste depends on rock formations, with a target date for opening a repository within 20 years of a storage site. The geologic disposal of high-level nuclear waste, such as at Yucca Mountain, faces challenges due to uncertainties in predicting site performance over the 1 million years required for isolation. Despite worldwide consensus on geologic isolation as the safest long-term option, specific sites have encountered flaws like water intrusion and earthquake vulnerability. Public controversy has also arisen over the issue. President Obama's budgets for FY2017 and previous years included long-term research on technologies to reduce nuclear waste volume and toxicity. The Bush Administration proposed reprocessing spent nuclear fuel to recycle elements like plutonium, but this was controversial due to cost and weapons concerns. The Obama Administration shifted focus towards fundamental science research on nuclear waste, moving away from reprocessing facility development. The Obama Administration shifted focus towards fundamental science research on nuclear waste, moving away from reprocessing facility development. The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget request would sharply reduce DOE funding for nuclear spent fuel reprocessing, while continuing to focus on \"a long-term, science-based approach.\" President Bush recommended the Yucca Mountain site to Congress in 2002, facing opposition from Nevada Governor Guinn. Other types of civilian radioactive waste, such as low-level waste, have also generated public controversy. The Yucca Mountain site was approved by President Bush in 2002 for nuclear waste disposal. Low-level radioactive waste from various sources is currently disposed of in different states, with threats of closure leading to the authorization of regional compacts for disposal. Utah's commercial facility accepts the lowest-concentration class of low-level waste from anywhere in the United States. The first new disposal site under the regional compact system opened in Texas in 2011, allowing up to 30% of its capacity for states outside the Texas Compact. NWPA Section 302 authorized DOE to enter contracts with U.S. generators of nuclear waste, with a deadline for waste disposal by January 31, 1998. The NWPA required nuclear reactors to have a waste disposal contract with DOE by January 31, 1998. DOE missed the deadline, leading to lawsuits from utilities for additional storage costs. A settlement with PECO Energy allowed them to keep $80 million in waste fees, but other utilities sued DOE for using the fees as compensation. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that compensation must come from sources other than the waste fund, leading to payments from the U.S. Treasury's Judgment Fund. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that compensation for missing the disposal deadline must come from sources other than the waste fund. Nuclear waste compensation to utilities has been paid from the U.S. Treasury's Judgment Fund, totaling $6.9 billion by FY2017. Utilities submit reimbursement claims to DOE for delay-related nuclear waste storage costs, with unresolved claims going to arbitration. DOE settlements with utilities cover past and future damages from nuclear waste delays, with claims going to arbitration. Utilities not settled seek compensation through the U.S. Court of Federal Claims for incurred costs. DOE's potential liabilities for delays could reach $34.1 billion, including $6.9 billion already paid. Delays may lead to environmental enforcement for DOE's waste storage noncompliance. The DOE has already paid $6.9 billion in settlements and judgments for nuclear waste delays. Delays in waste disposal could lead to future environmental enforcement actions. DOE's own high-level waste is stored in noncompliance with laws, potentially resulting in fines. The nuclear waste fee collection was suspended after the Yucca Mountain project was halted, following lawsuits from the nuclear industry and state regulators. Petitions to end the fee were filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals in 2010. The court agreed with waste-fee opponents, suspending fee collections in May 2014. Petitions to end the nuclear waste fee were filed by NARUC and NEI in 2010, arguing against the $750 million annual fees. DOE insisted on collecting fees for future disposal costs, but a court ruling in 2012 deemed the determination invalid and ordered a more thorough study of the fee. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in 2012 that Secretary Chu's decision to maintain the nuclear waste fee was not valid, ordering a more comprehensive study within six months. The court emphasized the need to evaluate alternative costs and timing, as projections for Yucca Mountain were no longer viable. DOE conducted a new fee assessment in 2013, revealing potential deficits of up to $2 trillion or surpluses of $5 trillion, leading to uncertainty about the need for an immediate fee increase. In January 2013, a study evaluated waste management costs, showing scenarios with costs exceeding revenues by $2 trillion or resulting in a surplus of $5 trillion. DOE's fee adequacy assessment was challenged, leading to a court order to stop collecting nuclear waste fees due to vague plans and unreliable cost estimates. DOE ceased fee collection in 2014, with plans to reassess fees based on previous estimates for Yucca Mountain until new information is available. The DOE stopped collecting nuclear waste fees in 2014 after a court ruling. The Trump Administration planned to restart the Yucca Mountain program and conduct a new fee adequacy assessment based on previous cost estimates. The DOE filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application with NRC's ASLB in 2010, citing that a geologic repository at Yucca Mountain was not a viable option for long-term waste disposal. The decision was influenced by opposition from Nevada and a desire for a waste solution with greater public acceptance. The DOE filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application in 2010, citing opposition from Nevada and a desire for a waste solution with greater public acceptance. The ASLB denied the motion, stating that DOE cannot unilaterally terminate the review process. DOE appealed, arguing the Secretary of Energy has authority to make policy decisions regarding nuclear waste disposal. The DOE appealed the ASLB decision to the NRC commissioners, arguing that the Secretary of Energy has the authority to discontinue the Yucca Mountain project. The NRC commissioners sustained the licensing board's denial of the license withdrawal on a tie vote in September 2011, but halted further consideration due to budgetary limitations. The Court of Appeals ruled in August 2013 that NRC must continue work on the Yucca Mountain license application as long as funding was available. The Court of Appeals ruled in August 2013 that NRC must continue work on the Yucca Mountain license application as long as funding was available. NRC completed its Safety Evaluation Report for Yucca Mountain in January 2015 and used remaining funds for a supplemental EIS and licensing database. Additional funding of about $330 million would be needed for NRC to complete the licensing review, with DOE estimating costs at $1.9 billion. The Trump Administration proposes to resume consideration of the NRC license, with DOE's FY2018 budget request including $110 million for the Yucca Mountain program. The Trump Administration proposes to resume consideration of the NRC license for the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository. DOE's estimated costs as the license applicant would total about $1.9 billion, with additional funding needed for NRC to complete the licensing review. NRC is required to determine that nuclear waste can be safely disposed of before issuing licenses to nuclear facilities. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) updated the Waste Confidence Decision in 1990, stating that a permanent repository for nuclear waste would be available by the first quarter of the 21st century. However, delays in the opening of the Yucca Mountain repository led to a revised waste confidence rule in 2010, allowing for safe storage of waste at reactor sites for at least 60 years after shutdown. Lawsuits were filed challenging this rule, with the U.S. Court of Appeals ruling in 2012 that NRC must conduct an environmental review of the decision. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in 2012 that the NRC must conduct an environmental review of the Waste Confidence Decision due to flaws in the rulemaking process. NRC approved a final rule in 2014 on continued storage of spent nuclear fuel to replace the struck down waste confidence rule. The NRC halted final licensing of new nuclear facilities for over two years to address court ruling on future dangers and consequences. A new rule on continued storage of spent nuclear fuel was approved in 2014, analyzing environmental effects of different storage timeframes. The rule replaced the waste confidence rule that had been invalidated. The NRC approved a new rule in 2014 for continued storage of spent nuclear fuel, analyzing environmental effects of different storage timeframes. A consolidated lawsuit challenging the rule was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals. The termination of work on the Yucca Mountain repository by the Obama Administration sparked congressional controversy, with President Trump proposing to restart the licensing process. The Obama Administration sparked congressional controversy by terminating work on the Yucca Mountain repository. President Trump's proposal to restart the licensing process has changed the dynamics of the debate on nuclear waste in Congress. Despite the retirement of Senator Reid, who strongly opposed Yucca Mountain, the 115th Congress has not provided new funding for the project. The House approved funds for Yucca Mountain in FY2018 and FY2019, while the Senate did not allocate any funds. Multiple concerns about nuclear waste were raised during the confirmation hearing for former Texas Governor Rick Perry as Secretary of Energy. The Senate did not provide funds for the Yucca Mountain project despite concerns raised during the confirmation hearing for former Texas Governor Rick Perry as Secretary of Energy. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada expressed opposition to the project and emphasized the importance of ensuring Yucca Mountain never becomes a nuclear waste repository. The Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017 (H.R. 3053) passed the House, aiming to withdraw the repository site from public lands laws and place it solely under DOE's control. The Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017 (H.R. 3053) passed by the House aims to withdraw the Yucca Mountain repository site from public lands laws, increase its capacity limit, and authorize DOE to store spent fuel at an interim storage facility. The bill includes changes from the Energy and Commerce Committee version, such as eliminating mandatory funding provisions to address past misuse of the Nuclear Waste Fund. The House passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017 (H.R. 3053) with changes from the Energy and Commerce Committee version, including the elimination of mandatory funding provisions. The bill allows for interim storage of spent nuclear fuel at Monitored Retrievable Storage (MRS) facilities, with the option for DOE to operate federal or nonfederal MRS facilities. The Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017 authorizes the Department of Energy to site, construct, and operate Monitored Retrievable Storage (MRS) facilities for spent fuel. DOE can partner with nonfederal entities for MRS facilities, subject to NRC approval and state/local government consent. Priority is given to nonfederal MRS facilities, unless a federal facility is deemed quicker and cheaper. Closed reactor fuel has priority for shipment to MRS facilities. The Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017 authorizes the Department of Energy to construct Monitored Retrievable Storage (MRS) facilities for spent fuel. Priority is given to nonfederal MRS facilities, unless a federal facility is deemed quicker and cheaper. Closed reactor fuel has priority for shipment to MRS facilities. The proposed Yucca Mountain repository would be located on federal land encompassing parts of DOE's Nevada Test Site and the Nellis Air Force Range. H.R. 3053 proposes to permanently withdraw 147,000 acres of federal land for the Yucca Mountain repository, transferring jurisdiction to the Secretary of Energy. This withdrawal is necessary for the Department of Energy to obtain a license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The NRC must make a final decision on issuing a construction authorization within 30 months of enactment. The Yucca Mountain repository would not be subject to certain waste disposal regulations, a construction authorization decision must be made within 30 months of enactment. DOE could conduct infrastructure activities before the decision, the limit on nuclear fuel disposal would increase, and a separate repository for defense-related waste is prohibited until a decision is made. The Secretary of Energy cannot resume nuclear waste fee collection until a final decision is reached, with total collections limited to 90%. The Secretary of Energy cannot resume nuclear waste fee collection until a final decision is reached, with total collections limited to 90% of each fiscal year's appropriations for the DOE nuclear waste management program. Any uncollected fees may be required to be paid later. Nuclear waste fees collected would offset appropriations to the nuclear waste program, ensuring that annual appropriations up to the amount of available fees would net to zero during the appropriations process. The existing balance of the Nuclear Waste Fund would remain available for appropriation without offsets. The bill specifies that appropriations from the Nuclear Waste Fund would not affect annual discretionary funding allocations for the Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill. The Secretary of Energy would be authorized to enter into benefits agreements with the State of Nevada and local governments, providing increased annual payments and a lump sum payment upon the first receipt of spent fuel at Yucca Mountain. The Nuclear Waste Informed Consent Act proposes increased payments for spent fuel receipt at Yucca Mountain, with annual payments of $40 million and potential benefits agreements with local governments. The OCRWM Director would oversee waste management functions and serve up to two five-year terms. The Nuclear Waste Informed Consent Act, introduced by Senator Heller and Representative Titus, aims to require consent from State and local governments before using funds from the Nuclear Waste Fund for a repository. Additionally, the Sensible Nuclear Waste Disposition Act, introduced by Representative Joe Wilson, prohibits the development of a repository for defense nuclear waste until a final decision is made on the Yucca Mountain repository. In the 114th Congress, Representative Joe Wilson introduced the Sensible Nuclear Waste Disposition Act (H.R. 433) to delay the development of a repository for defense nuclear waste until a final decision is made on the Yucca Mountain repository. Other proposals include bills to authorize DOE to enter contracts with private spent fuel storage facilities and legislation for DOE to take title to spent nuclear fuel from commercial reactors for private interim storage. In the 114th Congress, various bills were introduced regarding the storage of spent nuclear fuel. Representative Joe Wilson introduced the Sensible Nuclear Waste Disposition Act (H.R. 433) to delay the development of a repository for defense nuclear waste. Other proposals included bills authorizing DOE to enter contracts with private spent fuel storage facilities and legislation for DOE to take title to spent nuclear fuel for private interim storage. Additionally, legislation was introduced to authorize DOE to store spent fuel at privately owned consolidated storage facilities, provide assistance to communities with stored nuclear waste, and revive tax credits for first-time homebuyers in affected areas. Legislation introduced by Senator Duckworth and Representative Schneider aims to provide assistance to communities with stored spent fuel at closed reactor sites within a 50-mile radius. The bills would offer financial support, revive tax credits for first-time homebuyers, and make communities eligible for the New Markets Tax Credit. Additionally, a task force would be established to simplify the process for communities applying for government assistance. The bills also require the Department of Energy to explore alternative options for hosting decommissioned nuclear waste and study potential economic uses for secure closed reactor sites. In the 115th Congress, the Dry Cask Storage Act of 2018 (H.R. 4891) was introduced to address concerns about spent fuel storage in nuclear power plants. The bill would require plants to develop plans approved by the NRC to transfer spent fuel from storage pools to dry storage facilities within seven years. Emergency planning zones would be expanded, and grants would be provided to facilitate the transfer of spent fuel. This legislation is similar to previous bills introduced in the 114th Congress. The Dry Cask Storage Act of 2018 (H.R. 4891) addresses concerns about spent fuel storage in nuclear power plants. It requires plants to transfer spent fuel to dry storage facilities within seven years, with expanded emergency planning zones. The bill allows NRC to use interest from the Nuclear Waste Fund for grants to facilitate the transfer. This legislation is similar to previous bills introduced in the 114th Congress. The proposed legislation, S. 854, aimed to establish nuclear waste storage facilities with the consent of state, local, and tribal governments. It required the opening of a pilot storage facility by 2021 for priority waste and a permanent repository by 2048. Financial compensation and incentives were to be offered for hosting these facilities, with preference given to sites that included both storage and a repository. The Nuclear Waste Administration (NWA) would have been authorized to offer financial compensation and incentives for hosting nuclear waste storage and disposal facilities. Highly radioactive defense waste could be placed in defense-only storage facilities under S. 854. President Obama authorized DOE to pursue a defense-only repository in 2015. Nuclear waste fees collected after the bill's enactment would be held in a Working Capital Fund. The disposal limit of 70,000 metric tons for the first repository under NWPA would have been repealed. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held a hearing on S. 1240 in 2013. The disposal limit of 70,000 metric tons for the first repository under NWPA would have been repealed. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held a hearing on S. 1240 in 2013, with various stakeholders expressing their opinions on the bill. The bill, S. 854, raises concerns about allowing temporary waste storage facilities without progress on a permanent repository and inadequate state authority to regulate safety. The Senate approved funding for DOE to develop a pilot spent fuel interim storage facility. Similar language was included in previous energy and water bills. The debate over nuclear waste policy was influenced by the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident in Japan in 2011. Legislation has been introduced to require the NRC to maintain safety standards. The debate over nuclear waste policy was influenced by the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident in Japan in 2011. Legislation introduced by Senator Barbara Boxer in 2015 aimed to maintain safety standards for spent fuel storage. NRC released a study in 2013 stating that expedited transfer of spent fuel to dry cask storage would provide limited safety benefits. Radioactive waste varies in characteristics and some types remain dangerous for thousands of years. Some radioactive waste is safe to handle in unshielded containers, while others are intensely hot and remain dangerous for thousands of years. Major types include spent nuclear fuel, which is highly radioactive and contains short-lived fission products and long-lived radionuclides like plutonium. High-level waste is created from spent fuel reprocessing, mostly for defense purposes. High-level waste is highly radioactive residue created from spent fuel reprocessing, containing radioactive fission products and long-lived radionuclides like plutonium. Transuranic waste is low-activity waste with long-lived elements heavier than uranium, primarily plutonium, requiring radiation shielding. In the United States, transuranic waste is generated mainly from nuclear weapons production processes and requires long-term isolation. The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in Carlsbad, NM, is the nation's only permanent repository for transuranic waste. In the United States, transuranic waste is mainly from nuclear weapons production and requires long-term isolation due to plutonium. The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in Carlsbad, NM, is the nation's only permanent repository for this waste. Low-level waste disposal facilities have NRC concentration limits and cannot accept material exceeding them. Low-level waste disposal facilities have NRC concentration limits and cannot accept material exceeding them. Uranium mill tailings are sand-like residues from uranium ore processing with low radioactivity but large volumes that can pose hazards. Mixed waste includes chemically hazardous waste with radioactive material, regulated by DOE or NRC for radioactive elements and EPA for nonradioactive elements. When spent nuclear fuel is removed from a reactor, it is thermally hot and highly radioactive, stored in deep pools of water to prevent overheating. The fuel assemblies consist of metal-clad fuel rods containing uranium enriched in U-235, which after fission becomes highly radioactive fission products. Some U-238 nuclei absorb neutrons and decay into radioactive plutonium. Spent nuclear fuel, containing radioactive fission products, is stored in deep pools of water near reactors to prevent overheating. Older fuel is transferred to dry canisters for long-term storage at radiation-shielded facilities. The NRC mandates a cooling period of 7-10 years before transfer to dry storage. Currently, 80,000 metric tons of spent fuel are stored at various nuclear plant sites in the U.S. The U.S. nuclear power industry has accumulated around 80,000 metric tons of spent fuel by the end of 2017, exceeding the 70,000-metric-ton limit for Yucca Mountain. Additional storage capacity is needed as the total amount of spent fuel may eventually reach 105,000 to 130,000 metric tons. The U.S. nuclear power industry has accumulated around 80,000 metric tons of spent fuel by the end of 2017, exceeding the 70,000-metric-ton limit for Yucca Mountain. DOE estimates that total spent fuel may reach 105,000 to 130,000 metric tons. New storage capacity will be needed if disposal is delayed. Concerns about terrorist attacks and overheating of spent fuel have been raised. The NRC and NAS reports highlight the risk of terrorist attacks on spent fuel pools, with the potential for overheating and fires releasing radioactivity. Recommendations include interspersing hotter and cooler fuel assemblies, installing spray systems, and transferring fuel to dry cask storage. The nuclear industry argues that there is ample time to cool the fuel before a fire occurs. NRC's 2013 report found minimal safety benefits in expedited fuel transfers. The NRC's 2013 report found minimal safety benefits in expedited transfers of spent fuel from pools to dry casks. Recommendations include ensuring electrical power and water spray systems for spent fuel pools. NRC also approved an order in 2012 requiring improved water-level monitoring equipment at reactors' spent fuel pools. In 2017, 5.1 million cubic feet of low-level waste with 57,179 curies of radioactivity was shipped to disposal sites, with volumes varying yearly based on decommissioning projects and cleanup activities. In 2017, 5.1 million cubic feet of low-level waste with 57,179 curies of radioactivity was shipped to commercial disposal sites. The volume and radioactivity of low-level waste can vary yearly based on nuclear decommissioning projects and cleanup activities. Low-level radioactive waste is categorized into Class A, B, and C for handling and disposal, with most of the radioactivity found in classes B and C. The disposal of spent fuel and high-level waste is a federal responsibility, while states can develop disposal facilities for commercial low-level waste. The Yucca Mountain repository was halted by the Obama Administration after FY2010, despite being the sole candidate site for civilian waste disposal. The Obama Administration halted development of the Yucca Mountain repository for highly radioactive waste disposal after FY2010. The Trump Administration is proposing to revive the program in FY2019 with funding for Yucca Mountain and interim nuclear waste storage. DOE issued an alternative waste management strategy in 2013 for a pilot facility by 2021 and a new repository by 2048, requiring new legislation. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 established a system for selecting a geologic repository for up to 70,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 established a system for selecting a geologic repository for up to 70,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste. DOE's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) was created to carry out the program, funded by the Nuclear Waste Fund. The program was modified by the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1987, allowing DOE to consider only one candidate site for the national high-level waste repository. The Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1987 modified the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, allowing DOE to consider only one candidate site for the national high-level waste repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. Construction of a monitored retrievable storage facility was also authorized, but cannot begin until Yucca Mountain receives a construction permit. DOE has not announced plans for siting the storage facility. The law prohibits DOE from selecting an MRS site until recommending a permanent repository at Yucca Mountain. The Obama Administration halted funding for Yucca Mountain and transferred waste management functions to DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended a new, consent-based approach to siting nuclear waste facilities. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended a new, consent-based approach to siting nuclear waste facilities, emphasizing negotiations with affected states, tribes, and local governments to establish legally binding agreements on project parameters. The commission expressed confidence in the success of this process, citing the example of the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended establishing a congressionally chartered federal corporation for a new waste management program, independent from Administration control. They called for prompt efforts to develop a permanent underground nuclear waste repository and interim storage facilities. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended creating a federal corporation for a new waste management program, emphasizing the need for interim storage facilities to remove waste from shutdown reactor sites. The DOE issued a strategy in 2013 for managing and disposing of nuclear waste, including plans for opening interim storage facilities by 2021 and 2025. The strategy aims to link the interim storage facility to the development of a permanent repository. A fuel storage facility focusing on spent fuel from decommissioned nuclear plants is set to open by 2021, with a larger interim storage facility planned for 2025. The DOE strategy aims to connect the interim storage facility to a permanent repository, with a geologic disposal facility scheduled to open by 2048. Sites for these facilities will be selected through a \"consent based\" process. The DOE strategy aims to open a geologic disposal facility by 2048, with site selection by 2016 and completion of site suitability studies by 2042. The process for selecting sites for storage and disposal facilities would be \"consent based,\" but details on implementation were lacking. The Obama Administration planned to consult with Congress and interest groups on defining and codifying consent. The waste program would be managed by a new entity, but specifics were not provided. Senator Alexander introduced a bill in the 114th Congress to modify the waste program in line with the Administration's strategy. The DOE's waste management strategy includes opening a geologic disposal facility by 2048, with site selection by 2016. A bill introduced in the 114th Congress by Senator Alexander aimed to modify the waste program in line with the Obama Administration's strategy. Other proposals suggest privatizing waste management services. DOE's 2014 report recommended testing a consent-based approach for siting a separate repository for defense and research waste, separate from civilian waste. This would reverse the long-standing federal policy of a single repository for both types of waste. The Obama Administration authorized DOE to plan a separate underground repository for high-level radioactive waste from nuclear defense activities. GAO criticized DOE's analysis of the defense-only repository in 2017, leading to bills being introduced to delay the plan. President Obama blocked DOE's preferred rail route to Yucca Mountain in 2015, but other potential routes were still available. Waste Control Specialists filed for waste management services. President Obama blocked DOE's preferred rail route to Yucca Mountain in 2015, leading to bills being introduced to delay the plan. Waste Control Specialists filed for an NRC license to develop a consolidated interim storage facility in Texas, forming a joint venture with Orano USA for the project. The proposed facility would be built at a 14,000-acre site near Andrews, TX, with construction planned in eight phases. The proposed WCS spent fuel storage facility in Texas would consist of dry casks on concrete pads, with a total capacity of 40,000 metric tons. DOE would take title to spent fuel at nuclear plant sites, ship it to the Texas site, and pay WCS for storage for up to 40 years. WCS argues that a privately developed facility would not be bound by NWPA restrictions. Holtec International filed an NRC license application for a spent fuel storage facility in New Mexico on March 30, 2017. A new spent fuel storage facility in New Mexico, proposed by Holtec International, would not be restricted by NWPA regulations like the Yucca Mountain project. The facility would be located near the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, supported by local officials and potentially accepting high-level waste with state assistance. Governor Susana Martinez endorsed the project, but state senators Tom Udall and Martin Heinrich opposed an interim storage facility. The proposed spent fuel storage facility in New Mexico, supported by Governor Susana Martinez, faces opposition from state senators Tom Udall and Martin Heinrich due to the lack of a plan for permanent disposal. Public support for expanded waste activities in the state may be affected by a 2014 radioactive release from the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. Interest in hosting nuclear waste sites has also been expressed in Mississippi and Loving County, Texas. Legislation has been introduced to authorize the Department of Energy to enter into contracts with privately owned spent fuel storage facilities. A bill (H.R. 474) introduced by Representative Issa on January 12, 2017, authorizes DOE to enter contracts with privately owned spent fuel storage facilities. The bill is similar to previous legislation (H.R. 3643) introduced in the 114th Congress. DOE would take title to all spent nuclear fuel from commercial reactors delivered to the private storage facility. Annual interest from the Nuclear Waste Fund could be used by DOE to pay for private interim storage. The bill has 33 cosponsors, including 14 from Texas. Another bill (H.R. 3053) approved by the House Energy and Commerce Committee includes provisions for a private-sector MRS facility. An earlier effort to develop a private spent fuel storage facility was undertaken after DOE missed the 1998 deadline for taking nuclear waste from reactor sites. An earlier effort to develop a private spent fuel storage facility was undertaken after DOE missed the 1998 deadline for taking nuclear waste from reactor sites. A utility consortium signed an agreement with the Skull Valley Band of the Goshute Indians in Utah to develop a storage facility on tribal land. The Private Fuel Storage (PFS) consortium obtained a 20-year license for storing up to 44,000 tons of spent fuel in dry casks, but the Department of the Interior issued decisions against the project due to concerns about the risk of waste remaining indefinitely at the site and environmental compatibility issues. The Bureau of Land Management rejected rights-of-way for waste transport to the facility due to environmental concerns. The Skull Valley Band of Goshutes and PFS filed a lawsuit to challenge Interior decisions. PFS later requested termination of its license. The Obama Administration attempted to redirect the nuclear waste program, but current law still focuses on Yucca Mountain. NWPA mandates NRC licensing for high-level waste repositories. EPA was required to establish repository standards for Yucca Mountain. DOE must follow NRC-approved siting guidelines for the repository. The NWPA mandates NRC licensing for high-level waste repositories like Yucca Mountain. EPA sets repository standards for Yucca Mountain, and DOE must follow NRC-approved siting guidelines. Transportation of waste is regulated by NRC and DOT, with specific requirements for shipments to Yucca Mountain and MRS facilities. NRC's licensing requirements for Yucca Mountain include compliance with EPA standards and procedures for seeking a repository license. The DOE must follow NRC-approved procedures to seek a license for the Yucca Mountain repository, including a performance confirmation program to ensure system functionality. Specific standards for Yucca Mountain were established to meet radiation dose limits recommended by the National Academy of Sciences. The National Academy of Sciences recommended Yucca Mountain environmental standards to limit risk to individuals near the repository, rather than specific limits on radioactive material releases. EPA proposed radiation protection standards in 1999, aiming for annual radiation doses of 15 millirems for the maximally exposed individual and 4 millirems from groundwater exposure for the first 10,000 years of operation. The nuclear industry criticized the proposal as overly stringent. The EPA proposed radiation protection standards in 1999 for the Yucca Mountain repository, including an annual radiation dose limit of 15 millirems for the maximally exposed individual and 4 millirems from groundwater exposure for the first 10,000 years of operation. Despite opposition from the nuclear industry, the final standards were issued in 2001, with the site deemed able to meet them. The NRC revised its regulations to conform to the EPA standards, but a court panel later struck down the 10,000-year compliance period. The DOE's site suitability evaluation determined that Yucca Mountain could meet EPA standards, but a court panel later struck down the 10,000-year compliance period. EPA proposed new standards in 2005, retaining dose limits for the first 10,000 years but allowing higher doses thereafter. The EPA proposed new Yucca Mountain standards in 2005, with a higher annual dose limit of 350 millirems for 10,000 years through 1 million years. Nevada officials criticized the leniency of the proposed standard. In 2008, the final rule reduced the annual dose limit to 100 millirems for the same period. Compliance with post-10,000-year standards will be based on the mean dose. NRC updated licensing regulations to align with the new EPA standards in 2009. Under the final rule, compliance with the post-10,000-year standard will be based on the arithmetic mean of projected doses, rather than the median as proposed. The 4 millirem groundwater standard will continue to apply only to the first 10,000 years. NRC revised its repository licensing regulations to conform to the new EPA standards on April 13, 2009. DOE estimated in its June 2008 Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (FSEIS) for the Yucca Mountain repository that the maximum mean annual individual dose after 10,000 years would be 2 millirems. This is substantially lower than the peak doses estimated in the 2002 Final Environmental Impact Statement, which calculated doses of about 150 millirems occurring after 400,000 years. DOE's Fuel Cycle Research and Development Program conducts research on technologies for managing spent nuclear fuel. The DOE's Fuel Cycle Research and Development Program conducts research on technologies for managing spent nuclear fuel. The Trump Administration's budget proposals for FY2018 and FY2019 included funding for nuclear waste processing and disposal R&D, but eliminated funding for the Obama Administration's integrated waste strategy. The FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act allocated funds for generic nuclear waste R&D and integrated waste management activities. The program focuses on technology for reprocessing spent fuel to convert long-lived radionuclides into faster-decaying fission products. The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget includes $10 million for waste disposal R&D and no funding for integrated waste management. The Fuel Cycle R&D program focuses on technology for reprocessing spent fuel to convert long-lived radionuclides into faster-decaying fission products. The Nuclear Waste Fund balance was $37.2 billion at the end of FY2017, with $7.41 billion disbursed for the Yucca Mountain project before it was halted in FY2010. The total cost of the Yucca Mountain program was estimated at $96.2 billion in 2007 dollars. The Waste Fund disbursed $7.41 billion after FY2010. The Yucca Mountain program was estimated to cost $96.2 billion from 1983 to 2133. States handle low-level radioactive waste disposal under the 1980 Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act. Most states are part of interstate compacts for disposal. Two commercial low-level waste disposal facilities remain in Barnwell, SC, and Hanford, WA. The nation's commercial low-level waste disposal facilities may refuse waste from outside their regional compacts after 1992. One site in Beatty, NV, closed, leaving two sites in Barnwell, SC, and Hanford, WA, to prohibit waste from outside their compacts. A new disposal facility in Andrews, TX, opened in 2012 to alleviate storage issues for Class A, B, and C waste. The facility can also accept waste from other states, with the first shipment received from Vermont in 2012. Legislation for the Texas compact was signed in 1998. The Texas disposal site in Andrews, TX, received its first waste shipment from Vermont in 2012. Legislation for the Texas compact was signed in 1998, but a proposed site near Sierra Blanca was rejected. Governor Rick Perry authorized the licensing of disposal facilities in 2003, leading to the approval and construction of the Andrews County facility in 2011. The Barnwell, SC facility is currently accepting low-level waste from the Atlantic Compact. The Waste Control Specialists LLC filed for a license in August 2004, which was approved by TCEQ in January 2009. The Barnwell facility in South Carolina is currently accepting low-level waste from the Atlantic Compact, with restrictions on non-compact waste acceptance. South Carolina's attempts to open the facility to waste generators outside the Southeast Compact were rejected, leading to the state's withdrawal from the compact in 1995. The rejection of South Carolina's proposals in 1995 led to the state's withdrawal from the Southeast Compact, allowing waste acceptance at Barnwell from all states except North Carolina. North Carolina also withdrew from the compact in 1999. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2010 that North Carolina was not subject to sanctions for its withdrawal. The Hanford site in Washington is the only other facility accepting all classes of low-level waste, controlled by the Northwest Compact. Licensing for low-level waste facilities is regulated by the NRC or approved state programs under the Atomic Energy Act, following environmental and radiation protection guidelines. Transport of low-level waste is also regulated. The NRC regulates licensing of commercial low-level waste facilities under the Atomic Energy Act. NRC regulations must adhere to environmental and radiation protection standards set by the EPA. Transportation of low-level waste is jointly regulated by NRC and the Department of Transportation. Proposed modifications to disposal regulations were submitted by NRC in 2015 and further revisions were issued in 2017 to establish time periods for technical analyses of waste sites for population protection. The NRC staff proposed new regulations in 2015 and revised them in 2017 to establish time periods for technical analyses of low-level waste sites. The analyses would ensure protection of the general population, with a 1,000-year compliance period for sites without significant quantities of long-lived radioactive material, and a 10,000-year compliance period for sites with significant quantities. Additional post-10,000-year analysis may be required in certain cases, along with new technical analyses to protect inadvertent intruders at low-level waste sites. The disposal of radioactive waste is a key issue in the nuclear power debate, especially with the need for a national waste management system to address on-site storage of spent fuel from nuclear power plants. Public concern has been raised, particularly near proposed reactor sites without existing reactors where spent nuclear fuel is already stored, due to safety concerns heightened by the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant disaster in 2011. The federal government's nuclear waste disposal policy is focused on the Yucca Mountain site, but President Obama terminated the project. The NRC found in 2014 that the site would meet standards after closure. The Trump Administration proposed restarting licensing, and Senator Reid's retirement may impact legislative action on nuclear waste in Congress. The Trump Administration's proposal to restart Yucca Mountain licensing and the potential impact of Senator Reid's retirement on legislative action regarding nuclear waste in the 115th Congress have been highlighted. The Administration's request for $120 million in FY2018 for Yucca Mountain licensing and spent fuel storage was not approved, but the request has been repeated for FY2019. Existing reactor owners may seek damages from the federal government due to disposal delays, with potential liabilities estimated at up to $34.1 million by the DOE. The DOE estimates potential liabilities for waste program delays could reach $34.1 billion, with existing reactor owners seeking damages from the federal government. The nuclear industry predicts future damages could rise by tens of billions more if the disposal program fails. Lack of a disposal system could impact licensing of new nuclear plants and compliance deadlines for defense waste disposal. Options to address delays include centralized interim storage and reprocessing technology. The Blue Ribbon Commission addressed problems caused by nuclear waste disposal delays in its final report, recommending options such as centralized interim storage, continued storage at existing sites, reprocessing technology, and development of alternative repository sites. The commission suggested establishing a congressionally chartered corporation for siting new waste facilities, but due to ongoing delays, longer on-site storage is likely. The \"consent based\" siting process has attracted interest from localities in New Mexico and Texas. The \"consent based\" siting process for nuclear waste disposal, recommended by the Blue Ribbon Commission, has attracted interest from localities in New Mexico and Texas. Previous voluntary siting efforts faced challenges from potential host states, highlighting the importance of state cooperation for success.
