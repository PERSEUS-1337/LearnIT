    "content": "The \"Import Control and Safe Handling of Spent Nuclear Fuel Act of 1995\" prohibits the import of spent nuclear fuel into the United States unless approved by Congress, licensed by the appropriate Federal agency, and operating repositories are in place. National security exceptions are also outlined. SEC. 3 of the \"Import Control and Safe Handling of Spent Nuclear Fuel Act of 1995\" outlines national security exceptions for importing spent nuclear fuel, allowing imports from countries suspected of nuclear weapons development with presidential approval and notification to relevant committees. Additionally, SEC. 4 mandates guidelines by port authorities for safe shipment of certain materials. Port authorities have the authority to establish guidelines for the safe handling of spent nuclear fuel at marine ports, ensuring public health and safety. Guidelines may include worker training, response plans for emergencies, and community notification. Before spent nuclear fuel can enter the port, a response plan must be in place covering containment in case of fire, spill response, and other contingencies. Local communities must be informed of the unloading, transfer, or shipment of the fuel, with guidelines including standards for storage or parking of casks and prohibitions against movement under certain conditions that could increase radiation exposure or accident risks. The guidelines prohibit the movement of spent nuclear fuel from the port under certain conditions to prevent increased radiation exposure or accident risks. Worker radiation exposure levels must not exceed public standards. The guidelines are more protective of public health and safety than other applicable laws. Other laws governing fuel shipment do not prevent the enforcement of these guidelines. The Act does not impact the port's liability in handling nuclear materials. Definitions are provided in the Act. The Act defines \"atomic energy defense activity\" as functions carried out by the Secretary of Energy, \"port authority\" as an authority with jurisdiction over port operations in the US, and \"repository\" as defined in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. The term \"port authority\" refers to a local, regional, State, or interstate authority with jurisdiction over port operations in the United States. The terms \"repository\" and \"spent nuclear fuel\" are defined in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982."
