    "content": "Critical infrastructure (CI) encompasses machinery, facilities, and information crucial for governance, public health, and the economy. Adverse events can result from disruptions to CI systems, whether due to natural disasters or deliberate attacks. This report outlines key policy concerns for Congress, including defining and identifying CI, assessing CI risk, federal organization for CI, and the role of the private sector. Presidential Decision Directive 63 (PDD-63) in 1998 was the first policy guidance on critical infrastructure protection, emphasizing national vulnerability to asymmetric attacks and the importance of CI for national power. The Presidential Decision Directive 63 (PDD-63) in 1998 highlighted the critical infrastructure issue and the national vulnerability to asymmetric attacks. It emphasized the interdependence of economic and military power on critical infrastructure. PDD-63 aimed to eliminate national vulnerability to non-traditional attacks on critical infrastructure, but challenges remain in assessing the criticality of specific assets due to the complexity and interconnectedness of the U.S. and global economies. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 defines critical infrastructure as vital systems and assets that, if incapacitated or destroyed, would have a debilitating impact on national security, economic security, public health, or safety. Critical infrastructure policy has evolved to consider not only physical attributes but also perspectives, values, and priorities of those involved in assessments. The complexity and interconnectedness of the U.S. and global economies make it challenging to identify and inventory critical assets and systems. The definition of critical infrastructure includes systems and assets vital to the United States, with a focus on national security, economic security, public health, and safety. The policy has expanded to include essential services and conveniences to the public, with a growing concern for asymmetric threats from state and non-state adversaries using physical or cyber means to disrupt infrastructure. Natural disasters and other causes of damage are also considered in addition to intentional acts of terrorism. The definition of critical infrastructure has expanded to include essential services and conveniences to the public, with a growing concern for asymmetric threats from state and non-state adversaries using physical or cyber means to disrupt infrastructure. Natural disasters and other causes of damage are also considered in addition to intentional acts of terrorism. Policymakers have lowered the threshold of criticality to include infrastructure-related events with disruptive effects at all levels of society and government, reflecting local, society-centric perspectives on infrastructure as an enabler of prosperity, public safety, and civic life. The National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) defines critical infrastructure as assets, systems, and networks that support American society, considering a wide range of natural and manmade hazards. The CI policy has evolved to focus on society-centric resilience at the system level rather than security-oriented protection of specific assets. In 2017, the Department of Homeland Security designated U.S. election systems as critical infrastructure, along with government facilities, national monuments, and education facilities. The Department of Homeland Security designated U.S. election systems as critical infrastructure in January 2017, including physical locations and technology infrastructure. This designation is part of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors outlined in Presidential Policy Directive 21 (PPD-21) for public-private partnerships to support the nation's civic life. The federal government uses critical infrastructure (CI) sectors as an organizing framework for public-private partnerships with self-identified CI owner-operators. DHS has overall responsibility for coordination of partnership programs, with other federal agencies serving as Sector-Specific Agencies (SSAs). Each officially-designated CI sector has formal coordination bodies involving private sector stakeholders and SLTT governments. The expanding definitions of critical infrastructure have policy implications for Congress. Each sector has formal coordination bodies with private sector stakeholders and SLTT governments. New communities of interest emerge within the critical infrastructure enterprise, leading to diverse perspectives on criticality. Definitions of critical infrastructure are not static, reflecting evolving interests and perspectives. The definition of critical infrastructure has not changed in nearly two decades, but the identification and prioritization of critical systems and assets continue to evolve. This reflects diverse interests and perspectives, with various official definitions in use. Critical infrastructure policy has two orientations: critical infrastructure protection (CIP) focuses on identifying and protecting assets, while criticality is defined by the consequences of asset loss or disruption. This reflects different organizational perspectives and requirements. Critical infrastructure protection (CIP) emphasizes identifying, prioritizing, and protecting infrastructure assets based on the consequences of asset loss or system disruption. Critical infrastructure resilience (CIR) focuses on investments in hazard mitigation, preparedness, and adaptation to ensure availability of critical infrastructure functions. National CI policy reflects a hybrid approach combining elements of both CIP and CIR, favoring system resilience over asset protection. The United States and other developed countries have shifted towards a focus on system resilience in national critical infrastructure policy, combining elements of both asset protection and system resilience. This approach introduces complexities in defining criticality and identifying what is critical in different contexts. Legislation and government directives post-9/11 have emphasized creating asset lists to identify critical systems requiring higher levels of protection against threats. However, the application of this logic often leads to practical complexities at the national level. The focus on system resilience in national critical infrastructure policy has led to the need for identifying critical systems and assets that require higher levels of protection against threats. Inventory requirements are a key step in broader risk management strategies for critical infrastructure protection. The criteria for defining criticality continue to be debated, but asset lists help determine which assets are considered critical in practice. The National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets, released in 2003, was an early example of a CIP-based inventory requirement. The National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets, released in 2003, directed the development of a uniform methodology to identify critical facilities and build a comprehensive database. This was followed by Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 in December 2003, which prioritized the protection of critical infrastructure and key resources. Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD-7) in 2003 directed federal departments to prioritize the protection of critical infrastructure and key resources. A 2006 DHS Inspector General report found shortcomings in the early efforts to compile a national database of critical infrastructure assets, with entries ranging from nuclear power plants to petting zoos and water parks. The National Asset Database grew significantly from 160 key assets in 2003 to 77,069 assets in 2006, including a wide range of assets from nuclear power plants to petting zoos and water parks. The database had entries of \"unusual\" assets without clear criticality, and data collection procedures were not standardized. The 9-11 Commission Act of 2007 mandated the compilation of a national database of vital systems and creation of a classified list of prioritized critical infrastructure to be updated annually. The 9-11 Commission Act of 2007 mandated the compilation of a national database of vital systems and creation of a classified list of prioritized critical infrastructure to be updated annually. The classified list includes assets that would cause national or regional catastrophic effects if disrupted. The Government Accountability Office found that DHS improved its critical asset identification processes, but questions remained about reporting criteria and methodology. The report highlighted changes in nomination and adjudication criteria for the National Critical Infrastructure Prioritization Program (NCIPP) established by DHS to comply with the 9-11 Commission Act. NCIPP assessed criticality based on potential consequences like fatalities, economic loss, mass evacuation length, and national security impacts. Methodological adjustments were made to account for unique characteristics of critical infrastructure. The report recommended an independent peer review of asset nomination vetting methods to ensure the identification of the nation's highest priority infrastructure. The report recommended an independent peer review of asset nomination vetting methods for the National Critical Infrastructure Prioritization Program (NCIPP) to identify the nation's highest priority infrastructure. Despite the significant ramifications of the NCIPP list, some state governments were opting not to participate in DHS data calls due to compliance burdens, technical limitations, and cost-benefit calculations. The 2013 GAO report found that some state governments were not participating in DHS data calls for the National Critical Infrastructure Prioritization Program (NCIPP) due to compliance burdens, technical limitations, and cost-benefit calculations. States cited a lack of expertise in developing scenarios and modeling complex infrastructure systems, leading to an incomplete national inventory of critical systems and assets. DHS was also unable to provide documentation for statutory reporting requirements, indicating persistent difficulties in ensuring the completeness and currency of centralized inventories of critical infrastructure assets. Persistent difficulties exist in ensuring the completeness, quality, and currency of centralized inventories of critical infrastructure assets. The Critical Infrastructure Resilience (CIR) approach prioritizes adaptive use of critical capabilities to maintain service continuity during stress periods. The Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) database, managed by DHS, DOD, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, and U.S. Geological Survey, compiles data from public and private sector partners for emergency planning and contingency purposes. The Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) database, managed by DHS, DOD, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, and U.S. Geological Survey, compiles data from public and private sector partners for emergency planning and contingency purposes. HIFLD includes critical infrastructure assets essential for homeland security functions, as well as non-critical assets that may become critical in specific emergencies or policy decisions. The Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) database includes critical infrastructure assets essential for homeland security functions, as well as non-critical assets that may become critical in specific emergencies or policy decisions. For example, during the 2017 hurricane season, HHS used HIFLD to locate day care centers in impacted areas, which were essential for providing critical public health services. The HIFLD partnership model aims to enable relevant agencies and private sector entities to leverage infrastructure data for real-world use cases. The HIFLD partnership model enables agencies and private sector entities to use infrastructure data for real-world use cases, without directly supporting federal oversight. It is widely used for preparedness and incident management activities by federal and SLTT agencies. The development of HIFLD partnerships contrasts with declining state participation in NCIPP. CIP-based approaches to inventory of critical infrastructure assets remain relevant, as seen in provisions of the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act related to national preparedness against electromagnetic threats. CIP-based approaches to inventory of critical infrastructure assets remain relevant, with specific regulations in place for high-risk facilities. Policy shifts towards system-level resilience may impact legacy programs like NCIPP. Congressional consideration is needed for stakeholder participation costs and potential reduction in asset-protection approaches. Continuing policy changes by DHS may reduce the profile of NCIPP and asset-protection approaches to CI risk management. Congress should consider stakeholder participation costs, data call frequency, and updates to National Asset Database requirements to align with emerging CISA programs and priorities. Efforts to prioritize CI systems and assets are part of a national risk assessment for homeland security. The national effort to understand and assess homeland security risks involves risk assessments used for planning and resource allocation decisions. DHS defines risk as the potential for unwanted outcomes from incidents, events, or occurrences, considering threat, vulnerability, and consequence factors. Threat assessments include data on human adversaries or natural hazards. DHS defines threat as a potential harm to life, information, operations, environment, or property, including human adversaries or natural hazards. Threat assessments consider threat actors, motivations, capabilities, and observed targets. Vulnerability is defined as a feature that makes an entity open to exploitation or damage. Vulnerability assessments identify characteristics that may leave assets or systems susceptible to threats or hazards. Vulnerability assessments provide information about characteristics of assets or systems that may leave them open to exploitation or damage from a threat or hazard. Assessments may contain recommendations for adoption of resilience measures to mitigate identified vulnerabilities. Criticality assessments focus on potential consequences of adverse events that disrupt or destroy infrastructure systems and assets, using various technical and non-technical methods. Research centers, universities, and industry groups develop different modeling methodologies to inform infrastructure security investments. Since 2007, DHS has utilized a risk formula (R=f(TVC)) to guide planning, programs, and budget activities, where risk is a function of threat, vulnerability, and consequence. Critics question the formula's accuracy in assigning probabilities to rare events like terrorist attacks and determining precise values for each term, as well as the interdependence of the terms. DHS has faced criticism for its risk formula's inability to accurately assign probabilities to rare events like terrorist attacks and determine precise values for each term. The complex interactions between threat, vulnerability, and consequences make applying the formula to decision-making challenging. In response, DHS recognized the need for a comprehensive risk assessment approach for critical infrastructure (CI) in 2018 and proposed revisions. Legislative and executive initiatives in 2018-2019 led to the creation of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to enhance CI risk management. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Act of 2018 created CISA as an operational component of DHS to manage national CI risk through the National Risk Management Center. CISA will adopt an evolved approach to CI risk management, emphasizing cross-sector analysis and capabilities-oriented approaches. Congress may request information on CISA's efforts to institutionalize new risk management methods validated by external reviewers. Relevant expertise in infrastructure risk assessment can be provided by National Laboratories, university-based DHS Centers of Excellence, industry research groups, and the Homeland Security Advisory Council. The Homeland Security Act specifies how organizational resources can be leveraged to support homeland security activities. Congress can establish funding priorities and program guidance for organizations to support national critical infrastructure security goals. Federal organization addressing critical infrastructure issues has evolved in response to threats, with three distinct periods of development outlined. The development of federal attention to critical infrastructure (CI) policy increased in the late 1990s due to concerns about cyber threats. The Clinton Administration established the Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection in 1996, leading to the issuance of PDD-63 in 1998, which focused on eliminating vulnerabilities to cyber or physical attacks within five years. This marked a shift towards interagency coordination to address emerging threats. The Gilmore Commission, chartered by Congress in 1999, assessed terrorist threats and the implementation of PDD-63. The report found incomplete implementation of PDD-63 and limited development of critical infrastructure protection since 1998. The Gilmore Commission report in 2000 highlighted incomplete implementation of PDD-63 and limited progress in critical infrastructure protection since 1998. Key findings included embryonic Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs), lack of a national CIP strategy, and limited actions by the National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC) under FBI auspices. The 9/11 attacks spurred a renewed focus on homeland security. The 9/11 attacks prompted a renewed focus on homeland security and critical infrastructure protection. Two legislative tracks emerged: one favored reestablishing the Office of Homeland Security with added responsibilities, while the other favored comprehensive government consolidation. The second legislative track favored comprehensive consolidation of government counterterrorism functions under a single federal agency named the National Homeland Security Agency, following recommendations from the Hart-Rudman Commission. Key supporters in Congress believed that dispersing homeland security functions across various agencies left the nation vulnerable to terrorist attacks. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 reflected the Hart-Rudman Commission's approach. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 reflected the Hart-Rudman Commission's approach by consolidating government counterterrorism functions under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). This transfer included infrastructure security functions from various sectors such as business, finance, and public health. The creation of DHS was deemed high risk due to the management challenges of incorporating nearly three dozen federal agencies into four major directorates. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 consolidated government counterterrorism functions under the Department of Homeland Security, which included infrastructure security functions from various sectors. The new departmental structure prioritized homeland security missions, especially counterterrorism, representing a change in infrastructure policy. The Office of Management and Budget distinguished CIP as a separate but related mission, focusing on combating terrorism while acknowledging diverse infrastructure risks beyond terrorism. The authors justified distinguishing CIP as a separate but related mission, focusing on combating terrorism while acknowledging diverse infrastructure risks beyond terrorism. The 2001 report mentioned CIP efforts only where they directly impact the combating terrorism mission, with CIP funding overlapping counterterrorism being less than half of one percent of the total funding requested. After 9/11, infrastructure programs previously not seen as directly impacting counterterrorism were included in reports, reflecting the newfound centrality of counterterrorism priorities. The White House requested $12.1 billion for FY2004, showing the increased focus on counterterrorism efforts. The White House requested $12.1 billion for FY2004, a 450% increase over its pre-9/11 request, reflecting the heightened focus on counterterrorism efforts. The creation of the DHS consolidated more than half of the government's pre-9/11 homeland security funding under a single agency, institutionalizing CIP and other core homeland security missions. The new purpose-built department consolidated more than half of pre-9/11 homeland security funding under a single agency, ensuring CIP and other core missions were top federal priorities. Despite significant changes, CIP remains a highly distributed enterprise competing for limited resources. Counterterrorism remained a focal point for critical infrastructure security policy, but public perception of the terrorist threat had softened by the time Hurricane Katrina struck in 2005. By 2005, public perception of the terrorist threat had significantly softened, with only 6%-8% considering it a top concern. The failure of the levy system during Hurricane Katrina highlighted the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to various hazards beyond terrorism. This shift in focus led to renewed concerns about equipment failure, human error, weather disasters, and criminal activity in national policy discussions. The vulnerability of critical infrastructure to diverse hazards beyond terrorism was highlighted by the catastrophic floods in New Orleans. In 2006, the Critical Infrastructure Task Force argued for a shift towards improving resilience against various threats, not just focusing on protecting assets from terrorist attacks. The House Committee on Homeland Security also addressed resilience in 2008, with DHS officials emphasizing the importance of government policies that encourage resilience alongside protection. Subsequent policy documents placed greater emphasis on resilience. In 2008, the House Committee on Homeland Security held hearings on resilience, with DHS officials emphasizing government policies that encourage resilience alongside protection. The 2010 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review highlighted diverse missions and stakeholders in homeland security, addressing threats like natural disasters, cyberattacks, transnational crime, and contagious diseases. The review noted DHS's leadership in managing risks to critical infrastructure and other security missions. The Quadrennial Homeland Security Review (QHSR) highlighted various threats and hazards, including natural disasters, cyberattacks, transnational crime, and contagious diseases. It emphasized the decentralized nature of homeland security, with diverse stakeholders sharing responsibility. In 2013, PPD-21 replaced HSPD-7, focusing on all-hazards critical infrastructure resilience rather than just protection against terrorist threats. PPD-21, in force, influenced the 2013 NIPP by prioritizing all-hazards critical infrastructure resilience over just protection from terrorist threats. The 2014 QHSR expanded critical infrastructure security to include issues like aging systems and neglect, turning maintenance and utility provision into homeland security concerns. DHS failed to submit a QHSR to Congress in 2017, leaving no current departmental statement on infrastructure security priorities. The DHS did not submit a QHSR to Congress in 2017 as required, leading to a lack of current departmental-level statement on infrastructure security priorities. Negotiations continue on the boundaries of responsibility for critical infrastructure security, with shifts in responsibilities such as the transfer of the Plum Island Animal Disease Center from DHS to USDA in 2018. In 2018, Congress authorized the transfer of a replacement facility and its functions back to USDA from DHS. Critical infrastructure security has evolved into a distributed enterprise model emphasizing an all-hazards approach. Congress may consider the boundaries between homeland security and other infrastructure policy areas. The definition of homeland security is expanding beyond counterterrorism roots. DHS has not submitted a QHSR to Congress as required. The distributed enterprise model of critical infrastructure security blurs boundaries between homeland security and other infrastructure policy areas. Congress is interested in a more current strategy from DHS, as the last top-level strategy was submitted in 2014. The Quadrennial Homeland Security Review Technical Corrections Act of 2019 highlights congressional interest in homeland security strategy. The Quadrennial Homeland Security Review Technical Corrections Act of 2019 (H.R. 1892) passed the House of Representatives unanimously and was referred to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. The act aims to enhance DHS's strategy by requiring consultation with advisory committees, linking strategy with budgeting, and establishing new deadlines tied to the budget cycle. Congress has periodically redefined organizational relationships within DHS, transitioning from a centralized to a federated structure emphasizing operational components. The centralized directorate structure under headquarters management has transitioned to a more federated structure emphasizing operational components within DHS. The National Protection and Programs Directorate became an agency within DHS through the 2018 CISA Act. Congress may consider the nature of intra-Departmental organization and relationships within DHS to support the critical infrastructure security mission. The management of critical infrastructure risk in a complex ownership and regulatory environment presents enduring policy challenges, with a preference for voluntary collaboration between public and private sectors for investment in critical infrastructure security. The current partnership structure for critical infrastructure security involves voluntary collaboration between the public and private sectors, with CI owner-operators responsible for assessing and mitigating risks at the enterprise level. Government agencies are directed to manage risk at the national level, with a focus on incentives, information sharing, and voluntary investments in security. Private individuals and entities primarily handle investments in security, but the public and larger business community collectively bear many serious risks. Infrastructure security in the private sector involves collaboration between government and private entities to manage risks at the enterprise level. The responsibility for upfront costs and regulatory oversight measures is often debated, with the federal government relying on voluntary investments from the private sector to support national resilience goals. The 2013 NIPP emphasizes the importance of industry engagement in partnership efforts to invest in the national interest. The federal government relies on the private sector to develop CI risk management strategies and mitigation investments for national resilience goals. Government encourages industry to invest in the national interest through public-private partnerships, but effectiveness varies, especially for low-probability/high-consequence events. Incentives for industry participation include access to risk information, national-level risk analyses, and the opportunity to influence CI policy. The Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002 aims to reduce barriers to information sharing between the public and private sectors. The federal government relies on the private sector for CI risk management strategies and mitigation investments. Public-private partnerships are encouraged, but effectiveness varies for low-probability/high-consequence events. Incentives for industry participation include access to risk information, national-level analyses, and the opportunity to influence CI policy. The Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002 aims to facilitate information sharing between public and private sectors. Partnerships in advanced industrialized economies may not provide enough incentive for investments in resilience. Regulatory mandates are favored for critical infrastructure sectors with potentially catastrophic impacts. Collaborative approaches are more common as risks become privatized. Policymakers aim to limit government regulation in CI security. Policymakers aim to limit government regulation in critical infrastructure security, with various agencies having regulatory oversight in specific sectors such as oil and gas pipelines, port security, and chemical facilities. Other federal, state, and local agencies also have regulatory authorities related to infrastructure security, but not specific to homeland security. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) regulates civilian nuclear facilities with safety requirements stemming from the Three Mile Island incident. Infrastructure security relevant to homeland security, like facility protection, is overseen by the NRC, not DHS. Lessons from past experiences emphasize the separation of regulation and partnership roles in agencies. DHS focuses on enhancing voluntary infrastructure security programs. The DHS infrastructure security programs focus on enhancing voluntary collaboration with partners through information sharing, training, and coordination. Current CI partnership structures are organized under PPD-21 and implemented through sector and cross-sector partnerships outlined in the 2013 NIPP. The NIPP emphasizes distributed responsibility among stakeholders committed to national resilience goals, with partnerships administered by CISA and other federal agencies. The NIPP emphasizes distributed responsibility among stakeholders committed to national resilience goals, with partnerships administered by CISA and other federal agencies. Each of the 16 CI sectors has its own Government Coordinating Council (GCC) and Sector Coordinating Council (SCC) for interagency coordination. DHS leads or co-leads 10 of the 16 GCCs as the Sector-Specific Agency (SSA). Other SSAs include EPA, GSA, and various other federal departments. The Sector-Specific Agencies (SSAs), including DHS, EPA, GSA, and other federal departments, lead or co-lead Government Coordinating Councils (GCCs) for interagency coordination in 10 of the 16 Critical Infrastructure (CI) sectors. Sector Coordinating Councils (SCCs) are comprised of private-sector trade associations and CI owner-operators, working with the federal government to develop sector-specific infrastructure protection plans. SCCs have advisory, coordination, and information-sharing functions between government and private-sector stakeholders. The Sector Coordinating Councils (SCCs) are self-organized groups made up of private-sector trade associations and CI owner-operators. They are recognized by Government Coordinating Councils (GCCs) as \"appropriately representative\" of the sector and have advisory, coordination, and information-sharing functions with the federal government and private-sector stakeholders. SCCs may also support Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) specific to their sector. The National Council of ISACs lists 24 member organizations. Reliable data on private-sector participation in SCC activities across CI sectors is not available. Four cross-sector councils represent key stakeholder groups with broad interests not specific to one sector. Private-sector participation in SCC activities varies across CI sectors. Four cross-sector councils represent key stakeholder groups with broad interests. The councils include SLTTGCC, Critical Infrastructure Cross-Sector Council, Regional Consortium Coordinating Council, and Federal Senior Leadership Council. The FSLC, chaired by the CISA Director, leads the other councils. The Federal Senior Leadership Council (FSLC) leads cross-sector councils, forging policy consensus on CI risk management strategies, coordinating issue resolution, and collaborating with international partners. The Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council (CIPAC) provides legal exemptions for NIPP coordinating councils and member organizations to facilitate discussions. The Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council (CIPAC) was established in 2006 and its Charter has been renewed multiple times, most recently in 2018. CIPAC provides legal exemptions for NIPP coordinating councils and member organizations to facilitate discussions on sensitive topics related to infrastructure security. The Homeland Security Advisory Committee (HSAC) provides advice to the Secretary of Homeland Security on homeland security matters, with members appointed from various sectors. The National Infrastructure Advisory Council focuses on cybersecurity and emerging technologies. The National Infrastructure Advisory Council, established in 2001, consists of senior industry leaders advising the President and SSAs on CI policy. It serves as an intermediary between coordination councils, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the President, facilitating consultation between public and private sector representatives. The partnership structure is flat and includes subcommittees focusing on cybersecurity and emerging technologies. The National Infrastructure Advisory Council advises on critical infrastructure policy, with a flat partnership structure involving coordination councils and subcommittees. The partnership activities include symposia, research collaborations, working groups, policy deliberations, and emergency preparedness. The National Infrastructure Coordinating Center (NICC) collects, analyzes, and shares threat information across the critical infrastructure partnership network. The distributed partnership structure maintained by DHS includes the National Infrastructure Coordinating Center (NICC) and the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC), both administered by CISA. These centers collect, analyze, and share threat information in real-time, provide decision support, and monitor cybersecurity incidents to enhance industry investment in system-level resilience. The current partnership system administered by CISA includes the NICC and NCCIC, aiming to enhance industry investment in system-level resilience through information sharing. Key questions revolve around private sector collaboration, incentivizing investments in risk reduction, and appropriate legislative remedies. Empirical analyses on the effectiveness of collaboration within this voluntary framework are limited. The effectiveness of collaboration within the critical infrastructure enterprise varies across sectors. Studies have shown that strong communities of interest are more prevalent in sectors with specific threats. Private-sector risk mitigation investment is primarily driven by cost-benefit analysis. Government support for externalized social costs incurred by terrorist attacks is a common expectation among CI owner-operators. Challenges in DHS partnership efforts have been identified, impacting the effectiveness of the partnership approach. The GAO testified to Congress in 2014 about challenges in DHS partnership efforts, including barriers to sharing information, sharing assessment results, and evaluating program effectiveness. DHS did not systematically collect data on industry participation in security surveys or measure security improvements. GAO highlighted the need for measures to assess program effectiveness. The GAO testified to Congress in 2014 about challenges in DHS partnership efforts, including barriers to sharing information, assessing program effectiveness, and collecting data on industry participation in security surveys. GAO recommended measures to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of partnership activities in meeting critical infrastructure resilience goals. Congress may explore DHS's progress in implementing data gathering and analysis initiatives to better assess the effectiveness of industry information sharing and investments in risk reduction. CISA has not provided reliable data on the reach and effectiveness of public-private partnership programs in incentivizing bidirectional information sharing and private investments in national resilience. Congress may address gaps in public-private partnership programs by introducing reporting requirements and enhancing regulatory authorities of federal departments and agencies to meet national critical infrastructure resilience goals. For example, the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 expands the jurisdiction of CFIUS to prevent foreign adversaries from exploiting the legitimate trade system to gain control of critical infrastructure assets. Congress may also exercise oversight in cases where regulatory authorities related to infrastructure security exist but are insufficient. The Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 (FIRRMA) expands CFIUS jurisdiction to prevent foreign adversaries from gaining control of critical infrastructure assets. Congress may consider adjusting partnership structures to align with federal risk management approach."
