The Congress finds that asthma affects 14.6 million Americans, including 4.8 million children, and is the most common chronic respiratory disease in children. The prevalence of asthma has increased significantly, especially among low-income families. The prevalence of asthma is higher in low-income families, with 79.2 out of 1,000 individuals under 45 in families earning less than $10,000 annually having asthma. In 1997, over 5,000 Americans died from asthma attacks, with African Americans having a higher average death rate than Caucasians. Asthma costs the US over $12 billion annually, and African Americans are more likely to seek emergency care for asthma. The asthma death rate is significantly higher among African American children and adults. African Americans are five times more likely to seek emergency care for asthma. The asthma death rate is four times higher among African American children and two times higher among all African Americans.
