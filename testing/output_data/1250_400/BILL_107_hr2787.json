    "content": "SECTION 1. REFERENCE. This Act amends provisions of the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990. SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. Congress finds that two-thirds of mothers with children under 6 years old are in the workforce, over 10 percent of young children have disabilities, and there is a limited supply of infant care and care for special needs children, especially in low-income communities. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act mandates early intervention and special education services for children with disabilities in natural environments. The General Accounting Office reports limited supply of infant care, special needs care, and care during nonstandard hours, especially in low-income communities. Children with disabilities face barriers in accessing child care programs due to myths, stereotypes, and lack of staff training. The purpose of the Act is to increase quality child care for children with disabilities. The Act aims to improve the quality of child care by expanding services for families with children with disabilities. Section 658G (42 U.S.C. 9858e) is amended to require states to allocate at least 5 percent of funds for activities that increase quality child care for children with disabilities, including training and technical assistance. The amendment to Section 658G requires states to allocate 5% of funds for child care activities for children with disabilities, including training and technical assistance for child care providers and parents on implementing disability laws. Training and support are provided to family home and center child care providers to better include children with disabilities in child care settings. This includes training on assistive technology, leadership skills for program development, and compliance with disability laws. Grants are provided for recruitment and retention of qualified child care staff, including scholarships for obtaining degrees or training in child development and increasing salaries for staff with advanced qualifications. Grants and low-interest loans are provided to public agencies and nonprofit organizations for projects that increase availability of inclusive child care programs, child care for infants, and child care during evenings and weekends.
