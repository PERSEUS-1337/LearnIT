    "content": "Ebola virus disease (Ebola, or EVD) is a severe, often fatal disease first detected in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1976. It is spread through contact with infected bodily fluids and has caused a large outbreak in West Africa. Nearly 10,000 people have been infected, with almost 5,000 deaths reported. WHO updates on EVD cases can be found at http://www.who.int/ebola. As of late October, nearly 10,000 people have contracted Ebola virus disease (EVD), with almost 5,000 deaths reported. WHO estimates actual cases may be higher due to inadequate surveillance. Mali reported its first EVD case, and WHO is sending a team to assist. Efforts are underway to develop Ebola vaccines and treatments. Supportive care is currently used to treat EVD symptoms. The WHO plans to test two Ebola vaccines on 20,000 health workers and volunteers in January. A treatment may be available in Liberia by early November. Supportive care can reduce the fatality rate of EVD. Disease surveillance and containment measures can limit the spread of Ebola. Manuals released by WHO outline patient care, safe burial practices, and diagnostic protocols. The current Ebola outbreak in West Africa is spreading quickly due to inadequate health systems in affected countries. The health systems in affected countries are ill-equipped to implement disease containment measures. Key factors distinguishing this outbreak include emergence in West Africa and simultaneous multi-country outbreaks. Disease transmission along shared borders has been intense, with cases imported into other countries. Contact tracing and containment efforts have halted spread in Senegal and Nigeria. WHO is investigating a new case in Mali. In October, health workers in the US and Spain contracted EVD while caring for patients. The Ebola outbreak in West Africa has resulted in 20 infections and 8 deaths in Nigeria, with a single case contained in Senegal. WHO is investigating a new case in Mali. Health workers in the US and Spain contracted EVD in October while caring for patients. The current outbreak is spreading in both rural and urban areas, with cases doubling every 15-40 days in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Urban areas are struggling to isolate cases due to lack of resources and health workers. The Ebola outbreak in West Africa has led to severe shortages of health workers and clinics, with cases doubling every 15-40 days in Liberia and Sierra Leone. A separate Ebola outbreak in the DRC has resulted in 66 cases and 49 deaths, with Congressional actions accelerating to address the outbreak. The seventh outbreak of EVD in the DRC since 1976 has led to Congressional actions accelerating to address the outbreak. Legislation has been introduced and enacted to provide funding for CDC Ebola response activities and research for treatments and vaccines. Additionally, the Department of Defense has been permitted to reprogram funds to build Ebola treatment units in Liberia. The Overseas Humanitarian Disaster and Civic Aid (OHDACA) funds were used to build 17 Ebola treatment units in Liberia and support U.S. efforts in the region. The health systems in the affected countries were already weak before the outbreak, facing severe deficiencies in human resources, governance, financing, supply chain, service delivery, and information. The outbreak has exacerbated these challenges, leading to perceptions of government ineptitude and mistrust among civilians. The constraints in the affected countries' health systems enable the virus to spread, leading to perceptions of government ineptitude and mistrust among civilians. Attacks on health workers and facilities persist, prompting the use of armed forces for disease control measures. Criticisms of quarantines have been raised, with some neighborhoods no longer being quarantined. Despite concerns, a sensitization campaign in Sierra Leone was deemed successful in detecting Ebola cases. Despite criticisms and protests, Liberia and Sierra Leone have stopped quarantining some neighborhoods. Per capita health spending in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone is low, leading to poor conditions in health facilities. Health workers face delays in compensation, leading to absenteeism. Some health workers abandoned their posts due to safety concerns and lack of salaries. Donors, including the United States, are offering financial aid to support payment of health workers' salaries. Several local staff at Ebola treatment units in Liberia have not been paid for three months, leading to frustration. Donors, including the United States, are offering financial aid to support payment of health workers' salaries. The outbreak-affected countries lack sufficient financial resources to fund their national Ebola response plans and need support. The United Nations estimates that Guinea will need $194 million, Liberia $473 million, and Sierra Leone $220 million to address the health and secondary effects of the outbreak. Inadequate access to health personnel and facilities is a problem in all three countries, with the majority of people infected with Ebola in Liberia lacking access to medical care and treatment. Observers are concerned about the severe shortages of health workers and clinics in Ebola-affected countries like Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea. This lack of access to medical care is not only impacting Ebola patients but also affecting maternal and child health. Before the outbreak, these countries already had high maternal and child mortality rates. The shortage of medics and health facilities is leading to people caring for the ill on their own, which is facilitating the spread of the virus. Additionally, people needing care for non-Ebola related issues have nowhere to go. In 2012, high maternal and child mortality rates were reported in four sub-Saharan African countries, with over 46,000 women dying from pregnancy-related complications. Nearly 1 million children died before their fifth birthday in these countries, accounting for 30% of under-five deaths in the region. Lack of access to healthcare, including vaccines and medical attention during labor, contributed to these preventable deaths. The shortage of health workers in these countries, such as Sierra Leone with only two doctors per 100,000 people, further exacerbated the situation. Press reports indicated that pregnant women were avoiding health facilities due to fear of contracting Ebola, leading to increased mortality from treatable ailments. According to the United Nations, more people are dying in Liberia from treatable ailments than from Ebola. High maternal and child mortality rates in affected countries are linked to the lack of health workers. Sierra Leone had only two doctors per 100,000 people between 2006 and 2013. Liberia had fewer than 200 doctors before the Ebola outbreak, with only about 50 remaining after. EVD deaths among health workers have further reduced staffing levels. WHO reported that 443 health workers had contracted EVD, with 244 deaths. Ebola control requires a large number of healthcare workers, with a facility treating 70 patients needing at least 250 workers. The Ebola outbreak in Liberia and Sierra Leone has led to severe shortages of healthcare workers, with more than 40% of deaths occurring in Liberia. WHO estimates that a facility treating 70 Ebola patients needs at least 250 healthcare workers. The affected countries require over 13,000 health workers for care, contact tracing, and safe burials, with only 5% coming from foreign countries. The outbreak has worsened healthcare options, with many facilities closed and limited access to clinics, especially in rural areas. The Ebola outbreak in Liberia and Sierra Leone has severely diminished healthcare options in the affected countries. Many health facilities are closed, and access to clinics was already limited before the outbreak. The majority of health facilities are in urban areas, leaving large portions of the population without access to general healthcare and Ebola-specific treatment. Limited access to clinics results in people traveling long distances for healthcare, leading to delayed treatment and reduced survival prospects for Ebola patients. The affected countries face severe deficiencies in essential health services needed to control the outbreak, such as Ebola treatment centers, laboratories, contact tracing, and safe burial services. Most health services are unable to meet the demands, and new facilities quickly reach capacity. Patients turned away from treatment facilities often return to their communities, potentially spreading the virus. The Ebola outbreak in Liberia faces severe deficiencies in treatment centers, laboratories, contact tracing, and safe burial services. Health services are overwhelmed, with patients often turned away and returning to communities, potentially spreading the virus. Liberia has only 23% of the needed treatment beds, but treatment capacity is expected to improve with U.S. support. Safe disposal of dead bodies is improving, with 90% removed within 24 hours. Health experts are investigating a recent reduction in people seeking Ebola care in Liberia, with some beds left vacant. Safe disposal of dead bodies is improving, with roughly 90% removed within 24 hours. EVD responders are working with community leaders to adapt traditional funeral practices that can facilitate EVD transmission. Inconsistent adherence to infection control protocol is contributing to EVD cases among health workers. CDC identified multiple opportunities for Ebola transmission to healthcare workers in Liberia. Inconsistent availability and use of gloves and hand washing were noted during a CDC Director's tour of Liberia. Exposure to Ebola patients in hospitals, inadequate use of protective equipment during cleaning, and potential transmission among healthcare workers were noted in Liberia. CDC Director highlighted poor sanitation due to water supply interruptions in health clinics. Limited ambulance services and protective gear shortages contribute to EVD spread within healthcare facilities in affected countries. In Sierra Leone, with a population of 465,000 people, there are only four ambulances, often overcrowded with ill individuals, regardless of Ebola infection status. Shortages of protective gear are linked to Ebola cases among health workers, leading to potential spread within health facilities. Limited supplies of protective equipment pose risks for healthcare workers interacting with the public. Health workers outside Ebola treatment centers are at risk of contracting and spreading diseases due to lack of protective gear. Shortages of PPE are also noted in Ebola treatment units, along with insufficient supplies of antibiotics and safe blood for Ebola treatment. The price of disinfectants and medicine has doubled due to health system deficiencies. Poor road conditions complicate the transportation of aid workers and supplies within the affected countries. Efforts to combat Ebola in affected countries are hindered by shortages of antibiotics, safe blood, and protective gear. The high cost of disinfectants and medicine has doubled, leading people to self-medicate. Transportation of aid workers and supplies is challenging due to poor road conditions and limited air service. Awareness about preventing EVD infection has increased, but poverty, infrastructural deficiencies, and health system constraints make it difficult for many to avoid infection. Consumption of wild animals, common in areas with food insecurity, poses a risk for EVD transmission. Efforts to combat Ebola in affected countries are hindered by shortages of antibiotics, safe blood, and protective gear. Consumption of wild animals, particularly in areas with high food insecurity, poses a risk for EVD transmission. Health officials are expanding efforts to inform the public about the risks associated with eating wild animals. Limited laboratory capacity has resulted in extensive diagnosis backlogs, hindering containment efforts. International responses are accelerating, but uncertainty about EVD cases endangers health workers and other patients. The Ebola outbreak is causing financial requirements to rise, with estimates reaching $490 million to contain the outbreak. By August, there were 3,685 EVD cases and 1,841 deaths. The outbreak has spread to Sierra Leone and Nigeria, infecting over 10,000 people. The United Nations established the U.N. Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER) in September to coordinate international efforts. The Ebola outbreak has caused 3,685 cases and 1,841 deaths by August, spreading to Sierra Leone and Nigeria. The United Nations established the U.N. Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER) in September to coordinate international efforts. Donors have contributed $493 million towards a $988 million plan to address health and social impacts of the outbreak. Donors have contributed $493 million towards the UN plan to address the Ebola outbreak, with an additional $279 million pledged. The UNOCHA estimates a total of $894 million committed for the outbreak response, with an additional $938 million pledged for preparedness needs. WHO has requested donors provide $490 million for building referring and isolation centers to contain the outbreak. The World Health Organization has outlined measures for containing the Ebola outbreak by January 2014, requesting $490 million for building referring and isolation centers, increasing diagnostic capacity, and attracting health workers. Several countries have pledged medical support, including Cuba, the U.S., Britain, and China, with commitments of deploying health professionals and troops to the region. The African Union and East African Community have also committed to sending health workers. Several countries have pledged medical support for containing the Ebola outbreak, including the U.S., Britain, and China, deploying health professionals and troops to the region. The African Union and East African Community have also committed to sending health workers. The Liberian Government, WHO, CDC, and other partners developed the Community Care Campaign to target vulnerable households in Liberia, establishing community care centers managed by NGOs, community health workers, and family members of EVD patients. Sierra Leone is also establishing similar centers. The U.S. is a leading funder of the international Ebola response, with financial support totaling $344.6 million as of October 22. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Department of Defense (DOD) are heavily involved in containing the outbreak in West Africa. President Obama established an Ebola Czar to coordinate domestic and global responses, with key goals including controlling the outbreak and advancing global health security. The U.S. is heavily involved in the international Ebola response in West Africa, with a focus on Liberia. Nearly 900 U.S. Government personnel, including 700 military personnel, are stationed in the region. Efforts are coordinated through USAID and CDC, with contributions from other departments. Pandemic preparedness programs have been ongoing since the 2005 avian flu outbreak. Since 2005, USAID has invested roughly $1 billion in pandemic preparedness efforts, including responding to outbreaks like Ebola. The Emerging and Pandemic Threats program, operating in 18 countries in Africa and Asia, focuses on viral detection in wildlife, livestock, and human populations. Congress appropriates funds directly to USAID for this program. The USAID's Emerging and Pandemic Threats program, funded by Congress, focuses on viral detection, risk determination, one health approach institutionalization, outbreak response capacity, and risk reduction in 18 countries in Africa and Asia. USAID has also deployed a Disaster Assistance Response Team to West Africa to coordinate the U.S. Government's response to the Ebola outbreak. USAID has deployed a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) to West Africa to coordinate the U.S. Government's response to the Ebola outbreak. Between March and October 2014, USAID committed over $300 million for combating Ebola in West Africa, providing treatment beds, protective equipment, hygiene kits, and support for public awareness and prevention efforts. The USAID and CDC are actively involved in combating the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. USAID has reprogrammed funds to support public awareness, disease prevention practices, and safe burial activities. CDC funds global pandemic preparedness efforts through various programs and has requested additional support to address global infectious disease threats like Ebola. CDC also supports pandemic influenza preparedness efforts in over 50 countries. CDC has requested $45 million in FY2015 to support the Global Health Security Agenda, focusing on detecting, preventing, and responding to global infectious disease threats like Ebola. CDC provides assistance to countries through experts, cooperative agreements, and training airport personnel. CDC teams traveled to Guinea and Liberia to help control the outbreak, manage cases, and improve data management. Despite initial progress, new cases emerged, prompting CDC to resume technical assistance efforts. CDC resumed technical assistance efforts in the region, training airport personnel and displaying Ebola-specific travel messages. CDC has committed over $16.7 million for its Ebola responses. DOD announced a $22 million field hospital in Liberia for EVD cases among healthcare workers. President Obama launched \"Operation United Assistance\" based in Monrovia, Liberia. Military personnel will establish and supply the facility, but not provide direct medical care. The U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps will deploy 65 officers to Liberia to manage and staff a hospital. President Obama announced \"Operation United Assistance\" in Monrovia, Liberia, involving 4,000 U.S. military forces to coordinate relief efforts, train health workers, and establish treatment centers. The first 22-bed Ebola Treatment Center is expected to be completed by the end of October, with more centers to follow in November. Over 700 U.S. military personnel, including those operating mobile medical labs for Ebola testing, are in the region. Congress has approved funding for Operation United Assistance and related activities. The U.S. military is involved in Operation United Assistance in Liberia to combat the Ebola outbreak. Over 700 personnel, including those from the U.S. Naval Medical Research Center, are operating mobile medical labs for testing. Congress has approved funding exceeding $1 billion for the global Ebola response. The outbreak has overwhelmed Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, leading to weakened health systems. Additional funds may be requested to contain the outbreak. The Ebola outbreak has led to dilapidated conditions and Congress has enacted legislation to expand responses and provide funds. WHO estimates 13,000 health workers are needed to contain the outbreak, with human resource constraints most acute in Liberia. The United States is partnering with various groups to develop a Community Care Campaign, but Doctors Without Borders has expressed concerns about potential contamination centers. Doctors Without Borders has expressed concerns about the Community Care Campaign in Liberia, warning that without strict infection control, adequate supplies, trained staff, and proper burial methods, the CCCs could become \"contamination centers.\" WHO acknowledges the risk of virus transmission within the CCCs due to deficiencies in implementation, including inconsistent adherence to infection control protocols and the inability to ensure IPC protocols among trained health personnel and lay personnel providing Ebola care. The concern arises regarding the adherence to infection control protocols among health workers and family members providing Ebola care in Liberia's CCCs. WHO recommends only one family member to care for each patient to prevent EVD spread, but challenges such as collective familial care, loss of income, and emotional stress may hinder compliance. In Liberia, challenges such as collective familial care, loss of income, and emotional stress may hinder compliance with WHO guidelines for Ebola care in CCCs. Adherence to infection control protocols, including waste management and safe burial practices, is crucial, but deficiencies in waste management and sanitation facilities pose challenges. Oversight and supervision are critical for ensuring success in preventing EVD spread within CCCs. In 2012, less than 20% of people in affected countries had access to improved sanitation facilities, posing a challenge for IPC protocol adherence among lay care takers. WHO emphasizes the importance of monitoring and supervision for success. The Community Care Campaign calls for daily supervisory visits by trained health care workers to ensure compliance with IPC protocols and proper use of PPE. Poor supply chain management leads to interruptions in medical supplies and lack of protective equipment in health clinics, increasing the risk of EVD infection. Due to poor supply chain management, health clinics in affected countries face interruptions in medical supplies and lack protective equipment like gloves, masks, and gowns. This shortage has been linked to Ebola virus disease (EVD) infections among health workers. WHO advises a gradual approach to ensuring a continuous supply of commodities to Community Care Centers (CCCs). The US has already started implementing the Community Care Campaign by providing community care kits in Liberia and issuing grants to NGOs for managing CCCs. The U.S. is implementing the Community Care Campaign by issuing grants to NGOs to manage Community Care Centers in Liberia. There are concerns about U.S. oversight of grantees and the standardization of quality control and IPC protocol. Critics have questioned WHO's leadership in the global Ebola response, citing budget cuts that have reduced the agency's effectiveness in containing outbreaks. Budget cuts under WHO's reform efforts have limited its capacity to contain outbreaks, with a 51% reduction in response activities. Critics argue that staff reductions and bureaucratic issues have further hampered WHO's effectiveness. Suggestions include establishing a Health Systems Fund to address both long-term capacity building and immediate crises like Ebola. The ongoing Ebola outbreak has sparked debates on WHO's role as an advisory body or operational entity. Analysts propose a Health Systems Fund for long-term capacity building and crisis response. Weak health systems in West Africa contribute to the rapid spread of Ebola. Donors have struggled with addressing health emergencies due to dysfunctional systems. Disease-specific funding has been criticized for creating parallel bureaucracies and bypassing government authorities. The debate over disease-specific funding intensified with the introduction of PEPFAR, which provided funding to non-governmental organizations to establish care facilities outside of government networks. While this effort saved millions of lives, it also made the United States the sole supporter for many at-risk individuals worldwide. In the second phase of PEPFAR, resources were increasingly used to support health systems in hopes of strengthening country capacity. In the third phase of PEPFAR, there is a debate on the use of funds for building health systems. A 2013 GAO report highlighted that 21% of PEPFAR funds were spent on capacity building projects. Health system advocates are concerned that budgetary reforms may jeopardize efforts to strengthen health systems. The U.S. Congress is facing a similar dilemma with the current Ebola outbreak, where focused support is needed to contain the outbreak. Health system advocates fear that budgetary reforms may imperil efforts to bolster health systems. The U.S. Congress faces a dilemma with the current Ebola outbreak, as affected countries need focused support to contain it. Donors must support the development of strong health systems to prevent future disease outbreaks. USAID has established an Ebola Health Systems Strengthening working group to support health care delivery and system improvement post-outbreak. USAID has established an Ebola Health Systems Strengthening working group to support health care delivery and system improvement post-outbreak. The majority of health aid is directed towards specific diseases, leaving minimal resources for broader activities to strengthen health systems. Various U.S. agencies are responding to the ongoing Ebola outbreak, with the Department of State leading diplomatic engagements, USAID coordinating U.S. responses, CDC heading public health and medical response activities, and DOD providing support for foreign armed forces. The U.S. agencies responding to the Ebola outbreak include the Department of State, USAID, CDC, and DOD. Each agency has flexible budgetary structures to provide financial and material support. The Department of State coordinates diplomatic engagements through existing channels, CDC can use USAID disaster assistance accounts for outbreak responses, and DOD's budget supports various health activities without detailed congressional direction. The DOD budget supports domestic and international health activities without detailed congressional direction. Congress has established directives on foreign aid funds usage. USAID receives specific direction from Congress on fund usage, limiting its ability to address unanticipated events like the Ebola outbreak without reprogramming funds from ongoing health efforts. Supporters view the current appropriation structure as a tool for overseeing health programs, while opponents argue it hinders agility. The current appropriation structure for USAID receives specific directives from Congress, which some see as a tool for overseeing health programs while others argue it hinders agility in responding to disease outbreaks like Ebola. USAID's pandemic preparedness efforts are focused on East and Central Africa, South and Southeast Asia, but the FY2015 budget request for pandemic preparedness is 30% less than the previous year. This decrease in funding may impact USAID's ability to respond effectively to potential outbreaks in regions like West Africa. The FY2015 budget request for pandemic preparedness is $50 million, 30% less than FY2014. Even if Congress funds at the previous level, it may not be enough to meet demands. Experts predict containment by end of January, but high death tolls are disrupting social structures. MSF reports villages in Sierra Leone losing adult community members, leaving vulnerable populations without resources. Concerns arise about growing number of Ebola orphans, vulnerable to marginalization. The Ebola outbreak is impacting vulnerable populations, including children and the elderly, who lack resources for food and agriculture. There is a growing number of Ebola orphans who are at risk of marginalization. The outbreak is also affecting the capacity of governments in West and Central Africa to address health issues, such as maternal and child mortality rates. The full health effects of the outbreak may not be known until it is contained. The Ebola outbreak has led to the depletion of health personnel, diversion of resources to treatment centers, and public avoidance of health facilities. The long-term health impacts are still unknown. There is no specific cure or vaccine for Ebola, and experimental treatments are being tested for safety and efficacy. The outbreak may worsen existing health and development issues, leading to debates on global health funding allocation. There is no specific cure, treatment, or vaccine for Ebola. Experimental treatments and vaccines are being tested for safety and efficacy. The ethical debate surrounds the use of experimental drugs, particularly regarding equity and safety testing in humans. WHO has addressed the ethical considerations under the current outbreak circumstances. WHO announced that under the current outbreak circumstances, it is ethical to offer unproven interventions with unknown efficacy and adverse effects as potential treatment or prevention. Trials for Ebola vaccines are set to begin in January on 20,000 health workers and volunteers, with a limited amount of experimental treatment available in Liberia by early November. Discussions are ongoing to fast track testing and deployment of vaccines to impact the epidemic. Ethical debates are expected once the trials commence. WHO announced that trials for Ebola vaccines are set to begin in January on 20,000 health workers and volunteers. Discussions are ongoing to fast track testing and deployment of vaccines to impact the epidemic. Ethical debates are expected once the trials commence. High-risk countries are being warned about potential Ebola cases, with concerns raised about future outbreaks in forested areas where fruit bats reside. An Oxford University study raised concerns about future Ebola outbreaks in Central and West Africa due to the presence of fruit bats in forested areas. Questions are being raised about the effectiveness of the U.S. response to the Ebola outbreak, support for pandemic preparedness efforts, and the impact of disease-specific funding on preparedness. Additionally, there are concerns about the reprogramming of USAID funds for Ebola affecting global health programs and the capacity of affected countries to respond to future outbreaks."
