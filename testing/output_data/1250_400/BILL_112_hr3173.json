FINDINGS.\" Congress finds that nearly 2 million transportation workers are required to carry a Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) under the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002. Workers must pay $132.50 for the TWIC, which is valid for five years and requires multiple trips to renew. The TWIC is valid for five years and workers must make multiple trips to renew it, costing $132.50 each time. The enrollment process is not mandated by law but is driven by a DHS policy decision to align with standards for Personal Identity Verification. The TWIC aligns with PIV standards for Federal employees and contractors, but deviations are allowed. It serves as a work permit for a mobile private sector workforce. Possession does not grant unescorted access to secure areas without authorization. DHS has flexibility to develop alternative processes for TWIC. The TWIC allows access to secure areas only with authorization. DHS can develop alternative enrollment processes. Congress mandated biometric reader requirements, but a final rule has not been issued yet. Congress emphasizes the need for urgent reform of the TWIC application process by the end of 2012 to avoid burdens on workers and businesses. They also urge the deployment of TWIC readers for security purposes and ensure that funds for TWIC projects do not expire before the final reader rule is issued. The Secretary of Homeland Security is required to reform the TWIC application process within 90 days of the enactment of the Act, limiting in-person visits to enrollment centers to one, except in special circumstances. This was passed by the House of Representatives on June 28, 2012."
