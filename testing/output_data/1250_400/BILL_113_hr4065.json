    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Smartphone Theft Prevention Act\". Congress finds that mobile device theft costs consumers $30 billion annually, with 1 in 3 robberies involving mobile device theft. Efforts have been made by carriers, manufacturers, law enforcement, and the FCC to address this issue, but more action is needed. Consumers deserve secure technology to protect their information, and the industry should educate them on available security tools. Technological advancements benefit the economy, consumers, and public safety. The wireless industry should collaborate with law enforcement to educate consumers on security tools and safety measures. Engineering and security needs evolve rapidly, so the mobile device industry, law enforcement, and consumer advocates should proactively develop solutions to protect consumers and drive innovation. SEC. 343. FUNCTION FOR STOLEN MOBILE DEVICES. Part I of title III of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended to include a function for stolen mobile devices. In this section, definitions for terms related to mobile devices are provided, including 'account holder', 'commercial mobile data service', 'commercial mobile service', and 'mobile device'. Additionally, requirements are outlined for providers of commercial mobile service or commercial mobile data service to make a function available on the device for stolen mobile devices. The term 'mobile device' refers to a personal electronic device that provides commercial mobile service or data service. Providers must offer a function on the device that allows the account holder to remotely delete all their information, make the device inoperable on any network globally, and prevent reactivation without a passcode. The regulations require mobile devices to have remote deletion capabilities, render the device inoperable globally, prevent unauthorized reactivation, and reverse actions upon recovery. Additionally, mobile devices must meet specific standards to be manufactured or imported for sale in the United States. The regulations mandate that mobile devices must have remote deletion capabilities, render the device globally inoperable, prevent unauthorized reactivation, and reverse actions upon recovery. Mobile devices manufactured or imported for sale in the United States must meet specific standards, including allowing providers of commercial mobile service to make available required functions on the device. Exemptions may be granted for functionally equivalent technology. The Commission may exempt manufacturers and importers from certain requirements for mobile devices if they are configured to allow providers to offer equivalent functions. Waivers may be granted for low-cost, voice-only mobile devices primarily intended for voice service. The Commission may waive requirements for low-cost, voice-only mobile devices focused on voice service and limited text messaging functions. Providers cannot charge fees for certain mobile services. Violations may result in forfeiture penalties determined by the Commission. The Commission may impose forfeiture penalties on individuals found to have violated specific sections of the Act, in addition to any other penalties. Manufacturers and providers of mobile services are not prohibited from taking additional actions to protect consumers from mobile device theft. The term \"mobile device\" is defined in section 343 of the Communications Act of 1934. This section applies to mobile devices manufactured or imported into the United States after January 1, 2015. The FCC may grant exemptions for compliance extensions to individuals subject to these requirements."
