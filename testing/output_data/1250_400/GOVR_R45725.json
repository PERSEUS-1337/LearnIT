    "content": "The Jones Act, part of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, mandates that vessels transporting cargo within the U.S. must be U.S.-built, owned, and crewed. It protects U.S. shipyards and sailors but is debated for increasing costs and limiting ship availability. Recent issues involving the Jones Act include Puerto Rico's economic challenges, the El Faro ship sinking, and discussions on domestic oil and gas transportation. National security goals and a national maritime strategy are also areas of focus. The Jones Act of 1920 mandates that vessels transporting cargo domestically in the U.S. must be U.S.-built, owned, and crewed. Recent issues include the sinking of the El Faro ship in 2015 and discussions on domestic oil and gas transportation. The law's effectiveness in achieving national security goals and efforts to increase efficiency in the maritime sector have also been topics of discussion. The Jones Act, enacted in 1920, mandates that vessels transporting cargo domestically in the U.S. must be U.S.-built, owned, and crewed. This law was a restatement of a long-standing restriction that favored a U.S.-flag fleet over a foreign fleet. The early United States had a comparative advantage in shipbuilding due to ample supplies of large timber, but lost this advantage as wooden sailing ships gave way to iron steamships. Congress debated how to respond to the decline in the U.S. foreign trade share. Since 1912, the domestic build requirement has mainly applied to vessels for domestic voyages. In the late 1800s, Congress debated proposals to allow foreign-built vessels to sail under the U.S. flag, known as the \"free ship\" movement. Opponents argued that the higher cost of U.S. crews would hinder the resurgence of U.S. vessel trade, even if foreign-built ships were allowed. Bills allowing foreign-built vessels for U.S.-flag international service were considered in the late 1800s, but it wasn't until 1912 that Congress enacted such a measure. In the late 1800s, bills allowing foreign-built vessels for U.S.-flag international service were considered by House and Senate committees. However, it wasn't until 1912 that Congress enacted such a measure. The domestic build requirement has since applied mainly to vessels for domestic voyages. Congress tightened language on coastwise transport in response to shippers' attempts to avoid high-cost U.S. vessels. In the late 1800s, bills allowing foreign-built vessels for U.S.-flag international service were considered by House and Senate committees. However, it wasn't until 1912 that Congress enacted such a measure. The domestic build requirement has since applied mainly to vessels for domestic voyages. Congress tightened language on coastwise transport in response to shippers' attempts to avoid high-cost U.S. vessels. Shipments from Seattle to Alaska often were routed via Vancouver, Canada, so shippers could use foreign-flag ships for both legs. Congress amended the coastwise law in 1893 and again in 1898 to prohibit shippers from routing cargo through a foreign port to avoid coastwise laws. U.S. shippers continued to use foreign-flag vessels in the Alaska trade by moving cargo between the United States and Vancouver, Canada, by rail. In the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, Senator Wesley Jones of Washington sought to stop this practice by requiring Alaska-bound cargo to move through the Port of Seattle by amending the coastwise language to cover shipments \"by land and water\" and replacing shipments between \"U.S. ports\" with shipments between \"U.S. points.\" In 1920, Senator Wesley Jones amended the coastwise law to require Alaska-bound cargo to go through the Port of Seattle, replacing \"U.S. ports\" with \"U.S. points.\" The debate over the Jones Act also focused on the cost difference between building ships in the U.S. versus foreign countries. The minority report expressed concerns about banning foreign-built ships, stating that American merchants should be able to acquire ships at the lowest possible price to compete globally. The debate over the Jones Act focused on the cost difference between building ships in the U.S. versus foreign countries. It is necessary to remove restrictions against American merchants acquiring ships at the lowest possible price to compete globally. American merchants should be allowed to buy ships in the open world market to enable them to compete with other nations in the transportation of the world's commerce. If American merchants can only buy ships from American builders, U.S.-built ships will cost 20% more than foreign-built ships. The cost difference between building ships in the U.S. versus foreign countries has been a long-standing issue. U.S.-built ships have consistently been more expensive, with the price gap increasing over the years. Currently, U.S.-built tankers are estimated to cost four times more than global prices, while container ships may cost five times more. This cost disparity has also affected the Department of Defense's plans for military sealift ships, leading them to opt for more affordable used foreign-built cargo ships instead of building domestically. The Department of Defense officials face challenges with military sealift ships due to high operating costs, including crewing, insurance, and maintenance. U.S.-built ships are costlier compared to foreign-built ones, leading to a shift towards purchasing used foreign-built cargo ships. The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 addressed surplus government cargo ships from World War I. The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 addressed surplus government cargo ships from World War I and outlined the importance of a strong U.S. merchant marine for national defense and commerce. The average operating cost of U.S.-flag ships compared to foreign-flag ships has increased over time, leading to challenges for the Department of Defense. The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 emphasized the need for a strong U.S. merchant marine to support national defense and commerce. The Jones Act applies to domestic waterborne shipments, requiring U.S. citizen crewing for ships owned by U.S. citizens. The Jones Act applies only to domestic waterborne shipments, requiring U.S. citizen crewing for ships owned by U.S. citizens. Foreign-flag ships can transport cargo between certain U.S. territories, and the Coast Guard enforces U.S.-build, ownership, and crewing requirements for vessels. The Jones Act enforces U.S.-build, ownership, and crewing requirements for vessels in domestic waterborne shipments. Customs and Border Protection determines maritime activity under the act, including defining \"transportation\" and \"U.S. points.\" The Coast Guard determines if a vessel is U.S.-built based on major components of its hull and superstructure. The Jones Act requires the use of \"U.S.-built\" vessels, with the Coast Guard determining this based on major components of the hull and superstructure. Propulsion machinery and certain equipment do not affect the U.S.-build determination, allowing for the import of engines for oceangoing ships. For oceangoing ships, U.S. shipyards import engines from foreign manufacturers as they are considered components attached to the hull. The Coast Guard allows certain parts to be manufactured abroad as long as they do not exceed the steel weight limit. Steel products in standard forms can be imported with no weight limit. The Coast Guard permits certain foreign components to be used in U.S.-built vessels as long as they do not exceed the steel weight limit. Shipyards seek confirmation from the Coast Guard on incorporating foreign-built components, detailed in determination letters. Shipyard unions refer to vessels built with foreign components as \"kit ships.\" In 2007, unions sued the Coast Guard over its interpretation of the statute, but the U.S. District Court sided with the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard was directed by Congress to publish letters regarding the use of foreign components in U.S.-built vessels. Shipyard unions, who call these vessels \"kit ships,\" sued the Coast Guard in 2007 over their interpretation of the statute. The U.S. District Court sided with the Coast Guard, citing historical interpretations dating back to the late 1800s and early 1900s. This lawsuit stemmed from a partnership between a Philadelphia shipyard and a South Korean shipbuilder to build Jones Act tankers and container ships. Another partnership between General Dynamics NASSCO and Daewoo Shipbuilding also involved procuring vessel designs and materials from South Korea. Since 2006, General Dynamics NASSCO of San Diego has partnered with Daewoo Shipbuilding of South Korea to procure vessel designs and materials for Jones Act ships. The use of foreign components in U.S.-built vessels has been a point of contention, with shipyards arguing that it would increase costs but also benefit the domestic fleet. Additionally, cruise ships serving U.S. ports are not required to be Jones Act-compliant if they have visited a distant foreign port. The largest cruise ship market is in the U.S., but most Americans board foreign-flag cruise ships. This is because cruise ships serving a U.S. port do not have to be Jones Act-compliant if they have visited a distant foreign port. The reasoning behind this exemption dates back to a 1910 Attorney General's opinion and a 1985 rulemaking by the U.S. Customs Service. This allows foreign-flag cruise ships to make round trips from a U.S. port and visit other U.S. ports as long as they also include a visit to a nearby foreign port. Customs Service allowed foreign-flag cruise ships to make round trips from a U.S. port and visit other U.S. ports as long as they include a visit to a nearby foreign port. Passengers must continue with the cruise until it terminates at the same dock. Voyages to nowhere involve visits to no other ports, staying within the 3-mile zone of U.S. territorial waters to be Jones Act-compliant. This interpretation is based on Treasury Decision 22275 issued in 1900. CBP's interpretation of the Jones Act for passenger vessels states that if vessels stay within 3 miles of U.S. territorial waters, they must be Jones Act-compliant. However, if they venture beyond 3 miles into international waters, they do not need to comply. Charter fishing boats must still be Jones Act-compliant even in international waters. CBP defines a passenger as not necessarily a paying customer. CBP's interpretation of the Jones Act for passenger vessels defines a passenger as anyone aboard a vessel who is not a crew member or owner. This includes scenarios like yacht owners entertaining guests or construction companies transporting workers. CBP's interpretations also impact lightering operations and offshore supply vessels in the oil market. If a tanker to be lightered is within 3 nautical miles of shore, it is considered a \"U.S. point.\" CBP has determined that lightering vessels within 3 nautical miles of shore are considered \"U.S. points.\" Lightering operations in the Gulf of Mexico can involve foreign-flagged vessels, while those in the Delaware Bay must be Jones Act-compliant. Offshore supply vessels servicing oil rigs must also adhere to Jones Act regulations within U.S. waters extending 200 miles offshore. The Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953 extends U.S. waters 200 miles offshore for offshore natural resource activities. Only oil rigs attached to the seabed are considered \"U.S. points,\" while mobile offshore drilling units not attached to the seabed may be serviced by foreign-flagged vessels. Congress mandated that OSVs servicing MODUs be U.S.-owned and -crewed. Jones Act compliance for OSVs depends on their role in transporting supplies or workers to the rig. The Jones Act compliance for Offshore Supply Vessels (OSVs) depends on whether they are involved in transporting supplies or workers to oil rigs. Vessels laying cable or pipeline in U.S. waters do not need to be Jones Act-compliant. While OSVs transporting supplies and rig workers must comply with the Jones Act if the rig is attached to the seabed, vessels involved in installing rig equipment or conducting surveys can be foreign-flagged. The application of the Jones Act to offshore wind farms beyond 3 miles from shore is still a subject of debate. The Jones Act compliance for Offshore Supply Vessels (OSVs) is a subject of debate, especially for offshore wind farms located beyond 3 miles from shore. The Department of Energy has highlighted the lack of Jones Act-compliant \"Tower Installation Vessels\" (TIVs) as a hindrance to offshore wind farm development. U.S. wind developers currently rely on foreign vessels or a combination of Jones Act-compliant and non-compliant vessels for equipment transportation and installation. The CBP's interpretations of the Jones Act play a significant role in shaping coastal maritime activity. The Jones Act requires U.S. wind developers to use Jones Act-compliant vessels to transport equipment from a U.S. port, but foreign-flag tankers can transport products that have been transformed at an intermediate foreign port without needing to be Jones Act-compliant. This CBP interpretation has impacted coastal maritime activity significantly. Since 1920, Congress has enacted provisions tightening Jones Act requirements and exempting certain maritime activities. In 1935, Congress prohibited Jones Act-qualified vessels from being sold to foreign owners or registered under a foreign-flag, ensuring they could never be used in U.S. domestic trade. This provides additional protection for Jones Act carriers against competition. In 1940, Congress expanded the Jones Act to cover towing vessels and salvage vessels operating in U.S. waters. In 1988, Congress specified that waterborne transport of valueless material requires a Jones Act-qualified vessel. Congress has enacted exemptions to the Jones Act, including waivers when no Jones Act-qualified operator is available in a particular market. Congress has enacted exemptions to the Jones Act, including waivers when no Jones Act-qualified operator is available in a particular market. Exemptions have been made for passenger travel between Puerto Rico and other U.S. ports, allowing foreign-flag cruise ships to operate. Congress has also permitted foreign-flagged LNG tankers to provide domestic service in cases where no Jones Act fleet existed. Additionally, exemptions have been enacted to address sudden spikes in demand for Jones Act-qualified vessels, such as for iron ore transport on the Great Lakes. Congress has enacted exemptions to the Jones Act, including waivers for passenger travel between Puerto Rico and other U.S. ports and for foreign-flagged LNG tankers to provide domestic service. Exemptions have also been made for sudden spikes in demand for Jones Act-qualified vessels, such as for iron ore transport on the Great Lakes. Additionally, exemptions have been enacted for vessels participating in oil spill cleanup operations and for innovations in vessel designs used in foreign trade. The Jones Act has exemptions for specific types of ships, such as those used for international voyages and empty container movement between U.S. ports. These exemptions allow foreign-flagged container carriers to reposition their equipment along U.S. coastlines. However, Jones Act-compliant ships are still needed for transshipment of loaded international containers, which is common abroad but not in the United States. This lack of transshipment services increases demand for U.S.-built, -crewed, and -owned ships. The Jones Act requires U.S.-built, -crewed, and -owned ships for transshipment of loaded international containers, which is common abroad but not in the United States. Congress has granted exemptions for specific vessels, with at least 133 waivers issued since 1989. Since 1989, Congress has granted at least 133 waivers for specific vessels from the Jones Act requirements. These waivers are typically found in maritime-related legislation and often involve vessels that are not commercially significant, such as small or nonprofit-owned ships. Some waivers are granted due to technicalities in meeting Jones Act requirements, like missing ownership records. In the late 1970s, tankers built in the United States became foreign-registered due to technicalities in meeting Jones Act requirements. Waivers for domestic shipping restrictions have been granted for national defense reasons during World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and in response to conflicts in the Persian Gulf and Libya. The executive branch has also waived the Jones Act for fuel resupply after natural disasters. In 1991 and 2011, waivers were granted on national defense grounds to expedite oil shipments from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in response to the Persian Gulf War and conflict in Libya. The executive branch has waived the Jones Act for fuel resupply after natural disasters, such as Hurricanes Katrina, Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Congress inserted a role for MARAD to check on the availability of Jones Act-qualified vessels before granting certain waivers. National defense waivers have also been prompted by the lack of heavy-lift vessels in the Jones Act fleet. In 2005 and 2006, waivers were granted for foreign-flag heavy-lift vessels to transport radar systems and an oil rig. Customs denied a waiver request in 1992 for transporting replicas of Christopher Columbus's vessels. CBP has denied Jones Act waivers for specific heavy-lift vessels used in offshore oil rig construction, citing national defense as a high standard for waivers. Waivers have been issued for fuel shortages but not for economic reasons. CBP has denied Jones Act waivers for economic reasons, stating that national defense is a high standard for waivers. Waivers have been issued for fuel shortages but not for favoring domestic supply lines over offshore ones. Members of Congress sought to extend the Jones Act to the U.S. Virgin Islands in 1976 due to vulnerability of offshore supply lines. In 2014, northeast refineries considered seeking a waiver to ship crude oil from Texas. The U.S. exported 40-80 million barrels of crude oil per month on foreign-flag tankers in 2018. In 2018, the United States exported between 40 million and 80 million barrels of crude oil per month on foreign-flag tankers, imported about 150 million barrels per month from overseas sources on foreign-flag tankers, and shipped about 15 million barrels per month domestically on Jones Act tankers. The U.S. has begun exporting liquefied natural gas (LNG) by ship while continuing to import LNG by ship, with no domestic shipments. Puerto Rico is seeking a 10-year waiver of the Jones Act to receive bulk shipments of LNG from the U.S. mainland. Recent controversies over the Jones Act have concerned oceangoing ships and offshore supply vessels. In 2018, the United States exported crude oil on foreign-flag tankers, imported from overseas sources on foreign-flag tankers, and shipped domestically on Jones Act tankers. Puerto Rico is seeking a 10-year waiver of the Jones Act to receive bulk shipments of LNG from the U.S. mainland. Recent controversies over the Jones Act have concerned oceangoing ships and offshore supply vessels. The Jones Act covers various types of vessels, including tankers, container ships, roll on/roll off vessels, and dry bulk carriers. As of March 2018, there were 99 oceangoing ships in the Jones Act-compliant fleet, with the largest category being tankers. The Jones Act fleet consists of 57 tankers, including those carrying Alaskan crude oil and medium-sized product tankers. There are also dry cargo ships such as container ships, roll on/roll off vessels, and dry bulk carriers. The fleet has significantly decreased in size since 1950, with a drop in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Alan Boyd once stated that the U.S. merchant marine was \"too small, too old, and too unproductive.\" The Jones Act fleet has decreased in size since the late 1950s and early 1960s. Alan Boyd, Secretary of Transportation in the Lyndon B. Johnson Administration, criticized the fleet as \"too small, too old, and too unproductive.\" The Administration called for the repeal of the Jones Act, as domestic ships have lost market share to railroads and pipelines despite economic advantages. Ships can move more cargo per trip and per gallon of fuel than trucks and railroads, offering lower costs for shippers willing to sacrifice transit time. The Jones Act fleet operates in domestic trade routes where shippers have limited alternatives. Despite its goal of sustaining a growing merchant marine, it has not met the objective of carrying an increasing proportion of the nation's commerce. Congress amended the policy goals in the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 to include providing shipping service on essential routes and having the safest vessels. The Jones Act fleet, established in the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, aims to provide shipping service on essential routes with the safest vessels. However, it does not currently meet these goals as it lacks certain ship designs like \"project cargo\" vessels for moving oversized equipment. The Department of Defense has used waivers to utilize foreign-flag vessels for specific cargo needs not met by the Jones Act fleet. The Jones Act fleet lacks certain ship designs like \"project cargo\" vessels for moving oversized equipment. The Department of Defense has used waivers to utilize foreign-flag vessels for specific cargo needs not met by the Jones Act fleet. The higher cost structure of Jones Act operators hinders their ability to compete for international shipments. The oceangoing Jones Act fleet has two inactive dry bulk ships that are nearly 40 years old, and a chemical tanker built in 1968. Despite new domestic markets from the shale gas boom, there are no LNG tankers in the Jones Act fleet. The lack of sufficient Jones Act-qualified tanker capacity to move booming shale oil production coastwise added to pressure for lifting the crude oil export ban. The Jones Act fleet lacks LNG tankers despite new domestic markets from the shale gas boom. To address the high cost of U.S.-built and U.S.-crewed ships, a unique vessel design called an articulated tug barge (ATB) has been developed. Over 150 ATBs are operating in the Jones Act trades, but they are less reliable and efficient than tanker ships due to their slower speed and smaller size. ATBs could pose a higher risk of grounding and provide less time to prevent spilled oil from reaching shorelines. ATBs are less reliable and efficient than tanker ships due to their slower speed and smaller size. They sail closer to the coasts, increasing the risk of grounding and oil spills reaching shorelines. The El Faro, a Jones Act general cargo ship that sank in 2015, highlighted concerns about the condition of the U.S.-flag fleet. The U.S.-flag fleet faces concerns about the condition of its vessels, with the Coast Guard noting that many ships are in substandard condition due to their age. This was highlighted by incidents like the crack found in the hull of the Jones Act containership Matsonia. The fleet's age and maintenance issues raise worries about reliability and safety. The Jones Act fleet has become younger due to new shipbuilding after the shale oil production increase. About one-third of oceangoing fleet is over 21 years old, down from two-thirds in 2007. Great Lakes fleet is older, with 1,000-foot freighters built between 1972 and 1981. The second-largest class of ships, around 700 feet, is even older, some originally built in the 1940s or 1950s. The largest ships on the Great Lakes, 1,000-foot freighters, were built between 1972 and 1981. The second-largest class, around 700 feet in length, is older, with some vessels originally built in the 1940s or 1950s. Ships on the Great Lakes have longer lives than oceangoing vessels. Domestic tonnage on the Great Lakes has declined since the 1950s. Canada's fleet was similar in age to the Jones Act fleet until a 25% tariff on imported ships was imposed in 1985, halting new ship construction. The tariff was repealed in 2010, leading to the construction of over 35 new dry bulk ships in other countries. Canada's fleet, similar in age to the Jones Act fleet, saw a halt in new ship construction in 1985 due to a 25% tariff on imported ships. This tariff was lifted in 2010, resulting in the construction of over 35 new dry bulk ships in other countries for service on the Great Lakes. The fleet includes thousands of tugs and barges carrying dry and liquid bulk commodities, with tonnage dominated by corn, soybeans, and coal. Overall tonnage on the system has been flat or slightly declining since 1990. The Dredging Act of 1906 requires U.S.-built, -operated, and -crewed vessels for dredging in U.S. waters. The Jones Act was amended in 1988 to include valueless material as \"merchandise\" for domestic vessel transport. The ban on foreign-built dredgers and operators increases dredging costs in U.S. harbors. Despite increased federal spending on navigation dredging, there has not been a larger volume of material dredged from U.S. harbors. The ban on foreign-built dredgers and operators raises dredging costs in U.S. harbors significantly. Despite increased federal spending on navigation dredging, there has not been a larger volume of material dredged from U.S. harbors. Factors contributing to cost increases include limited supply of dredging vessels, higher fuel and steel costs, labor expenses, and stricter environmental requirements. The U.S. privately owned fleet is older and smaller compared to leading European dredging firms. The European firms have a larger and more modern fleet of hopper dredges compared to the U.S. firms. When the Army Corps bids for harbor work requiring a hopper dredge, one of the U.S. firms is often the sole bidder. Dredging projects in the U.S. involve high costs for mobilization and demobilization of equipment. Foreign firms use heavy-lift vessels for transportation, which are not available in the U.S. Jones Act fleet. The offshore supply vessel fleet in the Gulf of Mexico can fluctuate significantly with changes in the oil market. The offshore supply vessel fleet in the Gulf of Mexico consists of about 1,800 vessels, with annual construction averaging 32 vessels over the last decade. Foreign-built vessels are used for construction in deeper waters due to the lack of dynamic positioning propulsion systems in the Jones Act fleet. There are perceived shortcomings in the domestic fleet's ability to serve as a naval auxiliary in times of war or national emergency, despite Congress enacting programs for sealift support since 1920. Since 1920, Congress has enacted programs for sealift support, but there are concerns about the domestic fleet's ability to serve as a naval auxiliary in times of war or national emergency. The shrinking U.S. mariner pool raises doubts about crewing a reserve sealift fleet. In 2014, Congress directed the Department of Transportation and Defense to develop a national sealift strategy, which is yet to be issued. Jones Act mariners on shore leave could crew a reserve fleet for military sealift, such as the Ready Reserve Force. The Jones Act mariners, along with other U.S.-flag privately owned and government-owned ships, could crew a reserve fleet for military sealift purposes. MARAD estimates a sufficient commercial mariner pool for a surge lasting up to 180 days, but a prolonged sealift effort may require crew rotations, leading to a shortfall of about 1,800 mariners. MARAD estimates a sufficient commercial mariner pool for a surge lasting up to 180 days, but a prolonged sealift effort may require crew rotations, leading to a shortfall of about 1,800 mariners. This shortage has been a consistent issue for decades, even when the mariner pool was larger in the past. The MARAD Administrator testified in 1991 that the mariner pool was barely sufficient to crew the reserve sealift fleet, which consisted of 96 ships at the time. Since then, three other fleets of ships have been established for military sealift purposes: the RRF, MSC, and MSP. The RRF currently consists of 46 ships with a skeleton crew of about 600 commercial mariners, but would require an additional 1,200 mariners to sustain its operation once activated. The MSC fleet is controlled by TRANSCOM and has about 50 ships crewed by civilian mariners who are federal employees. The MSP ships, established in 1996, receive an operating subsidy. The MSP fleet, established in 1996, receives an operating subsidy of about $5 million per vessel per year to cover the additional cost of American crews and relies heavily on government cargoes reserved for them. The military is to utilize MSP ships before MSC ships, which are mostly crewed by civilian mariners. Jones Act operators are required to purchase more costly U.S.-built ships, while the sealift fleet is largely composed of more economical foreign-built ships. The Jones Act operators are required to buy expensive U.S.-built ships, while the military sealift fleet mainly uses cheaper foreign-built ships. The sealift fleet could be domestically built to increase oceangoing shipbuilding capability. This would lead to higher costs shared nationally, making coastwise ships more competitive and expanding the mariner pool for sealift support. Additionally, designing sealift ships to military specifications would ensure they meet the military's cargo ship requirements. The military seeks cargo ships with flexible capabilities, including ramps or onboard cranes for unloading cargo at underdeveloped ports. The majority of the military sealift fleet consists of product tankers and roll-on/roll-off ships. The military's preference for versatility conflicts with the commercial fleet's trend towards specialized and larger ships. Commercial mariners may lack experience operating cargo cranes, which could be necessary in foreign ports. The shift in the maritime industry towards container ships without onboard cranes has led to a lack of experience among commercial mariners in operating cargo cranes, which may be necessary in foreign ports. The trend towards specialized and larger ships in the commercial fleet conflicts with the military's preference for versatile cargo ships with ramps or onboard cranes for unloading at underdeveloped ports. The military's ideal vessel designs are not aligned with those of commercial carriers due to the use of LNG-fueled engines and scrubbers. Licensing of engine crews is specific to engine type, creating a disparity in crew skill sets. The Jones Act aims to preserve a shipyard industrial base for building and repairing ships, but U.S. shipyards lack economies of scale and may experience gaps in orders for container ships. U.S. shipyards face challenges in building oceangoing ships due to lack of economies of scale, with gaps in orders for container ships. One shipyard building commercial ships had employment drop below 100 people with no vessels under construction. Smaller vessels like tour boats and ferries are built by more shipyards, but lack dry docks for large ship repairs. The government-owned sealift fleet is aging and in need of repair, with a shortage of large dry docks causing delays in readiness to sail. The government-owned sealift fleet, averaging 44 years old, lacks sufficient large dry docks for repairs, causing delays in readiness to sail. Some reserve fleet ships have failed safety inspections and are not seaworthy, with costly and lengthy repair processes. The Navy is considering purchasing used, foreign-built ships due to the high cost and time of repairing vessels in U.S. shipyards. The Navy is considering accelerating the purchase of used, foreign-built ships due to the high cost and time of repairing vessels in U.S. shipyards. The Tariff Act of 1930 imposes a 50% duty on nonemergency repairs on U.S. flag ships done in foreign shipyards, but many U.S.-flag international trading ships still opt for foreign repairs due to lower costs."
