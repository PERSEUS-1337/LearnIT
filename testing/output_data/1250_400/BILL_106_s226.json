    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nigerian Democracy and Civil Society Empowerment Act of 1999\". It includes findings and a declaration of policy. The Act \"Nigerian Democracy and Civil Society Empowerment Act of 1999\" contains findings by Congress regarding the negative impact of successive military regimes in Nigeria, the progress made by the current regime under Gen. Abdusalami Abubakar, and the cooperation in halting international drug trafficking. Since 1993, limited sanctions were imposed on Nigeria by the United States and other international members due to human rights violations and political repression. Some sanctions have been lifted following recent political liberalization, but decrees still exist that suspend constitutional protection of human rights, allow indefinite detention without charge, and revoke civilian court jurisdiction over executive actions. Nigeria is a party to various human rights treaties and agreements. Despite recent political liberalization and the lifting of some sanctions, Nigeria still faces challenges with human rights violations, including indefinite detention without charge and the potential for military repression. Nigeria's role in peacekeeping efforts in West Africa is significant, but concerns remain about the country's transition process, especially highlighted by events in the Niger Delta. Ongoing monitoring is crucial to ensure the success of the transition. Recent events in the Niger Delta highlight the need for ongoing monitoring of the situation in Nigeria to prevent a return to military repression. Congress emphasizes the importance of supporting political, economic, and legal reforms to ensure respect for human rights and a successful transition to democratic civilian government in Nigeria. The sense of Congress is for the President to coordinate with other countries to promote the rule of law, human rights, and democratic civilian government. Congress also urges the President to condemn human rights abuses in Nigeria at the United Nations Human Rights Commission and support the renewal of the special rapporteur's mandate. Additionally, assistance is recommended to promote democracy and civil society in Nigeria. Development Assistance for Nigeria should include not less than $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, $12,000,000 for fiscal year 2001, and $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2002 to promote democracy, good governance, and the rule of law through nongovernmental organizations representing a broad cross-section of society in Nigeria. The Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development ensures that nongovernmental organizations in Nigeria promote democracy, human rights, and accountable government. Grants are provided to support individuals or organizations advancing human rights in Nigeria. Additionally, funds are allocated for USIA Information Assistance to support these efforts. The United States Information Agency receives funding to promote awareness of democracy, rule of law, and human rights in Nigeria. Congress urges an increase in staff levels at the United States Agency for International Development office in Lagos. Development in Lagos, Nigeria is inadequate. Congress urges the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development to increase staff levels in Lagos and consider placing personnel elsewhere in Nigeria. SEC. 5 prohibits economic and military assistance to the government of Nigeria and requires opposition to multilateral assistance for Nigeria. Prohibition on Economic Assistance to the Government of Nigeria includes restrictions on various forms of economic aid, excluding disaster relief, refugee assistance, and narcotics control assistance. Prohibition on Military Assistance or Arms Transfers to Nigeria includes restrictions on providing military assistance or arms transfers, as defined by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. The definition of \"military assistance or arms transfers\" includes various forms of assistance under different acts such as the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and the Arms Export Control Act. The Secretary of the Treasury instructs the US executive director of international financial institutions to oppose any assistance to the Government of Nigeria. The institutions include the African Development Bank, International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, International Development Association, International Finance Corporation, Multilateral Investment Guaranty Agency, and International Monetary Fund. The sense of Congress is that if a democratic transition to civilian rule has not occurred in Nigeria by July 1, 1999, visas should be denied to senior Nigerian government officials and military officers. There is a provision for waiving these restrictions if certain requirements are met. The President can waive prohibitions in sections 5 or 6 for a fiscal year if a determination is made regarding Nigeria's human rights practices and freedoms. This includes not harassing advocates, implementing a transition program, respecting freedom of speech, releasing political prisoners, and allowing international human rights monitors access. The media should cease harassing journalists, release political prisoners held without due process, allow access for international human rights monitors, repeal laws granting undue powers to the military, and ensure policing in oil-producing communities is done without excessive force or human rights violations. The President can waive prohibitions on certain actions if it is in the national interests of the United States, with notification to Congress required at least 15 days in advance. SEC. 8. REPORT OF CORRUPTION IN NIGERIA.\n\nWithin 3 months of this Act's enactment, the Secretary of State must submit an annual report on corruption in Nigeria to Congress and the public. The report will cover evidence of corruption by Nigerian government officials, its impact on government services, U.S. business interests, advance fee fraud affecting U.S. citizens, and Nigeria's foreign policy. SEC. 9. APPROPRIATE CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES DEFINED. The term \"appropriate congressional committees\" refers to specific committees in the House of Representatives and Senate. SEC. 10. TERMINATION DATE. The provisions of this Act will end on September 30, 2004."
