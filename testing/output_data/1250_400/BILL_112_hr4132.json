    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Faster Access to Specialized Treatments Act\" or \"FAST Act\". Congress acknowledges the critical role of the FDA in ensuring the safety and effectiveness of new medicines. Advances in medical sciences have led to the development of targeted treatments for serious diseases, utilizing innovative drug development strategies. A new generation of modern, targeted medicines is under development to treat serious and life-threatening diseases, utilizing innovative drug development strategies. FDA should implement more effective processes for expedited development and review of innovative new medicines for unmet medical needs, including rare diseases, using modern scientific tools earlier in the drug development cycle. This may lead to fewer, smaller, or shorter clinical trials without compromising FDA's high standards for drug approval. Patients benefit from expedited access to safe and effective innovative therapies for serious or life-threatening diseases. The existing statutory authority for expedited drug approval should be enhanced to allow FDA to consider appropriate scientific data and tools, expediting access to novel treatments for a broad range of serious conditions. The FDA should utilize accelerated approval and fast track provisions to expedite the development and availability of treatments for serious or life-threatening diseases while maintaining safety and effectiveness standards. SEC. 3. EXPEDITED APPROVAL OF DRUGS FOR SERIOUS OR LIFE-THREATENING DISEASES OR CONDITIONS. Amends Section 506 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to expedite approval of drugs for serious or life-threatening diseases. The Secretary will expedite the review of new drugs intended for serious or life-threatening diseases if they demonstrate potential to address unmet medical needs. Sponsors can request designation as a fast track product, and the Secretary must decide within 60 days. The Secretary can designate a drug as a fast track product under section 505(i) or 351(a)(3) of the Public Health Service Act, expediting its development and review process. Additionally, the Secretary may approve a product for a serious or life-threatening disease under section 505(c) or 351(a) of the Act, considering the severity or rarity of the condition. Approval of a product for a serious or life-threatening disease under section 505(c) or 351(a) of the Public Health Service Act requires evidence that the product has an effect on a surrogate or clinical endpoint reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. This evidence may include various scientific methods or tools. The evidence supporting an endpoint's ability to predict clinical benefit may involve various scientific methods or tools, such as biomarkers. Approval of a product may be subject to post-approval studies to confirm its effects on clinical outcomes, and sponsors must submit promotional materials for review before dissemination. The Secretary may withdraw approval of a product if the sponsor fails to conduct post-approval studies diligently, if a study fails to verify predicted effects, or if other evidence shows issues with the product. The Secretary may withdraw approval of a product if post-approval studies are not conducted diligently, if predicted effects are not verified, or if other evidence shows issues with the product. The Secretary can review incomplete applications for fast track products if preliminary data suggests effectiveness, allowing for partial review before a complete application is submitted. The Secretary may review incomplete applications for product approval before a complete application is submitted, provided the applicant provides a schedule and pays any required fee. Any agreed-upon review timeframes do not apply until the application is complete. The Secretary is also required to develop and distribute awareness efforts to various stakeholders. The Secretary is required to develop and distribute awareness efforts to stakeholders regarding accelerated approval and fast track products, as well as encourage the development of scientific methods to predict clinical benefit for serious medical conditions. SEC. 4. GUIDANCE; AMENDED REGULATIONS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must issue draft guidance within one year of the enactment of the Act, followed by final guidance and amendments to regulations within one year of the draft guidance. Considerations include issues related to accelerated approval and fast track processes for drugs designated for rare diseases or conditions. The Secretary will consider issues related to accelerated approval and fast track processes for drugs designated for rare diseases or conditions, as well as incorporating novel approaches to reviewing surrogate endpoints based on pathophysiologic and pharmacologic evidence. The issuance of guidance or regulations implementing the amendments shall not delay the review or approval of requests or applications. SEC. 5. INDEPENDENT REVIEW.\n\nThe Secretary will contract with an independent entity to evaluate the FDA's application of new drug review processes and their impact on innovative treatments for serious conditions. Consultation with various stakeholders is required.\n\nSEC. 6. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.\n\nThe amendments aim to encourage innovative approaches for product assessment under accelerated approval while maintaining safety and effectiveness standards."
