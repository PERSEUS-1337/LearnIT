The \"Genetically Engineered Food Right-to-Know Act\" aims to establish a standard for labeling foods produced using genetic engineering, providing consumers with information on how their food is made. Congress recognizes the need for labeling due to material changes in genetically engineered food, and the right of individuals to know for various reasons. Over 60 countries have laws mandating disclosure of genetically engineered food on labels. Countries like the European Union, South Korea, Japan, Brazil, Australia, India, China, and other US trading partners have laws mandating disclosure of genetically engineered food on labels. The Codex Alimentarius adopted a text in 2011 allowing governments to decide on labeling genetically engineered foods. Mandatory identification of such foods can preserve economic value in exports and sensitive markets. SEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO THE FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG, AND COSMETIC ACT. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to require clear disclosure of genetically engineered ingredients in food, with exceptions for certain types of food like those served in restaurants or medical foods. The term 'genetic engineering' is defined as a process involving nucleic acid techniques. The paragraph defines genetic engineering as a process involving nucleic acid techniques, including recombinant DNA and fusion of cells beyond the taxonomic family. It also defines genetically engineered food as organisms produced intentionally through genetic engineering for human consumption. The term 'genetically engineered' refers to a material intended for human consumption that is produced through genetic engineering. 'Genetically engineered ingredient' means a material derived from an organism that has been genetically engineered, regardless of detectable molecular or cellular characteristics. Section 303(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include these definitions. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include definitions related to genetically engineered ingredients for human consumption. A new guaranty provision is added to protect individuals from penalties for violations involving misbranded food if a signed guaranty is provided by the recipient. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include definitions related to genetically engineered ingredients for human consumption. A new guaranty provision is added to protect individuals from penalties for violations involving misbranded food if a signed guaranty is provided by the recipient, stating that the food is not genetically engineered or does not contain genetically engineered ingredients. The exclusion from penalties applies regardless of how the recipient uses the food. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include definitions related to genetically engineered ingredients for human consumption. A new guaranty provision is added to protect individuals from penalties for violations involving misbranded food. Recipients can avoid liability by providing a guaranty stating that the food is not genetically engineered. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include definitions related to genetically engineered ingredients for human consumption. A new guaranty provision is added to protect individuals from penalties for violations involving misbranded food. Agricultural producers are exempt from penalties if their food does not contain genetically engineered material. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include definitions related to genetically engineered ingredients for human consumption. Agricultural producers are exempt from penalties if their food is contaminated with genetically engineered material unintentionally. The Secretary must establish labeling requirements within one year of the Act's enactment."
