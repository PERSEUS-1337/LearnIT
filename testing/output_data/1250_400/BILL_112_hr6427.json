Eligible applicants include national organizations, States or political subdivisions, and Indian tribes or tribal organizations. The grant conditions and requirements for eligible applicants include establishing job placement performance goals for self-sustaining job programs operated by the grantee.

Repayment to the Treasury is required for any such failure. The Secretary shall require repayment of funds in proportion to the degree of failure to meet job placement goals. Repayment shall be made over a 10-year period with no interest accruing. Alternatively, the recipient may comply with the goals to avoid repayment, as prescribed by the Secretary. In case of state failure, specific actions will be taken. The Secretary may require repayment of funds for failure to meet job placement goals, with repayment over a 10-year period. States facing penalties may have their grants reduced instead. State penalty limitations do not apply in this case. Additionally, there is an exclusion from the state reasonable cause exception under the Social Security Act. The exclusion from state penalty limitations under the Social Security Act is amended to include subsection (17). The text chunk is about an offset to ensure compliance with Paygo regulations."
