It is a blood vessel disease with vascular lesions in the brain and spinal cord. Detection is costly, and symptoms include neurological deficits, seizures, and stroke. Limited research means treatment is mainly brain or spinal surgery, with some patients ineligible for surgery. Cavernous angioma, a blood vessel disease affecting 1,500,000 people in the US, has no specific treatment regimen other than brain or spinal surgery. Some individuals may not be eligible for surgery, leading to a lack of treatment options. New Mexico has the highest population density of cavernous angioma due to a specific disease-causing mutation, affecting tens of thousands of individuals. Other states with high rates include Texas, Arizona, and Colorado. In the 1590s, New Mexico had the highest population density of cavernous angioma in the world, affecting tens of thousands of individuals. Other states with high rates include Texas, Arizona, and Colorado. Senate Resolution 148, 111th Congress, highlights the critical need to increase research, awareness, and education about cerebral cavernous malformations. The National Institutes of Health supports research at institutes of higher education to better understand biomedical systems and translate discoveries into clinical applications to address the public health threat posed by cavernous angioma. To address the public health threat of cavernous angioma, a Cavernous Angioma Clinical Care, Advocacy, Research, and Education Center is needed at the University of New Mexico to facilitate medical research and enhance care nationwide. SEC. 3. CAVERNOUS ANGIOMA CARE CENTER. A new section is added to the Public Health Service Act to establish Cavernous Angioma Care Centers of Excellence. The Director of NIH will establish a Cavernous Angioma CARE Center of Excellence at the University of New Mexico to conduct research and provide support for individuals with cavernous angioma. The center will consist of researchers, clinicians, and medical staff with expertise in various specialties. The Cavernous Angioma CARE Center of Excellence at the University of New Mexico will include a team of specialists such as a medical director, headache specialist, epilepsy specialist, psychiatrist, neuropsychologist, dermatologist, nurse practitioner, nurse coordinator, research coordinator, clinical nurse, radiology specialist, vascular fellow, basic science postdoctoral fellow, and genetic counselor. The center will be affiliated with a university medical center with an accredited medical school. The Cavernous Angioma CARE Center of Excellence at the University of New Mexico requires specialists like a vascular fellow, basic science postdoctoral fellow, and genetic counselor. The center must be affiliated with a university medical center with an accredited medical school, maintain a program for postdoctoral fellows in cavernous angioma research, recruit new researchers, provide medical education, and have patient advocacy programs. The Cavernous Angioma CARE Center of Excellence at the University of New Mexico offers professional training for medical clinicians in cavernous angioma care and patient management. They maintain programs for patient advocacy, outreach, and education, including public awareness campaigns, distributing patient education materials, educating school nurses for early detection, organizing educational conferences for patients and families, and developing electronic health tools for support. The center also communicates with other research institutions for information sharing and coordination. The Cavernous Angioma CARE Center aims to develop electronic health tools, establish communication with other research institutions, facilitate translational projects, and form an advisory board composed of individuals with expertise in cavernous angioma. The CARE Center is led by a Director with expertise in cavernous angioma patient care and research. The Director ensures high-quality care, promotes understanding and treatment of cavernous angioma, and coordinates opportunities for clinical research studies. The Center includes members with expertise in relevant biomedical disciplines and representatives from affiliated institutions. The CARE Center, led by a Director with expertise in cavernous angioma, provides patient-centered care, promotes clinical research opportunities, and aims to serve as a model facility for similar institutions nationwide. A biannual report on the Center's activities is submitted to the Secretary for review. The advisory board of the CARE Center submits a biannual report to the Secretary detailing progress, expenditures, and outcomes. $2,000,000 is authorized for the Center's establishment and operation in fiscal year 2011."
