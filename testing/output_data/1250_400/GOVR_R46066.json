This includes deploying troops to the Baltic States and Poland, conducting military exercises in Central and Eastern Europe, and establishing new command structures. Efforts are underway to enhance NATO's readiness, including the Four-Thirties Readiness Initiative proposed by the United States. Despite ongoing support for deterrence initiatives, concerns remain about China's growing investment and engagement in Europe. Some NATO allies question the effectiveness of deterrence initiatives, with concerns raised about the alliance's ability to defend its exposed members. While some countries like Poland and the Baltic States call for more forces in the region, others like Germany, Italy, and France advocate for a dual-track approach that combines deterrence with dialogue to rebuild relations with Russia. These allies are hesitant to permanently deploy troops in response to Russian aggression.

Critics have questioned the effectiveness of this approach. President Trump has urged European allies to increase defense spending, leading to substantial boosts in budgets over the past five years. NATO members agreed in 2006 to allocate at least 2% of GDP to defense annually, with formalized targets at the 2014 Wales Summit. Critics worry Trump's criticism of insufficient spending could harm NATO cohesion and credibility. European allies and Canada have added $130 billion in defense spending over five years. At NATO's 2014 Wales Summit, allies pledged to increase defense expenditures towards the 2% guideline within a decade. European allies and Canada have seen growth in defense spending for five consecutive years, with $130 billion added since 2014 and an expected rise to $400 billion by 2024. While 9 allies are expected to meet the 2% guideline in 2019, criticism persists towards NATO members, like Germany, for not reaching defense-spending targets. Germany currently spends 1.38% of GDP on defense, aiming for 1.5% by 2024, emphasizing contributions to NATO missions and military capabilities alongside total spending. Germany aims to increase defense spending to 1.5% of GDP by 2024, emphasizing the importance of contributions to NATO missions and military capabilities over total spending levels. Analysts stress the need to focus on defense outputs, such as military capabilities and effectiveness in NATO activities, rather than just defense inputs like budget size. NATO targets to allocate 20% of national defense expenditure to new equipment and research. In London, allied leaders approved a U.S. proposal to reduce assessed U.S. contributions and increase German contributions to NATO's common funds, which pay for day-to-day operations and some collective military assets.

The Trump Administration and Congress are concerned about China's increasing investment in Europe, particularly in critical infrastructure and telecommunications. This has raised security implications and calls for NATO to counter potential negative impacts on transatlantic security. Chinese investment in critical infrastructure and telecommunications, such as 5G networks, raises security concerns for U.S. officials and allies. NATO has adopted a plan to address risks associated with 5G technology, but individual national governments retain decision-making authority. Using Huawei or other Chinese 5G equipment could hinder intelligence sharing with the United States. The EU is working on common guidelines for 5G network contracting decisions, but individual national governments will still have the final say. Some European allies, like the UK and Germany, are open to Chinese companies bidding on contracts but have strict national security requirements. The UK announced restrictions on \"high-risk vendors\" like Huawei in sensitive parts of 5G networks. Other countries, such as Poland and Czech Republic, have also expressed concerns about Huawei's involvement in their telecommunications sector. The US and Europe are working together to address security and economic issues posed by China, with concerns about Huawei's involvement in telecommunications sectors.
