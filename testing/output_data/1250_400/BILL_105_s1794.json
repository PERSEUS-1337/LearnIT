The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to establish the Iraq Claims Fund for payment of claims. Funds from Iraqi asset liquidation will be allocated by the President between the Iraq Claims Fund and other accounts for payment of claims, with a limitation on the amount for US Government claims. The subsection limits the amount for payment of US Government claims from the Iraq Claims Fund based on certified claims determined to be valid by the Secretary of State. The President is authorized to vest and liquidate Iraqi assets in the US to satisfy claims under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The Secretary of the Treasury deducts 1.5% of funds into the Iraq Claims Fund for administrative expenses. Amounts deducted are treated as miscellaneous receipts in the US Treasury. Payments are made based on certified valid claims determined by the Secretary of State. The United States Commission certifies awards under section 2, and the Secretary of the Treasury makes payments from the Iraq Claims Fund in a specific order of priority. This includes initial payments, further payments towards unpaid balances, and pro rata payments for accrued interest on awards. After payment of awards from the Iraq Claims Fund, any remaining funds will be transferred to the Treasury. Payment of awards does not extinguish unsatisfied claims against the Government of Iraq. The Executive agency can transfer records to the United States Commission for adjudicating claims under this Act. The statute of limitations for certified awards under this Act is one year after the publication date of the notice. The Secretary of the Treasury must publish a notice in the Federal Register after 9 years, identifying unpaid claims. Unused funds must be disposed of within 2 years of the notice publication date. At the end of a 2-year period from the notice publication date, the Secretary of the Treasury will dispose of any unused funds from the Iraq Claims Fund by depositing them into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts if not used for additional payments.
