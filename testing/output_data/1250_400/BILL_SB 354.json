    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 7522.02 of the Government Code is amended to apply to all state and local public retirement systems and their participating employers, including various specific systems and individual retirement plans offered by public employers. The article is subject to the Internal Revenue Code and Section 17 of Article XVI of the California Constitution. Compliance with applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and the Revenue and Taxation Code is required for the administration of the requirements of this article. The article exempts certain entities and public employees from its application, including those specified in the California Constitution and federal law. Retirement plans approved before January 1, 2013, by excluded entities are not affected. Additionally, the article does not apply to public employees protected under federal law until a court ruling or January 1, 2016. The article exempts certain public employees from its application based on federal law and the California Constitution. It also excludes retirement plans approved before January 1, 2013, for specific entities. The benefit plan required by this article applies to new members as defined in Section 7522.04. The benefit plan required by this article applies to public employees who are new members as defined in Section 7522.04. Individuals who were employed by a public employer before January 1, 2013, and then became employed by a subsequent public employer for the first time on or after January 1, 2013, shall be subject to the retirement plan of the subsequent employer if they had concurrent membership or reciprocity established under specific provisions. An individual employed before January 1, 2013, who changed positions without a separation from employment and became subject to a different defined benefit plan in a different public retirement system offered by the employer shall be subject to that plan as if they were first employed on or before December 31, 2012. If a public employer offered a lower cost defined benefit pension plan before January 1, 2013, they can continue to offer it instead of the required formula. Any new defined benefit formula adopted after January 1, 2013, must have no greater risk or cost and be approved by the Legislature. New members can only participate in the lower cost formula or an approved one. If a public employer offers a defined contribution plan before January 1, 2013, they can continue to do so instead of the required defined benefit pension plan. Any new defined benefit plan adopted after January 1, 2013, must meet certain requirements and be approved by the Legislature. New members can only join the existing defined contribution plan or an approved plan. If the Cities of Brea and Fullerton form a joint powers authority after January 1, 2013, they can offer employees the same defined benefit plan they had before. Other cities in Orange County can join the authority by January 1, 2017, with a limit of three cities. On or before January 1, 2017, a city in Orange County contiguous to Brea or Fullerton may join the joint powers authority, with a limit of three cities. New members must participate in a defined benefit plan that complies with the requirements. The Judges\u2019 Retirement Systems are exempt from certain benefit and compensation limitations. Public retirement systems must modify their plans to comply with the article's requirements by January 1, 2013."
