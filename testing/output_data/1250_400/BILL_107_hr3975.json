The Congress finds that HIV/AIDS is predicted to become the worst infectious disease epidemic in history, surpassing past pandemics like the bubonic plague and the 1918 influenza outbreak. The gap in HIV transmission from mother to child between rich and poor countries is widening, potentially increasing child mortality by over 100% in heavily affected regions by 2010.
