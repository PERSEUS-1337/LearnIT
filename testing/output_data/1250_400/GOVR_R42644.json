    "content": "The Administration requested $39.510 billion for DHS in FY2013, a slight decrease from FY2012. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported a version of the FY2013 DHS Appropriations bill with a net discretionary appropriation of $39,514 million. The Senate-reported bill for FY2013 would have provided a net discretionary appropriation of $39,514 million for DHS, excluding overseas contingency operations and disaster relief. The House passed H.R. 5855 with amendments, resulting in a net discretionary appropriation of $39,114 million for DHS. Funding for certain activities was 27% below the requested level due to offsets from management accounts. Increases were proposed for various DHS activities. The FY2013 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, signed into law as P.L. 113-6, provided $39.646 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for the Department of Homeland Security. This included increases for various DHS activities, such as Customs and Border Protection, Coast Guard, and FEMA's Urban Search and Rescue Response activities. The FY2013 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, signed into law as P.L. 113-6, allocated $39.646 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for the Department of Homeland Security. This amount was reduced by $52.4 million due to across-the-board cuts unrelated to sequestration. After accounting for sequestration impacts, $38.348 billion was available for DHS to use. Data sources include the President's Budget Documents, H.Rept. 112-492, S.Rept. 112-169, FY2013 DHS Congressional Budget Justifications, and the FY2013 DHS Budget in Brief.

The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred functions, funding, and personnel to the Department of Homeland Security. Appropriations for DHS are organized into five titles, including funding for various offices and agencies like CBP, ICE, TSA, USCG, and the Secret Service. Title II of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 contains appropriations for various agencies under the Department of Homeland Security, including Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Transportation Security Administration, Coast Guard, and Secret Service. Title III includes funding for the National Protection and Programs Directorate, Office of Health Affairs, and Federal Emergency Management Agency. Title IV covers U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Science and Technology Directorate, and Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. Title V includes general provisions and additional titles may be added for special issues. The FY2012 House full committee mark-up added a sixth title for a $1 billion emergency appropriation for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), while the Senate version had no additional titles. The proposed FY2013 appropriations bills had similar structures but differences in subcomponents and accounts. Congress determines maximum budget authority for annual appropriations through a two-stage process, with overall spending totals set in the annual concurrent resolution on the budget and then allocated among appropriations committees. The 302(a) allocations are distributed among appropriations committees for annual appropriations bills. The appropriations committees then allocate the 302(a) discretionary funds to subcommittees for each bill as 302(b) allocations. These allocations must not exceed the 302(a) discretionary allocation to enforce budget discipline. Adjustments to 302(b) allocations can be made during the year. The FY2012 appropriations bills were impacted by the Budget Control Act, which established discretionary security measures. The FY2012 appropriations bills were the first affected by the Budget Control Act, which set spending caps for security and nonsecurity categories. For FY2013, a separate cap of $686 billion was set for security spending, with all other spending capped at $361 billion out of a total of $1.047 trillion. Adjustments can be made for overseas contingency operations, emergency spending, disaster relief, and continuing appropriations. The Budget Control Act set spending caps for security and nonsecurity categories, with a separate cap of $686 billion for security spending in FY2013. All other spending was capped at $361 billion out of a total of $1.047 trillion. Adjustments could be made for overseas contingency operations, emergency spending, disaster relief, and continuing appropriations. The Budget Control Act of 2011 set spending caps for security and nonsecurity categories in FY2013. An automatic spending reduction process was triggered due to the failure to enact deficit reduction legislation by January 15, 2012. The process included sequestration and lower discretionary spending caps, with the Office of Management and Budget implementing across-the-board spending cuts to achieve equal budget reductions from defense and nondefense funding. The American Taxpayer Relief Act made significant changes to the procedures in the BCA for FY2013. The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) of 2013 made changes to the Budget Control Act (BCA) of 2011 for FY2013. The joint committee sequester was delayed to March 1, 2013, with a $24 billion reduction. President Obama ordered the sequester's implementation, leading to budget authority cancellations at the program level. Sequestration was applied during a temporary continuing resolution, with reductions calculated annually throughout the fiscal year. Sequestration was applied at the program, project, and activity level within each account, with reductions calculated on an annualized basis. The post-sequestration numbers in this report are derived from the FY2013 DHS operating plan. Sections 3001 and 3004 of P.L. 113-6 aim to eliminate any excess budget authority provided in the act. The FY2013 discretionary spending limits were exceeded by the act, leading to across-the-board rescissions for \"nonsecurity\" and \"security\" budget authority. DHS falls under the \"security\" category and received a 0.1% cut to align with spending limits. OMB has the final say on exceeding limits, with potential increased rescissions if needed. The section provides across-the-board rescissions for nonsecurity and security budget authority, with OMB estimating additional cuts if needed to stay within limits. Funding for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terror and disaster relief is exempt from these cuts. Table 2 displays DHS's initial 302(b) allocations for FY2013. The DHS's appropriations process for FY2013 includes adjustments for emergency spending, overseas contingency operations, and disaster relief. The allowable adjustment for disaster relief is determined by OMB using a specific formula. Disaster relief funding for FY2013 was determined by OMB using a formula. The allowable adjustment for disaster relief was $11,779 million, fully exercised including pre-sequestration resources. Table 3 summarizes funding in the FY2012 DHS appropriations bill, FY2013 appropriations request, and final DHS appropriations legislation in P.L. 113-6. The Administration proposed a 0.5% pay increase for civilian federal employees. The final DHS appropriations legislation in P.L. 113-6 included a 0.5% pay increase for civilian federal employees, except for Coast Guard military personnel. The House rejected the pay raise, resulting in a slight reduction in appropriations for civilian salaries. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding the pay raise, but neither the part-year continuing resolution nor P.L. 113-6 provided resources for it. Breaking down the DHS bill by title does not offer transparency into how appropriated resources are allocated, as different components of DHS have varying budget sizes. Table 4 and Figure 1 show DHS's pre-sequester discretionary budget authority for FY 2013 by component. The DHS appropriations legislation in P.L. 113-6 included a 0.5% pay increase for civilian federal employees, except for Coast Guard military personnel. Breaking down the DHS bill by title does not provide transparency into how appropriated resources are allocated, as different components of DHS have varying budget sizes. Table 4 and Figure 1 show DHS's pre-sequester discretionary budget authority for FY 2013 by component, with additional information on adjustments to the allocation allowed under the Budget Control Act. The discretionary budget authority provided in P.L. 113-6 is compared against the bill's budget allocation, along with resources available under adjustments to the discretionary budget cap under the BCA. Funding provided under these adjustments is not treated as appropriations. DHS components receive funding from various sources, such as fee income and offsetting collections. Less than 4% of CIS's budget is from direct appropriations. Figure 2 illustrates that a significant portion of the DHS budget is not funded through discretionary appropriations. Less than 4% of the CIS budget is from direct appropriations, with the rest relying on fee income. The DHS budget is not fully funded through discretionary appropriations, as shown in Figure 2. Table 5 presents DHS appropriations for FY2003 through FY2013 in current dollars. The graphs are derived from the Administration's budget request documents, not congressional documents. Table 5 shows DHS appropriations for FY2003 through FY2013 in current dollars, not adjusted for inflation or sequestration. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees marked up bills in 2012, with P.L. 113-6 being the second-latest enactment of finalized annual appropriations. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees marked up bills in 2012, with P.L. 113-6 being the second-latest enactment of finalized annual appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security. The DHS appropriations bill provides funding for management activities, Analysis and Operations (A&O) account, and the Office of the Inspector General (OIG). The Administration requested $1,279 million for these accounts in FY2013, with the House-passed bill proposing $1,020 million and the Senate-reported bill proposing $1,102 million. After across-the-board cuts, the final appropriations amount to $1,086 million.

After across-the-board cuts, the final appropriations amount to $1,086 million, with sequestration reducing it further to $1,026 million. The House-passed and Senate-reported appropriations for DHS in P.L. 113-6, along with the post-sequester level of available resources, cover general administrative expenses. This includes the Office of the Secretary and Executive Management, Under Secretary for Management, Chief Administrative Officer, Chief Human Capital Officer, Chief Procurement Officer, Chief Security Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Information Officer. The Administration usually requests funding for headquarters consolidation. A graphic representation of discretionary appropriations for each DHS element is provided for reference. The discretionary appropriation provided to each element of DHS is represented in a graphic for quick reference. The FY2013 request compared to the FY2012 enacted appropriations shows increases for OSEM, OCFO, and OCIO, and a decrease for USM. The total request for departmental management activities in FY2012 was $724 million, excluding $89 million for the consolidation of DHS headquarters. The Administration requested $134 million for OSEM. The Administration requested $222 million for the USM and 902 full-time employee equivalents (FTEs), with program changes proposed for the Immediate Office of the Under Secretary for Management (OUSM). The Administration requested funding for various programs under the USM, including the transfer of the Directives function, salaries and expenses for OCHCO, and improvements to the Nebraska Avenue Complex. Additionally, $55 million was requested for the OCFO, with a focus on Financial Systems Modernization efforts. The OCFO justification includes $6.7 million for the Financial Systems Modernization effort to implement a new core financial system at FEMA in FY2013. The OCIO account requested $122 million for Infrastructure and Security Activities, including $65 million for data center migration activities for CBP, TSA, and USCIS. H.R. 5855 would have provided appropriations compared to the President's request, with OSEM receiving $122 million, USM receiving $213 million, OCFO receiving $50 million, and OCIO receiving $242 million. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended appropriations for various departments, including OSEM, USM, OCFO, and OCIO, with reductions ranging from 4% to 23% compared to the President's request. The total funding for management activities was $627 million, a decrease of 13.4%. Amendments were passed during floor consideration of the bill to further reduce the budget for management. During floor consideration of the bill on June 6, 2013, amendments were offered to reduce the budget for departmental management accounts by almost $33 million. The four largest amendments that passed included decreasing funds for the Office of the Under Secretary for Management and increasing funds for various agencies like the Federal Emergency Management Agency and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. During the bill's floor consideration on June 6, 2013, amendments were passed to reduce the budget for departmental management accounts by almost $33 million. The amendments included decreasing funds for the Office of the Under Secretary for Management and increasing funds for agencies like the Federal Emergency Management Agency and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. One of the amendments reduced funds for the Office of the Under Secretary for Management by $10 million and increased funds for U.S. Customs and Border Protection Security Fencing, Infrastructure, and Technology by $10 million. Another amendment reduced funds for the Office of the Under Secretary for Management by $5 million and increased funds for Firefighter Assistance Grants by $5 million. These changes left the USM with an appropriation of $180 million, $41 million less than the requested level. Representative Flake's amendment redirected funds from official reception and representation expenses to increase U.S. Customs and Border Protection Salaries and Expenses by $43,000. During the bill's floor consideration on June 6, 2013, amendments were passed to reduce the budget for departmental management accounts by almost $33 million. Representative Flake redirected funds from official reception and representation expenses to increase U.S. Customs and Border Protection Salaries and Expenses by $43,000. Additionally, provisions withheld $71 million from obligation until all required reports for the FY2014 budget request were submitted. Another provision proposed withholding $5 million for the Office of General Counsel until a final overseas aircraft repair station security regulation was published. Funding of $5 million was proposed to be withheld for the Office of General Counsel until a final overseas aircraft repair station security regulation has been published. Under the USM appropriation, over $124 million would have been withheld until all required reports for the FY2014 budget request were submitted. The House Appropriations Committee recommended a reduction of $7 million for OCPO for failure to comply with the statutory requirement to submit a comprehensive acquisition report on time. Additionally, over $29 million would have been withheld under the OCFO account until all required reports and plans were submitted. The House Appropriations Committee recommended withholding over $29 million from the OCFO account until all required reports and plans were submitted. They also emphasized the need for direct communication from relevant components regarding their areas of responsibility. The recommended appropriation for the Office of the Chief Information Officer included allocations for salaries, expenses, development, acquisition of IT equipment, software, services, and security activities. The House recommended appropriations for the Office of the Chief Information Officer included $27 million for Information Technology Services and $55 million for Security Activities. The Senate-reported bill would have provided appropriations slightly less than the President's request, with a total funding of $655 million for departmental management in Title I. The Senate-reported bill proposed a total funding of $655 million for departmental management in Title I, representing a decrease of $69 million (9.5%) from the President's request. The bill included a programmatic increase for the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (OCRCL) to ensure compliance with civil rights statutes. However, funding for OCRCL was still down by roughly $1 million (3.5%) from FY2012 levels. The committee report also mentioned the discontinuation of funding for the DHS historian and encouraged the Secretary to fill the position using funds provided in FY2013. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a $35 million appropriation for the Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer (OCHCO), which was $1 million below the requested amount. Funding for reception and representation expenses was reduced by 15% for FY2012 and proposed to be further reduced by 10% for FY2013. The committee emphasized the need for robust oversight of major acquisitions, recruitment of skilled workforce, and security measures to safeguard DHS personnel and facilities. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a $35 million appropriation for the Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer (OCHCO), $1 million below the request. The Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) would receive $248 million, with $121 million for salaries and expenses and $127 million for technology investments. Data center migration funding of $65 million was included in the bill, with expected savings of nearly $3 billion by 2030. The committee report noted that investment in data center consolidation is expected to result in savings of nearly $3 billion by 2030. The law provides appropriations for departmental management, with funding reductions for OSEM, USM, OCFO, and OCIO compared to the President's request. The total funding provided by the law for departmental management is $643 million, representing a decrease of $170 million or 21% from the President's request. Sequestration led to a funding reduction for OCIO, as outlined in the DHS Operating Plan. The management accounts, specifically OCIO, faced funding reductions due to sequestration. A crediting mechanism outlined in 2 USC 903 reduced sequestration for activities with final FY2013 appropriations below OMB's baseline. P.L. 113-6 directed the DHS CIO to submit a multi-year investment plan for IT projects. Additionally, the Secretary was required to report travel costs and submit a contingency plan. The Senate's explanatory statement directs the Secretary to report travel costs and submit a contingency plan. The USM is required to provide a Comprehensive Acquisition Status Report and quarterly updates. DHS must submit a report on workforce strategy implementation and justify any insourcing or outsourcing initiatives in the annual budget request. DHS is required to provide quarterly updates on workforce strategy implementation to appropriations committees. The CFO will continue to brief on financial systems modernization efforts. Funding levels for management accounts are outlined in Table 7, reflecting spending cuts from FY2012 enacted amounts. The \"DHS Plan\" column shows budgetary resources after sequestration as of April 26, 2013, with potential transfers and reprogramming to mitigate impacts. House and Senate Appropriations committees identified issues, including the Administration's proposal. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) provided quarterly updates on workforce strategy implementation to appropriations committees. The CFO briefed on financial systems modernization efforts. Funding levels for management accounts reflected spending cuts from FY2012 enacted amounts. The \"DHS Plan\" column showed budgetary resources after sequestration as of April 26, 2013, with potential transfers and reprogramming to mitigate impacts. House and Senate Appropriations committees identified issues with the Administration's proposal for separate line items for three offices under OSEM. The House and Senate Appropriations committees rejected a proposal to have three offices directly report to the Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans (OSPP) within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). They suggested consolidating the functions of these offices into an external affairs office to streamline operations and reduce administrative overhead. The Senate committee questioned the need for these offices to operate independently, stating that their functions could be adequately performed within the Office of Policy. The Senate committee report questioned the need for stand-alone external affairs offices within DHS, suggesting that their functions could be consolidated into the Office of Policy. The Administration's budget proposed three legislative measures to increase DHS's budget resources, but the House rejected them while the Senate included them. The House committee noted concerns about revenue assumptions in the budget, particularly regarding a shortfall of $115 million related to a proposed aviation security fee increase. The House committee rejected proposed legislative measures to increase DHS's budget resources, citing concerns about revenue assumptions and a $115 million shortfall related to an aviation security fee increase. The committee emphasized the unrealistic budgeting approach and stated that such proposals will not be considered in appropriations work until enacted into law. The House committee rejected proposed legislative measures to increase DHS's budget resources due to concerns about revenue assumptions and a shortfall related to an aviation security fee increase. The Committee will only consider proposals enacted into law for appropriations work. P.L. 113-6 allowed CBP to initiate pilot projects for reimbursable agreements for customs services. The House committee report expressed concern about late submission of required plans and reports to Congress, withholding funding from departmental management accounts. The Department's failure to comply with statutory requirements was deemed unacceptable by the Committee. The Department has been egregiously late in responding to Congressional direction, failing to submit statutorily required reports on time. The investment plans, expenditure plans, reports, and justifications outlined by the Committee are essential for DHS to better protect the American people and uphold fiscal responsibility. The Committee expects compliance with statutory requirements for content and schedule, as many reports and plans are currently over three months late. The Committee expects the Department to comply with statutory requirements for submitting reports and plans on time. The Senate-reported bill proposed withholding 59% of budgets until all required expenditure reports are submitted. House floor action reduced the USM budget, resulting in potential withholding of 70% of its budget. Section 562 of P.L. 113-6 withholds 20% of budgets until all reports and plans due by May 1 are submitted. In FY2013, 70% of the USM budget would have been withheld under Section 562 of P.L. 113-6. The House committee report highlighted the need for better oversight of expenditures, requiring the Office of Inspector General to report on compliance with federal laws on travel, conferences, and employee awards programs. Both House and Senate bills included provisions for quarterly reporting on government events costing over $20,000, with the Senate also restricting event spending. Both House and Senate bills included provisions for quarterly reporting on government events costing over $20,000, with the Senate also restricting event spending and limiting the number of employees that can attend an overseas conference. The House and Senate bills included provisions for quarterly reporting on government events costing over $20,000 and limiting the number of employees attending overseas conferences. The Department of Homeland Security's headquarters occupies over 7 million square feet in 45 locations in the Washington, DC area, leading to inefficiencies. The Department of Homeland Security's headquarters is currently spread out in about 45 locations in the Washington, DC area, leading to inefficiencies. To address this issue, a $3.4 billion master plan has been approved to create a new DHS headquarters at St Elizabeths in Anacostia, with $1.4 billion funded through the DHS budget and $2 billion through the GSA. Phase 1A of the project, a new Coast Guard headquarters facility, is nearing operational status. The DHS headquarters is currently spread out in 45 locations in Washington, DC. A $3.4 billion master plan has been approved to create a new DHS headquarters at St Elizabeths in Anacostia. $1.4 billion is funded through the DHS budget and $2 billion through the GSA. Phase 1A of the project, a new Coast Guard headquarters facility, is nearing operational status. $1,366 million has been invested in the project so far through FY2012. The Administration has sought funding for consolidation of some offices to save money on lease costs. $89 million was requested for activities related to the St. Elizabeths DHS headquarters project. The funding requested for a highway interchange to support the DHS consolidated headquarters project was not traditionally funded through the Homeland Security appropriations bill. The Administration also requested $24.5 million for moving the Coast Guard to its new facility. The House Appropriations Committee recommended no funding for the highway interchange, but approved funding for the Coast Guard's move. The House Appropriations Committee recommended no new construction funding for the Departmental Headquarters Consolidation expansion, $89 million below the request. Funding was included in the Coast Guard appropriation for the move to St. Elizabeths, with additional support for the project from the Coast Guard's construction budget. The Committee recommended additional funding under Coast Guard construction for the move to St. Elizabeths, with support for site access and planning adjustments. The Department is exploring options to modify current leases due to delays in headquarters construction. $10,000,000 is allocated for Phase 1 of construction to ensure Coast Guard's move in 2013. The Coast Guard Acquisition, Construction, and Improvements account is allocated $10,000,000 for Phase 1 of construction to facilitate their move to St. Elizabeths in 2013. However, the bill does not provide the $89 million needed for site access improvements for DHS personnel to access the new headquarters. This lack of funding has caused delays and increased costs for the project, which is now estimated to cost over $4 billion for all three phases. The bill only funds the Coast Guard relocation in 2013, with no funding allocated for Phase 2 construction for DHS central headquarters and FEMA. Amendments addressing DHS headquarters consolidation were not considered on the House floor. The bill only funds the Coast Guard relocation in 2013, with no funding allocated for Phase 2 construction for DHS central headquarters and FEMA. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $89 million for the highway interchange, funded through the Under Secretary for Management's office. An attempt to use the $89 million as an offset for an unrelated amendment failed, and the funding remained in the reported version of the legislation. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $89 million for the highway interchange, funded through the Under Secretary for Management's office. The committee specified that the Under Secretary must submit an expenditure plan within 90 days detailing how the funds will be allocated for headquarters consolidation. Quarterly briefings on consolidation activities are required, with an updated plan expected to be completed by the end of summer 2012. The Department is developing an updated plan with the General Services Administration to complete the headquarters consolidation project in smaller, manageable segments. The plan will identify construction segments, resource requirements, and funding timelines. $29 million is allocated for necessary expenses related to the project, which was not reduced through sequestration. The DHS operating plan includes funds for the department headquarters project and mission support consolidation, with $322 million allocated for the Analysis and Operations account supporting intelligence and operations coordination. The Office of Intelligence and Analysis manages the DHS intelligence enterprise, while the Office of Operations Coordination and Planning develops interagency operations plans and manages the National Operations Center. The Analysis and Operations account manages the National Operations Center, coordinating domestic incident management and situational awareness. The FY2013 budget request was $322 million, a decrease of $16 million from FY2012. H.R. 5855 proposed $317 million for the account, $4.5 million below the President's request. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended denying certain funding increases and decreases, with the Senate also involved in the decision-making process. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $324 million for the Analysis and Operations account, a decrease of $14 million from FY2012 and an increase of $2 million from the President's FY2013 request. The Committee required DHS's Chief Intelligence Officer to submit an expenditure plan for FY2013 within 60 days of the appropriations bill enactment, focusing on unique expertise and intelligence customers not supported by other components of the intelligence community. The Committee directed DHS to focus the expenditure plan for FY2013 on I&A's functions providing unique expertise or serving intelligence customers not supported by other components of the intelligence community. P.L. 113-6 provides $322 million for the Analysis and Operations account, falling between the amounts in H.R. 5855 and S. 3216. The operating plan for FY2013 indicates sequestration reduced this to $306 million. Some Members of Congress have concerns about I&A's funding. The operating plan for DHS for FY2013 indicates sequestration reduced funding to $306 million, with concerns raised by some Members of Congress about I&A's mission focus and overlapping authorities. Representative Sue Myrick highlighted the lack of focus in I&A's mission during a House hearing on DHS's role in the intelligence community. The Aspen Institute report recommended avoiding duplication of intelligence efforts across agencies. The Aspen Institute report recommended that DHS's intelligence mission should focus on specific homeward-focused areas where it has unique strengths and value, avoiding duplication of efforts by other agencies. Concerns were raised about potential duplication of intelligence efforts by I&A and the need for a clear expenditure plan centered around its functions. The DHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) is an independent body that conducts audits and investigations to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse within the department. They requested $144 million in funding, including $2.6 million for audits of states receiving FEMA grant funds for disaster preparedness. The DHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) requested $144 million in funding, including $2.6 million for audits of states receiving FEMA grant funds for disaster preparedness. The House-passed bill included $109 million for the DHS OIG, but $10 million was reduced due to dissatisfaction with communication on border corruption investigations. $24 million of the OIG's budget was funded through a transfer from FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund for disaster-related audits and investigations. The Senate-reported bill allocated $123 million for the DHS OIG, with $24 million from FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund for audits and investigations related to corruption at CBP and ICE. The funding increase was intended to complete all audits mandated under P.L. 110-53 by a specific deadline. The DHS OIG received $121 million in net budget authority for FY2013, with a $4 million increase from the previous year. Sequestration reduced the budget authority by $7 million, bringing the total resources to $138 million, $3 million less than FY2012 levels. The funding included a $24 million transfer from the Disaster Relief Fund to address corruption at CBP and ICE. Sequestration reduced OIG budget authority by roughly $7 million in FY2013, bringing total resources to $138 million. The OIG was required to conduct reviews and provide reports on various matters, including DHS expenditures and reviews of local law enforcement operations. The House directed the OIG to report on compliance with federal laws, conduct TSA screening inspections, assess fraud detection reforms, and review delays in FEMA determinations. The OIG was directed to ensure compliance with federal laws, conduct TSA screening inspections, assess fraud detection reforms, and review delays in FEMA determinations. The Senate did not include these provisions but directed a review of FEMA's application of its rules for awarding public assistance funds. The OIG's tasks represent new work, including integrity investigations. The House and Senate reports emphasize compliance with language unless specifically negated. No additional funding is allocated for new tasks for the OIG, except for integrity investigations. Concerns were raised about the OIG's organizational structure hindering independence and timely reporting. GAO is directed to review the OIG's structure and reporting functions. Many senior positions in the OIG are filled by officials in acting roles, potentially impacting its ability to fulfill duties. The OIG's organizational structure may hinder independence and timely reporting, with many senior positions filled by officials in acting roles. The DHS appropriations bill includes funding for various agencies like CBP, ICE, TSA, USCG, and USSS. The requested budget for FY2013 was $30,759 million, with slight variations in the House-passed and Senate-reported bills. After across-the-board cuts, the final appropriations for Title II were $31,267 million, an increase of 1.7% from the requested amount. The DHS appropriations bill for FY2013 provided $31,267 million for Title II, with sequestration reducing it to $30,184 million. CBP is responsible for security at ports of entry, inspecting people and goods for immigration and customs enforcement. CBP is responsible for security at ports of entry, inspecting people and goods for immigration and customs enforcement. Their major programs include Border Security Inspections and Trade Facilitation, Border Security and Control between Ports of Entry, Air and Marine Interdiction, Automation Modernization, Border Security Fencing, Infrastructure, and Technology, Facilities Management, and immigration and customs user Fee Accounts. Border Patrol is responsible for security at ports of entry, inspecting people and goods for immigration and customs enforcement. Their major programs include Border Security Inspections and Trade Facilitation, Border Security and Control between Ports of Entry, Air and Marine Interdiction, Automation Modernization, Border Security Fencing, Infrastructure, and Technology, Facilities Management, and immigration and customs user Fee Accounts. Funding numbers for P.L. 113-6 reflect spending cuts relative to FY2012 enacted amounts, but do not include additional cuts required by sequestration. The Administration requested an appropriation of $10,345 million for CBP for FY2013, an increase of $190 million over the enacted FY2012 level. The Administration requested an appropriation of $10,345 million for CBP for FY2013, an increase of $190 million over the enacted FY2012 level. The total request included program changes such as transferring the US-VISIT program to CBP and increasing funding for the Automated Targeting System and security-related targeting. The FY2013 budget includes a $261.5 million increase for CBP, with additional funding for the Automated Targeting System, Office of Intelligence and Investigative Liaison, National Targeting Center, Container Security Initiative, intellectual property rights enforcement, and Centers for Excellence and Expertise. There are decreases in funding for the Office of Air and Marine Interdictions and management and administration staffing. Decrease in funding for Marine Interdictions and Air and Marine salaries due to fewer new aircraft acquisitions and air missions. Reduction in management and administration staffing and services, fleet acquisition and management, information technology infrastructure and support, nonintrusive inspection operations and maintenance, CBP officer overtime expenses, field support staff salaries, and training expenses. The House approved $10,172 in net budget authority for CBP for FY2013, with decreases in various expenses such as officer overtime, field support staff salaries, Air and Marine salaries, training expenses, and transportation program costs. This marked a slight increase from the previous year's appropriation and a decrease from the President's request. CBP would have received $11,689 in gross budget authority, a $37 million increase from last year and a $283 million decrease from the President's request. Amendments included adding funds for CBP salaries, communications infrastructure, and cutting environmental mitigation. The Senate proposed $10,454 million in net budget authority for CBP for FY2013, an increase of $299 million from last year and $109 million from the President's request. The Senate-reported bill included $11,971 in gross budget authority, a $319 million increase from last year and a slight decrease from the President's request. The Senate-reported bill for FY2013 included $11,971 in gross budget authority for CBP, a $319 million increase from last year's appropriation and a slight decrease from the President's request. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 provided $10,356 million in net budget authority for CBP, an increase of $201 million from last year and $12 million from the President's request. Sequestration further reduced CBP budget authority by roughly an additional $575 million. The DHS FY2013 expenditure plan reduced CBP budget authority by $575 million, projecting total spending to be $11,298 million. Policy issues during the appropriations cycle included US-VISIT program, CBP staffing, customs user fees, border surveillance technology, and cargo security. Congress mandated an automated entry-exit data system for foreign visitors in 1996. The Entry-Exit System, established by the Responsibility Act of 1996, tracks foreign visitors entering and exiting the United States by collecting biographic and biometric identification information. This data is stored in DHS databases and shared with various government agencies to identify potential risks. The system has been operational at most U.S. ports of entry since December 2006, requiring most non-citizens to provide biometric data when entering the country. However, biometric data is not collected from non-citizens exiting the U.S. The Entry-Exit System, established in 1996, tracks foreign visitors entering and exiting the United States by collecting biographic and biometric data. While biometric data is required for most non-citizens entering the country, it is not collected from those exiting. The President's FY2013 budget did not include funding for a biometric exit system, focusing instead on an enhanced biographic exit program and an integrated U.S.-Canadian entry-exit system. The Entry-Exit System, established in 1996, tracks foreign visitors entering and exiting the United States by collecting biographic and biometric data. High-priority overstays are quickly flagged for follow-up investigations. The integrated U.S.-Canadian system shares biometric records of third country nationals entering Canada with DHS. Some Members of Congress have expressed frustration over the lack of a biometric exit system. The system's place in the DHS organizational structure has changed multiple times since its creation in 2003 as the U.S. Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology (US-VISIT) Program. The US-VISIT Program's organizational structure within DHS has undergone several changes since its creation in 2003. Initially coordinated under the Directorate of Border and Transportation Security, it was later proposed to be placed in a Screening Coordination Office that was never funded. Eventually, US-VISIT became a stand-alone office within DHS before being transferred to the National Protection and Programs Directorate. In FY2013, there was a proposal to divide US-VISIT's work between CBP and ICE, but this move was not fully supported by Congress. In FY2013, the US-VISIT Program was replaced by the Office of Biometric Identity Management within NPPD. The budget proposed transferring US-VISIT's work to CBP and ICE, but Congress did not fully support the move. The President's budget requested funding for CBP officers and U.S. Border Patrol agents. The President's FY2013 budget requested funding for 21,186 CBP officers and 21,370 U.S. Border Patrol agents. Both chambers' budget proposals supported the staffing levels but raised questions about how DHS sets them. The Senate report warned of adverse consequences if DHS maintains high staffing levels during budget tightening, while the House report encouraged CBP to consider changes to reduce staffing requirements at POEs. The House and Senate reports proposed changes to reduce CBP staffing at POEs, including automation, risk-based targeting, and expanding trusted programs. Some members disagree with reducing staffing, as border patrol staffing has increased significantly compared to OFO staffing. User fees fund 37% of CBP officer salaries, and efforts are being made to refine the model for forecasting user fee revenues. Some Members may disagree with efforts to reduce CBP staffing at POEs, as border patrol staffing has increased significantly compared to OFO staffing. With the implementation of sequestration in 2013, DHS officials warned of potential furloughs and reduced hiring, impacting over 5,000 Border Patrol agents and 2,750 personnel. With sequestration implemented on March 1, 2013, DHS officials warned of potential furloughs and reduced hiring for frontline CBP personnel. Measures to minimize impact include eliminating performance awards, reducing contracts, and working with appropriators to reprogram funds. CBP plans to rely on overtime reductions and hiring freezes to avoid or minimize furloughs, although specific plans have not been announced yet. The administration is considering leveraging public-private partnerships to fund staffing and infrastructure at ports of entry, as CBP faces potential furloughs and reduced overtime hours due to budget constraints. Despite restrictions, CBP may enter into up to five partnerships in FY2013 to provide additional services at POEs. Section 560 of P.L. 113-6 allows CBP to enter into public-private partnerships to fund additional services at ports of entry, including officer overtime costs. User fees, known as COBRA fees, reimburse CBP for customs services, overtime compensation, and other functions. Merchandise processing fees are also deposited into CBP's account. Certain COBRA fees, including merchandise processing fees, are used to fund customs functions such as overtime compensation and benefits for CBP officers. Congressional interest has been drawn to instances where passenger fees were collected without a corresponding appropriation for customs functions. The Act of 1993 temporarily increased fees for passengers entering the United States, resulting in the collection of $639 million from FY1994-FY1997. The United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act of 2011 eliminated a passenger fee exemption for travelers from Mexico, Canada, and other Western Hemisphere states, leading to an increase in COBRA fees. These funds were directed to the Customs User Fee Account but have not yet been obligated for customs revenue collection. Members of Congress have raised questions about the disposition of these fees. The Act of 1993 increased passenger fees, resulting in $639 million collected from FY1994-FY1997. The funds were directed to the Customs User Fee Account but have not been used for customs revenue collection. Some Members of Congress have questioned the use of these fees. The House Appropriations Committee directed CBP to report on access to the funds identified by GAO. P.L. 113-6 appropriated an additional $110 million to address a budget shortfall in CBP. The House and Senate addressed a budget shortfall in CBP salaries by shifting funds and increasing fee revenues. P.L. 113-6 appropriated an additional $110 million for CBP salaries and directed the use of technology for border control. Previous surveillance initiatives have not met desired levels of surveillance. The government has struggled to develop an effective border surveillance system, with past initiatives like America's Shield Initiative and SBI net facing criticism for contracting issues and cost overruns. The Obama Administration replaced SBI net with the Arizona Border Technology Plan, focusing on rapid deployment of existing technology. However, House and Senate reports expressed frustration with the slow implementation of the new plan, citing delays in procuring and implementing new surveillance equipment. The House and Senate appropriations reports criticized DHS for the slow implementation of the Arizona Border Technology Plan, specifically noting delays in procuring new surveillance equipment. Both chambers recommended fully funding the border surveillance mission but also called for rescinding unobligated balances from the BSFIT account. CBP utilizes manned and unmanned aircraft in addition to ground-based surveillance for border security. The President's FY2013 budget request for the Office of Air and Marine Interdiction (OAM) supported 277 aircraft for drug interdiction and border surveillance activities, including $3 million for the \"Big Pipe\" project. CBP operated 10 unmanned aerial systems (UAS) in FY2012, with some Members of Congress supporting their use for border surveillance despite privacy concerns. In FY2012, UAS accounted for 5,737 flight hours, up from 4,406 hours in FY2011. Some Members of Congress support UAS for border surveillance, but there are concerns about privacy and cost effectiveness. A DHS Inspector General report criticized CBP's UAS program for lack of support resources. Both appropriations committees recommended increases to the OAM budget, with the House recommending $82.7 million and the Senate recommending $70.9 million for upgrading the fleet and supporting UAS operations. P.L. 113-6 appropriated about $799 million for Air and Marine Operations. In FY2012, UAS flight hours increased to 5,737 from 4,406 in FY2011. Congress recommended budget increases for upgrading the OAM fleet and supporting UAS operations. P.L. 113-6 allocated $799 million for Air and Marine Operations, with funds shifted from CBP's Salaries and Expenses account. CBP is responsible for screening cargo at U.S. ports of entry for contraband and dangerous materials, with requirements set by the SAFE Port Act and The 9/11 Act. The 100% scanning requirement for U.S.-bound cargo has raised concerns about balancing security benefits with costs. DHS officials suggest focusing on high-risk cargo and a random sample of lower-risk cargo to cut costs and make better use of resources. Homeland Security Secretary Napolitano extended the scanning deadline in May 2012. The DHS suggests focusing on high-risk cargo and a random sample of lower-risk cargo to cut costs and make better use of resources for U.S. importers. The FY2013 budget request included increases to the Container Security Initiative and Automated Targeting System for security screening of incoming goods and travelers. House and Senate Appropriations Committee reports supported these programs, acknowledging concerns about the costs of implementing a 100% scanning program at foreign ports. ICE focuses on enforcement of immigration and customs laws within the United States. The House report and P.L. 113-6 acknowledge DHS' concerns about the costs of implementing a 100% scanning program at foreign ports. ICE focuses on enforcing immigration and customs laws in the US, including investigating violations and removing aliens. ICE also combats terrorist financing, money laundering, and enforces export laws. Funding numbers for P.L. 113-6 reflect spending cuts. ICE requested $5,332 million in net budget authority for FY2013, a decrease of $218 million from FY2012. The budget included increases for the Alternatives to Detention program and personnel consolidation. Funding numbers for ICE reflect spending cuts. The Administration requested $5,644 million in gross budget authority for ICE in FY2013, a decrease of $218 million from FY2012. The budget included increases for the Alternatives to Detention program, personnel consolidation, video conferencing expansion, and transfer of the US-VISIT Program. Reductions were made for the 287(g) program, Office of Principle Legal Advisor, detention beds, and Secure Communities. The House-passed H.R. 5855 would have provided $5,474 million in net budget authority for FY2013. The House-passed H.R. 5855 proposed $5 million for the Office of Principle Legal Advisor (OPLA), a reduction of $53 million for detention beds, and a reduction of $41 million for Secure Communities. The bill would have given ICE a total funding authority of $5,786 million, representing a decrease of $77 million (1.3%) from the FY2012 enacted level and an increase of $142 million (2.5%) over the Administration's request. The Senate-Reported S. 3216 recommended ICE receive $5,330 million in net budget authority for FY2013, a decrease of $2 million (less than 0.1%) from the Administration's request and a decrease of $220 million (4.0%) from the FY2012 enacted amount. The Senate-reported S. 3216 proposed a $2 million decrease in funding for ICE from the Administration's request, and a $220 million decrease from the FY2012 enacted amount. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 provided $5,426 million in net budget authority for ICE for FY2013, a decrease of $125 million from the previous year's appropriation. Sequestration further reduced ICE's budget authority by roughly an additional $200 million. The FY2013 budget for ICE saw a $125 million decrease from the previous year's appropriation and a $94 million increase over the President's request. Sequestration further reduced ICE's budget authority by an additional $200 million. ICE is responsible for various activities related to civil and criminal violations of law, leading to ongoing debates on resource allocation. Part of ICE's mission involves locating and removing deportable aliens, with an estimated 10.8 million unauthorized aliens in the United States. ICE's mission includes locating and removing deportable aliens, with an estimated 10.8 million unauthorized aliens in the United States. There are also 1.9 million aliens who have committed a crime. ICE has the capacity to remove 400,000 aliens a year, leading to debates on how to prioritize removal. Amendments in H.R. 5855 direct ICE's immigration enforcement priorities, focusing on identifying and removing aliens convicted of a crime. ERO manages custody of these aliens. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is tasked with identifying and removing aliens convicted of crimes in the United States. The agency prioritizes removal based on the severity of the crime. ICE's Office of Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) manages custody and ensures the departure of aliens ordered to be removed. Concerns have been raised about insufficient detention space and the use of alternatives to detention programs for noncriminal alien detainees. Some policymakers advocate for alternatives to detention programs for noncriminal alien detainees due to cost and proportionality concerns. ICE maintained 34,000 detention bed spaces in FY2012, with a proposed reduction to 32,800 beds in FY2013. ICE released 2,228 detainees in 2013, citing budget constraints and sequestration requirements. Critics viewed the release as politically motivated to pressure Congress. ICE Director John Morton stated that despite funding for 34,000 beds, ICE's daily detention population exceeded 35,000 individuals, including those not required to be detained by law. Critics viewed the release of detainees as a political move to pressure Congress amid budget constraints. ICE's Alternatives to Detention program offers less restrictive monitoring methods for aliens awaiting removal proceedings. The Administration requested a decrease in detention bed space and an increase in funding for the ATD program. The Administration requested a decrease in detention bed space and an increase in funding for the Alternatives to Detention (ATD) program, which includes ankle bracelets, home visits, work visits, and telephone reporting to monitor aliens awaiting removal proceedings. The House passed H.R. 5855 maintaining current bed space and increasing ATD funding by $20 million, while the Senate's S. 3216 decreased detention space by 600 beds and increased ATD funding by $24 million. P.L. 113-6 funds 34,000 detention beds and increases ATD funding by $19 million. Additionally, the Administration requested $139 million for Secure Communities, an information sharing program between DHS and the Department of Justice. ICE has deployed Secure Communities to 89% of all jurisdictions nationally and is seeking resources to expand the system nationwide by the end of FY2013. They have the resources to identify 282,000 more removable aliens in FY2012 compared to FY2010, including 73,000 Level 1 offenders. Both House and Senate appropriators support the expansion of Secure Communities. The enforcement of immigration laws by state and local law enforcement agents through agreements like the \u00a7287(g) program and Secure Communities has sparked debate about their role. The debate over the role of state and local law enforcement in enforcing immigration laws through programs like \u00a7287(g) and Secure Communities has raised concerns about training, resources, civil rights violations, and community impact. The Administration has requested $51 million for 287(g) agreements, a decrease of $17 million from the previous year. ICE plans to discontinue less productive 287(g) task force agreements in jurisdictions where Secure Communities is active. Senate-reported S. 3216 would address these issues. ICE plans to discontinue less productive 287(g) task force agreements in jurisdictions where Secure Communities is active. Senate-reported S. 3216 would have appropriated $51 million for 287(g) agreements while H.R. 5855 would have funded the program at the FY2012 level of $68 million. P.L. 113-6 funds the 287(g) program at $68 million. ICE created the Public Advocate Office in 2012 to assist individuals with concerns about ICE operations. ICE created the Public Advocate Office in 2012 to assist individuals with concerns about ICE operations. The office was established in response to criticisms of the agency's lack of responsiveness to complaints. However, some argue that the program is not productive and is a misuse of ICE resources. P.L. 113-6 prohibits the use of funds for the Public Advocate position within ICE. TSA, established in 2001, is responsible for protecting transportation systems in the US. The TSA, established in 2001 by the Homeland Security Act, is responsible for protecting transportation systems in the US, including aviation, marine, and land modes. Its duties include deploying screeners, detection systems, and security technologies to prevent terrorist threats. The TSA budget is complex, with various funding sources such as airline security fees. The TSA's budget includes various funding sources like airline security fees, with a net direct discretionary appropriation of $5,130 million for FY2012, representing a 7.1% drop from the previous year. This budget includes $5,099 million for aviation security, a 3.0% decrease compared to FY2012. The President's proposed budget for TSA in FY2012 includes a net direct discretionary appropriation of $5,130 million, a 7.1% decrease from the previous year. The budget allocates $5,099 million for aviation security, with decreases in funding for checked baggage and passenger checkpoint technologies, screening technology maintenance costs, and the Federal Flight Deck Officer program. Funding for transportation threat assessment and credentialing would increase by $68 million. The President's proposed budget for TSA in FY2012 includes a net direct discretionary appropriation of $5,130 million, a 7.1% decrease from the previous year. The budget allocates $5,099 million for aviation security, with decreases in funding for checked baggage and passenger checkpoint technologies, screening technology maintenance costs, and the Federal Flight Deck Officer program. Funding for transportation threat assessment and credentialing would increase by $68 million to $272 million, including a one-time increase of $30 million for infrastructure modernization. Funding for Transportation Security Support was set at $970 million, a decrease of $62 million, and funding for the Federal Air Marshals Service specified $930 million, a decrease of $36 million. The House-passed bill for TSA budget activities specified $930 million for the Federal Air Marshals Service, representing a decrease of $36 million (3.8%). The bill included a gross budget authority of $7,498 million for TSA, offset by $2,400 million in collections and fees, resulting in a net direct discretionary appropriation of $5,098 million. This amount is $147 million (1.9%) lower than the administration's request. The House rejected proposed increases in offsetting passenger security fees, leading to a $58 million (2.0%) increase in appropriations for aviation security compared to the administration's request. Additional cuts were recommended for screening operations, including reductions in screener workforce costs and checked baggage explosives detection equipment procurement. The House-passed bill proposed a $58 million increase (2.0%) in aviation security funding above the Administration's request. Additional cuts were recommended for screening operations, including reductions in screener workforce costs and checked baggage explosives detection equipment procurement. The bill specified funding for surface transportation security, Transportation Security Administration (TSA) support, and Federal Air Marshals Service (FAMS), with some amounts below the Administration's request. The Senate-reported bill specified a net discretionary appropriation of $4,919 million for TSA. The Senate-reported bill specified a net discretionary appropriation of $4,919 million for TSA, with reductions made to offset a budget shortfall caused by the administration's reliance on passenger security fee increases. This included cuts to aviation security funding, checkpoint equipment procurement, and explosives detection systems procurement. The bill incorporated the full $315 million in revenue projections from passenger security fees, resulting in a $211 million (7.3%) decrease in aviation security appropriations compared to the Administration's request. The appropriations proposed in the bill for aviation security dropped $211 million (7.3%) from the Administration's request, with reductions in checkpoint equipment procurement and explosives detection systems procurement. The committee specified $24 million for the FFDO program, $12 million (92%) above the request. Sequestration further reduced TSA budget authority by roughly an additional $339 million. In FY2013, TSA's total budget authority was $7,551 million, $290 million less than FY2012. Sequestration further reduced it by $339 million. The projected spending for TSA in FY2013 was $7,212 million, $629 million less than FY2012. Passenger security fees under ATSA are set at $2.50 per flight segment, not exceeding $5.00 per one-way trip. Airlines have opposed fee increases, citing concerns over their impact on passengers. The Administration proposed changing the fee structure for passenger security fees in FY2013 to a flat fee of $5.00 per one-way trip, doubling the fee on direct flights. This change was estimated to increase revenue collections by $317 million, with $117 million going towards aviation security costs and $200 million towards deficit reduction. Previous administrations had also proposed fee increases, but the current proposal was supported by the Senate Appropriations Committee. The Senate Appropriations Committee supported a proposal to increase passenger security fees to $5.00 per one-way trip in FY2013. The House Appropriations Committee did not include the proposal, citing jurisdictional issues. Ultimately, P.L. 113-6 did not change passenger security fees. The committee did not include the proposal to increase passenger security fees, citing jurisdictional issues. They had to find $115 million in offsets to make up for budget assumptions. TSA identified over $100 million in savings from improved management efficiencies, including reductions in travel, conferences, and overtime pay. Efficiency improvements are crucial for addressing budget impacts at TSA. Efficiency improvements at TSA have raised oversight questions about why inefficiencies were not corrected sooner. TSA has initiated risk-based screening initiatives, including the PreCheck program, to focus resources based on security risk assessments. Various trial programs are underway for modified screening procedures, such as for children, known flight crew members, and elderly passengers. These programs aim to improve screening efficiencies and potential savings, which will be identified in future budgets. The PreCheck program is modeled after CBP programs and is currently available on a trial basis. The PreCheck program is a cornerstone of TSA's risk-based initiatives, modeled after CBP programs like Global Entry. It is available on a trial basis to certain members and frequent flyers, with plans for further expansion in FY2013. Both the House and Senate committees support the program as a rational approach to screening that can increase efficiency and reduce workforce requirements. TSA is directed to report on expansion plans, success indicators, public awareness efforts, time savings, and security measures. The Senate committee expressed support for TSA's plans to expand the PreCheck program, including reporting on expansion plans, success indicators, public awareness efforts, time savings, and security measures. There were concerns about the limited scope of the known crew member pilot program and a call to expand it to include flight attendants. The House committee did not support increasing the number of Behavior Detection Officers, citing a lack of clear evidence of their effectiveness in protecting against aviation security threats. A formal cost-benefit analysis of the BDO program was requested. The House committee report criticized TSA's proposal to increase Behavior Detection Officers (BDOs) without clear evidence of their effectiveness in protecting against aviation security threats. They called for a cost-benefit analysis of the BDO program and recommended keeping the Federal Flight Deck Officer (FFDO) program at the FY2012 level, with a proposed amendment to increase funding by $10 million. The House Appropriations Committee recommended keeping the Federal Flight Deck Officer (FFDO) program at the FY2012 level and passed an amendment to increase FFDO funding by an additional $10 million to $36 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee also disagreed with reducing FFDO funding and recommended $24 million for FFDO and crew member training programs. This slight decrease compared to FY2012 reflects the constrained budget environment. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $24 million for the Federal Flight Deck Officer (FFDO) and crew member training programs, reflecting a slight decrease compared to FY2012 due to budget constraints. The Coast Guard, responsible for maritime homeland security, received a total discretionary appropriation request of $8,377 million, $257 million less than FY2012. The Coast Guard was transferred to the DHS in 2003. The President requested $8,377 million in appropriations, with the House and Senate recommending more funding. P.L. 113-6 provided $10,400 million in total gross budget authority after across-the-board cuts. The Coast Guard was transferred to the DHS in 2003. P.L. 113-6 provided USCG with $10,400 million in total gross budget authority after cuts. Sequestration reduced USCG budget authority by $268 million. The plan projected spending in FY2013 to be $10,132 million, $200 million less than FY2012. Funding levels for USCG operating expenses and acquisition functions are outlined in Table 13. The \"DHS Plan\" column shows the department's assessment of budget resources available after sequestration under P.L. 113-6 as of April 26, 2013. Differences in FY2013 funding recommendations between the President's request and House and Senate bills mainly focused on vessel and aircraft acquisition. The President requested $139 million for two new fast response cutters, while the House funded four ($224 million) and the Senate funded six ($335 million). The House provided funds for one long-range fixed-wing aircraft and two MH-60 helicopters, while the President requested funds for the aircraft in the DOD's budget and none for the helicopters. The Senate did not request funds for either aircraft. The House allocated $90 million for one long-range fixed wing aircraft and $28 million for two MH-60 helicopters. The President requested $64 million for the long-range aircraft in the DOD's budget and no funds for the helicopters. The Senate did not request funds for these aircraft. The DHS sequestration plan includes $1,030 million for vessel acquisitions, with $646 million for one national security cutter, $319 million for six fast response cutters, and $8 million for a new icebreaker. $181 million is allocated for all aircraft acquisitions, with $86 million specifically for long-range aircraft. The Coast Guard's fleet modernization has been a key concern for Congress. The DHS sequestration plan includes $86 million for long-range aircraft acquisitions and $30 million for Coast Guard housing and aids to navigation. The House bill proposed $56 million for housing and aids to navigation, with $41 million more than the President's request. This funding includes $31 million for shore facilities backlog and $10 million for the Coast Guard's new headquarters building in Washington, DC. The House Appropriations Committee Report called for the Coast Guard to implement card readers for the TWIC biometric security card. The Senate Committee on Appropriations requested a briefing on Interagency Operations Centers at ports. The USSS has missions in criminal investigations and protection, including financial crimes and computer fraud. The U.S. Secret Service (USSS) has missions in criminal investigations, including financial crimes and computer fraud, as well as protection duties for high-profile individuals and events, such as the President, Vice President, and National Special Security Events (NSSE). The U.S. Secret Service (USSS) is responsible for security activities at National Special Security Events (NSSE) and has specific mandated assignments for protecting high-profile individuals. The Administration requested $1,601 million for the USSS in FY2013, with allocations for protection and investigation missions. The House-passed version of the DHS appropriations bill recommended $1,613 million for the USSS in FY2013. For FY2013, the House-passed version of the DHS appropriations bill recommended an appropriation of $1,613 million for the U.S. Secret Service (USSS), representing a decrease of $54 million from the previous year. This decrease was due to the conclusion of the 2012 Presidential campaign season and reduced demand for candidate protection. The budget cut was partially offset by specific funding restorations for the Center for Missing and Exploited Children and an increase for Electronic Crimes Special Agent Program and Task Forces. The Senate-reported version of the DHS appropriations bill for FY2013 recommended an appropriation of $1,613 million for the U.S. Secret Service (USSS), which was $54 million less than the previous year. The Senate also approved specific funding restorations for the Center for Missing and Exploited Children and an increase for Electronic Crimes Special Agent Program and Task Forces. Additionally, Congress appropriated $1.611 billion for USSS in FY2013, which was $56 million less than the previous year. Following the sequester, the Service plans to expend $1.527 billion, $84 million less than what was appropriated in P.L. 113-6. In April 2012, agents and officers in Cartagena, Colombia were involved in an incident. For FY2013, Congress allocated $1.611 billion for the Secret Service, $56 million less than the previous year. After the sequester, the Service plans to spend $1.527 billion, with a reduction in funding primarily for protection and investigation missions. The balance between investigative and protective missions is an ongoing concern for Congress. The USSS's protection mission receives more resources and attention from Congress compared to its investigative mission. Recent focus has been on agent misconduct and potential terrorist threats, leading to increased protection activities. Some advocate for expanding the investigation mission to enhance protection efforts. The DHS appropriations bill includes funding for the National Protection and Programs Directorate, the Office of Health Affairs, and FEMA. The requested amount for FY2013 was $5,911 million, with the House-passed bill proposing $5,930 million and the Senate-reported bill proposing $5,971 million. Additionally, both versions included $5,481 million for disaster relief, with adjustments under the Budget Control Act. After cuts, P.L. 113-6 provided $5,920 million before sequestration. The DHS appropriations bill for FY2013 included $5,920 million for disaster relief, with adjustments under the Budget Control Act. The National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) was established in response to the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006. The National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) was formed by the Secretary for Homeland Security in response to the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006. It includes the Office of the Under Secretary for NPPD, Office of Infrastructure Protection, and Office of Cybersecurity and Communications. The Administration proposed moving US-VISIT program activities from NPPD to other locations within the Department, while the House proposed keeping some functions within a new Office of Biometric Identify Management. The FY2013 Request supports these activities through the Management and Administration Program and the Infrastructure Protection and Information Security Program (IPIS). The FY2013 budget request for the Office of Biometric Identify Management under the National Protection and Programs Directorate includes funding for Management and Administration as well as Infrastructure Protection and Information Security programs. The total request is $1,217 million, with a decrease in funding for NPPD activities compared to FY2012. The IPIS program saw an increase of $278 million, with a focus on securing federal government information systems. The FY2013 budget request for IPIS was $1,167 million, a $278 million increase (31.3%) from FY2012. The increase was mainly for securing federal information systems, including a $202 million initiative for Federal Network Security and a $116 million increase for Network Security Deployment to expand the National Cybersecurity Protection System. The FY2013 budget request for IPIS was $1,167 million, a $278 million increase (31.3%) from FY2012. The extra funding would expand deployment of the 3.0 version of the NCPS system and development of version 2.2 across federal agencies. Other programmatic increases included $15 million for US-CERT and $5 million for MS-ISAC to support cybersecurity efforts. Infrastructure protection funding was reduced by $40 million (13.7%) below the FY2012 appropriation. The FY2013 budget request for IPIS included decreased funding in infrastructure protection and communications areas. Infrastructure protection funding was reduced by $40 million (13.7%) below the FY2012 appropriation, with a significant portion attributed to the Infrastructure Security Compliance project. The House proposed $1,347 million for NPPD, allocating funds for Management and Administration, IPIS, and the Office of Biometric Identity Management. The House proposed $1,347 million for NPPD, with allocations for Management and Administration, IPIS, and the Office of Biometric Identity Management. They provided $5 million less for Management and Administration due to concerns about TSA fee increases and poor compliance with statutory requirements. Reductions were also made in the IPIS budget, particularly in the Security Compliance project, based on internal program reviews revealing implementation issues and unobligated funds. Funding for the deployment of the NCPS was reduced by $17 million, citing concerns about NPPD's ability to utilize the funds effectively. The House directed NPPD to collaborate with the Coast Guard on program implementation and personnel management. The House proposed $1,347 million for NPPD, with reductions in funding for the deployment of the NCPS and other projects. They also directed NPPD to collaborate with the Coast Guard and consider using alternative security programs. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1,220 million for NPPD. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1,220 million for NPPD, with specific allocations for Management and Administration, IPIS, and security projects. They acknowledged the need for additional funds for implementation plans later in the fiscal year. The Committee also proposed a reduction in funding for the Federal Network Security project to support continuous monitoring capabilities. The Committee recommended additional funds for implementation plans later in the fiscal year for NPPD. They proposed a reduction in funding for the Federal Network Security project and recommended withholding $120 million until an expenditure plan is produced. The Committee also suggested increased funding for the Global Cybersecurity Management project and the Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity and Awareness project. The Committee recommended funding increases for cybersecurity education and critical infrastructure cybersecurity projects. They also highlighted the importance of improving cybersecurity for state and local governments. Additionally, the Committee supported increases for emergency communication projects, including the Next Generation Telecommunications project. The total funding for NPPD/IPIS and OBIM in P.L. 113-6 is $1,439 million, with allocations for Management and Administration, the IPIS program, and Biometric Identity Management. After receiving a funding increase of $5 million above the requested level, P.L. 113-6 provides $1,439 million for NPPD/IPIS and OBIM. This includes $50 million for Management and Administration, $1,157 million for the IPIS program, and $232 million for Biometric Identity Management. The FY2013 operating plan indicated that after sequestration, NPPD/IPIS and OBIM would receive $1,337 million for FY2014, with specific allocations for cybersecurity education, vulnerability assessments, and CFATS. $13.5 million allocated for the Office of Bombing Prevention, $20.6 million for vulnerability assessments, $16.9 million for cybersecurity education, $77.9 million for CFATS, with $20.0 million on hold pending Congress's receipt of an expenditure plan. $202 million for the Federal Network Security program to assist federal agencies in acquiring monitoring equipment. GAO to review DHS progress on CFATS program and inspect compliance barriers. NPPD to provide semiannual reports. The GAO, along with the Coast Guard, will continue to assess DHS's progress in developing the CFATS program. They will review the conduct of CFATS inspections, inspector training, and identify compliance barriers. NPPD is required to provide semiannual reports on the compliance program and present alternative security programs for consideration. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act also mandates federal agencies to submit expenditure plans for cybersecurity improvements and quarterly reports on their execution to OMB, which will then provide an annual summary to Congress. Table 16 outlines funding levels for the IPIS program in FY2012 and FY2013. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is instructed to provide annual summary reports to Congress on execution reports. Table 16 shows funding levels for the IPIS program in FY2012 and FY2013. The Department of Homeland Security is assessing post-sequester resources, with potential transfers and reprogramming to mitigate sequestration impacts. There are issues with implementing the CFATS compliance program, and Congress is interested in oversight. Congress has also focused on cybersecurity during the 112th Congress, considering bills on information sharing, education, and workforce development. The Federal Protective Service (FPS), within the National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD), is responsible for the protection and security of federal property, personnel, and federally owned and leased buildings, focusing on security and law enforcement activities to reduce vulnerability to criminal and terrorist threats. Legislation expanding DHS's role in protecting critical infrastructure may require additional resources. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) under the National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) is responsible for protecting federal property and personnel. FPS operations focus on security and law enforcement to reduce vulnerability to criminal and terrorist threats. They conduct risk assessments, implement countermeasures, provide law enforcement response, and offer safety education programs. FPS also supports other federal agencies like the U.S. Secret Service at National Special Security Events. Currently, FPS has around 1,225 law enforcement officers and administers 13,000 contract security guards. The President's FY2013 budget request included 1,279 FTEs and $1,302 million for FPS. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) is the lead agency for security in government facilities. FPS employs 1,225 law enforcement officers and administers 13,000 contract security guards. The President's FY2013 budget request included $1,302 million for FPS, funded by security fees charged to GSA building tenants. The budget allocated $272 million for basic security operations, $509 million for building-specific security operations, and $521 million for Security Work Authorizations. House-passed H.R. 5855 and the Senate Appropriations Committee made no specific changes to the FPS budget for FY2013. For FY2013, House-passed H.R. 5855 and the Senate Appropriations Committee made no specific changes to the FPS budget. The Senate Appropriations Committee required a briefing on FPS management and budget improvement efforts. FPS was directed to update on implementing GAO recommendations. Congress expressed concerns over FPS mission and funding. Appropriators showed interest in improving training for contract guards and developing standards for checkpoint detection technologies. In the 112th and 113th Congress, legislation was introduced to improve federal building security and strengthen the Federal Protective Service (FPS) mission. Concerns were raised about FPS funding and training for contract guards. The FPS inspector force staffing levels and the use of federal employees instead of contract guards were proposed in the Federal Protective Service Improvement and Accountability Act of 2013. In the 113th Congress, H.R. 735, the Federal Protective Service Improvement and Accountability Act of 2013, was introduced to set staffing levels in the FPS inspector force and expand the use of federal employees instead of contract guards. The Office of Health Affairs (OHA) oversees programs like BioWatch and NBIC, receiving $167 million in FY2012 and requesting $166 million for FY2013 to support 101 FTEs. The Office of Health Affairs (OHA) requested $166 million for FY2013, $1 million less than FY2012. The funding would support 101 FTEs, with allocations for BioWatch, NBIC, Chemical Defense Program, Planning and Coordination, and Salaries and Expenses. The House-passed bill proposed $132 million, $35 million less than FY2012. The Senate-reported bill recommended $168 million, $1 million more than FY2012. The Senate-reported bill recommended $168 million for FY2013 for the Office of Health Affairs (OHA), which is $1 million more than FY2012. The bill also included small increases for Planning and Coordination and Salaries and Expenses, as well as $2 million for the Chemical Defense Program. After across-the-board cuts, P.L. 113-6 provided $132 million for OHA, which is $35 million less than FY2012. The reductions in funding largely reflect decreased funding for BioWatch as recommended by the House. The House recommended decreased funding for BioWatch in FY2013, with enacted amounts under P.L. 113-6 reflecting across-the-board cuts. The House Appropriations Committee suggested merging DNDO and OHA into an Office of Weapons of Mass Destruction Defense for FY2014. The House recommended merging DNDO and OHA into an Office of Weapons of Mass Destruction Defense for FY2014. The BioWatch program, which accounts for the majority of OHA's budget, deploys sensors in over 30 U.S. cities to detect bioterrorism pathogens. The BioWatch program, which detects bioterrorism pathogens in U.S. cities, is a major part of OHA's budget. The program has faced challenges in deploying more advanced sensors, known as \"Gen-3,\" due to technical and management issues. Congressional appropriators have questioned the program's $5.8 billion cost and its effectiveness, leading to decreased funding in FY2013. The BioWatch program's performance has drawn attention from Congress, leading to funding limitations and program reviews. The decreased funding for FY2013 hinders the development of Gen-3 capability. FEMA's primary mission is to reduce loss of life and property from all hazards through various activities, including incident response and disaster preparedness grants. FEMA provides incident response, recovery, and mitigation assistance to state and local governments through various grant programs. The Administration requested a total discretionary appropriation of $4,528 million for FEMA for FY2013, with an additional $5,481 million for the Disaster Relief Fund. House-passed H.R. 5855 would have provided $4,451 million for FEMA for FY2013. The House-passed H.R. 5855 proposed a $4,451 million discretionary appropriation for FEMA in FY2013, a decrease from the President's request but an increase from FY2012. The Senate-reported S. 3216 suggested a higher appropriation of $4,582 million for FEMA in FY2013. After across-the-board cuts, P.L. 113-6 provided $4,351 million for FEMA, including funding for the Disaster Relief Fund. FEMA received $4,351 million in FY2013, $84 million more than FY2012 but $177 million less than the President's request. The bill included $1 million less for the Disaster Relief Fund due to across-the-board cuts. After sequestration, FEMA would receive $4,150 million from Title III provisions and $6,076 million from the disaster relief cap adjustment. State and local governments have primary responsibility for domestic public safety functions. The DRF received increased funding from P.L. 113-2, but there is no official statement on post-sequester funding levels. State and local governments may reduce public safety resources due to budget constraints, impacting national preparedness. PPD 8 directed DHS to develop a national preparedness goal in coordination with various government levels based on specific threats and vulnerabilities. Presidential Policy Directive 8 (PPD 8) directed the Secretary of DHS to develop a national preparedness goal in coordination with various government levels based on specific threats and vulnerabilities. This goal defines core capabilities necessary to prepare for incidents posing the greatest risk to national security, superseding a previous directive issued after 9/11. The first National Preparedness Goal (NPG) was released on October 7, 2011. The National Preparedness Goal, released on October 7, 2011, aims to strengthen the United States' readiness to prevent and respond to domestic terrorist attacks, disasters, and emergencies. It outlines core capabilities and targets for a comprehensive approach to preparedness, emphasizing a secure and resilient nation. Prior to 9/11, only three federal grant programs were available for homeland security efforts. Several federal grant programs are available to state and local governments to address homeland security, including the State Domestic Preparedness Program, Emergency Management Performance Grant (EMPG), and Metropolitan Medical Response System (MMRS). Additional programs have been added to ensure preparedness, such as the State Homeland Security Grant Program, Urban Area Security Initiative, and Port Security Grants. The federal government provides various grant programs to state and local governments for homeland security preparedness, including Transit Grants, Port Security Grants, Over-the-Road Bus Security Assistance, and others. Despite this assistance, federal grants account for less than one percent of total state and local government public safety expenditures, which amount to $218 billion annually. The President requested $1.8 billion in federal grants for state and local government homeland security preparedness for FY2013, an increase from the previous year. The President requested $1.8 billion in federal grants for state and local government homeland security preparedness for FY2013, including funding for a National Preparedness Grant Program. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees expressed concerns about the proposal to consolidate state and local preparedness grants due to lack of congressional authorization, implementation details, and stakeholder participation. The Senate Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about the lack of details and stakeholder participation in the implementation of the program. They also questioned the consolidation of state and local preparedness grants, citing uncertainties in risk assessments and funding allocation. The House recommended $1.7 billion for State and Local Programs, rejecting the consolidation proposal and advocating for the continuation of the grant structure from FY2012. Grant funding would be distributed at the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security under various programs. Grant funding of $1.7 billion for various homeland security programs in FY2013, distributed at the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security. The House allocated $55 million to Operation Stonegarden, $150 million for high-risk areas, and $232 million for education and training. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1.6 billion, $200 million more than FY2012, with $470 million for the State Homeland Security Grant Program. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1.6 billion for FY2013, $200 million more than FY2012, with allocations for various homeland security programs including State Homeland Security Grant Program, Urban Area Security Initiative, Public Transportation Security, Port Security Grants, and education, training, and exercises. Despite across-the-board cuts and sequestration, funding for state and local programs decreased by 20.3% from the requested level but was 8.6% above FY2012 levels. Sequestration further reduced budget authority for FEMA's state and local grants program by roughly $77 million. The DHS FY2013 expenditure plan projected $1,400 million for state and local programs, $50 million more than FY2012 levels. P.L. 113-6 removed a transfer from grant programs, increasing actual funding available for grants by $132 million compared to FY2012. The Administration's FY2013 budget proposed $670 million for firefighter assistance, including $335 million each for AFG and SAFER grants. The Administration's FY2013 budget proposed $670 million for firefighter assistance, with $335 million each for AFG and SAFER grants. DHS requested a percentage of AFG funding be set aside for grant program management. The House-passed bill would have funded firefighter assistance at $675 million, maintaining the FY2012 level. The House-passed bill for FY2013 would have funded firefighter assistance at $675 million, maintaining the FY2012 level. It also included language to maintain firefighter staffing levels and denied the Administration's request to shift AFG and SAFER grants into the State and Local Programs account. The Senate-reported bill proposed the same funding amount and included SAFER waiver authority language. The Senate Committee denied the Administration's request to shift AFG and SAFER grants into the State and Local Programs account. Post-sequestration, P.L. 113-6 funds firefighter assistance at $642 million. The DRF is the main account used to fund emergency and disaster assistance, funded yearly through regular appropriations. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) provides emergency and disaster assistance to states, local governments, nonprofits, and individuals affected by disasters. The DRF is funded annually through regular appropriations but often runs out of funds due to ongoing recovery efforts. There have been arguments that the reliance on supplemental funding is due to underfunding the DRF. For example, between 2005 and 2011, the average regular appropriation was $1,749 million, while the average monthly expenditures were $383 million. The Administration requested $6,088 million for the DRF in FY2013, a decrease from the previous year. The Administration requested $6,088 million for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) in FY2013, a decrease from the previous year. The request included $608 million for activities not directly tied to major disasters and $5,481 million for disaster relief costs for major disasters under the Stafford Act. This structure reflects the impact of the Budget Control Act, allowing costs incurred by major disasters to be paid through an \"allowable adjustment\" to discretionary spending caps. The FY2013 request was more than three times the size of the request from FY2012, based on FEMA's planned spending on past declared catastrophic events. The FY2013 request for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) was $6,088 million, including funding for past declared catastrophic events and a reserve to prevent shortfalls. Both the House-passed and Senate-reported bills allocated the same funding for the DRF as requested. Additionally, $24 million was transferred to the DHS Office of Inspector General for audits on disaster-related spending. P.L. 113-6 funded the DRF at $7,007 million after across-the-board cuts. The Office of Inspector General will conduct audits on disaster-related spending. P.L. 113-6 funds the DRF at $7,007 million, with $24 million allocated for audits on public assistance projects exceeding $10 million. The budget provides $918 million more than the Administration's initial request. Sequestration reduced the funding to $6,653 million. The Budget Control Act allows for an \"allowable adjustment\" for disaster relief to exceed discretionary spending caps. The Budget Control Act allows for an \"allowable adjustment\" for disaster relief to exceed discretionary spending caps, preventing sequestration. Funding for \"disaster relief\" under the BCA is for major disasters declared under the Stafford Act, not the same as the Disaster Relief Fund. Hurricane Sandy in 2012 had access to $7.3 billion from the DRF due to a continuing resolution. The DRF had access to $7.3 billion during Hurricane Sandy in 2012, with additional funding approved by Congress through the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013. The total resources exceeded the allowable adjustment for disaster relief for FY 2013, leading to emergency funding provided by Congress. In FY2013, the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) received all available funding under the Budget Control Act's allowable adjustment for disaster relief. The Administration proposed eliminating the Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) program, stating it duplicated the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) and other mitigation programs. PDM awarded funds before disasters, unlike HMGP, and was similar to projects funded by the National Flood Insurance Program. The Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) program, which is funded by the National Flood Insurance Program, awards grants before disasters unlike the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP). While both programs fund similar projects, PDM covers all types of hazards while NFIP only addresses flood hazards. The Administration proposed phasing out the PDM program due to duplication of efforts with HMGP. Despite concerns about slow pace of awards and large unobligated balances, the program received small appropriations in FY2013. The House-passed and Senate-reported bills signaled concern with the slow pace of awards and large unobligated balance in the Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) program. Funding for PDM in FY2013 was reduced to just under $25 million, presenting challenges for program administration. The reduced award amounts made it impractical to conduct a full new round of applications and awards, leading FEMA to consider working from existing, unfunded applications. The Administration continued its practice of proposing reduced funding for the program, requesting $100 million for FY2013, a $20 million reduction from the previous year. FEMA may work from existing, unfunded applications to continue the EFS program funding cycle. The Administration has proposed reduced funding for the program in recent years, with FY2013 requesting $100 million, a decrease from the previous year. Congress funded the program at $120 million in FY2012, but for FY2013, the House allocated $120 million while the Senate suggested $150 million. The post-sequester funding level for FY2013 is just under $114 million, the lowest since FY2000. Concerns also exist over delayed distribution of funds in FY2012. The funding for the EFS program has been reduced in recent years, with concerns over delayed distribution of funds in FY2012. The Administration requested $1,561 million for various accounts in FY2013, but the House-passed bill provides $1,510 million and the Senate-reported bill provides $1,535 million. After cuts, P.L. 113-6 provides $1,520 million. The Senate-reported bill provides $1,535 million for USCIS, 1.7% below the request and 15.2% above FY2012. P.L. 113-6 provides $1,520 million, a decrease of 0.5% from the requested level and 2.2% above FY2012. USCIS activities include adjudication of immigration petitions, naturalization petitions, and refugee/asylum claims. The USCIS is responsible for processing employment-based petitions, naturalization petitions, refugee/asylum claims, and travel documents. They are funded through direct appropriations and revenue generated by the Examinations Fee Account. The agency receives most of its revenue from adjudication fees of immigration benefit applications and petitions. The USCIS receives funding from direct appropriations and revenue from adjudication fees. The requested USCIS gross budget authority for FY2013 was $3,005 million, with $143 million from direct appropriations and $2,862 million from fee collections. The budget included funding for specific projects like the E-Verify program and the Immigrant Integration Initiative. The USCIS budget for FY2013 was proposed at $3,005 million, with $143 million from direct appropriations and $2,862 million from fee collections. The House-passed H.R. 5855 suggested a budget of $3,004 million, with $112 million from direct appropriations and $2,892 million from fee collections. The Committee recommended monitoring USCIS' fee revenues and obligations closely. The House Appropriations Committee directed USCIS to use fee revenues for all costs except E-Verify, recommended funding for SAVE program and digital conversion of immigration records. They did not provide funding for military naturalizations, urging DoD to fund it. The Committee expressed concerns about USCIS adjudication procedures and fraud detection, directing USCIS to report on corrective actions and OIG to assess USCIS actions. The Senate-reported S. 3216 proposed USCIS budget authority for FY2013 at $2,999 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a budget of $2,999 million for USCIS in FY2013, with $117 million from direct appropriations and $2,882 million from fee collections. They allocated $20 million for the SAVE program from user fee revenues and recommended $112 million for the E-Verify program. Additionally, $5 million was recommended for Immigrant Integration grants, with an option to use fees for an additional $5 million. The Office of Citizenship Services was directed to be fee-funded, with no appropriations for its operation. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $5 million for Immigrant Integration grants in direct appropriations and an additional $5 million via fees. They expressed concern about the costs of administering the grant program and directed that no more than 5% of the funding be used for administration. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 provided $114 million for the program, a decrease from the requested level but an increase from the previous year. Sequestration would reduce the funding to $109 million. The DHS FY2013 operating plan indicates that the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 provided $114 million for USCIS, a decrease from the requested level but an increase from the previous year. Sequestration would reduce the funding to $109 million. Potential issues for Congress included fee-generated funding, immigrant integration grants, USCIS Transformation program, E-Verify operability, paper record digitization, and refugee processing. The House Committee directed USCIS to monitor fee revenues and obligations to avoid backlogs or over-budgeting projects. They also requested including the costs of operations in future fee adjustments and to provide quarterly briefings. Funding for immigrant integration grants remains an issue, with the Administration requesting appropriations while the House and Senate Committees prefer funding from fee revenue. Section 546 of P.L. 113-6 requires USCIS to allocate $7.5 million for immigrant integration from the Immigration Examinations Fee Account in FY2013. The House Committee expressed concerns about funding for USCIS programs, including immigrant integration grants. While the Administration requested $11 million in appropriations, the Committees preferred funding from fee revenue. Section 546 of P.L. 113-6 allocated $7.5 million for immigrant integration grants in FY2013. The Committee also questioned the progress of the USCIS Transformation program and the effectiveness of the current contract, directing USCIS to provide regular updates on their efforts. The Committee questioned the effectiveness of the current contract for USCIS programs and directed USCIS to provide updates on efforts to transition to an online-based system. Congress extended the authorization of E-Verify for one year and directed USCIS to create a review process for final non-confirmations to prevent false identifications. The Senate Committee requested a report on the cost of expanding E-Verify and recommendations for its use in the agricultural industry. The House Committee directed USCIS to continue efforts to convert immigration records to digital format through the Enterprise Document Management System (EDMS) and eliminate the paper version of USCIS Form I-94. They expressed concerns about coordination issues and loss of personal documentation in the immigration process. The House Committee directed USCIS to convert immigration records to digital format through EDMS and eliminate paper USCIS Form I-94. They expressed concerns about coordination issues in processing vulnerable individuals. The Senate Committee urged DHS to use parole authority for urgent humanitarian needs, like family unity and medical emergencies after natural disasters. The Committee urged the Secretary to allocate resources for addressing humanitarian needs after natural disasters like the Haitian earthquake in 2010. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center provides training to federal, state, and local law enforcement entities to promote collaboration and consistency. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) aims to promote consistency and collaboration among partner agencies by training officers in a multi-agency environment. FLETC operates four training sites in the US, offers online training, and provides training at other locations as needed. The Center has around 1,100 personnel and a proposed budget of $258 million, with reductions in Salaries and Expenses and Acquisition, Construction, Improvements, and Related Expenses compared to the previous year. The proposed reduction in Acquisition, Construction, Improvements, and Related Expenses at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) was due to deferring construction work. The House-passed bill included $256 million for FLETC, $16 million below last year's level. The House Appropriations Committee cited the Administration's reliance on unauthorized fee increases as the reason for budget reductions. The Senate-reported bill would have provided $258 million for FLETC, the same as requested by the President. After cuts directed by P.L. 113-6, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 allocated $257 million for FLETC. The Senate-reported bill would have allocated $258 million for the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC), matching the President's request. Prior to sequestration, the funding for FLETC was $257 million, a decrease from the requested level. The Directorate of Science and Technology (S&T) is the primary DHS organization for research and development, with a requested budget of $831 million for FY2013. The Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) of DHS conducts R&D in its own labs and funds R&D by other entities. The requested budget for S&T in FY2013 was $831 million, a 25% increase from FY2012. The largest increase in funding was for disaster resilience R&D. There was a reduction in funding for Laboratory Facilities due to the lack of construction funding for the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF). The FY2013 budget request for the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) lacked construction funding, receiving only $50 million out of the requested amount. The House-passed bill allocated $826 million for the Science and Technology Directorate, $6 million less than requested, with a $72 million reduction for R&D. The Senate recommended funding levels matching the Administration's request, specifying amounts for each R&D thrust area. The House Appropriations Committee directed DHS to allocate reductions across thrust areas, while providing $75 million more for NBAF construction in Laboratory Facilities. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding levels matching the Administration's request for the Science and Technology Directorate. They specified separate amounts for each of the six R&D thrust areas. The committee did not recommend funding for NBAF construction, citing a total cost estimate of $1.138 billion for the facility. After adjustments, P.L. 113-6 provides $834 million for the S&T Directorate, with $28 million less than the request for R&D. The post-sequester total reported by DHS is $801 million. The act includes $37 million more than the request for Laboratory Facilities, to be spent on NBAF construction. The DHS Plan outlines funding levels for existing S&T program functions, with $801 million post-sequester total. DNDO is responsible for nuclear detection efforts, with a requested $328 million for FY2013. Transformational R&D saw a significant increase in funding. The Administration requested $328 million for DNDO for FY2013, an increase of 13% from FY2012. The request included a significant increase for Transformational R&D, partially offset by a reduction in Systems Development funding. The House-passed bill proposed $316 million for DNDO, with a focus on the Transformational R&D program. The House-passed bill proposed a reduction in the Transformational R&D program for DNDO. It directed DHS to provide an updated implementation plan for its responsibilities under the global nuclear detection architecture. The House Appropriations Committee recommended consolidating DNDO with the DHS Office of Health Affairs for cost savings and better coordination in efforts against weapons of mass destruction. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the same funding levels for DNDO as the Administration's request and also directed DHS to provide an updated implementation plan for its responsibilities under the global nuclear detection architecture. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding levels for DNDO in line with the Administration's request. They also called for an updated implementation plan for the domestic portion of the global nuclear detection architecture. The committee did not address the potential consolidation of DNDO and OHA. P.L. 113-6 provided $318 million for DNDO after rescissions, with $9 million less than the Transformational R&D request. The explanatory statement directed DHS to review WMD programs for potential consolidation benefits. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding levels for DNDO in line with the Administration's request and called for an updated implementation plan for the domestic portion of the global nuclear detection architecture. The explanatory statement directed DHS to review WMD programs for potential consolidation benefits, including the option of merging DNDO and OHA. The post-sequester total appropriation for DNDO is $303 million, with funding levels outlined for existing program functions. The DHS appropriations bill contains general provisions that may include rescissions of funding from previous years. The DHS appropriations bill contains general provisions that may include rescissions of funding from previous years to mitigate the impact of sequestration. The Administration proposed not carrying forward 35 general provisions from the FY2012 DHS Appropriations bill, including one-time provisions and permanent changes in the U.S. Code. The FY2012 DHS Appropriations bill (Division D of P.L. 112-74) contained various provisions, including rescissions and one-time provisions. The Administration proposed not carrying forward 35 general provisions, citing them as hindrances to the Department's ability to manage its affairs. Additionally, five new general provisions were suggested, such as extending the termination deadline for E-Verify and allowing FEMA to use earmarked grant funds for disaster mitigation. The House-passed H.R. 5855 includes provisions for FEMA to use earmarked grant funds for disaster mitigation and establish an outreach program for dam safety efforts. It also includes provisions for customs inspectors and equipment funding. The bill includes $292 million in rescissions to reduce the net scoring. The House added and dropped various general provisions, including extending the termination deadline for E-Verify and adding 13 general provisions during floor action. The House Appropriations Committee added 13 general provisions to the bill, including prohibiting funds for certain activities such as racial profiling, enforcing a proposed ICE rule, and contracting for alternative transportation fuels.

The budget process involves Congress enacting budget authority, federal agencies obligating funds, and making payments to liquidate obligations. Budget authority is determined by appropriations acts or direct spending legislation and can be one-year, multi-year, or no-year. The Antideficiency Act prohibits agencies from obligating more funds than enacted budget authority. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and authorize payments from the Treasury. It can be one-year, multi-year, or no-year, with outlays representing actual spending in a fiscal year. Outlays may not always match the budget authority enacted in a given year, as funds can be obligated in one year but spent in a future year. Discretionary agencies and programs are funded annually through appropriations acts. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and authorize payments from the Treasury. It consists of discretionary and mandatory spending, with discretionary funds appropriated yearly by Congress and mandatory funds provided in laws other than appropriation acts.

An example within DHS is the Coast Guard retirement pay, which is an appropriated mandatory spending program. Spending within DHS includes Coast Guard retirement pay as an example of appropriated mandatory spending.

These five agencies collectively make up 93% of federal spending on homeland security. The Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Justice, and Department of State were among the top five agencies in spending on homeland security, collectively accounting for 93% of federal spending. Not all DHS funding is classified as homeland security-related, with legacy agencies also conducting other activities. The total budget authority for DHS was $52.5 billion, higher than the $35.1 billion allocated for homeland security activities. The budget amounts in the report may not align with total amounts elsewhere due to inconsistencies. No authoritative data for FY2013 is available yet. The inconsistency between homeland security budget authority and requested total budget authority is also seen in other agencies listed. The Administration's budget for FY2013 lacks estimates accounting for P.L. 113-6 or sequestration impact, resulting in no authoritative data available."
