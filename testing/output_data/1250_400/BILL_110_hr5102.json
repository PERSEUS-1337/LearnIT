    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Our Nation's Trade, Infrastructure, Mobility, and Efficiency Act of 2007\" or the \"ON TIME Act of 2007\". Congress finds that the growth in international trade, especially containerized trade, is straining the nation's transportation network and causing traffic congestion near major US-international gateways. Between 2000 and 2005, the value of international trade increased from $2 trillion to $2.6 trillion, with containerized trade shipments rising from 59 million to 81 million 20-foot equivalent units. Existing and potential trade agreements are expected to further boost international trade and worsen freight congestion. The US is a member of the World Trade Organization, has 11 free trade agreements, and is negotiating with 4 countries and multi-lateral organizations for more agreements. Traffic congestion in the United States is a significant issue, with Americans wasting billions of hours and gallons of fuel each year. Freight bottlenecks are also causing economic losses and productivity delays. To maintain and improve transportation systems, substantial investments are required annually. To maintain and improve the transportation system in the United States, significant investments are needed. By 2030, government funding must increase to $472 billion to maintain current conditions and traffic levels, and to $561 billion to improve conditions for economic productivity. The Act aims to address transportation investment needs in trade corridors, reduce freight congestion, and enhance the quality of life for citizens. Establishment and collection of national trade gateway corridor fee. The Secretary of Transportation will establish a national trade gateway corridor fee on imported articles, amounting to .075 percent of the article's value or $500, whichever is less. The fee will be collected for eligible transportation projects in trade corridors. The Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with Homeland Security, will assess and collect fees for eligible transportation projects in trade corridors. Amounts received will be deposited in a specific account, and the fee will not apply after fiscal year 2017. Additionally, regulations will be issued for a national trade gateway corridor fee on exported articles from the United States. The Secretary of Commerce will establish a national trade gateway corridor fee on exported articles from the United States. The fee will be 0.075% of the article's value or $500, whichever is less. The Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with Homeland Security and Commerce, will collect the fee for eligible transportation projects in trade corridors. Amounts received will be deposited in a specific account. The Secretary of Commerce will assess and collect a fee for eligible transportation projects in trade corridors. Amounts received will be deposited in the \"National Trade Gateway Corridor Fund\" account. The fee will not apply after fiscal year 2017. The \"National Trade Gateway Corridor Fund\" account will consist of deposited amounts for transportation projects. The Secretary of Transportation can use the funds for expenditures until October 1, 2018, to fulfill obligations under the Act. SEC. 4. APPORTIONMENT OF FUNDS. The Secretary of Transportation sets aside 2 percent of funds for administrative expenses related to collecting fees on imports and exports. After this set-aside, the remaining funds are apportioned to State departments of transportation for eligible projects in transportation trade corridors based on the fees collected at Customs ports of entry in the previous fiscal year. The Secretary apportions funds collected from Customs ports of entry for eligible projects in transportation trade corridors based on the fees collected in the previous fiscal year. If a corridor spans multiple states, the funds are divided among the states based on the total lane miles of Federal-aid highways in each state. The apportionment of funds for eligible projects in transportation trade corridors is based on the total lane miles and vehicle miles traveled on Federal-aid highways in each state compared to all states. Amounts granted for projects remain available for a specified period. Amounts granted for eligible projects in transportation trade corridors remain available for 6 years after the fiscal year ends. Unobligated funds after this period will be reallocated to other states for similar projects at the Secretary's discretion. SEC. 5. PROJECT SELECTION AND ELIGIBILITY. The Secretary of Transportation must issue project selection guidelines for State departments of transportation to follow in selecting eligible projects for grants under this Act. Guidelines include consulting with various stakeholders, adhering to planning processes, developing a transparent selection process, and rating proposed projects. The State department of transportation must develop and implement a transparent selection process for rating proposed projects eligible for grants under this Act, clearly identifying the basis for rating projects. The grant program under SEC. 6 is established for rating proposed projects eligible for grants under this Act. The Secretary of Transportation may grant funds to a State department for projects in transportation trade corridors. Projects must meet construction standards for highways on the Federal-aid system. The Federal share of project costs is 80%, and non-Federal funds cannot come from other Federal sources. The non-Federal share of project costs for eligible projects under this Act cannot come from other Federal funds. Prevailing wage rates apply to projects receiving assistance under this section. SEC. 7. TRANSPORTATION TRADE CORRIDORS. The Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, shall establish transportation trade corridors for Customs ports of entry, with specific criteria for their boundaries and locations. These corridors may include areas in multiple contiguous states, extend up to 300 miles from the port of entry, and only include areas used for international trade movements. The Secretary may establish a single corridor for multiple ports of entry located close to each other, with a deadline of 180 days after enactment of the Act. The Secretary of Transportation may establish a single transportation trade corridor for multiple ports of entry located in close proximity. Within 180 days of the Act's enactment, proposed corridor boundaries must be published in the Federal Register. A 45-day comment period will follow for public input, with final corridor boundaries to be published within one year. Periodic reviews and modifications will be conducted every 60 days. The Secretary of Transportation must establish final transportation trade corridors within one year of the Act's enactment. Periodic reviews and modifications will be conducted annually to ensure appropriate boundaries for each Customs port of entry. The Secretary of Transportation must issue regulations within one year of the Act's enactment. Appropriations from the National Trade Gateway Corridor Fund are authorized for fiscal years 2009 through 2018. Grants approved by the Secretary for highway projects are considered contractual obligations of the Government. Definitions are provided in Section 10 of the Act. The Act defines \"eligible project\" as a project eligible for assistance under title 23, US Code, and includes construction or improvements to intermodal freight facilities. It also defines \"Federal-aid highway\" and \"State\" as per title 23, US Code. The Act defines terms such as \"Federal-aid highway,\" \"State,\" \"State department of transportation,\" and \"United States\" in accordance with title 23, US Code."
