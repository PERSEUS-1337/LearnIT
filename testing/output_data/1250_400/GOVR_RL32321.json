    "content": "After years of experience in peacekeeping and peacebuilding operations, analysts emphasize the importance of establishing a secure environment for sustainable peace. Military forces are crucial for initial security, but civilian police (CivPol) are increasingly recognized as more suitable for law and order tasks. Members of Congress are exploring tools for effective security in unstable regions like Iraq, Afghanistan, and Haiti. Over the past decade, international civilian police (CivPol) have gained recognition as more suitable than military forces for law and order tasks. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee acknowledges the importance of UN peacekeeping operations and the need for improvements in CivPol capabilities. Policymakers are addressing issues such as recruitment, deployment, and training of qualified personnel for post-conflict missions. Advocates propose measures to enhance CivPol capabilities and ensure personnel are equipped to handle various law enforcement situations. Proposals have been made to improve the recruitment and deployment of qualified police personnel for post-conflict missions, emphasizing the need for proper training. Key documents like the Clinton Administration's PDD-71 and the UN's Brahimi Panel report have recommended reforms to enhance CivPol capabilities. The Bush Administration has begun implementing measures to address problems with U.N. peacekeeping operations, including recommendations from the Brahimi Panel report. Proposed reforms include creating a reserve CivPol force, diversifying international police forces, and establishing units with military skills for crowd control. The report discusses proposed reforms for international police forces in peacekeeping operations, including creating a reserve CivPol force, diversifying police forces with military skills, and establishing civilian response mechanisms. Policymakers are interested in whether these recommendations could reduce reliance on U.S. military forces in post-conflict operations. The report also outlines the evolution of international police use in peacekeeping operations and the challenges faced. The report discusses the evolution of international police use in peacekeeping operations, with a focus on the increasing reliance on CivPols. Between 1994 and 2000, the number of international civilian police participating in U.N. operations increased fourfold. Recommendations for improving the current U.N., U.S., and European mechanisms for providing CivPols are also discussed, along with proposed reforms to address ongoing challenges in international peace operations. The international community has increasingly relied on CivPols for various functions in peace operations. The number of international civilian police in U.N. operations has doubled in the past decade, with 4,655 deployed as of February 29, 2004. Countries like the U.S. continue to provide bilateral assistance, including training, to indigenous police forces in post-conflict situations. Some analysts suggest deploying international civilian police to countries like Afghanistan, Iraq, and Haiti. Some analysts recommend deploying international civilian police to countries like Afghanistan, Iraq, and Haiti. U.S. assistance for law enforcement abroad is governed by Section 660 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, which prohibits aid to foreign police forces unless in post-conflict situations. International civilian police forces are used for various purposes in different situations. Exceptions to Section 660 do not apply to assistance in post-conflict situations. International civilian police forces have been used for various purposes since the late 19th century, including monitoring, advising, training, and restructuring local forces. Sometimes these forces are armed and granted arrest powers. Policing in peacekeeping operations has evolved through five phases of increasing scope. During the past decade, policing in peacekeeping operations has evolved through five phases of increasing scope and complexity, aimed at establishing security. The evolution involved expanding U.N. activities from monitoring mandates to adding training components and developing mandates that include substantial reform and restructuring of existing police institutions or creating new institutions. The evolution of policing in peacekeeping operations has gone through five phases, starting with training components in Cambodia and intensifying in El Salvador. It later included substantial reform efforts in Somalia and Haiti, the addition of constabulary units in Bosnia, and granting international police executive authority in East Timor and Kosovo. This evolution reflects the international community's recognition of diverse security needs and assistance required by local police forces in peacekeeping missions. The evolution of policing in peacekeeping operations has progressed through various phases, reflecting the international community's acknowledgment of diverse security needs and assistance required by local police forces. Policymakers and analysts have identified gaps in implementing peacekeeping mandates, focusing on the need for clear mandates and effective implementation procedures to ensure public security. The recruitment and training mechanisms for peacekeeping operations, particularly within the United Nations, are seen as deficient due to a diverse pool of volunteers with varying police standards. This has led to challenges in recruiting well-trained and professional policemen who can work effectively together, with some recruits lacking basic skills and engaging in corruption. The United Nations has faced challenges in recruiting well-trained and professional policemen for peacekeeping missions. Some recruits lack basic skills and engage in corruption. Efforts have been made to improve recruitment and training procedures, but additional training is needed to instill common policing skills and enhance teamwork. Security gaps exist in establishing law and order in post-conflict situations, exacerbated by deficiencies in recruitment and training systems. The presence of three security gaps in establishing law and order in post-conflict situations is a significant problem. The first gap is the deployment gap, where police forces are not deployed quickly or in sufficient numbers. This issue has been observed in various international missions, such as in Panama and Cambodia. Deployment delays have hindered the effectiveness of missions, like in Somalia where it took nearly a year to deploy the first dozen police officers. The deployment of police forces in international missions has faced challenges in terms of timely deployment and reaching authorized sizes. In some cases, like in Bosnia, only half of the authorized number of police officers were recruited. There is also a gap in deploying individuals with specialized skills. The second issue is the enforcement gap, where deployed police lack necessary skills for handling hostile situations and organized crime. In post-conflict situations, police deployed often lack necessary skills for handling hostile situations and organized crime, compromising peacekeeping operations. Additionally, indigenous law enforcement systems may lack adequate personnel and institutions for effective prosecution and punishment, leading to challenges in sustainable security. In post-conflict situations, international police assistance is crucial due to the lack of resources and personnel in indigenous law enforcement systems. The United Nations, European countries, regional organizations, and the United States play key roles in providing support. As of February 29, 2004, 4,655 UNCIVPOL officers from 65 nations were serving in eight U.N. missions, with Jordan and the United States being the largest contributors. International civilian police assistance is provided in multilateral operations, with 4,655 UNCIVPOL officers from 65 nations serving in eight U.N. missions as of February 29, 2004. Jordan and the United States are the largest contributors, with other countries like India, Germany, and Turkey also providing significant numbers of officers. The majority of UNCIVPOL officers are serving in Kosovo, with other missions in Liberia, East Timor, Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cyprus, Georgia, and Afghanistan. The United States has also provided police assistance in Somalia and Haiti under U.N. authority. Many nations, including the United States and European Union member states, have provided police assistance in various countries through multilateral efforts. The United States has been involved in peacekeeping operations in Somalia and Haiti, as well as developing police training programs in Somalia. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the European Union (EU) have also taken the lead in specific missions, often in conjunction with U.N. missions. The OSCE and EU have led specific missions in conjunction with U.N. efforts, providing police training and support in various countries. The EU took over the police mission in Bosnia from the U.N. in 2003 and launched the PROXIMA mission in Macedonia in the same year. U.N. Member States contribute police personnel voluntarily for peacekeeping operations, following international standards for democratic community policing. The United Nations Security Council authorizes peacekeeping operations, with Member States contributing national police forces or formed police units. The U.N. philosophy of CivPol is based on democratic community policing and human rights standards. The Department of Peacekeeping Operations provides direction for all operation components, including the police mission. The Civilian Police Division oversees policy, planning, recruitment, and deployment of civilian police personnel. The Civilian Police Division (CPD) within the UNDPKO manages civilian policing activities, recruitment, and deployment of CivPol personnel. The UNCIVPOL personnel in the field report to the UNCIVPOL Police Commissioner, who reports to the U.N. Secretary-General's Special Representative. The Brahimi Panel report identified issues with police personnel recruitment, training, and deployment in U.N. peacekeeping operations, recommending actions for improvement. The Brahimi Panel report highlighted challenges in U.N. peacekeeping operations, focusing on issues with police personnel recruitment, training, and deployment. Recommendations included establishing ready rosters of qualified CivPols, developing on-call lists for mission planning, forming regional partnerships for joint training, and appointing national points of contact for CivPol matters. Additionally, conferences were held with police-contributing nations to address system problems and propose solutions. Between March 1998 and mid-August 2000, the UNDPKO held conferences with police-contributing nations to address issues with U.N. policing operations. Proposals were made to improve recruitment, training, deployment, and organizational efficiency. Some recommendations, such as incorporating CivPol personnel under the U.N. standby arrangement system and pre-positioning equipment for rapid deployment, have been implemented. However, analysts still identify significant problems with the UNCIVPOL system. The UNDPKO held conferences to address issues with U.N. policing operations, proposing improvements in recruitment, training, deployment, and organizational efficiency. Some recommendations have been implemented, but analysts still see significant problems with the UNCIVPOL system. The Brahimi Panel's recommendations aimed at reforming and restructuring local police operations, calling for a new approach. The Brahimi Panel recommended a new approach for UNCIVPOL operations, emphasizing reform and restructuring of local police with better-trained personnel working alongside rule of law experts to strengthen institutions. This shift may strain U.N. Member States to provide more specialized police experts, leading to challenges in implementation. The United Nations is moving towards using a wider range of rule of law experts in peacekeeping operations by establishing a new rule of law unit. However, progress in integrating rule of law components is seen as \"lagging\" according to a recent report by the Henry L. Stimson Center. The United Nations is facing challenges in recruiting civilian police for peacekeeping operations, with uneven results and a lack of experience in community policing and international human rights. Progress in integrating rule of law components is considered \"lagging\" according to a recent report by the Henry L. Stimson Center. The United Nations faces challenges in recruiting civilian police for peacekeeping operations, including uneven results in meeting minimum standards and a lack of experience in community policing and international human rights. Additionally, there are difficulties in recruiting officers with specialized skills and a lack of a comprehensive U.N. civilian police strategy, making it hard to determine mission needs and appropriate personnel. The United Nations struggles to recruit civilian police for peacekeeping missions due to challenges in meeting minimum standards and lack of specialized skills. Current criteria for civilian police include age, service experience, language proficiency, driver's license, and medical standards. Some officers still lack necessary skills like language, driving, and firearms despite U.N. efforts. The United Nations faces challenges in recruiting civilian police for peacekeeping missions, with some officers lacking essential skills despite U.N. efforts. Selection Assistance Teams provide guidance to Member States in selecting candidates, focusing on language, driving, and firearms requirements. Retraining and retesting of basic skills continue in the mission, leading to high repatriation costs and deployment delays. Specialized skills recruitment remains difficult for UNDPKO. In Bosnia-Hercegovina, retesting accounted for a significant portion of the induction period, leading to high repatriation costs and deployment delays. Recruitment for specialized skills, such as training and investigations, has been challenging. The Brahimi Panel and UNDPKO recommend advance recruitment to improve the quality of personnel and expedite deployment. Success in implementing these recommendations has been mixed. The Brahimi Panel Report and UNDPKO recommend advance recruitment of trained CivPol personnel to speed deployment and reduce costs. Progress has been made in strengthening the U.N. System of Standby Arrangements for military, civilian police, and civilian personnel. The U.N. System of Standby Arrangements has made progress in strengthening its capabilities by increasing participating countries, creating job descriptions, and identifying specialized personnel. However, a report in December 2003 highlighted the need for more states to create national pools of candidates for international operations. The report recommended replacing the current system of \"bidding for slots\" with qualified candidates who have professional experience and knowledge of UN rules and procedures. Additionally, the Brahimi Panel Report called for an on-call list of 100 police officers and experts for advance mission planning and early deployment. In 2002, UNDPKO established a 100-person on-call roster of civilian police personnel for specialized recruitment. The Brahimi Panel Report recommended a 100-person on-call list of police officers and experts for advance mission planning and early deployment. UNDPKO established this roster in 2002 for specialized recruitment. As of March 2004, 10 out of 89 police-contributing Member States have nominated individuals for the list. The United Nations has also improved recruitment for specialists by including substantive skills in selection criteria since spring 2003. These skills include management, planning, training, mentoring, and operational expertise like criminal investigations and traffic control. Training exercises have been conducted to enhance the efficiency of the on-call system. Since spring 2003, SAT visits now consider substantive skills like management, planning, training, mentoring, criminal investigations, forensic analysis, and traffic control. Analysts have identified shortcomings in U.N. procedures that hinder recruitment efforts, including the lack of standardized criteria for determining civilian police numbers and matching skills to missions. The audit faulted UNDPKO for not consistently applying assessment systems to ensure appropriate skill matching. The audit criticized UNDPKO for not consistently matching skills to missions, leading to civilian police personnel performing non-policing functions and reducing available police for policing tasks. Additionally, training for police-contributing Member States varies and is sometimes inadequate, affecting the effectiveness of UNCIVPOL missions. Administrative functions accounted for a significant portion of police officers in missions like UNMIBH, UNMIK, and UNTAET. The effectiveness of UNCIVPOL missions is undermined by the lack of uniformity in experience and training among police-contributing Member States. Member States are responsible for providing pre-deployment training to civilian police personnel, but inadequate training is a concern due to a lack of experienced police trainers with peacekeeping experience. In-theater training covers standard operating procedures, safety, security, human rights, computer, and local language training. UNCIVPOL personnel undergo in-theater training covering standard operating procedures, safety, security, human rights, computer, and local language training. Challenges in pre-deployment training include a lack of experienced trainers, resources, and varying national training programs. Recommendations include developing regional partnerships for joint police training exercises and using UN educational materials for pre-training personnel for rapid deployment. Evidence suggests limited progress in implementing these recommendations. The Stimson Center recommends using U.N. educational materials for pre-training personnel for rapid deployment. The UNDPKO Training Unit has developed training publications to assist Member States with pre-deployment training programs. Common training standards and generic training modules have been developed to ensure uniformity in the competence of deployed peacekeepers. PDD-71 identified training as an area where the United States could contribute to enhancing the capabilities of other nations in CivPol operations. PDD-71 emphasized the importance of training standards for peacekeepers, calling for the State Department to provide tailored training packages to US and international CivPol when requested. The State Department is working on a program to allow foreign police officers to train with the US contingent. The State Department aims to provide tailored training packages to US and international CivPol upon request, with appropriate funding. Deployment of UNCIVPOL is complex, involving mission definition, recruitment, and procurement, historically taking six to eighteen months due to resource limitations. The Brahimi Report identified reasons for deployment delays, with the lack of a standing police force requiring significant organizational changes. The deployment times for UNCIVPOL missions have ranged from six to eighteen months due to insufficient resources. The Brahimi Report identified reasons for the deployment lag, including the lack of a reserve corps of mission leadership, unreliable standby arrangements, and an insufficient supply of equipment. The report recommended full deployment within 30 days for traditional peacekeeping missions and within 90 days for complex emergencies. Deployment uncertainty exists within the 30-90 day timeframe for military and police personnel. The Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations recommended full deployment within 30 days for traditional peacekeeping missions and within 90 days for complex emergencies. However, there are constraints on rapid deployment, including the limited capacity of the current U.N. system and the need for contributing states to quickly deploy well-trained personnel. Reforms are underway to improve the United Nations System for Standby Arrangements and develop a roster of civilian police personnel for faster deployment in the future. The United Nations is working on reforms to improve rapid deployment capabilities for civilian police personnel. The UNDPKO recommends pre-packaging equipment for quick deployment at the start of new missions. However, there is currently no program in place to prepare UNCIVPOL for rapid deployment. Many UN Member States have generic rapid deployment programs but lack the capability to deploy quickly. The U.S. CivPol program manages policy development, training, and coordination with the United Nations and other contributing countries. The Department of State's Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs manages the U.S. CivPol program, recruiting civilian police personnel from local agencies through contractors. DynCorp International has been the sole supplier of personnel, but a new arrangement with DynCorp and Civilian Police International LLC has been initiated to maintain rosters of up to 2,000 personnel. The State Department has initiated a new arrangement with DynCorp and Civilian Police International LLC to maintain rosters of up to 2,000 personnel for civilian police operations. The program is usually funded through various State Department regional bureaus and the Peacekeeping account, with officers receiving salaries ranging from $50,000-100,000 and additional allowances for U.N. missions. The U.S. CivPol program is funded through State Department bureaus and the Peacekeeping account. Officers receive salaries ranging from $50,000-100,000, with additional allowances for U.N. missions. Costs per officer vary by mission, with expenses covered by the United Nations in Kosovo. In Iraq, costs include security, food, and housing. The U.S. CivPol program is funded through State Department bureaus and the Peacekeeping account. Officers receive salaries ranging from $50,000-100,000, with additional allowances for U.N. missions. The higher Iraq figure includes costs for security, food, and housing, covered by the United Nations. The Congressional Budget Office estimated the incremental cost per troop in Iraq, ranging from $179,000 to $206,000. As of March 27, 2004, 1,016 U.S. CivPol and support personnel were participating in international missions. The U.S. CivPol program involves deploying police officers to various international missions, including U.N. missions in Kosovo, Liberia, East Timor, and Sierra Leone. Additionally, officers are seconded to OSCE missions and the headquarters in Vienna. The U.S. also contributes personnel to Afghanistan and Iraq. Policymakers have recognized recruitment and deployment challenges and have implemented reforms outlined in PDD-71 to enhance response capacities and operational activities. PDD-71 aimed to improve the recruitment and deployment of U.S. CivPol personnel, addressing issues such as matching skills with mission requirements and training inconsistencies. The Department of State has introduced contracts for a reserve cadre of up to 2,000 law enforcement personnel to enhance the current system. The Department of State has issued contracts for a reserve cadre of up to 2,000 U.S. law enforcement personnel for international police service. The contractor is responsible for recruitment, training, and procurement services to facilitate rapid deployment of qualified CivPols. Technical advisors are also identified to assist in establishing institutional capabilities in police, judicial, and corrections systems. The Department of State has issued contracts for a reserve cadre of up to 2,000 U.S. law enforcement personnel for international police service. The contractor is responsible for recruitment, training, and procurement services to facilitate rapid deployment of qualified CivPols. Technical advisors are also identified to assist in establishing institutional capabilities in police, judicial, and corrections systems. The decision to award contracts to multiple companies for the new CivPol cadre program has raised concerns about potential delays and costs. The extent to which the original RFP provisions apply to the new contracts is unclear as they have not been made public. Some analysts fear that advantages of the new contracts for international police service may be offset by additional costs and delays. The recruitment program draws police officers from state and local law enforcement agencies, leading to concerns about staffing shortages in municipal and state departments due to repeated call-ups of U.S. military reserve forces for various missions. Some analysts believe that the recruitment system for international police service is straining municipal and state police forces due to the repeated call-ups of U.S. military reserve forces. They suggest providing compensation to state and municipal governments for detailing police officers to CivPol missions to attract more professional recruits. Some argue that the recruitment of individual U.S. police officers for international police service lacks cohesion and does not accurately reflect mission requirements. Current selection criteria include U.S. citizenship, eight years of law enforcement experience, an unblemished record, a valid driver's license, physical and psychological fitness, a U.S. passport, and English proficiency. The Department of State has recruitment criteria for civilian law enforcement officers, including an unblemished record, valid driver's license, physical fitness, and English proficiency. They are also expanding qualifications for specialized skills in missions like Kosovo, East Timor, and Iraq. The State Department CivPol cadre program aims to address the need for high-quality personnel by including specialists in the recruitment process. The State Department's CivPol cadre program aims to recruit high-quality personnel, with nearly 55% of the cadre being specialists. Qualifications include interpersonal, leadership, and negotiation skills, knowledge of international police standards, and experience in multicultural environments. Selected individuals will receive annual training in essential policing skills to incentivize participation. Funding for training all members of the program is uncertain. The U.S. CivPol program aims to recruit high-quality personnel with specialized skills. Training for officers is uncertain due to funding issues. Current training includes pre-deployment sessions on various topics related to peace operations and international policing. Some experts find the training program inadequate due to variations in skills among recruited officers. The Police Assessment, Selection, and Training (P.A.S.T) program for U.S. CivPol officers includes training on United Nations operations, history of the region, civil-military relations, human rights, and defensive tactics. The new training curriculum aims to meet national certification standards and international principles of democratic policing. The new CivPol training program aims to meet POST certification requirements and international principles of democratic policing and human rights. It includes ongoing training in policing skills, specialized training, and annual additional training. Concerns have been raised about potential higher training costs due to increased trainees and facilities. The U.S. CivPol contingent can deploy to a U.N. operation within 30-45 days, falling short of the proposed legislation's deployment capability of 15 days. The United States fulfills the deployment requirement for the CivPol training program within 30-45 days, but proposed legislation calls for deployment capability within 15 days. Analysts question if the current deployment capability can be maintained under the new system. The contractor would maintain a database of commercial sources for equipment and provide logistical support to augment operational capabilities. The contractor would develop a logistics support team to provide advanced logistical and administrative support for the U.S. police contingent in international missions. Most European countries deploy police from their national forces for international CivPol operations, except for the United Kingdom and the United States. European governments have recognized the need to reform their deployment systems to improve international CivPol capabilities. The EU has developed goals and procedures since 1999 to enhance the quality and timeliness of European police missions. European governments, including the European Union, have acknowledged the importance of reforming their deployment systems to enhance international CivPol capabilities. The EU has set goals to improve the quality and timeliness of European contributions to U.N., OSCE, and EU police missions, including developing a 5,000 civilian reserve police force by 2003. This effort is part of the European Security and Defense Policy adopted in 1999, aiming to establish police capabilities for international peace operations. In December 1999, the European Security and Defense Policy (ESDP) was adopted at the Helsinki Summit, focusing on police capabilities for constabulary functions. In June 2001, the G\u00c3\u00b6teborg European Council established a Police Action Plan for selection, training, command, and control. The EU also created the Rapid Reaction Mechanism (RRM) for flexible funding of civilian crisis management operations. As of late February 2004, EU Member States committed up to 5,000 police officers for crisis management, with 1,400 available for rapid deployment within 30 days. Member States also pledged to provide rapidly deployable police units and headquarters for missions. The EU launched its first ESDP mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina in January 2003, with the aim of establishing sustainable policing arrangements. The mission consists of 500 police officers and 70 civilian experts from 33 states, with an annual budget of $47.2 million. In December 2003, the EU began its second police mission in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia with 200 police and civilian personnel. The EU's second police mission in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia started in December 2003 with 200 police and civilian personnel. The mission has an annual budget of $18.6 million, with all EU Member States participating. Some analysts doubt the effectiveness of the EU's crisis management and rapid reaction capabilities due to potential issues with national sovereignty. The OSCE is also improving its operational capabilities for rapid deployment of CivPols and civilian experts. The OSCE is enhancing its operational capabilities for rapid deployment of CivPols and civilian experts in various countries. The REACT program was created to deploy experts in conflict prevention, crisis management, and post-conflict missions. Policing activities focus on training, reform, and development of local police. The REACT program aims to identify and deploy experts in conflict prevention, crisis management, and post-conflict missions. It allows participating States to establish their own database of qualified civilian experts for rapid deployment within two to eight weeks. The OSCE and its 55 participating States have taken steps to implement and improve the program, including creating national websites for recruitment. The OSCE and its participating States have implemented the REACT program to recruit CivPols with specific skills for field activities. The program includes national websites for recruitment and a framework of standards for educational and experience requirements. The OSCE developed a staffing matrix to assist in recruiting qualified candidates for advising, mentoring, and development functions. Minimum requirements for civilian police are similar but not identical to U.N. and U.S. requirements. The OSCE recruits CivPols with specific skills for field activities through the REACT program. Minimum requirements for civilian police include graduation from a recognized police training school, active police experience, English communication ability, negotiation skills, mapping skills, and first aid experience. Desired skills include liaison experience with non-law enforcement organizations and the ability to operate police radio equipment. OSCE also recruits law enforcement administrators with relevant experience and expertise. In the 108th Congress, three bills were introduced to strengthen U.S. and international capabilities for CivPol missions and rule of law missions, with H.R. 1414 aimed at improvement. In the 108th Congress, Members introduced three bills to enhance U.S. and international capabilities for CivPol missions and rule of law missions. H.R. 1414 aims to improve UNCIVPOL capabilities, H.R. 2616 addresses U.S. CivPol issues and proposes NATO capabilities for post-conflict efforts, and S. 2127 seeks to enhance U.S. civilian crisis response abilities. Analysts suggest options to address training deficiencies and create effective law enforcement institutions. H.R. 1414, the International Rule of Law and Antiterrorism Act of 2003, focuses on reforming the U.N. Civilian Police System. H.R. 1414 proposes substantial reform to make UNCIVPOL more effective and rapidly deployable. It calls for negotiations within the United Nations to establish a professional United Nations civilian police corps (UNCPC) available for rapid deployment within 15 days of a U.N. Security Council authorization. The bill proposes the establishment of a professional United Nations civilian police corps (UNCPC) for rapid deployment within 15 days of a U.N. Security Council authorization. It emphasizes the need for law enforcement professionals with appropriate training and resources, including funding, equipment, and staffing. The bill proposes the establishment of a professional United Nations civilian police corps (UNCPC) with appropriate resources and training. It aims to address deployment and enforcement gaps, advocating for standards and training programs within the United Nations. This initiative is seen as a way to enhance the U.N.'s ability to maintain a secure environment and reduce the need for combat soldiers. The bill proposes the creation of a professional U.N. police corps to improve security and reduce the need for combat soldiers in peacekeeping operations. Opponents are concerned about the cost and sustainability of a standing corps funded through mandatory assessments or voluntary contributions. The bill proposes the creation of a professional U.N. police corps to improve security in peacekeeping operations. Concerns include cost, sustainability, limited management capacity of the United Nations, and potential infringement on national sovereignty. H.R. 2616 aims to enhance U.S. and NATO capabilities for reconstruction assistance in post-conflict situations. The Winning the Peace Act of 2003, introduced by Representatives Farr, Wolf, Hoeffel, Leach, and Wexler, proposes the establishment of a U.S. civilian police reserve to provide security and training in post-conflict situations. Additionally, the bill suggests creating a NATO mechanism for military and policing services. The bill proposes establishing a civilian police reserve in the United States and a NATO mechanism for military and policing services in post-conflict situations. It calls for the President to create a task force for the reserve and suggests training NATO units for security in reconstruction, with the ability to serve as a police force. The proposed legislation aims to establish a civilian police reserve in the United States and a NATO mechanism for post-conflict security. The bill specifies tasks for selected units, including constabulary skills and policing abilities. Proponents argue that this reserve would enhance international capabilities for post-conflict reconstruction. The proposed legislation aims to establish a civilian police reserve in the United States and a NATO mechanism for post-conflict security. Proponents argue that this reserve would help bridge the deployment gap by expediting the deployment of U.S. civilian police. There is a debate between establishing a civilian police reserve in line with the State Department's private sector model or a new U.S. government reserve force. Supporters of the private contractor model believe it is preferable due to quicker response times and avoiding new government bureaucracies. However, opponents raise concerns about the dedication and efficiency of commercial contractors in policing operations. Opponents of a government-sponsored reserve may concede that a federal agency could deploy a reserve CivPol force as efficiently as a private contractor, but only if civilian law enforcement personnel were maintained as paid reservists. Proponents argue that a government reserve is a more potent symbol of U.S. commitment, more responsive to U.S. policy, and might prove a more cohesive force. They also argue that a government agency could better guarantee the quality of recruits and draw qualified CivPol personnel from local and state police departments. A government agency could better guarantee the quality of recruits and draw qualified CivPol personnel from local and state police departments. Establishing a compensation system for departments providing personnel to federal service might be easier under a federal reserve model. Pre-deployment training could influence judgments on a government-sponsored vs. a government-contracted reserve force. Training together and coordinating with military forces could make a government-created model more effective than a contractor model. NATO constabulary capability could help bridge the enforcement gap. Establishing a NATO constabulary capability through NATO could bridge enforcement gaps in post-conflict situations, but some question if a military organization is the right venue for policing functions. Critics argue that using military forces for policing may send inappropriate signals and duplicate existing structures. Analysts suggest additional provisions on equipment, training, and coordination with the military in the bill. Some analysts argue that creating a NATO reserve may duplicate EU structures and strain US-European relations. Critics question the need for police reserves and suggest additional provisions for equipment, training, and coordination with the military to avoid repeating past operational problems. S. 2127, introduced by Senators Lugar and Biden in 2004, aims to strengthen civilian foreign affairs agencies' capacity to respond to overseas crises. The bill proposes reorganizing government structures to create a Response Readiness Corps with $80 million funding to hire personnel and designate employees from the State Department and USAID. Critics question the need for police reserves and express concerns about potential strain on existing resources and tensions with local and state governments. S. 2127 proposes creating a Response Readiness Corps with $80 million funding to hire personnel from the State Department and USAID to respond to overseas crises. The bill aims to train 10% of State Department and USAID personnel for this force within three years. However, it is unclear what types of personnel will be recruited for this corps. The legislation proposed creating a Response Readiness Corps with $80 million funding to hire State Department and USAID personnel for overseas crises. However, it is unclear what types of personnel will be recruited for this corps. Experts suggest improving training and professionalization of CivPol personnel to bridge deployment gaps and meet increasing mission needs. Training adjustments in the field have been made on a case-by-case basis in places like Bosnia, Kosovo, and East Timor. PDD-71 proposed maintaining the capacity to provide tailored training packages to CivPol when requested. Training adjustments were made in places like Bosnia, Kosovo, and East Timor on a case-by-case basis. PDD-71 proposed maintaining the capacity to provide tailored training packages to CivPol when requested. Analysts recommend increased police training funding as many nations find the cost prohibitive. The State Department's new CivPol cadre bid solicitation proposal includes a provision for U.S. training of foreign police personnel, pending decisions on program arrangements and funding availability. Some analysts suggest strengthening existing international constabulary forces to address deployment and enforcement gaps. Increase International Capability for Constabulary Forces. Analysts suggest strengthening existing international constabulary forces to address deployment and enforcement gaps. This may involve creating new capabilities in nations that do not have them, as proposed in H.R. 2616 to incorporate a unit within NATO for constabulary functions. Constabulary police perform tasks that require less force than combat but more than routine law enforcement activities, such as regulating movements for safety, intervening in civil violence, and dispersing unruly demonstrations. Constabulary forces are essential for addressing civil violence, looting, riots, and public disturbances. They are trained in both military and policing skills, making them valuable in post-conflict areas. When deployed on peacekeeping missions, they have their own communication and logistical support and can deploy rapidly as formed units. Analysts recommend specialized paramilitary units for constabulary tasks in peacekeeping operations. Several countries have specialized paramilitary police units trained as constabulary forces, such as the Italian carabinieri, French gendarmerie, and Spanish Guardia Civil. These resources can be strained by high deployment rates in U.N. peacekeeping operations. Some argue for the U.S. army to develop its own active duty constabulary force to augment military police in peacekeeping operations. Army analysts and policymakers are considering this option due to shortages in the reserve when deployment rates are high. The U.S. army is considering developing its own active duty constabulary force to assist military police in peacekeeping operations. Army leaders have traditionally resisted this idea, but with recent interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq, there is a growing belief that military forces must establish conditions for lasting peace. Proponents argue that an intermediary security force for peace operations is necessary for handling violent situations. The U.S. army is considering developing an active duty constabulary force to assist military police in peacekeeping operations. Proponents argue that such forces can handle violent situations beyond the capabilities of CivPol, reducing reliance on combat soldiers for policing activities. Analysts are unsure if other countries would be willing to enhance their constabulary capabilities for deployment abroad. Some analysts suggest developing a \"U.S. Force for Stability\" to address the gap in peace operations by creating rapidly deployable units of law enforcement and rule of law personnel. This includes police, judicial branch officials, and prison personnel. The United States currently deploys personnel with justice and corrections experience through Department of Justice contracts. The State Department's CivPol program also aims to identify such personnel for deployment. The United States deploys personnel with experience in justice and corrections systems through Department of Justice contracts. Analysts propose creating a \"U.S. Force for Stability\" to integrate military and civilian personnel for post-conflict intervention. Robert S. Perito advocates for this approach to address security gaps and break the cycle of impunity. The proposal for a \"U.S. force for stability\" aims to integrate military and civilian personnel to address security gaps and break the cycle of impunity in post-conflict interventions. The force would consist of robust military forces, civilian constabulary units, civilian police, and rule of law professionals, deploying concurrently to provide security from the outset and bridge deployment gaps. Civilian personnel would take over law enforcement functions once security conditions permit, transitioning from combat to stability roles at the end of major combat operations. The proposal aims to integrate military and civilian personnel to address security gaps in post-conflict interventions. Civilian personnel would take over law enforcement functions once security conditions permit, transitioning from combat to stability roles at the end of major combat operations. The model involves military providing perimeter security, constabulary units handling internal security, civilian police maintaining public safety, and justice experts ensuring the rule of law. Over time, personnel shifts from military to civilian control. The model is similar to the organization of NATO military and U.N. civilian security forces in Kosovo. The proposal integrates military and civilian personnel for post-conflict interventions, with civilians taking over law enforcement functions once security permits. Recommendations include creating a standing interagency team for stabilization and reconstruction, and an on-call civilian crisis management corps. Another recommendation is the establishment of an Agency for Stability Operations reporting directly to the Secretary of State. A March 2004 report recommends the establishment of an Agency for Stability Operations responsible for preparing and managing a Civilian Stability Operations Corps of 200-300 U.S. government civilians. This model is seen as advantageous for early deployment of rule of law personnel to enhance security and promote long-term stability and democracy in intervened or post-conflict countries. The early deployment of rule of law personnel is essential for providing security at the beginning of an operation, which can lead to long-term stability and democracy in intervened or post-conflict countries. This approach may allow for the earlier withdrawal of military personnel. However, implementing such a force would require significant changes in current U.S. practices, including developing constabulary capabilities within the military and recruiting constabulary and police personnel through a new federal agency instead of contractors. This restructuring could be controversial and discussions on the merits of government-employment versus government-contracted models for CivPol deployments are ongoing. The creation of a stability force through federal employment rather than contractors could be controversial. Arguments on restructuring military forces and the merits of government-employment versus government-contracted models for CivPol deployments are ongoing. Rapid deployment of personnel may depend on recruitment and hiring methods. The availability of personnel for rapid deployment may depend on recruitment methods and benefits, such as pensions and salaries for training, similar to the U.S. military reserve component. Sources include Peacekeeping Fact Sheets from the U.N. Department of Peacekeeping Operations and information from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). The curr_chunk provides information on various resources related to police in peace operations, including websites for the United Nations, EU Police, and OMIK. It also mentions several publications on the topic. Additionally, it notes the historical dispatch of international police units to advise and train local forces. The dispatch of international police units to advise and train local forces dates back to the late 1800s. The first use of U.N. civilian police in peacekeeping occurred in 1960 during the U.N. Operation in the Congo. Subsequent deployments included the U.N. Temporary Executive Authority in West New Guinea and the U.N. Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus starting in 1964. In 1962-63, the United Nations provided UNTEA to administer West New Guinea during the transition from Dutch to Indonesian rule, recruiting Philippine police officers to assist the local force. The UNFICYP in Cyprus, starting in 1964, was the first operation to use UNCIVPOL, assisting Cypriot police in maintaining order. Monitoring mandates in Cambodia and other areas from 1989 to early 1992 focused on monitoring local police performance. Operations in Namibia and Western Sahara in the post-cold war era involved well-trained police forces. The United Nations began monitoring local police officers' performance in 1989 through 1992 in Namibia and Western Sahara. The missions involved well-trained police forces and focused on tasks such as accompanying local police, investigating complaints, and supervising investigations. The missions set a model for future monitoring missions in the early 1990s. In the early 1990s, the United Nations established monitoring missions with tasks such as accompanying local police, investigating public complaints, and supervising police investigations. These missions were carried out in Namibia, Western Sahara, Angola, Cambodia, and the new states created by the break-up of Yugoslavia. Additional functions were occasionally deemed necessary in the field. In the 1990s, the United Nations deployed police monitors in various conflict zones, including the break-up of Yugoslavia and Cambodia. These missions faced challenges due to inadequate mandates and insufficient military forces. The UNTAC mission in Cambodia focused on investigating violations of political liberties and human rights, leading to a shift in responsibilities for the police unit. The UNTAC police mission in Cambodia underwent a significant shift in responsibilities, focusing on investigating violations of political liberties and human rights. The deployment of police forces was hindered by delays, leading to the ineffectiveness of the operation. The UNTAC police unit faced challenges due to inadequate numbers of authorized police for ensuring law and order. The UNTAC police mission in Cambodia faced challenges due to a lack of resources and inadequate police numbers. They shifted their focus to monitoring elections and recognized the need for training in both the police force and judiciary. The operation highlighted the \"institution gap\" caused by the previous regime's removal of an independent judicial system. The UNTAC police mission in Cambodia faced challenges due to lack of resources and inadequate police numbers. Analysts recognized the \"institution gap\" caused by the previous regime's removal of an independent judicial system. The concept of deploying integrated \"justice packages\" was developed to address this issue. Police reform became a pivotal element in international missions, such as ONUSAL in El Salvador, which aimed to put internal security forces under civilian control. The international community provided unprecedented levels of assistance to support the reform of police forces. The ONUSAL mission in El Salvador aimed to reform internal security forces by establishing a new National Civilian Police force with international support. The mission began in January 1992 after peace accords ended the civil war, with UNCIVPOLs assisting in the transition and accompanying existing police officers. The ONUSAL mission in El Salvador, starting in March 1992, focused on establishing a new police force with international support. The UNDP managed the process with contributions from various countries, leading to the successful formation of the new police academy and force, despite encountering significant challenges. The establishment of a new police force in El Salvador with international assistance was considered a success, despite facing significant challenges. This success paved the way for future missions with training and reform mandates, such as the civilian police operation in Mozambique authorized in February 1994. The civilian police operation in Mozambique, authorized in February 1994, had a monitoring mission with a small training assistance component. It was a precursor to later training and police reform missions. International police support continued after the formal UN operations through bilateral training programs, particularly by the Spanish Guardia Civil. Training was also a part of the mandate of the U.N. Assistance Mission in Rwanda. In Somalia and Haiti, international forces led training and reform efforts initiated by the U.S. In Somalia, the U.S.-led United Task Force (UNITAF) initiated efforts to establish an Auxiliary Security Force (ASF) to enforce local laws and restore order in the aftermath of Siad Barre's dictatorship. The ASF, intended to be a community police force, operated in 17 cities and towns. The ASF in Somalia was established by UNITAF to enforce local laws and restore order. It aimed to eliminate the need for UNITAF troops to serve as police, create jobs, and give Somalis responsibility for their own affairs. UNITAF provided substantial assistance to the ASF. UNITAF provided substantial assistance to the Somali police force, including salaries, equipment, and training. Other nations also contributed by providing uniforms, vehicles, and food rations for ASF members and their families. Additionally, UNDP paid for operating expenses and refurbished police stations. The ASF aimed to enforce local laws, create jobs, and restore order in Somalia. Operation Desert Storm saw UNITAF military forces, including contingents from Morocco, Botswana, and the United Arab Emirates, providing training, weapons, and conducting joint patrols in Somalia. The World Food Program supplied food rations for ASF members and their families. UNOSOM II took over from UNITAF in May 1993, with ASF members operating in Mogadishu and other cities. Despite challenges from General Mohamed Farah Aidid's faction, UN efforts to rebuild the Somali police force faced staffing and funding issues, delaying progress. The UN's efforts to rebuild the Somali police force faced challenges due to inadequate staffing and funding, leading to delays in progress. Despite training programs and assistance from organizations like ICITAP, escalating violence and insecurity, attributed to insufficient UN military presence, ultimately led to the collapse of the programs. UNITAF's success in providing police forces was partially attributed to its commitment to support the efforts. The UN's efforts to rebuild the Somali police force faced challenges due to inadequate staffing and funding, leading to delays in progress. The UNITAF ASF achieved success in providing police forces with protection and legitimacy. The need for police institution development and reform was recognized by the end of the 1990s. The Brahimi Panel Report recommended a shift in using civilian personnel in peace operations to build local police capacity. UNOSOM II's lack of commitment to back up UNCIVPOLs led to an enforcement gap in Somalia. The lack of commitment by UNOSOM II to support UNCIVPOLs in Somalia led to the development of the concept of an enforcement gap. This gap highlighted the need for military intervention to maintain law and order in post-conflict situations where a peace accord was lacking. Additionally, the Somalia operation revealed challenges with international civilian police forces functioning without an effective cease-fire, the limitations of UNCIVPOL missions in training local police, and the presence of institutional gaps such as inadequate courts. The challenges faced by international civilian police forces include the inability to function without an effective cease-fire, limitations in training local police, and institutional gaps like inadequate courts and political settlements. In Haiti, reform efforts under the U.S.-led Multilateral Force highlighted similar issues, with the International Police Monitoring Force working to develop a new national police force. The International Police Monitoring Force (IPM) was formed with 820 monitors from 20 countries to train a new Haitian national police force. The IPM vetted former members of Haiti's armed forces for an interim public security force. The subsequent UN Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) took over monitoring and training functions, with three follow-on missions sent over the next five years to professionalize the Haitian police. Coordination between military forces and civilian police was crucial for establishing public security while the HNP was trained and deployed. The military and civilian police worked together to establish public security in Haiti while the new Haitian national police force was being trained and deployed. The United States adjusted rules of engagement to allow military forces to detain and shoot criminals when necessary. The MNF military police conducted patrols and provided training to the IPMs. Unlike Somalia, there was a smooth transition between the U.S.-led MNF and the UNMIH operation in Haiti. UNMIH also provided backup to the UNCIVPOL and helped bridge the law enforcement gap. In Haiti, the UNMIH military forces assisted in bridging the law enforcement gap by providing rapid backup to UNCIVPOL and MPs for liaison and technical assistance. They also contributed to stability by conducting patrols to deter crime and political violence. As the HNP deployed, UNCIVPOLs transitioned to a mentoring and monitoring role. However, the overcrowded prisons and corrupt judicial system hindered the establishment of public security. In Bosnia, Special Constabulary Units were created by the United Nations to assist with international police efforts from 1995-2002. The United Nations had full responsibility for international police assistance in Bosnia from 1995-2002, mandated by the December 1995 Dayton Accords. The International Police Task Force (IPTF) monitored, advised, trained, and facilitated law enforcement activities in Bosnia to establish public security. The United Nations had full responsibility for international police assistance in Bosnia from 1995-2002 through the International Police Task Force (IPTF). The IPTF monitored, advised, trained, and facilitated law enforcement activities in Bosnia to establish public security. In January 2003, the European Union took over police monitoring and training responsibilities in Bosnia through the EU Police Mission (EUPM). The IPTF CivPols lacked enforcement powers and were insufficient in maintaining public order among hostile groups. The IPTF CivPols in Bosnia, lacking enforcement powers, were inadequate in ensuring public order among hostile groups. Concerns were raised during the Dayton negotiations for a stronger mandate for international CivPol and a policing function for NATO peacekeeping IFOR. IFOR provided assistance to the IPTF in early 1996, compensating for their slow deployment. In early 1996, IFOR provided assistance to the IPTF in Bosnia, helping with planning and organization. Despite the death of only one person during the relocation process, the lack of enforcement powers led to dwellings being gutted, burned, and booby-trapped. This resulted in a flight of Bosnian Serbs from Sarajevo suburbs, leading to a perception of U.N. failure and a loss of credibility for the understaffed and under-resourced IPTF. It took almost a year for the IPTF to recover from this setback. The flight of Bosnian Serbs from Sarajevo suburbs led to a perception of U.N. failure in Bosnia, impacting the credibility of the understaffed and under-resourced IPTF. The IPTF took almost a year to recover from this setback, leading to the development of specialized units within the force to address the enforcement gap. These units included paramilitary forces from foreign nations like France, Italy, and Spain. In the early 1990s, paramilitary police units from France, Italy, and Spain were integrated into international CivPols without special functions. However, by the late 1990s, the Multinational Specialized Unit (MSU) was formed in Bosnia to fill the gap between military capabilities and unarmed police monitors. The success in Bosnia led to the formation of similar units in Kosovo and East Timor. The formation of international civilian police units with executive authority powers occurred in Kosovo and East Timor in 1999, reflecting the absence of legitimate local authority. NATO and the United Nations took responsibility for stabilizing Kosovo after the coalition air war against Serbia, with NATO providing military presence through KFOR and the UN overseeing civil administration functions through UNMIK. In Kosovo and East Timor, NATO and the United Nations provided security and civil administration functions through KFOR and UNMIK. In East Timor, UNTAET oversaw the transition to self-government after Indonesia's withdrawal. In East Timor, a security vacuum was avoided by the presence of U.N. forces and the Australian-led peacekeeping force INTERFET. The use of executive authority in such situations is seen as problematic and unlikely to be a wise choice due to limited availability of international civilian police personnel. Case-by-case decisions are made regarding the need for executive policing when local police forces are deemed unsuitable. In situations where local police forces are deemed unsuitable, practitioners and policymakers will need to make case-by-case decisions on the desirability of executive policing. Sovereignty considerations will also play a significant role in these decisions."
