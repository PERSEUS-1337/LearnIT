Commanders must comply with climate assessments to create a safe environment. Improved performance assessments and reporting by commanders can help identify trends in harmful behavior. Reasons for not reporting incidents include fear of inaction and negative impact on military career. According to a report, members often choose not to report sexual harassment and assault incidents due to concerns that nothing will be done about it and fear of negative impacts on their military career. Commanders' tolerance or ignorance of such misconduct perpetuates a culture that hinders change. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines \"sexual harassment\" and \"sexual assault\" in accordance with Department of Defense directives. The Secretary of Defense must ensure that command climate assessment results are shared with relevant commanders and higher levels of command. Each military department must include a designated form in performance evaluations for senior commanders to indicate if required assessments were conducted.

Additionally, service-wide 360 assessments are required. SEC. 6. Service-wide 360 assessments will be adopted by each military department, modeled after the Department of the Army's MSAF Program. Individual counseling will be included in the performance evaluation process. SEC. 7. Health welfare inspections will be conducted monthly to ensure security, readiness, and discipline, with results provided to commanders.

The Secretary of Defense will review security measures on military installations, focusing on barracks and multi-family residences to ensure the safety of Armed Forces members and their dependents. The review will identify security gaps and assess the feasibility of 24-hour electronic monitoring or security personnel at entry points. A report with study results, including cost estimates to address security gaps and provide 24-hour monitoring, must be submitted to Congress within 90 days of the Act's enactment.
