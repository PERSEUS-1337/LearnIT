The new law caused a sharp drop in filings in 2006, but numbers rose steadily until 2010. Household debt is mainly comprised of mortgage debt and consumer credit, with credit card debt and auto/college loans being the major components. Household debt is primarily made up of mortgage debt and consumer credit, with credit card debt and auto/college loans being the main components. Table 2 provides figures on household debt, showing that mortgage debt and consumer credit make up about 97% of all household indebtedness. The burden of debt service, which is the percentage of household disposable income used to repay loans, has fluctuated within a narrow range of 10.80% to 13.93% over the past decade. The increase in debt burden since the 1980s has been gradual and not significant. The debt burden figures in Table 2 have fluctuated within a narrow range of 10.80% to 13.93% over the past decade. Despite a gradual increase in debt since the 1980s, it does not explain the significant rise in personal bankruptcy filings. The stability of the debt burden amidst historically low interest rates suggests a rising ratio of debt to income. This ratio has been increasing faster than the debt burden, indicating a potential for further increases in bankruptcy filings. The rising ratio of debt to income, shown in Table 2, suggests potential future increases in bankruptcy filings if interest rates rise suddenly. Declining interest rates since 1980 have allowed households to take on more debt without a significant increase in interest payments. Variation in household debt levels is evident, with some families struggling to repay debt. Lower-income families face high levels of distress, as shown in Table 3 based on the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances. The data in Table 3 from the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances shows the percentages of families at various income levels devoting more than 40% of their income to debt service. Lower-income families are most likely to file for bankruptcy, while there is no clear rising trend in personal bankruptcy filings. The distress levels among all families remained relatively stable from 1998 to 2007, with an increase in upper-income families possibly due to increased mortgage debt during the housing boom. The reasons why many families with median or below income levels end up in bankruptcy court remain unclear. During the housing boom that ended in 2007, many families with median or below income levels took on high levels of debt, leading to bankruptcy court. The bankruptcy code was seen as too debtor-friendly, creating an incentive to borrow beyond their ability to repay. Lack of a consensus explanation for the rise in consumer bankruptcy filings suggests ongoing controversy. Household debt levels began to fall after the recession in 2007, but rose slightly in the second quarter of 2011. Household debt levels began to fall in various categories after the 2007 recession, with declines continuing for 11 quarters. Factors contributing to the decrease include households paying down debt, borrowing less, and lenders tightening credit standards. Mortgage debt saw the most significant drop due to modifications, foreclosures, and increased uncollectible debt. The issue of deleveraging remains controversial."
