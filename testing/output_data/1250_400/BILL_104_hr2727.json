    "content": "The \"Congressional Responsibility Act of 1995\" aims to ensure that legislative powers are solely held by Congress as per the Constitution. It requires regulations proposed by the executive branch to be approved by Congress before taking effect, promoting accountability and democracy. SEC. 3. ENACTMENT OF AGENCY REGULATIONS. Regulations cannot take effect without Congressional approval through a bill containing the regulation's text. Agencies must submit a report to Congress explaining the proposed regulation. SEC. 4. EXPEDITED CONGRESSIONAL PROCEDURES FOR AGENCY REGULATIONS. (a) Introduction.--Within three legislative days of an agency submitting a report under section 3(b), the Majority Leader of each House of Congress must introduce a bill containing the regulation's text. If the Majority Leader fails to do so, any Member of that House may introduce the bill. (b) Bill.--A bill under this section refers to a bill in Congress that approves agency regulations, giving them the force of law. (c) Referral and Consideration.--Such bills do not go to a committee and can be considered by any Member of the respective House the day after announcing their intention to do so. The bill introduced must be considered by any Member of the respective House the day after announcing their intention to do so. The motion to proceed to the consideration of the bill is highly privileged in the House of Representatives and privileged in the Senate, not debatable, and not subject to amendment. Debate on the bill is limited to one hour. The bill must be immediately considered without delay, remaining the unfinished business until disposed of. Debate is limited to one hour, with equal time for those in favor and those opposing. Amendments are not allowed, and motions to limit debate or reconsider the vote are not debatable. Appeals on procedural matters are decided without debate. A final vote on the bill must be taken within 60 days of its introduction. The procedure for a bill's consideration in Congress includes a final vote within 60 days of introduction. An exception allows for a motion to suspend certain rules with a majority vote. If both Houses receive identical bills, the receiving House must not refer it to a committee and can only consider it for final passage. Upon receipt of an identical bill from the other House, the receiving House must not refer it to a committee and can only consider it for final passage. The procedure for the bill in the receiving House remains the same as if no bill had been received, but the final passage vote will be on the bill from the other House. Once the bill from the other House is dealt with, the original bill in the receiving House cannot be considered further. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines \"agency\" and \"regulation\" in accordance with existing laws. SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act applies to agency regulations made after its enactment. SEC. 7. JUDICIAL REVIEW. Regulations in bills under this Act are not subject to judicial review as agency actions."
