This method is justified by the Sinkhorn approximation of the permanent and has been shown effective in probabilistic neuron identification in C.elegans. The problem of marginal inference for an exponential family is addressed by introducing Sinkhorn variational marginal inference, which approximates the matrix of expectations efficiently using the Sinkhorn operator. This method has been shown to produce the best results in probabilistic neuron identification in C.elegans. The Sinkhorn approximation is used for probabilistic inference of neural identity in C.elegans, based on the relation between marginal inference and the normalizing constant in exponential families. The optimization problem links marginal inference and computation of the permanent, providing an approximate solution for \u03c1. The optimization problem in (2.2) links marginal inference and computation of the permanent Z L. An approximate solution for \u03c1 is obtained by replacing the variational representation of Z L with a more tractable optimization problem. The quality of the approximation depends on the tightness of the approximation to Z L. The Sinkhorn permanent, perm S (L), is an approximation of the normalizing constant based on component-wise entropy. Bounds for this approximation are provided in the following proposition. The Sinkhorn approximation has been proposed independently, but without a theoretical framework. The Sinkhorn approximation has been proposed independently without a theoretical framework. The Bethe variational inference method provides a general rationale for obtaining variational approximations in graphical models. It has better theoretical guarantees than the Sinkhorn approximation and has been successfully applied to permutations. The Bethe approximation of the permanent has known bounds, but there are important computational differences. The Bethe approximation, with better theoretical guarantees than the Sinkhorn approximation, has known bounds for the permanent. Computational differences exist, with the Sinkhorn algorithm simpler than the belief propagation-like routine for the Bethe approximation. In practice, the Bethe approximation produces better permanent approximations, but the Sinkhorn approximation may produce qualitatively better marginals in some cases. The Sinkhorn approximation often produces qualitatively better marginals compared to the Bethe approximation, even though the Bethe approximation may have better permanents. Sinkhorn also scales better for moderate n, with faster iteration times. Comparison of the two approximations using submatrices from the C.elegans dataset showed differences in log permanents and mean absolute errors of log marginals. The histogram shows differences between approximate and true log permanents, as well as mean absolute errors of log marginals for two approximations. Sampling-based methods can be used for marginal inference, but practical appeal is limited. The C.elegans species has a stereotypical nervous system with a consistent number of neurons and connections. Recent neurotechnology advancements allow for studying how brain activity relates to behavior. Recent neurotechnology advancements enable whole brain imaging of the stereotypical C.elegans nervous system with roughly 300 neurons. A technical challenge is identifying neurons in volumetric images, which our methodology addresses by probabilistic neural identification in the context of NeuroPAL. This approach estimates probabilities for neuron identification, providing uncertainty estimates for more comprehensive model predictions. Neurons in C.elegans are represented as vectors in R6, aiming to estimate the matrix of marginal \u03c1 for probabilistic neural identification. This approach provides uncertainty estimates for model predictions, using a gaussian model for each canonical neuron. The likelihood of observing data Y is determined by a flat prior over P, inducing a posterior with the form of (1.1). In the context of NeuroPAL, the task involves computing approximate probabilistic neural identifies \u03c1. In the context of NeuroPAL, a posterior over P is defined with a deterministic coloring scheme for worm neurons. A downstream task involves manually labeling uncertain neurons to improve identification accuracy. Different approximation methods are compared, including Sinkhorn and Bethe approximations, MCMC, and random and naive baselines. Results are shown in Fig 3. The study compares different approximation methods for improving accuracy in neuron labeling tasks, including Sinkhorn and Bethe approximations, MCMC, and various baselines. Results show that Sinkhorn and Bethe approximations outperform other methods, with Sinkhorn slightly better. MCMC does not provide better results than the naive baseline, indicating convergence issues. The Sinkhorn and Bethe approximations outperform other methods in neuron labeling tasks, with Sinkhorn slightly better. MCMC does not provide better results than the naive baseline, suggesting convergence issues. The Sinkhorn approximation may offer faster and more accurate marginals than the Bethe approximation. Further analysis is needed to understand the relationship between permanent approximation quality and corresponding marginals. The study used positive vectors x, y to create diagonal matrices and obtained the Sinkhorn approximation of the permanent of L. The dataset included NeuroPAL worm heads with human labels and log-likelihood matrices. Sinkhorn and Bethe approximations were performed with 200 iterations each. MCMC sampling was done with 100 chains of length 1000. The study utilized MCMC sampling with 100 chains of length 1000 and implemented the message passing algorithm described in Vontobel (2013) for efficient log-space computation. Error bars were not included due to their insignificance."
