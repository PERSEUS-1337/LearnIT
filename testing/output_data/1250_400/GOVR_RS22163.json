    "content": "The transatlantic partnership between the United States and Europe is based on common values, shared goals, and overlapping interests. Both sides face challenges like economic concerns, terrorism, and armed conflict, and advocate for democracy, human rights, and free markets. Close cooperation is seen as essential as neither side can address global issues alone. The US and Europe also have a significant trade and investment relationship. This report highlights shared interests, cooperation, and challenges in the transatlantic relationship. The United States and Europe have a significant trade and investment relationship. The U.S. Congress frequently deals with European economic, security, and diplomatic issues. Members of Congress support a close transatlantic relationship and view organizations like the EU and NATO as advancing U.S. interests. Congressional interest in Europe has historical roots in countering the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The United States and Europe have a strong trade and investment relationship. The U.S. Congress supports the transatlantic relationship and values organizations like the EU and NATO for advancing U.S. interests. Congressional interest in Europe stems from historical roots in countering the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The institutional pillars of NATO and the EU have been successful in promoting prosperity and security in Europe, with strong support from the U.S. Congress and Administrations. The EU and NATO are valued by the U.S. Congress for promoting prosperity and security in Europe. The EU's significance has grown as it makes common decisions and policies across various areas. NATO remains a key security institution, with Congress maintaining a strong interest in it. Both organizations have seen significant changes over time. The EU and NATO have undergone significant changes in the past two decades. NATO, as the preeminent security institution, has added 12 new member states since the Cold War. Discussions within NATO have focused on its future role and capabilities, especially in light of the conflict in Ukraine and tensions with Russia. In 2014, leadership transitions occurred in both the EU and NATO, with EU-wide elections and the appointment of Jens Stoltenberg as the new NATO Secretary General. In 2014, leadership transitions occurred in Euro-Atlantic institutions. German MEP Martin Schulz was reelected as President of the European Parliament, Jens Stoltenberg became the new NATO Secretary General, and Jean-Claude Juncker took over as President of the European Commission. Federica Mogherini replaced Catherine Ashton as the EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs. Donald Tusk became the new President of the European Council. European perceptions of U.S. foreign policy under the Obama Administration remained relatively favorable. In December, Donald Tusk became the new President of the European Council, replacing Herman Van Rompuy. European perceptions of U.S. foreign policy under the Obama Administration remain favorable. Transatlantic relations have been mostly constructive over the past six years, with common approaches to global challenges. However, frustrations and reality checks have reminded both sides to be realistic about expectations. The crisis in Ukraine has caused U.S. policymakers to rethink European security assumptions. The United States continues to play a leading role in NATO. After the Obama Administration announced a \"re-balancing\" of U.S. foreign policy towards Asia in 2012, Europeans expressed anxiety about the U.S. pulling back from Europe. The crisis in Ukraine has led U.S. policymakers to reassess European security assumptions. The U.S. hopes Europe will share the burden of its own security, take a leading role in regional and international issues, and continue to be an effective partner in addressing common threats. Concerns remain about Europe's economic difficulties, declining defense spending, and questions about its ability to deliver a coherent foreign policy. Europe's economic difficulties, declining defense spending, and questions about its ability to deliver a coherent foreign policy are concerns for U.S. officials assessing the long-term dimensions of transatlantic cooperation. The European financial crisis highlighted tensions between EU member states and raised unresolved questions about further EU integration. The perceived inability of Europe's mainstream parties to solve economic and social problems has also been a factor. The European financial crisis highlighted tensions between EU member states and raised unresolved questions about further EU integration. Anti-establishment backlash among European voters has led to the rise of populist parties advocating far-right and far-left policies, many of which are anti-EU to some degree. \"Euro-skeptic\" parties won a significant portion of votes in the May 2014 European Parliament election, and the trend will be further tested in upcoming national elections in various European countries. The rise of \"Euro-skeptic\" parties in the European Parliament election of May 2014 has led to concerns about political instability, economic struggles, and growing skepticism about the EU. The upcoming national elections in several European countries, including the UK, could have major implications for EU membership. Additionally, the deteriorating relations between the US, Europe, and Russia due to the crisis in Ukraine have transformed Russia from a strategic partner to a strategic problem. The crisis in Ukraine has strained relations between the US, Europe, and Russia since 2014. Russia's actions have shifted its status from a strategic partner to a strategic problem for policymakers. Despite past efforts to improve relations, tensions remain due to historical conflicts and differing views on NATO and missile defense. Relations between the US and Russia deteriorated despite initial efforts to improve ties during the Obama Administration. Cooperation on Afghanistan and Iran improved, but tensions persisted over issues like Georgia's independence recognition and Russia's actions in Europe. Criticism of Russia's elections and human rights violations further strained relations, leading to backlash from Moscow. Russia's opposition to US and European foreign policy, including NATO, escalated tensions. Putin's return to the presidency led to a negative reaction from Russia towards the US Congress adopting the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012. Russia's opposition to US and European foreign policy, support for Bashar al-Assad in Syria, and interference in Ukraine's political crisis strained relations with the West. The conflict in Ukraine in 2013 marked a turning point, leading to the lowest point in US and European relations with Russia in decades. In 2014, Ukraine's President Yanukovych reversed course on an EU agreement, leading to protests and his ousting. A new pro-Western government was formed, and Russia annexed Crimea, justifying it as protecting Russian inhabitants and responding to the will of the population in Crimea. The annexation and a referendum are not internationally recognized. The annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014, following the ousting of Ukraine's President Yanukovych, was justified as protecting Russian inhabitants and responding to the will of the population in Crimea. The annexation and a referendum are not internationally recognized, leading to sanctions against Crimean and Russian individuals. The conflict in eastern Ukraine since April 2014 has resulted in over 4,300 deaths, with evidence of Russian military involvement and support to separatists. The conflict in eastern Ukraine has continued despite a ceasefire agreed to in September. The United States and Western governments assert clear evidence of Russian military involvement with separatists, including providing heavy weapons. U.S.-European coordination in response to Russia's actions has been strong, with aligned analyses and extensive sanctions. The EU expanded sanctions after the shooting down of MH17 in 2014. Russia denies providing more than political and humanitarian support to separatists. The EU expanded sanctions on Russia beyond individuals and specific entities to target wider sectors of the economy after the shooting down of MH17 in 2014, leading to debates over the economic value and political influence of relationships with Russia. Despite some skepticism, all 28 EU member states unanimously adopted the measures. The EU adopted sectoral sanctions against Russia in response to the shooting down of MH17 in 2014. Despite initial skepticism, all 28 EU member states unanimously agreed on the sanctions, viewing them as a necessary political message to Russia. The sanctions are reviewed monthly and require unanimous consensus for renewal. Russia's economy has since entered a recession, with analysts attributing this to a drop in oil prices and Western sanctions. The impact of sanctions on Russia's foreign policy remains uncertain. Russia's economy has suffered from a weakened ruble, high inflation, and a drop in oil prices. Western sanctions are also believed to be a factor. The impact of sanctions on Russia's foreign policy is unclear, with speculation about their next steps in eastern Ukraine. In January 2015, the EU proposed easing sanctions if Russia complies with the ceasefire agreement, but combat in eastern Ukraine led to a backtrack on this idea. Mogherini proposed easing sanctions on Russia if they comply with the ceasefire agreement in Ukraine. However, combat in eastern Ukraine in January 2015 caused a backtrack on this idea. U.S. and European relations with Russia are expected to remain a central topic as policymakers assess Russia's foreign policy intentions. Members of Congress may consider adopting additional sanctions or cooperating with European counterparts on this issue. Members of Congress may cooperate with European counterparts to adopt additional sanctions or deterrents related to Ukraine. They may also explore ways to support Ukraine, including providing financial aid and military assistance. The EU has signed an Association Agreement with Ukraine and plans to offer substantial financial support. The US has provided non-lethal aid and a loan guarantee to Ukraine, with discussions ongoing about potentially providing lethal weapons in the future. The US and EU have provided financial assistance to Ukraine, with the US considering providing lethal weapons in the future. Developments in Ukraine have sparked debates about NATO's role in European defense. The US response to Russian aggression in Europe includes the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI), which involves troop rotations and pre-positioning military equipment in Eastern Europe. Congress allocated $810 million for the initiative in December 2014. The European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) extends reassurance measures by the United States in Eastern Europe, including troop rotations and pre-positioning military equipment. The U.S. military presence in Europe related to ERI is rotational, with no plans to permanently increase personnel. Despite plans to close 15 bases in Europe, the overall U.S. force level is expected to remain around 67,000 personnel. Concerns about declining European defense budgets and a growing transatlantic military capabilities gap could undermine NATO unity. European defense budgets are declining, leading to a growing transatlantic military capabilities gap that could undermine NATO unity. European militaries lack important capabilities like strategic air- and sealift, aerial refueling, and intelligence. NATO's \"Smart Defense\" initiative aims to address this issue, but results have been limited. The alliance's relevance depends on its ability to conduct out-of-area operations, while some members prefer focusing on collective territorial defense. The 2010 NATO summit adopted the latest Strategic Concept, outlining three core tasks: collective defense, crisis management, and cooperative security. NATO's primary role is ensuring collective defense and security, but member states are urged to develop capabilities for expeditionary operations and address unconventional security challenges like terrorism and cybersecurity. However, public opposition to combat operations, political will, and resource shortages may make Europe less willing to engage in such operations. In the aftermath of Afghanistan, analysts believe Europe may be less willing to engage in large-scale overseas missions due to public opposition, political will, and resource shortages. Some European countries are increasingly concerned about the threat posed by Russia, with calls for permanent basing of U.S. and NATO forces in countries like Poland and the Baltic states. The European Reassurance Initiative includes rotating forces, increased exercises, and pre-positioning of assets to bolster security in the region, such as tripling the number of fighter aircraft in the Baltic Air Policing mission. At NATO's 2014 Summit in Wales, member countries agreed to a \"Readiness Action Plan\" to bolster security in Central and Eastern Europe. This plan includes enhanced infrastructure, pre-positioning of equipment, and the establishment of a Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF) with 4,000 soldiers capable of deploying within days to respond to threats. The Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF) is a specialized arm of the NATO Response Force with 4,000 soldiers capable of rapid deployment to counter threats. NATO leaders at the Wales Summit also committed to increasing defense spending to 2% of national GDP within a decade. European energy security concerns have grown due to the EU's reliance on Russian gas imports, with Moscow using energy supplies as a tool for foreign policy leverage. European countries heavily rely on Russian gas imports, with some countries depending on Russia for one-third of their gas imports and one-quarter of their total gas and oil supplies. Russia has been using energy supplies as a tool for foreign policy leverage, seeking bilateral energy deals with European countries and acquiring ownership of European energy infrastructure. Concerns have been raised about Russia's lack of transparency and market reciprocity in business practices. The possibility of gas cutoffs, as seen in past disputes with Ukraine, has also raised concerns among countries dependent on Russian gas. U.S. officials and Members of Congress view European energy security as a U.S. interest, fearing the influence of Russian energy dominance on transatlantic unity. European countries heavily rely on Russian gas imports, with concerns raised about Russia's use of energy supplies for foreign policy leverage. The United States has encouraged EU member states to reduce energy dependence on Russia through diversification of supply. However, challenges exist in diversifying energy sources, with North Africa and Central Asia seen as potential alternatives but facing obstacles such as political instability and Russian interference in pipeline development. European countries face challenges in diversifying energy sources due to political and economic instability in the region hindering the expansion of their role. Russia has worked to prevent the development of alternative pipelines linking Europe directly to Central Asian suppliers. European leaders are working on a common energy strategy, including initiatives to liberalize and integrate the internal energy market. Recent events in Ukraine and Crimea have increased the urgency for these efforts, leading to the development of LNG terminals and expanded pipeline interconnectivity to mitigate potential crises. Several European countries have taken steps to enhance energy security, including building LNG terminals, expanding pipeline interconnectivity, and proposing an EU \"energy union\" for gas purchases. Legislation aimed at increasing competition and transparency in the energy sector has been met with criticism from Russia. Russia has criticized legislation aimed at introducing competition and transparency in the energy sector by unbundling gas production ownership and requiring an independent operator for transit systems. This led to the cancellation of the South Stream project in 2014, seen as a response to EU obstacles and criticism of Russia's actions in Ukraine. Russia is now diversifying its gas markets by making deals with China and Turkey. Russia is diversifying its gas markets by making deals with China and Turkey. The United States and Europe are leading a coalition to combat the Islamic State organization through military action in Iraq and Syria. European countries have also provided support through trainers, advisers, weapons, and humanitarian aid. European countries have pledged support in coalition airstrikes against IS in Iraq, providing trainers, advisers, weapons, and humanitarian aid to Kurdish forces. European military action against IS has been limited to Iraq due to political and legal challenges in Syria. The EU has condemned the Assad government in Syria and imposed sanctions, recognizing the Syrian National Coalition as the legitimate representative of the Syrian people. The EU imposed sanctions on the Assad government's economic base and recognized the Syrian National Coalition as the legitimate representative of the Syrian people. Concerns about Europe's vulnerability to terrorism were heightened after the 2015 Paris attacks, leading to raids to break up an Islamic State-linked terrorist cell in Belgium. European governments are worried about \"foreign fighters\" from Europe joining conflicts in Syria and Iraq. European governments are concerned about \"foreign fighters\" from Europe joining conflicts in Syria and Iraq. Estimates suggest there may be 3,000 to 5,000 individuals from EU countries involved. Authorities fear these fighters may return home with extremist views and skills to carry out terrorist attacks in Europe. Some experts question the extent of the threat, noting that not all fighters intend to return or commit attacks. Security measures are being implemented to address these concerns. European governments are taking measures to address security concerns related to foreign fighters from Europe joining conflicts in Syria and Iraq. These measures include increasing surveillance, combating terrorist recruitment, and prohibiting travel. However, challenges remain in stemming the flow of fighters and tracking those who go and return. An EU-wide approach has been hindered by differing views among member states and institutions. European governments are facing challenges in addressing security concerns related to European fighters joining conflicts in Syria and Iraq. The EU's efforts to strengthen counterterrorism capabilities have been hindered by differing views among member states and institutions, including issues with intelligence-sharing, data privacy, and civil liberties. The Paris attacks have sparked new debates on enhancing security and surveillance powers, with a proposal for an EU airline passenger name record system gaining traction. Transatlantic cooperation on counterterrorism has been strong since the 9/11 attacks. The European Parliament has been considering the creation of an EU airline passenger name record (PNR) system since April 2013. Transatlantic cooperation on counterterrorism has been robust since 9/11, with agreements on extradition, mutual legal assistance, container security, and sharing airline passenger data. The US and EU collaborate on tracking and countering terrorism financing through forums like the Financial Action Task Force and the U.S.-EU \"SWIFT agreement.\" The EU and US collaborate on counterterrorism efforts, including tracking terrorism financing through forums like the Financial Action Task Force and the U.S.-EU \"SWIFT agreement.\" However, there are concerns over data privacy safeguards in information-sharing arrangements, delaying the adoption of agreements like the SWIFT deal and airline passenger data sharing. The EU and US collaborate on counterterrorism efforts, with concerns over data privacy safeguards delaying agreements like the SWIFT deal and airline passenger data sharing. The EU has strict regulations protecting personal data and has been negotiating a Data Privacy and Protection Agreement with the US since 2011. The EU added Hezbollah's military wing to its terrorist list in 2013, but critics argue that listing only the military wing is insufficient. In 2014, the General Court of the European Union ruled that Hamas should be removed from the EU's list of designated terrorist organizations. In December 2014, the General Court of the European Union ruled that Hamas should be removed from the EU's common list of designated terrorist organizations on procedural grounds. The EU External Action Service stated that the ruling was not a political decision, and restrictive measures against Hamas will remain in place. The United States and Israel urged the EU to maintain sanctions against Hamas. Members of Congress have shown ongoing interest in international efforts to ensure Iran's nuclear program is used for peaceful purposes, with Europe playing a central role in these efforts. Members of Congress have shown ongoing interest in U.S. and international efforts to ensure Iran's nuclear program is used for peaceful purposes. Europe has played a central role in these efforts, with close cooperation between the U.S. and EU in negotiating with Iran. The EU has gone beyond UN sanctions to impose its own sanctions on Iran, including an oil embargo in 2012. This shift by the EU has aligned U.S. and European sanctions policies on Iran. The EU's shift towards imposing sanctions on Iran, including an oil embargo in 2012, has aligned U.S. and European sanctions policies. These sanctions include restrictions on various sectors, financial transactions, and individuals involved in Iran's nuclear program. The concerted efforts of the U.S., EU, and other international partners have successfully isolated Iran and generated economic pressure, leading to a shift in Iran's position on its nuclear program. Following the election of Hassan Rouhani as the president of Iran in June 2013, tensions eased to some degree, leading to the P5+1 and Iran agreeing to a Joint Plan of Action (JPA) in November 2013. The JPA outlines a path towards a comprehensive agreement on Iran's nuclear program, requiring Iran to freeze certain activities and cooperate with enhanced monitoring by the IAEA in exchange for limited sanctions relief. Relief measures include allowing Iran to repatriate $700 million per month from oil sales and suspending certain trade restrictions. The Joint Plan of Action (JPA) was agreed upon by the P5+1 and Iran in November 2013, requiring Iran to freeze certain activities and cooperate with IAEA monitoring in exchange for limited sanctions relief. Relief measures include allowing Iran to repatriate $700 million per month from oil sales and suspending certain trade restrictions. The terms of the JPA have been extended twice, with negotiations ongoing to reach a final agreement. Concerns remain about Iran's nuclear capabilities and regional influence. The EU-3 foreign ministers and EU High Representative oppose new U.S. sanctions during Iran nuclear negotiations, fearing it could disrupt talks. The U.S., EU, Russia, and UN are part of a quartet mediating the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, advocating for a two-state solution. Talks have been unsuccessful, with recent conflicts between Israel and Hamas in 2014. European officials have long urged greater U.S. engagement in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for a sustainable two-state solution. Recent developments in Europe's approach, including Sweden's recognition of a Palestinian state and non-binding resolutions by several European countries, have raised concerns in Israel about international isolation. Israeli Foreign Minister Lieberman identified growing European support for Palestinians as a top diplomatic challenge. France and Luxembourg supported a UN Security Council draft resolution at the end of 2014. Sweden recognized a Palestinian state in 2014, followed by non-binding resolutions from other European countries. Concerns in Israel include potential economic repercussions from the EU, international debates on Palestinian statehood, and possible ICC investigations. EU restrictions on funding Israeli organizations in certain areas have also been a point of contention. Investigations of Israelis' actions in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, potential EU measures such as funding restrictions and product labeling, and discussions on restarting peace talks without sanctions or significant economic threats to Israel. EU may offer financial incentives and upgraded ties in case of a successful peace agreement. The EU may provide financial incentives and an upgrade in ties to Israel and the Palestinians to motivate peace talks. The United States and the European Union have a significant trade and investment relationship, generating $5 trillion annually and supporting 15 million jobs. Trade between the two entities totaled $787 billion in 2013, with U.S. companies investing heavily in Europe and vice versa. The U.S. and EU together make up 50% of global GDP and 40% in purchasing power. The total assets of European affiliates in the United States were approximately $8.7 trillion in 2012, with U.S. corporate assets in Europe totaling over $13 trillion. The transatlantic economic relationship between the United States and the EU is the most influential globally, shaping standards and regulations. Negotiations for a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) have been ongoing since July 2013, aiming to boost jobs and growth on both sides of the Atlantic by reducing tariffs and non-tariff barriers. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) aims to boost jobs and growth on both sides of the Atlantic by reducing tariffs and non-tariff barriers. Harmonizing regulations and standards could help define global standards, with hopes to initial a draft agreement by the end of 2015. However, European political and public opposition to TTIP increased in 2014, posing obstacles to the agreement. Many Europeans are concerned about the possible effects of TTIP on issues such as data privacy and food labeling with regard to geographic protections of items such as Champagne, Black Forest ham, and Cornish pasties. Critics have raised objections that could pose obstacles to the agreement, particularly regarding the inclusion of provisions for investor-state dispute settlement. Congress is considering whether to reauthorize Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) on the U.S. side. Many Europeans are concerned about the effects of TTIP on data privacy and food labeling, including protections for items like Champagne and Black Forest ham. Congress is considering reauthorizing Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) on the U.S. side, which is necessary for major trade agreements. The Eurozone crisis dominated European politics from 2010 to 2012, raising doubts about the sustainability of the monetary union without fiscal union. The Eurozone crisis in European politics demanded much attention from leaders. Doubts were raised about the sustainability of the monetary union without fiscal union. Despite prolonged debates and disagreements, leaders took unprecedented steps to address the crisis, including tightening fiscal rules and creating rescue funds. Market confidence improved since 2013, but analysts remain skeptical that the crisis is definitively over. Market confidence has improved considerably since 2013, but doubts remain about the Eurozone crisis being definitively over. Analysts question the effectiveness of national austerity efforts and economic reform programs due to low growth and high unemployment. Economic growth forecasts for 2015 are 1.4% in the EU and 1.1% in the Eurozone, with unemployment expected to be 10% in the EU and 11.2% in the Eurozone. Concerns about long-term economic stagnation in Europe have been raised. The EU faces potential economic challenges, with concerns about long-term stagnation. The ECB announced a stimulus program to address these issues. US growth has been resilient despite Eurozone difficulties. Tensions over NSA surveillance strained the transatlantic relationship. The NSA surveillance programs in the US and Europe created tensions in the transatlantic relationship in 2013. Reports alleged spying on EU offices and German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone. Concerns arose about the extent of US surveillance, involvement of European intelligence services, and the balance between security and privacy rights. This has potentially damaged transatlantic trust and affected political, security, and economic ties between the US and Europe. The NSA surveillance programs in the US and Europe raised concerns about the extent of US surveillance, involvement of European intelligence services, and the balance between security and privacy rights. Many European leaders and citizens were dismayed by the reports, fearing violations of privacy rights and compromising the security of personal data. Criticism was strongest in Germany due to the broad scope of disclosed NSA activities and historical sensitivities to government surveillance. The fallout from the reports could impact US-European cooperation on counterterrorism and data privacy agreements. The fallout from the NSA surveillance programs in the US and Europe could impact US-European cooperation on counterterrorism and data privacy agreements, with implications for the renewal of SWIFT and passenger name record agreements. The European Parliament called for the suspension of the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor agreement and expressed concerns about U.S. surveillance activities affecting economic relations. However, some analysts believe tensions are manageable and do not pose a sustained threat to the transatlantic relationship. The fallout from NSA surveillance programs may impact US-European cooperation on counterterrorism and data privacy agreements, including the proposed TTIP. Some analysts believe tensions are manageable and do not pose a sustained threat to the transatlantic relationship. European leaders' outrage may be for domestic consumption, as they are aware of their own security services' surveillance activities. Cooperation between US and European intelligence services continues despite political trust issues. The diminishment of Arctic sea ice has increased human activities in the region and sparked interest in its future. Cooperation between U.S. and European intelligence and security services remains strong despite political trust issues. The melting Arctic ice has led to increased human activities in the region, impacting fisheries, tourism, research, and resource exploration. The United States will chair the Arctic Council in 2015, addressing various issues in the Arctic region. The United States will take over the chairmanship of the Arctic Council in May 2015, a forum for cooperation in the Arctic region among eight countries. While the Council focuses on environmental issues, the Arctic is gaining geopolitical significance with discussions on military presence in the region. The Arctic Council, chaired by the United States in 2015, focuses on environmental issues but also discusses military presence in the region. Coastal states show willingness to establish military presence, while Russia and China are expanding their interests. NATO has no consensus on Arctic involvement, and tensions over Ukraine could impact Arctic cooperation. EU and other countries hold observer status in the Council. The Arctic Council, chaired by the United States in 2015, focuses on environmental issues and military presence in the region. European countries and other nations hold observer status. The U.S. appointed Admiral Robert J. Papp, Jr. as the first U.S. Special Representative for the Arctic, leading the 2015-2017 chairmanship with a focus on stewardship, climate change, and economic issues. The U.S. chairmanship of the Arctic Council in 2015, led by Admiral Papp, focuses on stewardship, climate change, and economic issues. The theme is \"One Arctic, With Shared Opportunities, Challenges, Responsibilities.\" Priorities include governance of the Arctic Ocean and collaboration with the Arctic Economic Council."
