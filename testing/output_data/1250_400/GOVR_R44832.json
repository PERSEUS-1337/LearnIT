    "content": "Prescription drug affordability has become a major concern due to the rise in retail drug spending, driven by new drug introductions and price increases. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services predict a 6.3% annual growth in drug spending from 2017 to 2026, outpacing other medical spending areas. This report will address government and private-sector policies affecting drug prices and availability, including federally funded research, direct-to-consumer advertising regulation, reimportation restrictions, and federal price negotiation. The report addresses government and private-sector policies affecting drug prices and availability, including federally funded research, direct-to-consumer advertising regulation, reimportation restrictions, and federal price negotiation. The National Health Expenditures data track annual spending on prescription drugs in retail settings, totaling $328.6 billion in 2016. The United States spent $328.6 billion on prescription drugs in 2016 and is forecasted to spend $338.1 billion in 2017, accounting for 10% of predicted national health care spending. Prescription drug spending is expected to increase to 11% by 2027. Retail drug spending has ranged from 5% to 10% of total health care expenditures since 1960. The data do not include drugs dispensed in institutions or over-the-counter products. The NHE data on retail drug sales do not provide a complete picture of U.S. drug spending. Various studies estimate total U.S. prescription drug spending, including retail and institutional use. Different forecasts show a trend of increasing spending in recent years, with retail drug spending growing at a double-digit pace in the 1980s to early 2000s, slowing to a 5% annual growth rate from 2003 to 2013. Retail prescription drug spending in the U.S. has varied over the years, with a double-digit growth rate in the 1980s to early 2000s, slowing to 5% from 2003 to 2013. However, spending accelerated in 2014 with a 12.4% increase, followed by 8.9% in 2015, and a forecasted 2.9% in 2017. Projected growth is expected to be around 6.3% annually through 2027, driven by faster drug price growth, especially for specialty drugs. Retail drug spending is projected to grow by about 6.3% annually through 2027, driven by faster drug price growth, particularly for specialty drugs. The growth rate is expected to outpace other areas of health care spending, with physician services and hospital care projected to grow at 5% and 5.5% on average, respectively. Congressional hearings have been held to address the sharp increases in drug prices and overall spending, with factors such as changes in drug availability, pricing, and usage impacting retail prescription drug spending. Retail prescription drug spending can be affected by changes in drug availability, pricing, and usage. Factors driving the rapid increase in drug spending include the introduction of new high-cost drugs, price increases for existing drugs, and the impact of generic substitution. The implementation of the ACA also contributed to increased drug demand. Despite an overall rise in drug utilization, the rate of prescription drug spending slowed in 2016 due to fewer new drug approvals, decreased use of high-cost drugs, and reduced spending on diabetes treatments. New, innovator brand-name drugs are typically more expensive than older drugs, impacting the drug mix and overall spending. In recent years, there has been a decrease in the use of high-cost hepatitis C drugs and a slowdown in spending on diabetes treatments. The introduction of new, expensive specialty drugs for various conditions has contributed to the overall rise in prescription drug spending. The impact of new hepatitis C drugs on spending is diminishing as fewer new patients are being treated. The introduction of expensive specialty drugs, particularly hepatitis C drugs, significantly increased drug spending in 2014 and 2015. However, the impact of these drugs is diminishing as fewer new patients are treated and prices drop. Generic substitution has played a smaller role in reducing drug spending since 2009, when patents for many brand-name drugs expired. The development of biologics, with high introductory prices and limited alternatives, will continue to impact drug spending in the future. Annual savings from brands losing patent protection has decreased, with changes in drug mix playing a key role in future spending. The FDA has approved biosimilar substitutes for biologics, but they are not significantly lower-priced. Prescription drug prices have risen faster than overall inflation since 2014, but the gap narrowed in 2017. Drug inflation is mainly driven by price increases for existing brand-name drugs. In 2014, U.S. retail drug inflation was 6.4%, compared to general consumer inflation of 0.8%. Drug prices rose 6.2% in 2016 and 2.8% in 2017, driven by price increases for brand-name and new innovator drugs. Generic drug prices remained stable. ACA expansion boosted demand for prescription drugs. The rise in brand-name drug prices by 10.7% from 2015 to 2016 was offset by an 8.7% decline in generic drug prices. Biologics and specialty drugs drove much of the brand-name drug price inflation. The ACA expansion increased demand for prescription drugs through tax credits and required coverage in health plans. Medicaid coverage expansion under the ACA also contributed to increased drug spending. The aging population, particularly those aged 50 and older, accounted for a significant portion of dispensed prescriptions in 2016. The ACA changes to Medicaid in 2014 led to an 8% increase in Medicaid prescription drug claims and a 20% rise in spending. Patients aged 50 and older accounted for 70% of dispensed prescriptions in 2016. Out-of-pocket spending for prescriptions declined from 57% in 1990 to 13.2% in 2017, with a forecast of 12.1% in 2026. Commercial payers and taxpayer-funded health programs cover a growing share of retail drug costs. Out-of-pocket spending for prescriptions has decreased over the years, accounting for 13.2% in 2017 and forecasted to be 12.1% in 2026. Health plans have been increasing cost sharing for prescription drugs, with a rise in drug deductibles and the use of formulary tiered pricing. Consumers may still face high out-of-pocket expenses depending on factors like insurance coverage and drug discounts. From 2012 to 2015, the share of commercial health plans with a prescription drug deductible doubled to 46%. Drug deductibles are common in ACA state exchange plans, along with formulary tiered pricing and coinsurance for expensive drugs. The widening price differential between tiers places a greater financial burden on consumers. Despite cost-sharing increases, the ACA has helped moderate out-of-pocket spending by capping annual costs and reducing some cost-sharing expenses. The average co-payment for high-priced tier-four drugs was $110, while tier-one generic drugs had an $11 co-payment. Cost-sharing increases were partially offset by ACA regulations, such as capping annual out-of-pocket spending and reducing costs for certain medications. Pharmaceutical companies have provided assistance through discount coupons and patient assistance programs. Generic drug usage has increased, leading to a decline in average out-of-pocket spending for retail drugs. However, the number of consumers facing high out-of-pocket costs, especially for specialty drugs, has risen. The number of consumers facing high out-of-pocket costs for specialty drugs has increased in recent years. A 2016 study found that while average out-of-pocket spending for prescription drugs has declined, nearly 3% of enrollees had costs exceeding $1,000 in 2014. The share of people with high drug costs has tripled since 2004, with median out-of-pocket spending for outpatient specialty drugs rising by 46% from 2003 to 2014. Despite a decrease in per person out-of-pocket spending for retail prescription drugs from 2010 to 2016, it is forecasted to gradually increase to $207 by 2026. Out-of-pocket spending for retail prescription drugs declined from $146 in 2010 to $140 in 2016, with a forecast to decrease to $137 in 2017 and then increase to $207 by 2026. Government share of U.S. retail prescription drug spending rose from 25% in 2005 to an estimated 44.1% in 2017, and is projected to reach 47% by 2026. Unlike other countries, the U.S. does not have a centralized system for government-sponsored drug benefits. Government spending on prescription drugs in the U.S. has been increasing, with the government's share rising from 25% in 2005 to an estimated 44.1% in 2017 and projected to reach 47% by 2026. Unlike other countries, the U.S. does not have a centralized system for government-sponsored drug benefits, leading to various decentralized systems for drug discount and procurement. The FDA regulates drug safety and effectiveness but does not have the authority to set drug prices. Federal agencies can secure discounts for prescription drugs, but the discounts vary widely among different programs. The FDA does not have the authority to set drug prices or consider them during the approval process. Federal agencies can secure discounts for prescription drugs, but the discounts vary widely among different programs. Legislation has been introduced to give the HHS Secretary more power to negotiate Medicare Part D drug prices. The federal government oversees prescription purchasing systems for Medicare Part D, Medicare Part B, Medicaid, and the Veterans Health Administration. Medicare Part D operates as a market-oriented program where plan sponsors negotiate drug rebates and discounts with manufacturers. Congress has debated the effectiveness of this market-based model. The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 created Medicare Part D with a noninterference provision, prohibiting the HHS Secretary from intervening in negotiations. Congress has debated the effectiveness of the market-based model in controlling drug prices and enrollee costs, with some pointing to lower program spending and higher drug rebates. However, studies have shown that Part D plans have higher average drug prices compared to Medicaid. Some lawmakers propose modifying the noninterference provision in Medicare Part D to allow the Secretary to negotiate drug prices, leveraging the purchasing power of Medicare beneficiaries. In 2007, a bill was introduced but not approved by the Senate, as it was deemed to produce minimal savings without additional regulatory actions. The Secretary was proposed to negotiate Part D drug prices without formulary creation, but the bill was not approved by the Senate. A CBO analysis suggested minimal savings unless the Secretary could set prices administratively or take regulatory actions. Patient groups opposed giving more control over the formulary, fearing reduced drug coverage. Various bills were introduced to modify the noninterference provision, with proposals from the Obama and Trump Administrations for negotiating drug prices and rebates. Lawmakers also suggested moving some Part B drugs to Part D for better pricing negotiation. The Trump Administration recommended additional approaches for cost savings in prescription drugs, such as passing on more negotiated rebates to enrollees and moving some Part B drugs to Part D. Lawmakers have introduced legislation to apply Medicaid's rebates to Part D drugs for low-income enrollees, which could lower costs initially but may lead to price increases over time. State governments regulate drug pricing and offer patient assistance programs for low-income residents. State governments regulate prescription drug use and pricing, administer Medicaid, and offer health insurance plans. Some states have patient assistance programs for low-income residents. Various approaches are used to address drug spending, including limiting costs for high-priced drugs and requiring price transparency. Laws in California, Delaware, and Vermont aim to control drug prices by setting cost-sharing caps and requiring manufacturer disclosure for large price increases. Manufacturers must justify price hikes to the state attorney general under Vermont's law. The Vermont act requires drug manufacturers to justify large price increases to the state attorney general. Other states are also implementing laws to control drug prices, such as prohibiting gag clauses in pharmacy contracts and allowing importation of prescription drugs from other countries. The United States spends more on prescription drugs compared to other industrialized nations, with projections showing an increase in global drug spending share by 2021. The United States spends more on prescription drugs than other industrialized nations, with projections showing an increase in global drug spending share by 2021. U.S. per capita spending for retail prescription drugs was significantly higher than the OECD average in 2015. Studies have found large price differences for specific drugs between the U.S. and other countries, with U.S. prices often double that of the European Union. Various reasons have been suggested for the higher U.S. spending and prices. The U.S. spends more on prescription drugs than other countries, with prices often double that of the European Union. Reasons for higher U.S. spending include faster adoption of new drugs and market exclusivity. Other countries use government-run health care systems with price limits, while some use external reference pricing or value-based pricing. Reference pricing involves using the price of a medicine in one country to set a benchmark for pricing in another country. National health programs may use value-based pricing, which determines payment based on a drug's effectiveness. In Canada, the Common Drug Review evaluates new and existing drugs for reimbursement. In the U.S., there are experiments with alternative pricing models, such as discounts for drugs that do not meet health improvement goals. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) is involved in research on pricing strategies. The insurer will receive discounts if certain drugs do not meet health improvement goals. CMS encourages value-based purchasing in state Medicaid programs. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) produces reports on drug effectiveness and cost. Pharmaceutical industry concerned about research limiting reimbursement and patient access to treatments. Federal government focuses on basic research, while industry funds clinical trials. The federal government focuses on basic research, while the pharmaceutical industry funds clinical trials. Studies have tried to quantify the contribution of publicly funded research to new drug discovery, with only a small percentage originating from non-industry sources. Between 1990 and 1999, only 6.7% of new drugs approved by the FDA originated from sources other than private industry. A study in 2010 found that 24.1% of new molecular entities and biologics approved between 1998 and 2007 were publicly funded. Another study in 2011 revealed that 9.3% of drugs approved from 1990 to 2007 resulted from work in publicly funded labs. The Stevens study in 2011 found that 9.3% of drugs approved by the FDA from 1990 to 2007 resulted from publicly funded research. Of the total drug applications, 19% from publicly funded labs received priority review, compared to 20% from private-sector research. Priority review is for drugs with significant improvements in safety or effectiveness. PSRIs tend to discover drugs with important clinical effects. The 2011 Stevens study found that publicly funded research institutions (PSRIs) tend to discover drugs with important clinical effects. The study excluded the role of PSRIs in developing platform technologies that led to the development of new drug classes approved by the FDA. The study excluded platform technologies developed with public funds, such as recombinant DNA technology and methods for producing antibodies. Public funding was found to contribute to every new drug approved by the FDA from 2010 to 2016, highlighting the significant impact of NIH funding on drug development. A 2018 study found that public funding from NIH was associated with every new drug approved by the FDA from 2010 to 2016. The study revealed that up to 20% of the NIH budget allocation, around $100 billion, contributed to research on new drugs. This suggests that the NIH's role in new drug development is greater than previously thought. Pharmaceutical companies disclose overall research spending, but specific drug development costs are not typically available. The cost of developing a new FDA-approved prescription drug is estimated to be $2.6 billion, including $1.4 billion in clinical spending and $1.2 billion in time costs. Academic studies have attempted to estimate average spending for drug development, with the most often-cited study by the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development. According to a 2014 Tufts estimate, the cost of developing an FDA-approved prescription drug is $2.6 billion, including $1.4 billion in clinical spending and $1.2 billion in time costs. Academic and government research has challenged the assumptions made in the Tufts study, questioning factors such as the rate of return, drug sampling, and the impact of federal tax breaks on research and development spending. A 2016 HHS study noted that estimates for new drug development range from $1.2 billion to $2.6 billion and are highly sensitive to various factors. Transparency legislation is being debated in Congress to address these issues. The cost estimates for new drug development range from $1.2 billion to $2.6 billion and are influenced by factors like development time, cost of capital, and inclusion of orphan drugs. Price transparency legislation aims to compel drugmakers to disclose research, marketing, and other costs for high-priced drugs. Research costs may not always be the primary factor in drug pricing, as seen in specific cases like Gilead Pharmaceutical's hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni. A 2015 Senate Finance Committee investigation found that Gilead Pharmaceutical's pricing strategy for hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni focused on maximizing revenue rather than research and development costs. Similarly, Pfizer's pricing of the breast cancer drug Ibrance considered factors like existing drug prices and reimbursement. The United States allows direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs, regulated by the FDA to ensure accuracy and balance of information. Pharmaceutical companies in the United States can deduct advertising expenses, including direct-to-consumer (DTC) ads for prescription drugs, as ordinary business expenses. DTC advertising is regulated by the FDA to ensure accuracy and balance of information. In addition to DTC ads, pharmaceutical firms also market to healthcare providers through various channels. FDA has had authority over prescription drug advertising since 1962, with regulations requiring truthful and balanced information in ads. Pharmaceutical advertising has evolved since 1962 when FDA gained authority over prescription drug advertising. DTC prescription drug advertising expanded steadily, reaching over $5 billion in 2006. Advertising dipped during the 2007 recession but rebounded in 2014. Recent data shows a rapid increase in DTC advertising in recent years, with pharmaceutical advertising rising 56% to over $6 billion from 2012 to 2015. Recent data shows a rapid increase in DTC advertising, with pharmaceutical advertising rising 56% to over $6 billion from 2012 to 2015. Television and newspaper ads make up the majority of spending, but internet-based drug ads are the fastest-growing area. FDA regulations require drug companies to submit ads for assessment, with internet promotions increasing while television promotions remain flat. According to FDA analysis from 2001 to 2014, internet prescription drug promotions are increasing while television promotions remain flat. Supporters believe pharmaceutical advertising leads to more informed consumers and better diagnosis of undertreated illnesses. Critics argue that the presentation of drug benefits and risks may lead to inappropriate prescribing and higher drug spending. New brand-name drug advertising may lead to consumers choosing higher-priced products without clear evidence of their superiority. New brand-name drug advertising may lead consumers to choose higher-priced products without clear evidence of their superiority. Studies suggest a link between drug advertising and increased prescription drug use, with concerns raised about inadequate information on benefits and risks in direct-to-consumer advertisements. Congress has debated restricting direct-to-consumer drug advertising to protect consumers. A recent government survey found that many people feel direct-to-consumer drug advertisements lack sufficient information on benefits and risks. There is ongoing debate in Congress about restricting these ads to protect public health and finances. The American Medical Association and American Society of Health-System Pharmacists have recommended a ban on DTC drug ads. Legislation in the 114th Congress proposed a moratorium on advertising for new drugs, citing concerns about promoting products without long-term safety and effectiveness evidence. Legislation in the 114th Congress proposed a moratorium on advertising for new drugs, aiming to address concerns about promoting products without long-term safety and effectiveness evidence. The FDA regulates pharmaceutical sales in the US under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, requiring approved marketing applications with necessary clinical data on safety. Congress has also debated disallowing federal tax deductions for pharmaceutical DTC advertising to reduce drug spending. The FDA regulates pharmaceutical sales in the US under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, requiring approved marketing applications with necessary clinical data on safety and effectiveness. The Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 clarified that only the manufacturer of an FDA-approved prescription drug may legally bring the drug back into the United States. The Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 clarified that only the manufacturer of an FDA-approved prescription drug may legally bring the drug back into the United States. In 2000, the Medicine Equity and Drug Safety Act allowed pharmacists and wholesalers to import FDA-approved prescription drugs, but in practice, importation has not been allowed. The act required the HHS Secretary to certify to Congress that importation would not pose additional risks to public health and safety and would reduce costs for American consumers. The MEDS Act provision in the Medicare Modernization and Prescription Drug Act of 2003 aimed to reduce costs for American consumers by allowing importation of FDA-approved prescription drugs. However, this provision has never been implemented due to the lack of necessary certifications from HHS Secretaries. Lawmakers have attempted to address this issue through the annual agriculture appropriations bill. Lawmakers have tried to use the agriculture appropriations bill to bypass obstacles to prescription drug importation into the United States. FDA has been lenient in enforcing personal importation restrictions, allowing individuals to bring in a 90-day supply of non-FDA-approved drugs for personal use. The FDA's personal-use import policy allows individuals to bring in a 90-day supply of non-FDA-approved drugs for personal use by affirming in writing that the drugs are for their own use and providing their treating physician's information. The policy was originally intended to permit medical treatments not available in the US, but is now being used by consumers seeking lower prices for FDA-approved drugs. Some states have tried to pass laws allowing prescription drug importation. Consumers are now using the FDA's personal-use import policy to seek lower prices for FDA-approved drugs available in the US, instead of for medical treatments not available in the country. Some states have tried to pass laws allowing prescription drug importation. The Senate has held hearings on the business model of pharmaceutical companies and the repercussions for patients and the healthcare system. They have also examined sudden price spikes in decades-old prescription drugs and off-patent drugs. Additionally, the Senate has looked into the proposed Medicare Part B drug demonstration and the cost of prescription drugs according to a report by The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. The Senate has conducted hearings on the business practices of pharmaceutical companies, including sudden price increases in prescription drugs. They have also examined the proposed Medicare Part B drug demonstration and the impact of the drug delivery system on patient costs. The Senate has conducted hearings on pharmaceutical companies' business practices, focusing on prescription drug price increases and the impact of the drug delivery system on patient costs. The Senate has conducted hearings on various healthcare topics, including biosimilar implementation progress, research and development for patients, drug supply chain examination, 340B drug pricing program utilization, patient access to investigational drugs, FDA regulation of over-the-counter drugs, and FDA's prescription drug user fee program. The House has also held hearings on healthcare topics such as the generic drug and biosimilar user fee program, Medicare drug experiment, antitrust concerns in the FDA approval process, and competition in the pharmacy benefit manager and pharmacy marketplaces. The House Judiciary Committee has addressed antitrust concerns in the FDA approval process, competition in pharmacy benefit manager and pharmacy marketplaces, federally funded cancer research coordination and innovation, impact of voluntary restricted distribution systems in the pharmaceutical supply chain, rising price of EpiPens, and developments in the prescription drug market.
