The \"MANIFEST for Human Spaceflight Act of 2016\" reaffirms the long-term goal of expanding human presence beyond low-Earth orbit with international partners. Congress acknowledges findings from the National Academy of Sciences regarding human space flight direction and core capabilities. The Committee on Human Spaceflight, comprised of leaders from various fields, concluded that human space exploration has multiple rationales including economic benefits, national security, and scientific discovery. They affirmed Mars as the long-term goal and recommended sustainable steps for NASA to achieve this goal. The Committee on Human Spaceflight affirmed Mars as the long-term goal for human space exploration and recommended sustainable steps for NASA to achieve this goal. The Committee on Human Spaceflight affirmed Mars as the long-term goal for human space exploration and recommended sustainable steps for NASA to achieve this goal. SEC. 3. HUMAN EXPLORATION STRATEGY. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 is amended to include human exploration of Mars as a goal, with a strategy involving successive missions in cis-lunar space to achieve this objective. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 is amended to include a strategy for human exploration in cis-lunar space, utilizing missions to enable exploration of various destinations such as lunar orbits, the lunar surface, asteroids, Mars, and the moons of Mars. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 is amended to include a strategy for human exploration in cis-lunar space, focusing on missions to destinations like lunar orbits, the lunar surface, asteroids, Mars, and the moons of Mars. This includes collaboration opportunities with international partners, private industry, and other Federal agencies, as well as utilizing the International Space Station for scientific research and technological developments to support a human presence in cis-lunar space and beyond. Various exploration mission architectures and approaches, including capabilities for the Orion spacecraft, are also considered. The curr_chunk discusses the comparison of exploration mission architectures and approaches for missions in cis-lunar space and beyond. It includes factors like cost effectiveness, schedule resiliency, safety, sustainability, and opportunities for international collaboration. The aim is to enable new markets and opportunities for US private industry, scientific discovery, and technological excellence. The curr_chunk discusses measures for setting standards to ensure crew health and safety in space exploration missions, including radiation exposure limits, medical emergency protocols, and other safety issues. The curr_chunk outlines crew training needs, prioritizing missions, and assessing recommendations from a previous report in compliance with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010. The curr_chunk discusses the assessment of recommendations from a previous report and the inclusion of technical information to identify interest from potential stakeholders. Additionally, it mentions an independent review arrangement with the National Academy of Sciences to review and comment on each interim report. The National Academy of Sciences will review and comment on interim reports regarding the strategy, identifying agreed-upon matters, concerns, and making recommendations. The review process will be conducted in a timely manner. The Administrator must ensure timely review and comment on interim reports by the National Academy of Sciences to incorporate their feedback into the final report. Deadlines require submission of interim reports every five years for independent review and comment on the strategy. The Administrator must submit interim reports to the National Academy of Sciences every five years for independent review and comment on the strategy. Final reports incorporating feedback from the Academy must be submitted to Congress within one year of the enactment of the Act and every five years thereafter."
