    "content": "The quality of instruction for elementary and secondary school teachers is crucial for student learning. Federal policy, such as Title II, Part A of the Higher Education Act of 1965, focuses on improving teacher preparation programs. The 115th Congress is considering a reauthorization of the HEA through bills like H.R. 4508. The 115th Congress is considering a reauthorization of the Higher Education Act (HEA) through bills like H.R. 4508, which would repeal provisions in Title II. Funding for Title II-A expired in FY2011 but has been extended through various appropriations legislation. Congressional action to reauthorize the HEA may continue in the future. The report describes current programs and provisions in Title II-A of the Higher Education Act (HEA) and highlights key issues for potential reauthorization. It discusses the historical context of teacher preparation in the United States, focusing on traditional programs at institutions of higher education (IHEs) and the challenges posed by alternative approaches. Most teachers in elementary and secondary schools have been prepared at IHE programs since the early 20th century. The rise of alternative teacher preparation programs challenges traditional IHE programs. Historically, normal schools trained teachers before universities established schools of education. The split between pedagogy and subject-area knowledge has been a key development in teacher preparation. The split between pedagogy and subject-area knowledge in teacher preparation has widened with the rise of alternative routes to certification. These alternative programs focus on classroom instruction and management, relying on candidates' prior subject knowledge. Since 1998, the Secretary of Education has been required to prepare an annual report on teacher preparation in the US, with the most recent data available for the 2012-2013 academic year. The Secretary of Education's Tenth Annual Report provides data on teacher preparation in the US for the 2012-2013 academic year. Online data for 2015-2016 shows 2,106 teacher preparation providers offering 26,459 programs, enrolling 441,439 teaching candidates and producing 159,598 completers. In 2012-2013, 2,171 providers offered 26,589 programs, enrolling 499,800 candidates and producing 192,459 completers. In the 2012-2013 academic year, 2,171 teacher preparation providers offered 26,589 programs, enrolling 499,800 teaching candidates and producing 192,459 completers. Among these providers, 69% were traditional, 22% were alternative route providers at IHEs, and 9% were alternative route providers not based at IHEs. The programs consisted of 70% traditional teacher preparation programs, 20% alternative route programs at IHEs, and 10% alternative route programs not based at IHEs. In the 2012-2013 academic year, teacher candidates were enrolled in various teacher preparation programs. The top 5 states with the most program completers were Texas, New York, California, Pennsylvania, and Illinois. New York led in traditional program completion, while Texas led in alternative route completions. The Secretary's Tenth Annual report highlighted key aspects of teacher preparation in the United States. Texas led the nation in completers of alternative routes, accounting for 16% of individuals completing an alternative route based at an IHE and 48% of those completing an alternative route not based at an IHE. The Secretary's Tenth Annual report reveals key aspects of teacher preparation in the United States, including the differences between traditional and alternative route programs. Traditional programs require 100 hours of supervised clinical experience and 600 hours of student teaching, while alternative route programs do not have such requirements. The two largest traditional teacher preparation programs are online programs at Grand Canyon University and the University of Phoenix, enrolling over 30,000 prospective teachers each. The majority of enrollees in teacher preparation programs are white, non-Hispanic, with African-American enrollees making up a smaller percentage. The majority of enrollees in teacher preparation programs are white, non-Hispanic, with African-American enrollees making up a smaller percentage. The most common subject area of program completion is elementary education, followed by special education, early childhood education, English/language arts, and mathematics. The national average scaled score was 14 percentage points above the average cut score. Over 95% of candidates who took a state assessment passed the test. Title II-A of the HEA has two components: a competitive grant program and reporting and accountability provisions. The Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program is a competitive grant program under Title II-A of the HEA that aims to improve the quality of prospective and new teachers through enhanced preparation and professional development activities. It supports traditional teacher preparation programs and teacher residency programs, with annual appropriations of about $42 million funding grants to partnerships. The Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program receives annual appropriations of about $42 million to support grants for traditional teacher preparation programs and teacher residency programs. TQP projects include pre-baccalaureate/fifth year programs, residency programs, and a combination of both. Eligibility for a TQP award requires partnerships to include a high-need local educational agency, a partner institution of higher education, a school or program of education within the institution, and a school or department of arts and sciences within the institution. Grantees must match 100% of their award amount with non-federal funds. The Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program requires partnerships with high-need schools or early childhood education programs, partner institutions of higher education, and school departments within the institution. Grantees must match 100% of their award amount with non-federal funds and coordinate activities with other federally funded programs. Grants support reforms in teacher preparation programs, including curriculum changes, research-based instructional practices, and pre-service clinical education programs. The Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program aims to improve teaching skills through research-based practices, high-quality mentoring, induction programs, and professional development. It also focuses on increasing compensation for early childhood educators, recruiting qualified individuals into the teaching profession, and strengthening literacy instruction skills. Grants support teacher residency programs in high-need schools and academic subjects. The Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program provides grants for teacher residency programs to prepare teachers for success in high-need schools. The programs include rigorous coursework, teaching apprenticeships, mentorship, and criteria for selecting effective mentor teachers. Graduates are placed in targeted schools for professional collaboration, with a one-year living stipend provided. Grants also support effective school leadership programs for superintendents, principals, and other school leaders. The Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program provides grants for teacher residency programs to prepare teachers for high-need schools. Grants also support effective school leadership programs for superintendents, principals, and other school leaders, promoting strong leadership skills and techniques. Grant funds are used for developing clinical education programs, mentoring, induction programs, and recruiting qualified individuals to become school leaders. The Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program aims to improve academic achievement by supporting teacher residency programs, school leadership development, and recruitment efforts. Title II of the Higher Education Act (HEA) holds teacher preparation programs accountable by requiring states and institutions to report program performance data. This data is used by the Department of Education (ED) to issue annual reports on teacher qualifications and preparation in the United States. The Higher Education Act requires the Department of Education to issue annual reports on teacher qualifications and preparation in the United States using state-reported information. States must evaluate teacher preparation programs based on criteria such as teaching skill and pass rates on credentialing assessments. In 2014, 12 states and Puerto Rico identified low-performing or at-risk programs. In 2014, 12 states and Puerto Rico identified low-performing or at-risk teacher preparation programs. A total of 45 programs were classified as low-performing or at-risk, representing less than 3% of the total number of programs. H.R. 4508, a bill to amend the Higher Education Act, including the repeal of current provisions in Title II, was ordered reported by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. The House Committee on Education and the Workforce approved H.R. 4508, a bill to amend the Higher Education Act by repealing current provisions in Title II. The ranking member introduced H.R. 6543, a comprehensive HEA reauthorization bill that includes amendments to the TQP program, accountability provisions for institutions and states, and expanded reporting requirements. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions has held hearings on HEA reauthorization but has not introduced a bill amending Title II. The President signed a resolution nullifying regulations that would have added clearer guidance on providers, post-program measures, and penalties for poor performance. Congress may consider legislation to reauthorize the HEA, including Title II provisions. The regulations for HEA reauthorization included clearer guidance on provider definitions, new post-program measures, and penalties for poor performance. Congress may consider legislation on the federal role in supporting teacher preparation programs, TQP activities, and program quality. Some advocate for an expanded federal role in supporting quality programs, while others argue for maintaining the current limited support. Some argue for an expanded federal role in supporting teacher preparation programs, while others believe it should remain a state and local endeavor. There is debate over the optimal mix of activities in the TQP program, with traditional routes emphasizing supervised clinical practice and assessments, and alternative routes seeking fewer restrictions on partners and more in-service support like induction and mentoring. Some argue for an expanded federal role in supporting teacher preparation programs, emphasizing the need for more accountability in program quality and outcomes tied to student performance. They believe current reporting and accountability provisions are insufficient in holding teacher preparation programs to high standards. Less than 3% of programs are identified as low-performing, and three-fifths of states have never identified a program in this manner. On the other hand, some argue against federal accountability requirements, stating that current reporting already burdens state and local administrators unnecessarily."
