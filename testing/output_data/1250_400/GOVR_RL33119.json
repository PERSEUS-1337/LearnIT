    "content": "Federal highway, highway safety, and transit programs are subject to periodic reauthorization. The most recent authorization before SAFETEA was the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), which provided funds for FY1998-FY2003. Short-term extensions created uncertainty in funding, leading to a consensus for long-term reauthorizations like TEA-21. The passage of SAFETEA was welcomed by the highway and transit community, despite delays, as it provided funding until FY2009. The passage of SAFETEA was welcomed by the highway and transit community due to uncertainty in future funding. Federal funding for surface transportation is closely linked to the revenue stream from the highway trust fund, primarily funded by gasoline and diesel fuel taxes. The trust fund consists of separate accounts for highways and mass transit, with the transit account receiving a portion of the fuel tax. There have been periodic increases in fuel taxes over the trust fund's almost 50-year history, with the last increase occurring in 1993. The highway trust fund receives fuel tax revenues, with a portion reserved for a leaking underground storage tank fund. Over nearly 50 years, there have been periodic tax increases. In FY2004, the highway account received $31 billion and the mass transit account received $5 billion. While historically the trust fund collected more than spent, recent years have seen a decline in unexpended balance. The FY2004 limitation on obligations for the highway trust fund was set at $33.6 billion, higher than the revenues collected. Despite a substantial unexpended balance, there is uncertainty about its long-term financial health. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 provided additional income through changes in gasohol taxation. Reauthorization legislation was passed by both the House and Senate, but disagreement on total program funding prevented agreement. The House and Senate passed reauthorization legislation in the 2nd Session of the 108th Congress, but disagreement on total program funding prevented agreement. The Administration objected to raising fuel taxes, while some Members of Congress proposed gasohol changes and other mechanisms to support a larger program. Conferees considered various tax and other changes to increase revenues for the trust fund and offset additional highway and transit spending. The House and Senate passed reauthorization legislation in the 2nd Session of the 108th Congress, but disagreement on total program funding prevented agreement. The Administration objected to raising fuel taxes, while some Members of Congress proposed gasohol changes and other mechanisms to support a larger program. Conferees on SAFETEA considered tax and other changes to increase revenues for the trust fund and offset additional highway and transit spending. The revenue increases in the finance title of the act were viewed as modest, mainly from cutting back on tax fraud and transferring some Treasury general fund revenues to the trust fund. It was believed that the changes identified in SAFETEA, combined with gasohol legislation enacted in 2004 and expected economic growth, would be sufficient to finance the $286.4 billion program created by the act. TEA-21 changed the way the highway trust fund relates to the Federal Unified Budget by creating new budget categories and setting statutory limitations on obligations. TEA-21 changed the highway trust fund's relationship with the Federal Unified Budget by creating new budget categories and setting limitations on obligations. It also introduced Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA) to adjust amounts in the highway account based on revenue changes. Despite these changes, annual revenues and expenditures still impact the trust fund's overall federal deficit calculation. The provision in TEA-21 adjusted the highway program authorization level to align with revenues generated from receipts on the highway. This set a predetermined level of funding for core highway and transit programs, known as a discretionary spending guarantee. These funds were separated from the rest of the budget to prevent their use for other purposes, creating \"firewalls\" for highway and transit programs. SAFETEA continued this budget format largely unchanged, with most debate focusing on funding distribution. SAFETEA ultimately provided additional money, with $286.4 billion allocated. SAFETEA provided a significant increase in funding, with $286.4 billion allocated for the six-year period FY2004-FY2009. This was an increase from the $218 billion provided in TEA-21 for FY1998-FY2003. The debate mainly focused on funding distribution, and SAFETEA represented a substantial funding increase for federal surface transportation programs. It provided over $244 billion in guaranteed spending authority for FY2005-FY2009. SAFETEA provided over $244 billion in guaranteed spending authority between FY2005-FY2009, with total annual spending increases each year. The House version included a provision for Congress to reconsider funding at a later date, which was opposed by the Bush Administration. Detailed programmatic information can be found at http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/safetealu/fundtables.htm. SAFETEA provided significant funding between FY2005-FY2009, with annual spending increases. The House version included a provision for Congress to reconsider funding later, opposed by the Bush Administration. TEA-21 created a spending mechanism to adjust highway program obligations based on trust fund revenue changes. RABA initially provided additional spending authority but called for a reduction in FY2003. Congress chose not to reduce spending and instead increased it. SAFETEA changed how RABA is calculated to mitigate revenue swings. SAFETEA changed the RABA calculation method to reduce dramatic revenue swings, using a two-year calculation and delaying calculations until FY2007. It also prevented spending reductions as long as the highway trust fund balance exceeded $6 billion. Regional battles over federal highway aid distribution have been ongoing, with Congress addressing funding concerns through minimum guarantee provisions in transportation reauthorization acts since 1982. Since 1982, Congress has addressed concerns over the distribution of federal highway aid among states by including provisions in transportation acts to ensure equity. Donor states, which receive less aid than they contribute in taxes, advocate for a higher share rate-of-return, while donee states, which receive more aid than they contribute, oppose any reduction in their shares. Donor states argue for fairness, stating they have been subsidizing the repair and improvement of donee state infrastructure for too long. Donor states argue for equity and fairness, stating they have been subsidizing the repair and improvement of donee state infrastructure for too long. Donee states argue that fairness should consider their needs, citing the age of their infrastructure and limited financial resources. Donee states argue that fairness should not be separated from needs, citing the age of their infrastructure, high costs of urban road maintenance, and limited financial resources. They also argue that a national highway network should not be based solely on state boundaries and criticize states that receive federal funds but contribute less to highway spending. The debate over equity remedies has broader implications, including the federal government's role in transportation funding as the minimum guarantee approaches 100%. The 109th Congress faced challenges in balancing donor and donee state demands for a higher rate-of-return from the Federal aid highway program. Controversial issues included the role of the federal government in transportation funding as the minimum guarantee approached 100% and whether the guarantee should be expanded to include Federal Transit Administration programs. The difficulty in resolving conflicting goals was exacerbated by insufficient HTF revenue to fund both demands. The 109th Congress faced challenges in balancing donor and donee state demands for a higher rate-of-return from the Federal aid highway program. The HTF revenue base was expected to be insufficient to easily fund both goals. To address this, a minimum guarantee mechanism was constructed to increase donor state shares, which required increasing the overall federal highway program size. This equity remedy was costly, with the minimum guarantee program under TEA21 becoming the largest highway program. The 109th Congress faced challenges in balancing donor and donee state demands for a higher rate-of-return from the Federal aid highway program. To address this, a minimum guarantee mechanism was implemented under TEA21 to increase donor state shares, which became the largest highway program. SAFETEA replaced the TEA-21 MG program with an \"Equity Bonus\" program to bring donor states up to their guaranteed rate-of-return levels. The act directed the Secretary of Transportation to allocate sufficient funds to ensure each state receives a minimum return on their estimated payments to the highway account of the HTF. The Equity Bonus program under SAFETEA directs the Secretary of Transportation to allocate funds to ensure each state receives a minimum return on their estimated payments to the highway account of the HTF. This program includes various formula programs subject to the equity provision, as well as new formula programs. Hold harmless provisions are also included to ensure certain states receive the greater of the annual percent return or their share of total apportionments over the six-year life of TEA-21. The Equity Bonus program under SAFETEA includes hold harmless provisions to ensure certain states receive a minimum return on their estimated payments. States must meet specific criteria to be held harmless, with twenty-seven states qualifying. The program also guarantees that no state may receive less than a set percentage of its average annual TEA-21 apportionments. The Equity Bonus Program ensures that certain states receive a minimum return on their payments. Twenty-seven states qualify for this provision, with annual percentage floors set for each fiscal year. Funds are distributed to core programs based on specific criteria. The Equity Bonus Program ensures minimum returns for certain states, with funds distributed to core programs based on specific criteria. Set-asides like Transportation Enhancements and some population-based sub-state allocations do not benefit from this distribution. Any Equity Bonus funds above $2.639 billion are distributed among six core programs: IM, HBRR, NHS, STP, CMAQ, and HSIP, based on each program's apportionment ratio. FHWA analysis estimates that EB program distributions will cost $40.9 billion over SAFETEA's five-year life. Funding for these programs is apportioned annually to states using formulas in SAFETEA, also known as \"apportioned\" or formula programs. Under TEA-21, most highway funding was reserved for five core programs, which SAFETEA increases to six. SAFETEA increases the number of core highway programs from five to six, including interstate maintenance, national highway system, surface transportation, highway bridge maintenance, congestion mitigation, air quality, and highway safety improvement. The majority of funding in the surface transportation bill goes to these core programs, with additional smaller programs like metropolitan planning and recreational trails. Only a few new programs were included in SAFETEA despite consideration of many others during reauthorization. SAFETEA includes new core highway programs such as interstate maintenance, national highway system, and highway safety improvement. Additional smaller programs like metropolitan planning and recreational trails are also continued. Only a few new programs, such as the Coordinated Border Infrastructure Program and Safe Routes to School Program, were added in SAFETEA. Funding distribution is based on various factors like lane miles, vehicle miles traveled, and state share of total cost for deficient bridges. The SAFETEA act includes new core highway programs like interstate maintenance, national highway system, and highway safety improvement. Funding distribution is based on factors such as lane miles, vehicle miles traveled, and state share of total cost for deficient bridges. Adjustments were made to existing program formulas, including the elimination of the 10% safety STP set-aside and adjustments to the STP Transportation Enhancements set-aside. Additionally, a $20 million NHS set-aside for ferry construction in Alaska, New Jersey, and Washington was created.

Adjustments were made to existing program formulas, including the elimination of the 10% safety STP set-aside and adjustments to the STP Transportation Enhancements set-aside. A $20 million NHS set-aside for ferry construction in Alaska, New Jersey, and Washington was created. CMAQ of weighted non-attainment and maintenance areas for ozone under the new 8-hour area standards. National Highway System set-aside for the Territorial Highway Program is set at $40 million for FY2005-FY2006 and at $50 million annually for FY2007-FY2009. The off-system bridge program set-aside minimum is maintained at 15% but the 35% ceiling is removed. The formula distribution is weighted 33 1/3% based on federal lane miles, FAHP vehicle miles traveled, and annual fatalities on the federal-aid system in each state. Minimum payment to each state is set at 0.5%. Railway-Highway Crossings program is funded through a takedown from HSIP but is distributed differently to the states. Crossings funding is distributed 50% based on the existing formula distribution.

Minimum payment to each state is set at 0.5%. Railway-Highway Crossings program is funded through a takedown from HSIP but is distributed differently to the states. Crossings funding is distributed 50% based on the existing formula distribution. Under TEA-21, this was an allocated (discretionary) program. Under SAFETEA, the funds are to be apportioned to states along the Canada-U.S. and the Mexico-U.S. borders under the following formula: 20% in the ratio of incoming commercial truck crossings in a state to the total incoming commercial truck crossings in all border states; 30% in the ratio of incoming passenger vehicle crossings in a state to the total incoming passenger vehicle crossings in all border states. The SAFETEA act allocates funds for highway programs based on various factors such as commercial truck crossings, passenger vehicle crossings, cargo weight, and number of ports-of-entry along the Canada-U.S. and Mexico-U.S. borders. States receive apportionments based on student enrollment in primary and middle schools, with a minimum allocation of $1 million per state. Highway programs not apportioned are subject to allocations based on established criteria. The SAFETEA act allocates funds for highway programs based on various factors such as student enrollment in primary and middle schools in each state. States receive a minimum allocation of $1 million. Highway programs not apportioned are subject to allocations based on established criteria and congressional earmarking. Some of the largest allocated programs include congressionally mandated high priority projects, federal lands program, interstate maintenance discretionary program, bridge discretionary program, and transportation and community system pilot preservation program. SAFETEA also introduces new large allocated programs like a transportation improvement program. The SAFETEA act introduces new large allocated programs like a transportation improvement program, national corridor infrastructure program, and projects of national or regional significance subject to 100% earmarking. Innovative financing mechanisms, such as GARVEEs, leverage future highway funds to speed project completion. The SAFETEA act introduces innovative financing mechanisms like GARVEEs, TIFIA, and SIBs to leverage future highway funds for project completion. These mechanisms provide federal financial assistance through secured loans, loan guarantees, and standby lines of credit for transportation projects. SAFETEA also reduces the minimum project size threshold and lowers the threshold for intelligent transportation system projects. The SAFETEA act introduces innovative financing mechanisms like GARVEEs, TIFIA, and SIBs to leverage future highway funds for project completion. It provides federal financial assistance through secured loans, loan guarantees, and standby lines of credit for transportation projects. SAFETEA reduces the minimum project size threshold and lowers the threshold for intelligent transportation system projects. Additionally, the act authorizes tolling programs and provisions concerning the tolling of HOV lanes. SAFETEA consolidates tolling provisions in Section 1604, authorizing four tolling programs and a provision for HOV lane tolling. The program continues with 15 tolling projects, receiving $11 million for FY2005 and $12 million annually for FY2006-FY2009. $3 million is allocated for non-tolling congestion pricing pilot projects each year. The Secretary of Transportation is directed to carry out 15 demonstration projects for toll collection to manage congestion, reduce emissions, or improve transportation efficiency. The Transportation Department is authorized to conduct 15 demonstration projects allowing toll collection at existing toll facilities or highways to manage congestion, reduce emissions, or finance highway expansion. Most funding is expected to go towards high occupancy toll lanes. Revenues must be used for debt service, private financing returns, and operating costs. Excess revenues can be used for federal-aid highway or transit projects if the facility is well-maintained. Tolls can vary based on time of day or congestion levels to improve air quality and manage traffic. The act establishes a pilot toll program allowing states to collect tolls on Interstate System highways for construction purposes. States must demonstrate that toll financing is the most efficient way to advance the project. Fees collected on express lanes must be through noncash electronic technology. The act establishes a pilot toll program on the Interstate System for construction purposes. States must show toll financing is the most efficient way to advance the project. Revenues can only be used for debt service, investor returns, and operating costs. Interstate Maintenance funds cannot be used on toll facilities. State departments can allow vehicles to pay tolls for HOV lane use. The act allows state departments to establish toll programs on the Interstate System for construction purposes. It also permits tolling of vehicles for HOV lane use, including low emission and energy-efficient vehicles. Additionally, the act amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow tax-exempt private activity bonds for financing highway projects and rail-truck transfer facilities by state and local governments. The act allows tolling of vehicles, including low emission and energy-efficient vehicles, at a preferential rate for HOV lane use. It also amends the Internal Revenue Code to permit tax-exempt private activity bonds for financing highway projects and rail-truck transfer facilities by state and local governments, with a $15 billion limit on the bonds that can be issued. The conference report allows tolling of vehicles at a preferential rate for HOV lane use and permits tax-exempt private activity bonds for financing highway projects and rail-truck transfer facilities. A $15 billion limit is placed on the bonds that can be issued, potentially creating substantial infrastructure impact. The ADHP is a road building program aimed at promoting Appalachian economic development, funded by the highway trust fund and administered by the Appalachian Regional Commission. The Appalachian Development Highway Program (ADHP) aims to break regional isolation in Appalachia and promote economic development. It is funded by the highway trust fund and administered by the Appalachian Regional Commission. The program receives federal funds based on cost estimates for completing the approved Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS). ADHP has received significant funding under TEA-21 and SAFETEA, with an 80% federal share and a prohibition on using toll revenues as credits for non-federal matching funds. SAFETEA provides significant additional funding for the Appalachian Development Highway Program (ADHP), with $470 million annually and an 80% federal share. The act includes over 5,092 earmarks for high priority projects, totaling $14.8 billion, compared to TEA-21's 1,849 earmarks worth $9.4 billion. SAFETEA also introduces new earmarked categories, such as projects of national and regional significance, with almost $1.8 billion allocated for 25 projects. The SAFETEA act introduces new earmarked categories in the highway title, including projects of national and regional significance, national corridor infrastructure improvements, and transportation improvements. These categories allocate funding for a total of 523 projects valued at over $6.2 billion. Individual projects may appear in multiple earmarking lists with varying funding amounts. Additionally, there are 32 individually listed earmarks throughout the highway title of the bill. The SAFETEA act introduces new earmarked categories in the highway title, including projects of national and regional significance, national corridor infrastructure improvements, and transportation improvements. These categories allocate funding for a total of 523 projects valued at over $6.2 billion. Individual projects may appear in multiple earmarking lists with varying funding amounts. Additionally, there are 32 individually listed earmarks throughout the highway title of the bill. The total amount of earmarking in the bill exceeds $24 billion, with discussions focusing on how earmarking affects the Equity Bonus calculation. The SAFETEA act introduces new earmarked categories in the highway title, including projects of national and regional significance, national corridor infrastructure improvements, and transportation improvements valued at over $6.2 billion. Earmarking in the bill exceeds $24 billion, with discussions on how it affects the Equity Bonus calculation. Earmarks in the bill are categorized as \"below the line\" or \"above the line\" for Equity Bonus purposes, impacting state shares. Transit earmarks are not included in the Equity Bonus calculation. The Transportation Enhancements (TE) program under SAFETEA funds various projects such as pedestrian and bicycle facilities, historic preservation, and environmental mitigation. The funding mechanism for TE activities has been modified, with 10% of state funds now required for TE projects. Transit earmarks are not considered in the Equity Bonus calculation. The Transportation Enhancements (TE) program under SAFETEA funds projects like pedestrian and bicycle facilities, historic preservation, and environmental mitigation. Funding for TE activities has been modified, with 10% of state funds now allocated for enhancement projects. The TCSP program aims to integrate transportation, community, and system preservation plans, with funding authorized for projects improving transportation efficiency and reducing environmental impacts. The TCSP program aims to integrate transportation, community, and system preservation plans by providing funding for projects that improve transportation efficiency, reduce environmental impacts, and encourage compatible private sector development patterns. State, tribal, regional, and local governments are eligible for TCSP grants, with a total funding authorization of $270 million over six years. The Transportation, Community, and System Preservation (TCSP) program received substantial funding under SAFETEA, with $25 million authorized for FY2005 and $61.25 million authorized for FY2006-FY2009. This is more than TEA-21 but less than the total appropriations during TEA-21. TCSP projects were funded through competitive grants and earmarks in annual transportation appropriations bills, with funding amounts varying each year. SAFETEA continues to support bicycle and pedestrian programs for non-motorized trips and safety initiatives. The Transportation Enhancements (TE) program has supported pedestrian and bicycle mobility since the passage of ISTEA, allowing states to allocate funds for facilities, safety, education, and preservation of railway corridors. Between FY1992 and FY2004, 55% of TE funds were used for these activities, with pedestrian and bicycle facilities accounting for 46.3% of programmed activities. Other programs also provide for bicycle and pedestrian facilities associated with road and transit projects, including the Safe Routes to School Program under SAFETEA. The Safe Routes to School Program under SAFETEA aims to promote walking and biking to school for children, making it safer and more appealing. It will be funded at $612 million for FY2004-FY2009, with funding apportioned based on student enrollment. Each state will receive a minimum of $1 million per year, with the Secretary setting aside up to $3 million. Funding for the Safe Routes to School Program is based on student enrollment ratios among states. Each state will receive a minimum of $1 million per year, with up to $3 million set aside for administrative expenses. The federal share of project costs is 100%, and funds are not transferable. Eligible agencies include state, local, and regional entities, as well as nonprofit organizations. Funds can be used for infrastructure projects to improve walking and biking to school. Funds allocated under the Safe Routes to School Program can be used for infrastructure projects to enhance walking and biking to school. This includes sidewalk improvements, traffic calming measures, bicycle facilities, pedestrian crossings, and more. Additionally, funds can also be used for non-infrastructure activities like public awareness campaigns, traffic education, and safety training. Non-infrastructure spending should be at least 10% of the total allocation. The Safe Routes to School Program includes funding for infrastructure projects like sidewalk improvements and traffic calming measures, as well as non-infrastructure activities such as public awareness campaigns and safety training. Non-infrastructure spending should be between 10% and 30% of the total allocation. Each state must use a portion of the funding to support a full-time coordinator for their safe routes to school program. Additionally, grants are provided for a national nonprofit organization to operate a clearinghouse and develop educational programs on safe routes to school. The Safe Routes to School Program includes funding for infrastructure projects like sidewalk improvements and traffic calming measures, as well as non-infrastructure activities such as public awareness campaigns and safety training. Funding for a clearinghouse and educational programs on safe routes to school would come from the Secretary's administrative expenses. A task force was established to study and develop a strategy for advancing safe routes to school programs nationwide, with results to be transmitted to Congress by March 31, 2006. SAFETEA provides $45.3 billion in guaranteed funding for transit for the five-year authorization period, with shifts in funding distribution among transit programs. The SAFETEA Act shifted funding distribution in the transit program, with changes in the share going to urban and rural areas. Funding for the largest states decreased while increasing for the least-populated states. Minor changes were made to the federal transit program, including new programs and funding categories. Other provisions included offering transit passes as a fringe benefit and making alternatives analysis eligible for grants. The SAFETEA Act made changes to federal transit programs, including new provisions like offering transit passes as a fringe benefit and making alternatives analysis eligible for grants. It also allocated additional funding of $1.7 billion to Urbanized Area Formula and Non-Urbanized Area Formula programs over the FY2006-FY2009 period. The Area Formula programs allocate funds based on population forecasts for 15 years beyond the most recent Census. Half of the funds go to urban and non-urban areas within each state based on population ratios, while the other half is for urbanized areas with population densities over 370 persons per mile. This program aims to increase transportation services for persons with disabilities, including access to jobs and employment support services. Additionally, there is a discretionary grant program to provide transportation alternatives in national parks and public lands, with a total authorization of $97 million. A discretionary grant program aims to provide transportation alternatives in national parks and public lands to protect and provide access for all, including persons with disabilities. It has a total authorization of $97 million and is exempt from labor protection provisions. Additionally, a new formula program within the Urbanized Area Formula Program provides additional funding for small urbanized areas with populations under 200,000 that offer comparable transit service to larger urbanized areas. The Urbanized Area Formula Program includes a program for small urbanized areas under 200,000 in population to receive funding based on transit service levels. This program addresses the issue of smaller areas not receiving recognition for providing higher levels of transit service compared to other small areas. Section 3033 of TEA-21 directed DOT to study this issue and consider changes. The Urbanized Area Formula Program aims to address the disparity in funding for small areas with high transit service levels. Section 3033 of TEA-21 prompted a study by DOT, leading to a proposed change in funding allocation to reward transit-intensive areas. This shift would move 1% of funding from urbanized areas over 200,000 in population to those under 200,000. The program, part of the New Starts program, streamlines evaluation for projects seeking less than $75 million in federal funding, with an annual authorization of $200 million for FY2007-FY2009. Projects seeking less than $75 million in federal funding (Small Starts) will undergo a streamlined evaluation process with fewer categories compared to those seeking $75 million or more. The exemption for projects seeking less than $25 million is eliminated. $45 million is allocated for grants to Indian tribes for public transportation on reservations. Additionally, 20% of the Non-Urbanized Area Formula program funding will be based on a state's non-urbanized land area, with the remaining 80% based on population. $90 million is authorized for magnetic levitation train deployment for FY2005-FY2009. The act authorizes $90 million for magnetic levitation train deployment for FY2005-FY2009, with funding apportioned based on a state's share of the non-urbanized population. 50% of the funding is designated for a maglev project between Las Vegas and Primm, Nevada, and 50% for a project east of the Mississippi River. The act also reauthorizes the Swift Rail Act, expanding eligible expenses to include development of high-speed rail corridors. The committee report on SAFETEA notes that the program should be administered as a new program, reauthorizing the Swift Rail Act for high-speed rail corridor development. Funding levels remain at $70 million annually for corridor development and $30 million for technology improvements. Additional funding is allocated for rail-highway grade crossing hazards and grants to the Alaska Railroad for passenger transportation improvements. The SAFETEA act authorizes grants with unspecified amounts for various programs, including the Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) and funding for high-speed rail corridor development. The act also directs the Federal Railroad Administration to establish programs for rail joint bar inspection and pressurized tank car design standards. The SAFETEA act authorizes the Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) for highway safety, replacing the roadway hazard elimination program. The HSIP is funded at $1.2 billion in FY2006, increasing to $1.3 billion by FY2009. States must allocate a minimum amount for hazard elimination projects, with the remainder available for other highway projects if not needed for safety improvements. The HSIP Program, funded at $1.2 billion in FY2006 and increasing to $1.3 billion by FY2009, allocates funds based on lane-miles, vehicle miles traveled, and fatalities on federal-aid highways. States must allocate a minimum amount for hazard elimination projects, with set-asides for rail-highway grade crossing and high-risk rural roads. The Safe Routes to Schools program allocates $90 million annually for high-risk rural road projects and $1.2 billion in FY2006, increasing to $1.3 billion by FY2009 for hazard elimination projects. States must prepare a strategic highway safety plan and can use funds for other safety projects if needs are met. The program also focuses on infrastructure projects near schools to promote walking or biking, with funding based on student enrollment. The Safe Routes to Schools program focuses on promoting the safety of children near schools to encourage walking or biking. Funding is based on student enrollment, with a minimum of $1 million for each state. A portion of the funds is allocated for non-infrastructure projects. The program also includes grants for promoting seat belt use and reducing impaired driving. The grant funds under this program can be used for highway safety purposes, with a federal share of 100%. The program is authorized at $125 million annually for FY2006-FY2009 and includes expanding a grant program to reduce impaired driving. States must meet certain criteria to receive a grant, such as implementing specific programs to discourage driving while impaired. The program aims to reduce impaired driving by implementing various measures such as increased blood alcohol testing for drivers in fatal accidents, harsher penalties for high blood alcohol content, effective alcohol rehabilitation programs, prevention strategies for underage drinking, and returning fines collected for DUI to communities for prevention programs. Grants totaling $555 million are available for these initiatives, with a set-aside for states with high rates of impaired driving fatalities. Additionally, a motorcyclist safety grant program is included in the act. The program has a total authorization of $555 million over the authorization period. Other new programs in the act include a motorcyclist safety grant program to fund safety training and education programs, and an incentive grant program for states that require children to be in appropriate child restraints. The act also directs DOT to establish standards to reduce vehicle rollover crashes and enhance passenger motor vehicle occupant protection in side impact crashes. ITS is used in highway or transit projects. The Transportation Equity Act (TEA-21) directs the Department of Transportation to enhance vehicle safety by increasing roof strength in rollover crashes and improving occupant protection in side impact crashes. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are utilized in highway and transit projects to improve performance and safety, allowing traffic management centers to receive real-time information on traffic flow, incidents, and weather conditions. Federal investment in ITS during TEA-21 totaled $230 million annually, with $100 million for research and $120 million for deployment. The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA) provides $110 million annually for ITS research. During the later years of TEA-21, federal investment in ITS was around $230 million annually, with $100 million for research and $120 million for deployment. SAFETEA provides $110 million annually for ITS research. The ITS deployment program ended after FY2005, with ITS project costs now eligible in core highway programs. The act aims to advance new technologies, improve standards, and develop a national ITS program plan. Research and development activities play a crucial role in addressing challenges in surface transportation systems such as congestion, security, and environmental degradation. The federal role in research and technology deployment aims to reduce challenges in surface transportation systems such as congestion, security, and environmental degradation. FHWA, FTA, NHTSA, and RITA oversee these efforts, with a focus on ITS and FHWA's program. Approximately $295 million per year is authorized for FHWA's RD and TD program under Title V of SAFETEA. The FHWA's RD and TD program, funded at $295 million per year under SAFETEA, supports transportation research, development, and deployment. This includes funds for surface transportation research, training, education, Bureau of Transportation Statistics, and University Transportation Research Program. The research aims to improve highway pavements, structures, safety, and policies. The FHWA's RD and TD program, funded at $295 million per year under SAFETEA, supports transportation research, development, and deployment for highway pavements, structures, safety, and policies. Research funds are used to advance technologies and improve roadway safety, with some earmarked for specific types of research or projects. State and industry experts emphasize the importance of these funds for maximizing the effective use of federal aid funds. Title IX of SAFETEA addresses issues related to freight rail transportation, such as infrastructure capacity and rail-to-rail competition. Congress is evaluating the capability of freight railroads to expand their infrastructure capacity to handle increasing trade volumes and highway congestion. Congress is considering assisting freight railroads in expanding their infrastructure capacity to handle increasing trade volumes and highway congestion. Another issue is the growing frequency of freight train traffic through towns, causing delays for motor vehicle traffic. Concerns also exist about high rail rates and poor service for shippers served by only one railroad. Congress is addressing issues related to rail industry efficiency and the captive shipper question since price deregulation in 1980. SAFETEA legislation in the 109th Congress includes provisions for evaluating rail system performance and funding mechanisms to address these concerns. Congress passed SAFETEA legislation in the 109th Congress to address rail industry efficiency and the captive shipper question. The legislation includes funding mechanisms, such as the RRIF Program, which expands federal loan and loan guarantee programs for rail track rehabilitation. The program now has a total value of $35 billion, with $7 billion reserved for smaller railroads. SAFETEA also amends program language to expedite loan availability and states that loans must be provided within 90 days. Additionally, the legislation addresses rail-to-rail competition and allows loans to be issued to shippers considered \"captive\" to one railroad. SAFETEA legislation in the 109th Congress addresses rail industry efficiency and captive shipper concerns. The RRIF Program expands federal loan programs for rail track rehabilitation, with $35 billion total value and $7 billion for smaller railroads. Loans must be approved within 90 days. Section 9003 allows loans for rail connections between plants and second rail carriers. SAFETEA also includes a federal grants program for relocating or grade separating rail tracks, with $350 million authorized annually from 2006 to 2009. Grants must not exceed $20 million each, with a focus on enhancing rail infrastructure capacity and alleviating bottlenecks. The SAFETEA legislation in the 109th Congress addresses rail industry efficiency and captive shipper concerns. It includes a federal grants program for relocating or grade separating rail tracks, with $350 million authorized annually from 2006 to 2009. Grants must not exceed $20 million each, with a focus on enhancing rail infrastructure capacity and alleviating bottlenecks. Additionally, there are specific projects funded under \"Projects of National and Regional Significance\" to improve rail connections and eliminate grade crossings in various areas. The SAFETEA legislation in the 109th Congress includes funding for rail track relocation and grade separation projects, with specific allocations such as $125 million for Chicago area crossings, $14 million for East Los Angeles crossings, $15 million for Port of Portsmouth rail line relocation, and $6 million grants for improving freight mobility around U.S. ports. Additionally, a comprehensive study of the nation's rail transportation system is mandated, along with a new grant program for enhancing freight distribution around international and inland ports. The SAFETEA legislation in the 109th Congress includes funding for rail track relocation and grade separation projects, with specific allocations for various areas. It also creates a new grant program called the \"Freight Intermodal Distribution Pilot Grant Program\" that provides $6 million in grants annually from 2005 to 2009 for improving freight mobility around U.S. international ports, inland ports, and intermodal freight facilities. The program designates six projects in different states to carry out the program. Additionally, the legislation continues the Recreational Trails Program (RTP) as a state-administered, federal-aid program to develop and maintain recreational trails for various uses. The Recreational Trails Program (RTP) under SAFETEA authorizes $370 million in funding for FY2005-2009. Funds are allocated to states based on a legislative formula, with 30% for motorized trail uses, 30% for non-motorized trail uses, and 40% for diverse trail uses. States must use funds for approved purposes and are subject to annual obligation limitations. Under SAFETEA, the Recreational Trails Program (RTP) is subject to annual obligation limitations. States must allocate 30% of funds for motorized trail uses, 30% for non-motorized trail uses, and 40% for diverse trail uses. SAFETEA eliminates the discretionary waiver for the 30% provisions but retains the small state exemption. The federal share for RTP projects is changed to a sliding scale share. States are encouraged to use youth conservation or service corps for trail construction and maintenance. Educational funds can now be used for non-law enforcement trail safety and monitoring patrols. SAFETEA expands permissible uses for RTP funding, including trail safety and training. It allows funding for trail condition assessment and permits pre-approval planning costs to be credited towards project expenses. Environmental compliance documentation is required before applying for RTP funds. DOT must comply with environmental review requirements before highway or transit project construction. Before final design, property acquisition, or construction on a highway or transit project can proceed, DOT (i.e., FHWA or FTA) must comply with certain environmental review requirements, including those of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA, 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.). NEPA requires all federal agencies to consider the environmental impacts of proposed federal actions. To ensure that environmental impacts are considered before final decisions are made, NEPA requires DOT to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) for any federally funded action that significantly affects the quality of the human environment. If a project's impacts are determined to be significant at any time during the assessment, an EIS must be prepared. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires the preparation of an environmental assessment (EA) for projects with significant impacts. If impacts are deemed significant, an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) must be prepared. Projects with no significant effects are processed as categorical exclusions. Compliance with Section 4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act of 1966 is also required, which pertains to the use of certain resources for transportation projects. The law prohibits the use of Section 4(f) resources for transportation projects unless no alternative exists, with a focus on minimizing harm. Environmental Streamlining provisions in TEA-21 aim to expedite federally funded transportation projects while protecting the environment through improved interagency cooperation. The Streamlining provisions of TEA-21 required the Department of Transportation to develop a coordinated environmental review process for highway projects with significant environmental impact. SAFETEA includes provisions to further expedite the environmental review process for highway construction and transit projects. SAFETEA includes provisions to streamline the environmental review process for highway construction and transit projects, primarily focusing on NEPA and Section 4(f) requirements. The goal is to expedite compliance with environmental regulations, similar to the streamlining provisions in TEA-21. SAFETEA provisions aim to expedite compliance with environmental requirements, particularly NEPA and Section 4(f). Key changes include the establishment of a \"participating agency\" in the NEPA process, setting deadlines for collaborative development of project statements, and implementing a 180-day statute of limitation on judicial claims for final agency actions related to environmental requirements. The SAFETEA provisions aim to expedite compliance with environmental requirements, including NEPA and Section 4(f). Key changes include establishing a \"participating agency\" for collaborative development of project statements, setting deadlines, implementing a 180-day statute of limitation on judicial claims, allowing the use of transportation funds to expedite the environmental review process, establishing a dispute resolution process for disagreements, allowing states to determine categorical exclusions, and creating state pilot programs for federal compliance with environmental laws. Section 4(f) allows for the use of certain resources with \"de minimis impacts\" with concurrence from the jurisdictional official. SAFETEA provisions allow for the use of publicly owned parks, recreation areas, wildlife refuges, and historic sites with \"de minimis impacts\" if concurrence is obtained from the relevant jurisdictional official. Regulations are required to clarify factors for determining \"prudent and feasible\" alternatives under Section 4(f) requirements. The Interstate System cannot be considered a \"historic site\" under Section 4(f) provisions. The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) directed the Secretary of DOT to establish a Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ) program to reduce emissions from highway travel and assist states in complying with air quality standards. Eligible projects include those aimed at reducing carbon monoxide and ozone levels. The CMAQ Program aims to reduce emissions from highway travel to help states comply with air quality standards by funding projects to reduce carbon monoxide and ozone levels. Projects eligible for CMAQ funds include transportation control measures, auto emission control programs, alternative fuel vehicles, traffic flow improvements, and pedestrian/bicycle facilities. Funding is apportioned based on a state's population and pollution reduction needs, with a minimum guarantee for states without nonattainment areas. TEA-21 expanded the program to include projects targeting particulate matter reduction. SAFETEA expanded CMAQ funding eligibility to include projects like advanced truck stop electrification systems, transportation systems management improvements, emergency communications equipment, and diesel retrofits. Total CMAQ funding for FY2005-FY2009 was $8.6 billion, compared to $8.1 billion under TEA-21. SAFETEA expanded CMAQ funding eligibility to include projects like advanced truck stop electrification systems, transportation systems management improvements, emergency communications equipment, and diesel retrofits. It also directed DOT to evaluate CMAQ projects for their impact on air quality and congestion levels. The Clean Air Act requires areas with air quality issues to develop State Implementation Plans (SIPs) to reach attainment. Federal agencies are prohibited from funding projects in these areas unless they conform to the SIPs to prevent new violations or delays in reaching standards. The Clean Air Act prohibits federal agencies from funding projects in areas with air quality issues unless they conform to State Implementation Plans (SIPs) to prevent violations or delays in reaching standards. Projects must not cause new violations, increase existing violations, or delay standard attainment. Transportation Improvement Programs (TIPs) must demonstrate conformity every two years for highway and transit projects to receive federal funds. Conformity requirements are expected to have a greater impact due to emissions growth from SUVs, court decisions tightening rules, and increased vehicle miles traveled. The impact of conformity requirements is expected to increase in the next few years due to emissions growth from SUVs, court decisions tightening rules, and increased vehicle miles traveled. More stringent air quality standards will lead to additional areas being subject to conformity, potentially leading to temporary suspension of highway and transit funds in numerous metropolitan areas. Only 5 metropolitan areas had to change transportation plans in the past six years to resolve conformity lapses, but about one-third of local transportation planners anticipate difficulty demonstrating conformity in the future. The Clean Air Act provides no authority for waivers of conformity, with only a one-year grace period allowed for nonattainment areas. Limited exempt projects can be funded in lapsed areas, but new projects that could reduce emissions are not allowed. Concerns include a mismatch between SIP, TIP, and long-range transportation planning cycles, with calls for less frequent but better-coordinated conformity demonstrations. The GAO recommended relevant federal agencies consider extending the three-year time frame for conformity demonstrations. The Clean Air Act does not allow waivers of conformity, only a one-year grace period for nonattainment areas. Concerns include a mismatch between SIP, TIP, and long-range transportation planning cycles, with calls for less frequent but better-coordinated conformity demonstrations. P.L. 109-59 requires less frequent conformity demonstrations (at least every four years instead of every two years) and shortens the planning horizon to 10 years in many cases. The law also establishes a 12-month grace period following a failure to demonstrate conformity. The Clean Air Act requires conformity demonstrations every four years instead of every two years, shortening the planning horizon to 10 years in many cases. A 12-month grace period is allowed after a failure to demonstrate conformity. The local air pollution control agency must be consulted and public comments solicited if the planning horizon is to be shortened."
