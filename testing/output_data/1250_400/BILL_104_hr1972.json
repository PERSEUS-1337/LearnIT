    "content": "The \"Independent Contractor Tax Simplification Act of 1995\" aims to establish fair and objective rules for determining who is an employee and who is an independent contractor. The Act was a top priority at the 1995 White House Conference on Small Business, where delegates recommended recognizing the legitimacy of independent contractors and establishing realistic guidelines. The Act introduces standards for determining whether individuals are not employees. The \"Independent Contractor Tax Simplification Act of 1995\" sets criteria for determining independent contractor status. If specific requirements are met, the service provider is not considered an employee, the service recipient is not an employer, and the payor is not an employer. The requirements include significant investment, unreimbursed expenses, specific time or result agreements, commission-based payment, or product resale.
