    "content": "The diversity visa lottery encourages legal immigration from countries other than major sending countries to the US. It was added to the Immigration and Nationality Act in 1990 to stimulate new migration. The lottery makes 55,000 visas available annually to countries with lower immigrant admissions in the past five years. The allocation of visas is based on regional populations. The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services Bureau (USCIS) allocates visas based on regional populations, with a limit of 7% per country. Recipients become legal permanent residents (LPRs) of the US. The diversity lottery's annual ceiling was reduced to 50,000 starting in FY1999 to offset immigrant visa numbers for certain asylum seekers. The diversity visa program reduces the annual ceiling to 50,000 visas starting in FY1999. In FY2002, 42,829 persons were admitted or adjusted as LPRs with diversity visas, representing 4% of all LPRs. The top five countries in FY2002 were Albania, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Poland, and Ukraine. These countries consistently rank among the top diversity visa sending countries. The top diversity visa sending countries in FY1997-FY2002 were Albania, Nigeria, Russia, Ukraine, and other countries like Bangladesh, Bulgaria, Morocco, Romania, and Ireland. European immigrants received 39.4% of diversity visas, while African immigrants received 38.1%. The numbers for Russia and Ukraine may be understated due to nationals born in the Soviet Union. European immigrants comprised 39.4% of diversity visa recipients, while African immigrants received 38.1%. To be eligible for a diversity visa, an alien must have a high school education or equivalent, or two years of experience in a relevant occupation. Visa winners undergo reviews by Department of State consular officers and DHS inspectors to ensure eligibility for entry into the U.S. The diversity visa lottery is open to natives of certain foreign countries. Winners undergo reviews to ensure eligibility for entry into the U.S. Exclusion criteria include health, criminal history, security concerns, and more. The FY2005 lottery was announced in August 2003, with applications submitted electronically for the first time. The FY2005 diversity visa lottery had a 60-day application period from November 1 to December 30, 2003. Applications had to be submitted electronically for the first time, with ineligible countries including Canada, China, India, and others. Over 2 million applications were disqualified in FY2003 for not following instructions. In the FY2003 diversity visa lottery, over 2 million applications were disqualified for not following instructions issued by the State Department. Husbands and wives can submit separate entries, and unmarried children under 21 qualify as derivative beneficiaries. If a winner dies before obtaining LPR status, the visa is revoked, and derivative beneficiaries lose their entitlement. Winners of the FY2005 lottery will be notified by mail between May and July 2004. The State Department randomly selects winners of the diversity visa lottery, with notifications expected between May and July 2004. Winners must act quickly to demonstrate eligibility for a visa, as more applications are received than visas available. Some question the continuation of the lottery, preferring the visas be used to reduce backlog in other categories. The diversity visa lottery selects winners randomly, with notifications between May and July 2004. Some argue for using the 55,000 visas to reduce backlog in other categories, while supporters believe it brings new immigrants to a system dominated by family-based immigrants. There are debates on amending the INA to exclude countries sponsoring terrorism from the lottery. Supporters of the diversity visa lottery argue that the policy should be uniformly applied, while some suggest charging a fee to enter the lottery. The State Department is addressing concerns about fraud and misuse of the program."
