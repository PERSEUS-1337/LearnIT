The President requested $324.2 million for FY2008, with $100 million for state grants and $224.2 million for national programs. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended $526.0 million and $492.5 million respectively for FY2008, including $310 million for state grants. For FY2007, the President requested $216.0 million for national programs only. The 107th Congress approved reauthorization legislation for the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act (SDFSCA) through FY2007. Funding for the program in FY2006 was $568.8 million, with $346.5 million for state grants and $222.3 million for national programs. The program operates at FY2006 levels under a continuing resolution. The No Child Left Behind Act amended and reauthorized SDFSCA as Part A of Title IV\u201421st Century Schools, providing funds to prevent drug abuse and violence in schools. The Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act (SDFSCA) authorizes funds for programs to prevent drug abuse and violence in schools. State grants are awarded to outlying areas, state educational agencies, and local educational agencies in all 50 states, DC, and Puerto Rico. National programs are supported through discretionary funds for various projects. For FY2002, $650 million was authorized for state grants, with additional funding for succeeding fiscal years. Reservations are made for specific territories and programs for Indian youth. The Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act authorizes funds for programs to prevent drug abuse and violence in schools. State grants are awarded to various entities in all 50 states, DC, and Puerto Rico. Reservations are made for specific territories and programs for Indian youth. Funds are distributed based on a formula considering population and concentration grants, with a minimum allocation for each state. Unused funds may be redistributed, and there is a limitation on fund usage. State grants for the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act are distributed based on a formula considering population and concentration grants. Each state receives an equal proportional share of its grant, with funds potentially redistributed if not used within two years. A limitation on fund increases for national programs is in place unless state grant funding is at least 10% more than the previous year. 20% of the state allotment goes to the Governor for competitive grants and contracts, with a maximum of 3% for administrative costs. At least 93% of the allotment must be distributed to Local Education Agencies (LEAs). In FY2002, state grants for the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act were distributed with 20% going to the Governor for competitive grants and contracts. An SEA must distribute at least 93% of its allotment to LEAs for drug and violence prevention programs. LEAs may use up to 2% of the amount received for administrative costs. SEAs may use up to 3% of their allotments for program administration. In addition to the 3% for administrative costs, funds could have been used to implement a uniform management information and reporting system (UMIRS) to collect information on truancy rates, violence, and drug-related crimes in schools. SEAs may use up to 5% of funds for state activities such as capacity building, technical assistance, and program improvement services. PART is an instrument developed by the Administration to examine performance. The state grants component of the SDFSC program was rated \"ineffective\" by the Administration due to lack of demonstrated program effectiveness and thin distribution of funds. Approximately 64% of LEAs received less than $10,000 per year, which was deemed insufficient for effective drug prevention and school safety programs. The state grants program lacked measurable positive outcomes, leading to a proposal for changes in the FY2007 budget. The state grants program under the SDFSC was deemed ineffective due to insufficient funding of less than $10,000 per year for most LEAs. As a result, the Administration proposed to terminate the program in favor of funding higher-priority national programs that were seen as more promising in achieving positive outcomes in drug and violence prevention. The Department of Education aims to provide sufficient funding to select LEAs for effective programs, using national survey data to assess progress and measure outcomes. The authorization for national programs is for FY2002 through FY2007, allowing the ED Secretary to consult with the Department. The Department of Education provides funding for LEAs to improve data collection and analysis for SDFSC programs. National programs are authorized for FY2002 through FY2007, allowing collaboration with other agencies to prevent violence and drug use among students. Funds may be reserved for program evaluation and the Safe Schools/Healthy Students initiative. The National Coordinator Initiative was created in FY1999 to recruit coordinators for middle schools to address drug experimentation and violence among students. In FY1999, the National Coordinator Initiative was established to recruit coordinators for middle schools to address drug experimentation and violence among students. The initiative expanded to all schools with drug and safety issues under NCLBA, but funding was terminated in FY2004. Funds may be allocated to states based on school-aged population and ESEA Title I, Part A concentration grants. Competitive grants can be awarded to LEAs for alcohol abuse reduction programs. Grants may be awarded to LEAs for alcohol abuse reduction programs in secondary schools, as well as for mentoring programs in middle schools. Other initiatives include grants for hate crime-affected localities and the establishment of a School Security Technology and Resource Center. The President requested $324.2 million for the SDFSC program in FY2008, including grants for LEAs and community-based groups to assist localities affected by hate crimes, creating a School Security Technology and Resource Center, and establishing a National Center for School and Youth Safety. The President requested $324.2 million for the SDFSC program in FY2008, with funding allocated for state grants and national programs. The House Appropriations Committee recommended a total of $526.0 million, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $492.5 million for the program. The Senate Committee recommended $492.5 million for the SDFSC program in FY2008, including $310 million for state grants and $182.5 million for national programs. The President did not request funding for the mentoring program in FY2008. The President requested $216.0 million for national programs in FY2008, $6.3 million less than FY2006. No funding was requested for the mentoring program in FY2008. In FY2007, $19 million was requested for mentoring as it was the final year of a phase-out. Congress appropriated $49.3 million for mentoring in FY2006, with a slight reduction due to budget cuts. Funding for the Alcohol Abuse Reduction program was not requested from FY2005-2008, but Congress allocated $32.7 million for FY2005 and FY2006. The Administration did not request funding for the Alcohol Abuse Reduction (AAR) program from FY2005 through FY2008, as it was considered duplicative of other activities. Congress allocated $32.7 million for AAR in FY2005 and FY2006, with slight reductions due to budget cuts. The Gun-Free Schools Act (GFSA) was incorporated into the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act (SDFSCA) to mandate expulsion for students bringing weapons to school. The Gun-Free Schools Act (GFSA) was included in the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act (SDFSCA) to require expulsion of students bringing weapons to school. States must have a law mandating one-year expulsion for such students, but LEAs can modify this on a case-by-case basis. LEAs must report incidents involving firearms, and GFSA funds are contingent on reporting to the criminal justice system. The Gun-Free Schools Act (GFSA) requires expulsion of students bringing weapons to school and mandates LEAs to report incidents involving firearms. LEAs must have a policy for reporting students with firearms to the criminal justice system to receive GFSA funds. Bills related to school safety and violence prevention were introduced during the 109th Congress, with one bill (H.R. 3010) requiring a study on the effectiveness of violence prevention programs under SDFSCA, but it did not become law. During the 109th Congress, various bills related to school safety and violence prevention were introduced, including H.R. 283, H.R. 284, H.R. 3655, H.R. 5295, S. 1974, and S. 4028. These bills aimed to address issues such as bullying, gang prevention, school violence, and drug-free sports. However, amendments to increase funding for violence prevention programs under SDFSCA were not included in the final legislation. During the 109th Congress, bills like H.R. 283, H.R. 284, H.R. 3655, H.R. 5295, S. 1974, and S. 4028 were introduced to address school safety, bullying, gang prevention, and drug-free sports. H.R. 283, introduced by Representative Sanchez, aimed to cover bullying and gang prevention under SDFSCA. H.R. 284, introduced by Representative Shimkus, sought to include bullying and harassment prevention programs under SDFSCA as well. During the 109th Congress, bills like H.R. 284, H.R. 3655, and H.R. 5295 were introduced to address school safety by including bullying and harassment prevention programs under SDFSCA. H.R. 3655 aimed to improve state and local prevention programs based on a 2002 study, while H.R. 5295 focused on student and teacher safety, passing the House in 2006. The Student and Teacher Safety Act of 2006, introduced by Representative Geoff Davis, required LEAs to have policies allowing teachers to search students for weapons or drugs. Non-compliant LEAs would lose SDFSCA funds. The Drug Free Varsity Sports Act of 2005, introduced by Senator Bill Nelson, aimed to test high school students for performance-enhancing drug use through pilot programs. The Drug Free Varsity Sports Act of 2005 (S. 1974) introduced by Senator Bill Nelson aimed to test high school students for performance-enhancing drug use through pilot programs. The Fighting Gangs and Empowering Youth Act of 2006 (S. 4028) introduced by Senator Menendez would have reauthorized SDFSCA, increased state grants authorization levels, and allocated funds for national programs, including hiring gang prevention coordinators and drug prevention coordinators in LEAs. Additionally, mentoring program grants would have been awarded with a reserved amount of $50 million. The bill proposed hiring gang prevention coordinators and drug prevention coordinators in LEAs, reserving $50 million for mentoring program grants. It also included an Anti-Gang Discretionary Grant to combat gang activity in schools and communities, prioritizing programs in high crime areas. One bill introduced in the 110th Congress related to SDFSCA is H.R. 354, the Safe Schools Against Violence in Education Act (SAVE Act). It would allow students in unsafe school environments to transfer to a safer school within the same district, including private charter schools, and provide counseling or removal of offenders. H.R. 354, the Safe Schools Against Violence in Education Act (SAVE Act), allows students in unsafe school environments to transfer to a safer school within the same district, including private charter schools, and provides counseling or removal of offenders. The bill differs from current law by expanding the definition of a victim to include incidents on school buses or at school functions. H.R. 354, the Safe Schools Against Violence in Education Act (SAVE Act), allows students in unsafe school environments to transfer to a safer school within the same district, including private charter schools, and provides counseling or removal of offenders. The Administration recommends restructuring the SDFSC program to focus on creating safe, drug-free, healthy, and secure school environments. Congress may consider reauthorizing the SDFSCA and consolidating national programs into a flexible grant program focusing on emergencies, violence and drug-use prevention, school culture and climate, and improving the learning environment for high academic standards. Congress may consider reauthorizing the SDFSCA and consolidating national programs into a flexible grant program focusing on emergencies, violence and drug-use prevention, school culture and climate, and improving the learning environment for high academic standards. Policy makers might require K-12 schools to report school crime data to law enforcement agencies, potentially shifting responsibility for school safety and crime data collection from the Department of Education to the Department of Justice. The Department of Justice (DOJ) may be considered for taking over responsibility for school safety and crime data collection from the Department of Education (ED) due to its expertise in crime analysis. Restructuring state grant programs, with ED focusing on drug and alcohol prevention and suicide prevention, while DOJ handles school safety and emergency preparedness programs, could be a potential solution. Another option could be allowing K-12 schools to apply for Department of Homeland Security (DHS) funding for increased security measures. The Department of Justice (DOJ) may take over school safety and emergency preparedness programs from the Department of Education (ED) due to its expertise in crime analysis. Legislation allowing K-12 schools to apply for Department of Homeland Security (DHS) funding for security measures is another potential option. The Unsafe School Choice provision of the ESEA, as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act, could have unintended consequences regarding school safety definitions and transfers. State education officials may define persistently dangerous schools in a way that local schools never meet the criteria, leading to underreporting of school crime. This could result in schools missing out on funding for violence prevention grants. The lack of funding for schools labeled as persistently dangerous hinders their ability to improve safety programs, while federal and state budgets continue to cut school safety funds."
