    "content": "The federal government has a strong interest in regulating hazardous chemicals security to prevent terrorist attacks since 9/11. Congress focuses on security of chemicals in rail, tanker trucks, and commercial facilities. Legislation like H.R. 2651 and S. 1052 aim to increase penalties for criminal activities around ports and marine vessels. Congress is reviewing federal policies related to marine transportation of hazardous chemical cargo, with a focus on increasing penalties for criminal or terrorist activities around ports and marine vessels. The report provides an overview of hazardous chemicals marine transportation in the United States, discussing risks, potential public impact in a terrorist attack, shipment volumes, port locations, and relevant maritime security regulations. The report focuses on hazardous chemical marine shipments in U.S. waters, including shipment volumes and port locations. It addresses security policy issues, risk uncertainties, resources, and effectiveness. The report discusses marine chemicals security as part of the nation's overall chemical security strategy, specifically focusing on threats to the general public from chemical releases during marine transport. It does not cover other maritime security hazards like petroleum products or biological agents. The report focuses on threats to the general public from hazardous chemical marine shipments in U.S. waters. It highlights the potential dangers of these chemicals being intentionally released near populated areas, emphasizing the importance of protecting these shipments as part of U.S. homeland security strategy. The protection of hazardous chemical shipments passing through U.S. waterways and ports is crucial for homeland security. While marine shipments of hazardous chemicals are potential terrorist targets, no attacks have occurred. However, accidents involving these shipments have shown the potential impact on nearby communities. Foreign terrorists have targeted other types of marine vessels overseas, and intelligence suggests they may target hazardous chemical shipping in the U.S. Although major accidents involving hazardous chemical transportation are rare, they have been some of the deadliest industrial accidents ever recorded. Intelligence suggests terrorists may target hazardous chemical shipping in the United States. Major accidents involving hazardous chemicals are rare but have been some of the deadliest industrial accidents ever recorded, such as the explosions in Halifax in 1917 and Texas City in 1947. Improved safety practices have prevented similar disasters in the past 60 years, but incidents have still forced evacuations of coastal populations. Serious incidents involving chemical marine shipments have forced evacuations of coastal populations in the past 60 years. Examples include fires aboard ships carrying toxic chemicals in Somalia, Spain, and Scotland. While no serious casualties occurred, emergency responders were highly concerned for public safety. Terrorists have attempted to release chemicals from land-based facilities, but have not used marine cargo vessels for chemical attacks on the general public. During the 1990s, combatants and domestic terrorists attempted to release chemicals from land-based manufacturing and storage facilities in foreign war zones like Croatia. Similar incidents occurred in the United States, with criminals trying to release chemicals from facilities in California and Texas. Terrorists have targeted marine vessels, with notable attacks on U.S. and British warships in the Straits of Gibraltar and the successful attack on the oil tanker Limburg off the Yemeni coast. Foreign governments have expressed concerns about terrorist groups commandeering hazardous chemical vessels. In June 2002, Moroccan authorities foiled an Al-Qaeda plot to attack U.S. and British warships in the Straits of Gibraltar. In October 2002, the oil tanker Limburg was successfully attacked off the Yemeni coast. Concerns have been raised about terrorist groups commandeering hazardous chemical vessels. The Department of Homeland Security is concerned about the security of chemical infrastructure, including chemical tanker ships. The President's National Strategy highlights the challenge of protecting high consequence cargo in ports. LNG tankers have been identified as potential terrorist targets. The President's National Strategy emphasizes the security challenges posed by hazardous marine cargo, specifically liquefied natural gas (LNG). The DHS has identified LNG tankers as potential terrorist targets due to the real risks associated with their shipments. Various potential terrorist attacks on LNG tankers have been considered credible, including ramming, explosives, hijacking, and external actions like missile or airplane attacks. Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 directs focus on terrorist attacks that could cause catastrophic health effects or mass casualties comparable to those from a weapon of mass destruction. Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD-7) directs federal homeland security activities to focus on terrorist attacks that could cause catastrophic health effects or mass casualties comparable to those from a weapon of mass destruction. Hazardous chemical cargo on commercial marine vessels could pose a catastrophic hazard to the general public if accidentally released or combusted, leading to poisoning, asphyxiation, chemical burns, or thermal burns. Federal standards from the Department of Transportation, Coast Guard, and Environmental Protection Agency regulate the transportation of hazardous materials. The Department of Transportation (DOT) regulates hazardous materials transportation under the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act of 1975. They classify materials in 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 172.101 and require security plans for highly hazardous cargo. The DOT ranks hazardous materials by class and division in 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 173.2a and requires security plans for \"highly hazardous\" cargo, including radioactive materials, explosives, poisonous inhalation materials, bulk hazardous liquids/gases/solids, and certain regulated agents. The Coast Guard enforces federal hazardous material laws for marine vessels in U.S. waters. The Coast Guard enforces federal hazardous material laws for marine vessels in U.S. waters, including regulations for certain dangerous cargoes and special requirements for vessels carrying hazardous materials. The Coast Guard enforces federal hazardous material laws for marine vessels carrying various hazardous materials, including bulk solid and liquid materials, liquified gas, compressed gas, and incompatible chemicals. Regulations also cover hazardous marine cargoes at waterfront facilities. The EPA regulates stationary facilities handling hazardous substances under the Clean Air Act, requiring risk management plans for facilities with specified quantities of hazardous substances. The EPA regulates stationary facilities handling hazardous substances under the Clean Air Act, requiring risk management plans for facilities with specified quantities of hazardous substances. These plans summarize the potential threat from sudden, large releases of certain hazardous substances and include off-site consequence analysis for worst-case accidents, prevention measures, and damage mitigation. The Clean Air Act Amendments defined hazardous substances to include listed substances like chlorine and ammonia, with the EPA designating additional chemicals based on criteria like potential health effects, likelihood of releases, and human exposure. EPA promulgated lists of acutely toxic substances, flammable gases, volatile flammable liquids, and high explosive substances. The EPA promulgated a list of hazardous chemicals based on criteria like potential health effects, likelihood of releases, and human exposure. The list includes acutely toxic substances, flammable gases, volatile flammable liquids, and high explosive substances. The EPA/RMP list excludes certain substances like flammable fuels. Most hazardous materials on DOT and Coast Guard lists do not pose catastrophic health hazards to the general public. The EPA list identifies chemicals with the greatest potential consequences. The EPA list of hazardous chemicals focuses on substances with the greatest potential consequences, including those considered most hazardous on land. This list serves as the basis for marine cargo hazard analysis, with most substances also found on DOT and Coast Guard lists. Radioactive materials and explosives are notable exceptions not included in the EPA/RMP list. The EPA/RMP list of hazardous chemicals is used for marine cargo hazard analysis and aligns with DOT and Coast Guard lists. Radioactive materials and explosives, not on the EPA/RMP list, make up less than 0.3% of U.S. hazardous marine cargo. The EPA/RMP chemicals are broadly classified as acutely toxic or flammable, with variations in toxicity and flammability among specific chemicals like Ammonia. Ammonia is a toxic gas used in fertilizer production and other industries. It can cause skin and respiratory irritation. Methane, used as a heating fuel, can be asphyxiating and flammable. Methyloxirane is used in manufacturing various industrial products. Methyloxirane is a toxic liquid used in manufacturing industrial products. It can irritate eyes, skin, and respiratory tract and is flammable when mixed with air. Uncontrolled release of chemicals on the EPA/RMP list can have varying effects on the exposed population. EPA considers all RMP chemicals hazardous to the public above threshold quantities. The EPA considers all RMP chemicals hazardous above threshold quantities, warranting special regulatory treatment. Chemical properties may differ over water, affecting the health hazards in a marine incident. Some chemicals dissolve or sink in water, reducing public hazard, while others evaporate quickly or create larger hazard zones in a marine release compared to land. Some chemicals in marine incidents dissolve or sink in water, reducing public hazard, while others evaporate quickly or create larger hazard zones. Further research is needed to understand the relative marine hazards of specific chemicals. The Army Corps of Engineers maintains statistics on marine commerce in U.S. waters, which can be used to estimate the shipping volumes of EPA/RMP chemicals. Table 1 summarizes the total U.S. waterborne shipments of these chemicals by hazard category. According to ACE statistics, a subset of EPA/RMP chemicals are transported through U.S. waters in significant quantities. In 2003, over 48 million tons of these hazardous chemicals passed through U.S. waters, accounting for 2% of total U.S. waterborne cargo tonnage. The hazardous materials on the EPA/RMP list are included primarily because their chemical properties make them hazardous to human health. To be a potentially catastrophic threat, these materials must be present in large enough volumes to impact nearby populations in the event of a maritime release. In 2003, over 100,000 marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous cargo passed through U.S. waterways, with the total number of shipments and average cargo tons per shipment summarized in Figure 1. The overall volume of hazardous material in a marine shipment is crucial in evaluating potential public impacts of terrorist attacks, as a larger number of shipments could increase the overall terrorist risk. Cargo vessels may load or unload partial cargoes at multiple locations, leading to varying tonnages of cargo carried aboard a vessel at any time. In 2003, marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals exceeded the 20,000 pound threshold, requiring off-site risk management plans. The data in Figure 1 show the total number of shipments and average cargo tons per shipment, plotted on a logarithmic scale for clarity. The EPA regulations specify minimum threshold quantities for risk planning between 500 and 20,000 pounds for these chemicals. Based on the data, most hazardous chemicals in marine shipments in 2003 exceeded the EPA/RMP 20,000 pound threshold, requiring off-site risk management plans. Different types of vessels transport hazardous cargo, with tankers and liquid chemical barges being the most common. Cargo vessel characteristics play a crucial role in determining their vulnerability to accidents or attacks. Liquefied gas tankers are oceangoing ships designed to carry various liquefied gas cargoes such as butane, propane, LNG, butadiene, and ammonia. These tankers have large onboard tanks for storage. Liquefied gas tankers are designed to carry various liquefied gas cargoes like butane, propane, LNG, butadiene, and ammonia. The tanks are pressurized, refrigerated, and insulated to meet cargo needs. International shipping codes set standards for construction and operation, with robust double-hulled tanks for high pressure or low temperature resistance. This design ensures structural integrity, making them highly resistant to grounding and collision damage. Liquefied gas tankers have cargo tanks above a double bottom and inboard of the outer hull, providing greater structural integrity. LNG tankers carry only LNG, while others may carry a combination of different cargoes. Tanker capacities vary, with LNG tankers ranging from 25,000 m3 to 147,000 m3, and plans for new construction up to 200,000 m3. Chemical parcel tankers have capacities ranging from 3,000 to 50,000 tons and can carry multiple liquid and chemical cargoes in separate cargo tanks. They are versatile vessels designed for carrying EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals. Chemical parcel tankers, like gas carriers, adhere to international construction standards with cargo tanks lined with specialized coatings to ensure compatibility with various chemicals. They have double bottoms or hulls to prevent contact between incompatible cargoes and can carry multiple hazardous chemicals simultaneously. Liquid chemical barges are shallow draft vessels designed for bulk liquid chemicals in coastal regions and inland waterways, similar to parcel tankers with separate cargo tanks lined with special coatings. Liquid chemical barges are shallow draft vessels designed to carry bulk liquid chemicals, primarily in coastal regions and through inland waterways. These barges can carry multiple hazardous chemicals in separate cargo tanks, ranging in size from 700 to 3,500 tons of total cargo capacity. Larger barges transporting hazardous chemicals are typically double-hulled and self-propelled, while smaller ones may rely on tugboats for movement. Inland barges travel in groups, with some being refrigerated and capable of carrying ammonia, propylene, or other refrigerated chemicals. Liquid chemical barges can carry hazardous chemicals in separate cargo tanks, with sizes ranging from 700 to 3,500 tons. Larger barges are double-hulled and self-propelled, while smaller ones rely on tugboats. Inland barges can carry refrigerated chemicals like ammonia and propylene. Hazardous chemicals can also be transported on container ships in various ways, including tank containers, drums, and portable tanks. Large quantities of hazardous chemicals can be present on container ships at any time. Container ships can carry large quantities of hazardous chemicals in designated cargo areas. Hazardous chemicals may also be shipped on general cargo ships, container barges, ferries, and other vessels. The public hazards associated with these chemicals are proportional to volume, and can be compared to volumes in other modes of transportation and stationary storage facilities on land. Marine vessels, rail tank cars, and highway tanker trucks are all used for transporting hazardous chemicals. Comparing the volumes of hazardous chemicals on marine vessels, rail tank cars, and highway tanker trucks is informative. These modes of transportation have varying cargo capacities, with rail tank cars carrying 50 to 90 tons, containerized tank cars on flatbed railcars carrying up to 70 tons, and highway tanker trucks carrying 15 to 30 tons. This information is summarized in Table 2. The typical range of cargo tank capacity for marine, rail, and highway tankers transporting EPA/RMP chemicals varies, with marine tankers generally having a much larger capacity than rail or highway tankers. Comparing actual volumes shipped across these modes is challenging due to partial cargoes and multiple shipments. Marine shipments of hazardous materials are often larger than land shipments based on average volumes and tank capacities. The EPA maintains a database of on-site chemical storage volumes for facilities required to file risk management plans. Comparing marine shipment volumes to land storage volumes for EPA/RMP chemicals shows that marine shipments are often larger. The database helps estimate the quantity of chemicals across facilities. The EPA database contains on-site chemical storage volumes for facilities with risk management plans. Comparing marine shipment volumes to land storage volumes for EPA/RMP chemicals reveals that marine shipments are typically larger, especially for chemicals shipped in higher volumes. This suggests that higher volume cargo is often transported in larger vessels. Facility volumes of EPA/RMP chemicals show that marine shipments are generally larger than volumes stored at chemical plants, especially for higher volume chemicals. Marine shipments either start or end at U.S. ports, serving as transportation hubs or receiving hazardous cargo for industrial use. Port facilities vary in their prevalence of transportation and industrial activities, leading to significant variations in marine shipments of EPA/RMP chemicals between ports. Marine cargo for industrial processes like petrochemical refining, water treatment, and fertilizer production is transported through U.S. ports. Hazardous cargo is also produced at some port facilities. There are over 360 commercial ports in the United States, with 113 ports handling EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals in 2003. The top 30 ports handled 95% of the hazardous cargo tonnage. In 2003, 113 U.S. ports handled EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals, with the top 30 ports managing 95% of the tonnage. These ports are located in 15 states, primarily in the Gulf of Mexico region. The volume of hazardous cargo in each port varies, and security concerns exist for all ports handling such cargo. The top 30 hazardous chemical ports in the US are mainly located in the Gulf of Mexico region, with Texas having the most ports. LPG and ammonia are the most frequently shipped hazardous cargoes. The characteristics of these chemicals were previously discussed in the report. Great Lakes ports are not included in the top 30 list. The characteristics of ammonia, a toxic and potentially explosive gas, are summarized in the report. The top 30 ports handling hazardous cargo in 2003 are listed in Table 4, based on EPA/RMP estimates. Other key factors affecting terrorism risk in U.S. ports include DOT hazardous cargo shipments, non-chemical cargo hazards, passenger traffic, proximity to populations, and port infrastructure. The Department of Homeland Security considers these factors in its Port Security Grant Program. The Department of Homeland Security considers various factors in its Port Security Grant Program, providing security enhancement grants to U.S. ports. The Coast Guard oversees maritime security, including vessel and port security, with a focus on hazardous cargo. Coast Guard regulations ensure the safe construction of vessels carrying hazardous cargo. The Coast Guard focuses on maritime security, including vessel and port security, with a special concern for ships and barges carrying hazardous cargo. Regulations specify how these vessels should be constructed and operated, as well as procedures for responding to accidental cargo releases. Post-9/11, the Coast Guard has expanded its maritime security regulations to differentiate between safety measures and security measures aimed at preventing sabotage or subversive acts. The Coast Guard has expanded its maritime security regulations post-9/11 to focus on preventing sabotage or subversive acts. Area maritime security committees assess port vulnerabilities and develop plans to address them, including deploying federal, state, and local resources. Vulnerability assessments cover vessels, facilities, and other vital port infrastructure like bridges and tunnels, enhancing security measures for key marine assets. The Coast Guard has utilized vulnerability assessments to enhance security for key marine assets and develop new maritime security standards under the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002. They have also played a leading role in creating the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (ISPS Code) to establish safety and security standards for ships and ports worldwide. The ISPS Code requires ships and certain port facilities to have approved security plans with operational and physical security measures for different threat levels. Ships and port facilities worldwide must have security plans approved by their national government, outlining security measures for different threat levels. Each must appoint a security officer, deploy necessary security equipment, monitor access, and ensure security communications. The Coast Guard reviewed and approved security plans for over 9,000 vessels by July 1, 2004, conducting on-site inspections six months later. They also assessed security at the nation's 55 strategic ports to prevent terrorist attacks. The Coast Guard has completed security assessments of the nation's 55 strategic ports to prevent terrorist attacks. They have also evaluated the vulnerability of marine tankers and inland barges carrying hazardous chemicals to various types of attacks. The agency requires U.S. bound vessels and barges to report information about the vessel, crew, cargo, and voyage to determine potential security risks. The Coast Guard requires U.S. bound vessels carrying hazardous chemicals to report information four days prior to arrival or departure. They assess security risks and may board vessels, post armed sea-marshals, and enforce security zones while transiting harbors. Vessels may need roving patrols and non-commercial traffic may be banned in high threat areas. The Coast Guard also maintains Maritime Safety and Security Teams nationwide for security operations at ports. The Coast Guard requires vessels carrying hazardous cargo to provide roving patrols on deck and at terminals. Non-commercial traffic may be banned in high threat areas. The Coast Guard maintains Maritime Safety and Security Teams nationwide for security operations at ports. Vessels calling at U.S. ports must have Automatic Identification System transponders. The Coast Guard is developing joint harbor operations centers to monitor vessel traffic. The Coast Guard is installing AIS receivers at U.S. ports and developing joint harbor operations centers to monitor vessel traffic. They are enlisting the public through the \"Waterways Watch\" program to report suspicious activity and working on secure credentials for mariners and landside workers. Patrol boats are escorting hazardous cargo vessels. The Coast Guard is collaborating with the Transportation Security Administration to enhance security for merchant mariners and landside workers. NOAA maintains emergency response capabilities for hazardous material incidents, including the CAMEO program for chemical dispersion. The CAMEO program, developed by NOAA and EPA, provides response recommendations for over 6,000 chemicals and predicts the movement of chemical gases. NOAA has linked its air dispersion models to support emergency planners. They also conduct risk assessments on hazardous chemicals at U.S. ports. NOAA and DHS coordinate federal chemicals emergency response through the Interagency Modeling and Atmospheric Assessment Center. Industry groups work to enhance security for hazardous marine cargo. Industry groups, including the Chemical Transportation Advisory Committee (CTAC) and the American Waterways Operators (AWO), collaborate with the Coast Guard to enhance security for hazardous marine cargo. CTAC formed a Subcommittee on Hazardous Cargo Transportation Security to assess vulnerability and promote industry security awareness. AWO, in consultation with the Coast Guard and Army Corps of Engineers, developed a model vessel security plan to prevent potential terrorist attacks on the inland waterway system. The American Waterways Operators (AWO) collaborated with the Coast Guard and Army Corps of Engineers to create a model vessel security plan to prevent terrorist attacks on the inland waterway system. The plan includes a list of high consequence cargoes. The Chemical Distribution Institute (CDI) inspects and issues audit reports on chemical and LPG tankers, tank storage terminals, and container ships carrying hazardous cargo. The American Chemistry Council has also issued transportation security guidelines for the chemical industry. Securing hazardous chemicals against terrorist attacks is a priority in U.S. homeland security policy. Securing hazardous chemicals against terrorist attacks is a priority in U.S. homeland security policy, especially for maritime cargo. Despite new security measures post-9/11, policy issues like risk uncertainty, resource availability, and security effectiveness require Congressional attention. Terrorism risk factors include threat, vulnerability, and consequence, with uncertainties existing in all three areas for hazardous marine cargo. Public concern about specific threats to chemical shipping may be overstated. The potential threat of terrorists targeting hazardous marine cargo in U.S. waters post-9/11 is debated. Experts acknowledge the threat information but some believe public concern is overstated. There are uncertainties in threat intelligence and the shifting goals of attackers. Vulnerability and consequence analysis of marine chemical hazards also face uncertainties. The Coast Guard has approved security assessments for vessels under the MTSA and ISPS codes. NOAA reports similar security measures. The Coast Guard has approved security assessments for vessels under the MTSA and ISPS codes, but uncertainties remain in estimating the probability of a terrorist attack on hazardous marine cargo vessels. Public controversy surrounds conflicting vulnerability and consequence studies, complicating efforts to evaluate security plans. Little information is available on the physical vulnerabilities of marine vessels to terrorist attacks. The security sensitivity of vessel vulnerability assessments and security plans complicates efforts to evaluate them. Little public information is available on the physical vulnerabilities of marine vessels to terrorist attacks. Limited research exists on intentional release of hazardous chemicals, which may have different characteristics. Assessments and plans are crucial to U.S. maritime security strategy, but their effectiveness for hazardous chemicals carriers may be limited without a full understanding of vulnerability and consequence. Reducing risk uncertainty would help prioritize maritime security activities. The federal officials face challenges in determining the risk of terror attacks on hazardous marine cargoes, but reducing risk uncertainty would help prioritize maritime security activities. Security experts can analyze vessel vulnerabilities and chemical attack consequences using standard models and methodologies. A federal role is important for ensuring methodological consistency across chemicals, vessel types, and locations. The costs associated with hazardous marine cargo security and potential diversion of resources from other government agencies are key considerations. The federal government plays a crucial role in analyzing security risks related to LNG tankers and marine terminal siting applications. Concerns include the costs of securing hazardous cargo and the potential diversion of resources from other Coast Guard missions. President Bush requested $8.1 billion for the Coast Guard in FY2006, with $2.2 billion allocated for port, waterway, and coastal security. The Coast Guard's security activities significantly increased after 9/11, with President Bush requesting $8.1 billion for the Coast Guard in FY2006. This included $2.2 billion for port, waterway, and coastal security, with additional funding for hazardous marine cargo security and general maritime security. The budget also allocated resources for new response boats, vessel monitoring systems, and increased surveillance of vessels. State and local agencies are seeking more funding to support hazardous marine cargo security. The budget includes funding for vessel monitoring systems and increased surveillance of vessels. State and local agencies are seeking more funding for hazardous marine cargo security, particularly for LNG tankers. Federal officials recommend that new LNG terminal operators cover the costs of additional maritime security. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 requires cost-sharing for LNG tanker security, but ambiguity in accounting and uncertain federal funding sources raise concerns. Some LNG companies resist paying more for public security, while others are willing to pay for \"excess\" security. New security technology and threat intelligence may lower hazardous marine cargo security costs in the future. Public agencies face significant costs to secure hazardous marine cargo from terrorist attacks. The Coast Guard has security measures in place to protect hazardous chemicals shipping, but the effectiveness of these measures is still uncertain. Questions have been raised about the efficiency of deploying security resources and evaluating security activities. Assessing progress in making the nation more secure is challenging, despite heightened awareness of maritime security needs. The Coast Guard's security activities lack performance measures to assess progress in making the nation more secure, especially in addressing hazardous cargo and terrorism risks within ports. Uncertainties exist in evaluating the effectiveness of security measures for hazardous chemical vessels, leading to questions about resource allocation and the level of security provided. The Coast Guard's security measures for hazardous chemical vessels are questioned due to uncertainties in evaluating effectiveness and resource allocation. Congress may need to assess the agency's activities in the context of maritime security responsibilities. In overseeing the Coast Guard's security activities for hazardous marine cargoes, Congress may need to evaluate effectiveness and resource allocation. Concerns also exist regarding emergency response to marine chemical attacks, with potential for overwhelming federal and local agencies in the event of a successful terrorist attack causing mass casualties and requiring specialized medical treatment. Salvage operations for vessels damaged in such attacks could pose additional challenges. Emergency response to marine chemical attacks can complicate emergency response teams and require specialized medical treatment. Salvage operations for vessels damaged in such attacks could be challenging due to the chemical hazard. It is prudent for emergency and medical authorities near potentially affected waterways to develop specific measures for dealing with chemical cargo releases. Funding from sources like the DOT's Hazardous Materials Emergency Preparedness Fund and the DHS's Homeland Security Grant Program can support the development of emergency response plans for marine chemicals. The DOT's Hazardous Materials Emergency Preparedness Fund and the DHS's Homeland Security Grant Program can provide funding for emergency response plans for marine chemicals. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 may serve as a legislative model for coastal LNG terminals and tankers. Marine shipments of hazardous chemicals pose a significant risk as potential terrorist targets, requiring both government and industry efforts to enhance maritime security. Marine shipments of hazardous chemicals are potential terrorist targets, with the Coast Guard having authority over security. Congress may question terrorism risk evaluation and resource sufficiency for securing hazardous chemical cargo. Emergency response evaluation is crucial even with tight security measures in place. Congress may assess the sufficiency of resources and effectiveness of security measures for securing hazardous chemical cargo, including evaluating emergency response capabilities of coastal communities. Balancing security resources across marine vessels, rail and highway tankers, and chemical facilities poses a policy challenge due to different homeland security authorities and regulations. Balancing chemical security resources across marine and land transportation sectors is a policy challenge due to different homeland security authorities and regulations. Limited vulnerability information complicates comparing terrorism risks for hazardous chemicals. Without a comprehensive perspective on risks, security analysts may struggle to prioritize assets for protection. Diverting resources from safety to enhance security could reduce terror risk but increase overall risk if safety programs become less effective. Congress may face oversight challenges in aligning security priorities and activities to achieve common goals. The Army Corps of Engineers collects detailed marine commerce statistics to plan new capital projects and manage existing ones. They maintain separate databases for domestic and foreign commerce, recording vessel trips and tonnages by commodity for U.S. ports and waterways. Vessel types include dry cargo ships, tankers, barges, fishing vessels, towboats, tugboats, crew boats, and supply boats to offshore locations. The ACE waterborne commerce databases collect data on waterborne commerce between the U.S. and foreign countries by port, country, commodity group, and tonnage. Vessel types include dry cargo ships, tankers, barges, fishing vessels, towboats, tugboats, crew boats, and supply boats. Vessel operators must report movements to the ACE, and the databases may be used for chemical-specific analysis with limitations. The ACE provided estimates of EPA/RMP cargo statistics for this report, which should be viewed strictly as estimates. The ACE provided estimates of EPA/RMP cargo statistics based on available data, with key caveats regarding cargo classification inconsistencies. The ACE databases use standardized commodity codes that may not always correspond to individual hazardous chemicals, leading to inaccuracies that CRS has attempted to correct through comparison and consultation with experts. For example, LNG and LPG are classified under the same code in the WCSC system. The ACE data report cargo movements for chemicals, but cannot provide total tonnage carried on vessels due to multiple loading and unloading points. Data errors may occur in the ACE waterborne commerce databases due to the large number of records. The ACE data report cargo movements for chemicals at various locations during a single shipment, but cannot provide total tonnage carried on vessels. Data errors may occur in the ACE waterborne commerce databases due to the large number of records, despite rigorous internal review processes. The report includes only summary estimates of chemicals shipping data without specific associations to named vessels or companies. The ACE and CRS databases contain detailed commercial information about private companies, with errors escaping notice. The report provides summary estimates of chemicals shipping data without specific associations to named vessels or companies, as individual shipment data is considered privileged information not for public release."
