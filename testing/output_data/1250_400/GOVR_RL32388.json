    "content": "This report, General Management Laws: Major Themes and Management Policy Options, is a companion to CRS Report RL30795, General Management Laws: A Compendium. The main objectives are to identify and describe major general management laws, assist Congress in overseeing executive branch management, and help in considering potential changes to management laws and legislation. The quality and implementation of these laws are crucial for maintaining executive branch accountability and influencing federal agency effectiveness in policy formulation. The companion report focuses on major themes and management policy options for Congress related to general management laws for the executive branch. It includes over 90 entries organized into seven functional categories, reflecting the status of these laws at the end of the first session of the 108th Congress. The curr_chunk discusses general management laws for the executive branch, organized into seven functional categories. These categories include Information and Regulatory Management, Strategic Planning, Financial Management, Organization, Procurement, Intergovernmental Relations, and Human Resources Management. The focus is on specific laws within each category, with a particular emphasis on civil service laws codified in Title 5 of the United States Code. The curr_chunk provides a detailed overview of how specific civil service laws are presented in the compendium, including a brief history, major provisions, key developments, and source readings. It also discusses the roles of Congress and the President in managing the executive branch, compares management in public and private sectors, and analyzes major themes in general management laws. The debate over whether the President or Congress has more power in managing the executive branch is highlighted. The report analyzes major themes in general management laws and discusses the constitutional roles of Congress and the President in managing the executive branch. Scholars debate the balance of power between the two branches and how they should share power in this regard. The U.S. Constitution established separated powers and checks and balances to ensure a workable government. The report examines the constitutional roles of Congress and the President in managing the executive branch. Congress has the power to establish administrative agencies and make necessary laws, while the President has considerable power to manage the executive branch. The balance of power between the two branches is debated, with the Constitution emphasizing separateness but interdependence. The Constitution grants the President power to manage the executive branch, ensuring laws are faithfully executed. However, this power is limited, with the President's duty being to ensure officials obey Congress's instructions. The Constitution only explicitly mentions executive departments in Article II, Section 2, outlining the President's appointment powers and the requirement for written opinions from department heads. Congress enacted laws in 1789 establishing the Treasury Department and federal financial management system. In 1789, Congress enacted laws to establish the Treasury Department and set salaries for Secretaries of the Departments of Treasury, State, and War. By the end of the 18th century, only a few departments had been created, leading to challenges in administering the growing nation. Federalists like Alexander Hamilton played a key role in creating an administrative system for the new nation. After the nation's founding, elected officials faced challenges in administering the growing federal government. The Federalists, led by Alexander Hamilton, established an administrative system with an independent chief executive and a fiscal system. The Democratic-Republicans, under Thomas Jefferson, continued this framework but Congress became more involved. By the 1820s, Presidents and department heads were overwhelmed with work due to the country's growth in size and population. By the end of the 1820s, the country's geographic size and population were increasing, leading to an overwhelming amount of work for Presidents and department heads. Federal employment rose significantly from 1816 to 1861, with the organization of executive departments becoming more complex. The structure of executive departments in 1860 was much more intricate than in 1800, with the addition of bureaus handling routine business independently from the Secretary. The rise of the administrative state after the Civil War led to challenges in managing the executive branch. Congress delegated legislative authority to administrative agencies, relying on their expertise to formulate public policies. This shift required the expansion of general management laws to improve executive branch management practices. Congress expanded general management laws to address modern executive branch challenges, increasing oversight transparency with acts like the Administrative Procedure Act and the Freedom of Information Act. Additionally, Congress established inspectors general and required agency strategic planning to enhance accountability and influence over the budget process. Congress expanded general management laws to address modern executive branch challenges, increasing oversight transparency with acts like the Administrative Procedure Act and the Freedom of Information Act. The Congressional Review of Regulations Act, Government Performance and Results Act, Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act, and Chief Financial Officers Act were also enacted to improve oversight and financial management within agencies. The question remains whether these laws are necessary for disciplined management or if they restrict flexibility and initiative within the executive branch. The curr_chunk discusses the debate over whether general management laws are necessary for disciplined management in executive branch agencies or if they stifle flexibility and initiative. Scholars and practitioners compare management practices in the public and private sectors, noting similarities and differences. Key issues remain for Congress to consider. Public and private management are similar in some aspects, but key differences exist, such as the different laws governing each sector. Government agencies have coercive power and operate under laws that regulate their behavior, unlike private companies. Scholars caution against applying private-sector management principles to government without considering these differences. Government agencies and private companies operate under different laws to regulate their behaviors. The Constitution and public law give government coercive power, while private companies are governed by laws that create and regulate a functioning market economy. These laws establish the authority and mission of government agencies, while private companies are primarily accountable to their owners or shareholders. Scholars highlight various differences between government agencies and private sector organizations. Government agencies are primarily accountable to external entities such as legislatures, courts, politicians, and interest groups, which control revenues, factors of production, and agency goals. This contrasts with private companies, which are primarily accountable to their owners or shareholders. Government agencies are accountable to external entities like legislatures, courts, politicians, and interest groups. Managing the executive branch involves challenges in measuring agency performance and differences between public and private sector management practices. The compendium of general management laws raises public policy issues and themes that may prompt Congress to consider how much discretion to grant the executive branch in determining agency actions. The debate over how much discretion to grant the executive branch in determining agency actions has been a longstanding issue for Congress. Giving discretion can provide flexibility for agencies to tailor implementation of laws to specific circumstances, but it also raises concerns about potential misuse of power. This debate is particularly relevant when agency responsibilities involve scientific or technical judgments. Granting discretion to the executive branch allows for quicker decision-making compared to the legislative process. It can also lead to decisions that may not have support from Congress or key stakeholders. However, this can also result in decisions being made by unelected officials, raising concerns about transparency and accountability. Congress has faced this tension between flexibility and accountability when considering granting discretion to agencies like the Department of Homeland Security in 2002 and 2003. Granting discretion to the executive branch can lead to decisions by unelected agency officials, raising concerns about transparency and accountability. Congress has faced this tension between flexibility and accountability when considering granting discretion to agencies like the Department of Homeland Security in 2002 and 2003. In regulatory situations, Congress can address delegation by setting conditions for authority delegation to balance flexibility with accountability. Congress can address delegation by setting conditions for authority delegation to balance flexibility with accountability. This can be done through contract design, where Congress establishes goals, sanctions, probation periods, or sunsets, and requires the use of pilot projects or profit-sharing relationships. Screening and selection mechanisms can also be used to avoid delegating authority in a way that could risk poor performance by agencies. Congress can address delegation by setting conditions for authority delegation to balance flexibility with accountability. This can be done through contract design, where Congress establishes goals, sanctions, probation periods, or sunsets, and requires the use of pilot projects or profit-sharing relationships. To avoid poor performance by agencies, screening and selection mechanisms can be implemented. Additionally, monitoring and reporting requirements can increase accountability and transparency by requiring agencies to report their actions, milestones, and obtained information. Congress can require agencies to report their \"actions taken,\" milestones reached, and obtained information. The rationales are to monitor agency actions and provide difficult-to-access information to Congress and stakeholders. Information technology and the Web enable real-time reporting. Some argue that excessive reporting requirements can be burdensome. Institutional checks include involving additional agencies to veto or block delegate agency actions and requiring notice and comment before certain actions proceed. Sequential funding within an appropriation can be contingent upon specific conditions. The tension between standardization and customization in management laws for agencies is a frequent issue for Congress. The question arises whether laws should be standardized for all agencies or customized to each agency's needs. This debate involves varying degrees of standardization and customization in general management laws, authorizing statutes, and appropriations. Many experts believe that standardization can help improve executive branch management. The tension between standardization and customization in management laws for agencies is a frequent issue for Congress. Standardization can improve executive branch transparency and accountability. For example, the Administrative Procedure Act established basic requirements for agency rulemaking. The CFO Act of 1990 required audited financial statements for major executive departments and agencies, leading to improved financial accountability. In 2002, Congress amended the CFO Act to extend financial statement requirements to most executive agencies. Standardization promotes accountability by requiring agencies to justify exceptions, while customization aligns management with internal and external environments. Congress uses statutes and appropriations to direct agency actions, balancing standardization and customization in management laws. Congress uses authorizing statutes, appropriations, and accompanying reports to require specific actions for agencies, balancing standardization and customization in management laws. Small agencies were not required to prepare audited financial statements until recently, and the Department of Homeland Security's CFO position was initially exempt from CFO Act requirements. DHS and the DOD were granted authority to customize aspects of their HRM systems in the last two years, moving towards standardization or customization with varying degrees of a mixed approach. The mixed approach in management laws involves balancing standardization and customization. An example is the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, which required agencies to develop strategic plans within a general framework. Standardization can be rigid, while customization may reduce transparency and accountability if not reported in real-time. Customization can sometimes reduce transparency or accountability if agencies do not report in real-time on the nature and status of their efforts. Oversight and analytical resources are crucial for monitoring the effectiveness of customized laws. Mixed approaches can lead to agencies working at cross-purposes and budget pressures. Congress has policy options to address these issues, with the decision depending on various factors. Regular examination of customization levels is recommended to avoid potential problems. Policy options for addressing issues related to customization in laws include regularly examining the need for increased customization or standardization in general management laws to improve transparency, accountability, efficiency, or effectiveness. Analytical support can be obtained from various sources such as agency management, program evaluations, inspectors general, the General Accounting Office (GAO), and outside scholars. Another option is to reduce the analytical burden by requiring the executive branch to maintain real-time descriptions of the current state of affairs and updated comparisons across agencies, especially in areas where customization is prevalent. The executive branch is required to maintain real-time descriptions and comparisons across agencies to reduce the analytical burden for Congress and stakeholders in monitoring the situation. This includes areas of widespread customization in laws to improve transparency and accountability. Reporting requirements may help in examining the extent of customization and standardization, with the possibility of real-time reporting on the Web. Central management agencies like OMB, OPM, GSA, and the Financial Management Service are involved in this process. The executive branch is required to maintain real-time descriptions and comparisons across agencies to reduce the analytical burden for Congress and stakeholders in monitoring the situation. Reporting requirements may help in examining the extent of customization and standardization, with the possibility of real-time reporting on the Web. Central management agencies like OMB, OPM, GSA, and the Financial Management Service could report how management policies are customized to facilitate government-wide analysis and comparisons. This would likely entail costs for the reporting agencies. Functional orientation in both private and public sectors is crucial for efficiency and centralized control over strategic decisions. However, if it becomes too inward-looking, organization-wide coordination can suffer. Functional silos can hinder the development of general managers and cause missed opportunities. Management literature emphasizes the importance of integrating functional perspectives within a broader general management perspective. Functional silos can hinder organization-wide coordination and cause missed opportunities. Management literature stresses the need to integrate functional perspectives within a broader general management perspective to develop general managers. The importance of developing a general management perspective is highlighted to integrate multiple functional perspectives for a complete understanding of problems or opportunities. This approach can provide a toolbox of options for addressing executive branch management issues, focusing on improving management fundamentals in individual functional areas. The general management laws offer a toolbox of options for addressing executive branch management problems by integrating functional perspectives and providing mutual support to each other. Integration can be achieved through changes to laws, agency statutes, appropriations, and other legislative tools. For example, leveraging the E-Government Act of 2002 for more timely financial and performance reporting using the Federal Enterprise Architecture. Leveraging the E-Government Act of 2002 to achieve real-time financial and performance reporting, directing appropriations for hiring contract oversight specialists, restructuring budget accounts for better resource alignment with programs, and utilizing the Chief Human Capital Officers Act of 2002 for assessing staff resources dedicated to contract management. The federal government has various options for leveraging different functional perspectives into an integrated general management perspective, including information policy, regulation, strategic planning, performance measurement, program evaluation, auditing, investigation, financial management, budgeting, accounting, organization, acquisition management, real property management, intergovernmental relations, human resources management, and ethics. This is in line with past efforts in both the legislative and executive branches to improve federal government management reform. The history of federal government management reform includes efforts to improve agencies' performance, organization, and management practices. Despite challenges, progress has been difficult to achieve. Congress faces challenges in overseeing executive branch management, especially in ensuring compliance with general management laws and measuring agencies' progress. Management literature emphasizes the importance of measurement as a motivator for action. The importance of measurement in motivating action and improving management practices is highlighted in management literature. While measurement systems can drive commitment, they may also create perverse incentives. For example, achieving clean financial audits may not indicate good fiscal management if achieved through manual workarounds. An illustration more applicable to the federal government may be the achievement of unqualified financial audits, where clean audits of an agency's financial systems look like a sign of good fiscal management, but not if they are achieved only by applying brute force at audit time in manually working around deficient systems. In the last 25 years, agency inspectors general (IGs) and the GAO have reported persistent, major management problems in executive branch agencies in areas such as financial management, acquisition, information technology investment, human resources, and the strategic planning and implementation of major programs. GAO released reports detailing high-risk areas and major management challenges that affect specific agencies or cut across many agencies government-wide, stating that progress was made but much work remained to be done. The GAO released reports on high-risk areas and management challenges in government agencies. Progress was noted, but significant work still needed to be done. Various management reform initiatives were pursued by presidential administrations, and concerns were raised by Congress about government management. Senator Fred Thompson released a report in 2001 highlighting the need for improvement in central management, procurement, information resources management, financial management, and human resources management. The House Committee on Government Operations recommended actions to improve central management, procurement, information resources management, financial management, and human resources management. Senator Fred Thompson highlighted urgent federal government management problems, including workforce, financial management, and information technology issues. President George W. Bush's Office of Management and Budget released the President's Management Agenda with five government-wide initiatives. Under the President's Management Agenda (PMA), OMB evaluates agencies quarterly on five initiatives: Capital, Competitive Sourcing, Financial Performance, Electronic Government, and Budget Integration. Agencies are given red, yellow, or green \"stoplight scores\" based on meeting standards for success. Green indicates meeting all criteria, yellow for partial success, and red for serious flaws. Progress is assessed based on agreed deliverables and timelines, with green for on-track implementation, yellow for issues requiring adjustment, and red for significant problems. The five government-wide PMA initiatives have deliverables and timelines established by the agency and OMB. Progress is evaluated with green, yellow, or red ratings indicating success levels. The initiatives are interconnected and leverage general management laws to achieve PMA goals. The PMA initiatives leverage various general management laws to achieve goals, with agencies making significant progress. However, PMA evaluation practices lack transparency outside the executive branch. The PMA initiatives are being taken seriously, with significant progress made. However, transparency in PMA evaluation practices outside the executive branch is lacking.OMB assessments using the Program Assessment Rating Tool were more transparent, with detailed evidence released. Subjectivity in stoplight scoring criteria may be a challenge for some initiatives. The PMA initiatives face challenges with subjectivity in stoplight scoring criteria, lack of verification by independent evaluation organizations, and gaps in coverage of important management laws. Acquisition-related issues like contract oversight and small business contracting are not included in the criteria, and real property management is not explicitly addressed. The PMA's acquisition-related initiative, Competitive Sourcing, lacks criteria for contract oversight and small business contracting concerns, despite long-standing concerns raised by GAO and outside observers. Real property management issues are also not explicitly addressed by the PMA. Various entities, including agency IGs, GAO, and Congress, have made efforts to improve agency management practices over the years through compliance measurements with general management laws. Representative Stephen Horn and Representative Adam Putnam have used letter grades to evaluate agency financial management and information security performance. Several representatives have used letter grades to evaluate agency performance in financial management and information security. Congress is exploring options to ensure agencies comply with general management laws and improve their practices. This includes measuring agency progress through cross-agency comparisons to motivate action by political appointees and senior officials. Congress is considering ways to measure agency progress in improving management practices, including using existing oversight tools like GAO and agency IGs. Another option is to have GAO and IGs verify and validate PMA stoplight scores and agency actions taken to increase congressional confidence in executive branch measurements. Congress could consider various options to increase confidence in executive branch measurements and determinations. These options include independent verification and validation by GAO and agency IGs, transparency through access to final PMA stoplight worksheets, and independent measurement of agency progress in improving management practices. Each option has its benefits and drawbacks, such as increased costs and potential perception of micromanagement by the executive branch. Congress could direct GAO or IGs to develop measures to systematically measure agency progress in improving management practices, potentially increasing workload and costs. Alternatively, Congress could amend GPRA to require agencies to address major management problems and high-risk areas in their strategic plans and performance reports, establishing milestones and timelines for improvement. The compendium of general management laws includes milestones and timelines for improvement, building agency management capacity, and the establishment of agency \"chief officer\" positions. These chief officers head various functions within agencies and include inspectors general, chief financial officers, and chief information officers. Chief officers, also known as \"CXOs,\" are senior positions in executive branch agencies overseeing functions like human resources, financial management, and procurement. These officers include inspectors general, chief financial officers, chief information officers, chief human capital officers, and chief acquisition officers. They are established by statute and have specific roles and appointment rules outlined in the law. Some are presidentially appointed with Senate confirmation, while others may be appointed by agency heads. Some chief officers in executive branch agencies are presidentially appointed with Senate confirmation, while others may be appointed by agency heads. Certain positions require political appointees, while reporting relationships vary among different chief officers. The creation of these positions aimed to elevate functional perspectives within agencies' management ranks. Many observers believed that senior managers in executive branch agencies paid insufficient attention to functional perspectives like financial management. To address this, functional perspectives were elevated to higher positions within agencies. Various chief officer groups were placed in interagency councils by statute or executive order. The councils vary in membership and are chaired by the Office of Management and Budget's deputy director for management. The President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE) was established by President Ronald Reagan in 1981 through executive order. The council's purpose was to coordinate government-wide activities to combat fraud and waste in government programs. The PCIE, chaired by the Office of Management and Budget's deputy director for management, provided leverage for agency Inspectors General (IGs) to advocate for resources and independence within their agencies. The PCIE, established in 1981 by President Reagan, served as a tool for IGs to advocate for resources and independence within their agencies. It was endorsed for enhancing IGs' lobbying power and building informal networks for organizational learning. Standing committees were formed for sharing ideas and cooperating on projects. Despite criticism as a \"trade union\" for IGs, it was praised for facilitating collaboration and addressing fraud, waste, and abuse issues across the government. The PCIE, established in 1981 by President Reagan, served as a tool for IGs to advocate for resources and independence within their agencies. It was praised for enhancing IGs' lobbying power and facilitating collaboration on fraud, waste, and abuse issues. In 1992, President George H. W. Bush established two IG councils, the PCIE for presidentially appointed IGs and the Executive Council on Integrity and Efficiency (ECIE) for IGs typically appointed by agency heads. The Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Council was also created by the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990. The CFO Act established the deputy director for management (DDM) position in the President's Office of Management and Budget, giving the DDM responsibility for general management policies in areas such as financial management, procurement policy, and human resources management. The CFO Council, initially passive, was energized in 1994 by broadening membership, electing council officers, and setting their own agenda. The DDM, despite modest resources, has significant leveraging opportunities through the interagency councils he chairs. The CFO Council, established after the CFO Act, has been successful in bringing focus to financial management. OMB supported the recommendations and the deputy director for management has leveraging opportunities through interagency councils. Additional chief officer councils were later established by Congress. Despite challenges, the chief officer positions have generally been successful in improving agency management practices. Officer positions have been successful in bringing focus to functional perspectives, but face challenges like high turnover among CIOs and difficulties with change management. Agencies still struggle with management difficulties due to budget pressures and lack of attention from political appointees. Management scholars caution against narrow functional perspectives. Interagency councils of chief officers have varying levels of effectiveness. Public management scholars have increasingly focused on the benefits of interagency collaboration, with interagency councils of chief officers being seen as beneficial for improving federal management. This is supported by testimony from a former OMB official highlighting the importance of setting up networks for sharing knowledge and best practices among different government agencies. Setting up networks of people to share knowledge, best practices, and information is crucial for organizational performance. Attention has been given to the \"knowledge management\" perspective in management literature. However, it is important to avoid a narrow functional perspective that could harm other functions or the agency overall. Re-thinking the structure and role of OMB within the Executive Office of the President is necessary for improving federal executive branch management. Congress should consider questions regarding chief officers. Some scholars and practitioners suggest re-thinking the structure and role of OMB within the Executive Office of the President to improve federal executive branch management. Congress should consider questions about chief officers, such as the need for additional officers, preserving institutional memory, and making councils more accountable to Congress. GAO has highlighted the importance of chief security officers in ensuring government services are available during emergencies. In the context of ensuring government services during emergencies, the idea of establishing agency \"chief security officers\" (CSOs) is proposed. This role could bring a more integrated approach to security and risk management at federal agencies, although it may lead to potential conflicts with existing positions like the Chief Information Officer (CIO). Many corporate CEOs have already designated CSOs, who may handle not only information technology but also all security responsibilities. Establishing statutory CSO positions could lead to turf battles with CIOs but may bring a more integrated approach to security at federal agencies. Some argue that adding more chief officers would be excessive. Observers suggest creating \"chief program evaluation officer\" positions to address program evaluation deficiencies in agencies. Congress could establish \"chief program evaluation officer\" (CPEO) positions in major agencies to bring more attention to program evaluation. Evaluation methods vary due to program differences and interdisciplinary nature. Proponents believe CPEO positions could improve performance and coordination, while critics argue it may be excessive. Options for appointments vary, with some positions political, others career, and some at agency head's discretion. The existing chief officers can be appointed in various ways, with some positions required to be political, others career, and some at the agency head's discretion. There are debates on the benefits of political appointees versus career officials in these roles. CFOs and CIOs must report directly to the agency head, while IGs report to the agency head or the next in rank. Reporting relationships for CHCOs and CAOs are not specified by law. In enacting the CFO Act, Congress reflected perspectives on chief officer reporting relationships. CFOs and CIOs must report directly to the agency head, while IGs report to the agency head or the next in rank. Reporting relationships for CHCOs and CAOs are at the agency head's discretion. The debate continues on the appropriateness of these reporting relationships in addressing management needs and major problems. One argument is for direct access to agency leadership, but concerns exist about the span of control for agency heads. Congress may consider making IG councils statutory by codifying the mandates of the PCIE and ECIE into law. The debate continues on the reporting relationships of CFOs, CIOs, IGs, CHCOs, and CAOs in executive branch agencies. Congress may consider making IG councils statutory to improve training, strengthen IG-Congress relationship, and enhance coordination among IG offices. Funding options for interagency councils are also being discussed. The Inspector General Act of 1978 is discussed in a compendium, highlighting the coordination between IG offices in the federal government. Funding for interagency councils like the PCIE and ECIE is self-financed through MOUs, with operations for the CHCO Council funded by the Office of Personnel Management. Other councils have been funded through interagency transfers or reimbursements under Title VI general provisions. Funding for interagency councils like the CFO, CIO, and Procurement Executives Council is currently done through interagency transfers or reimbursements. Congress could consider making a separate appropriation for each council or all combined, potentially giving them more control and improving continuity between presidential administrations. Additionally, Congress could alter reporting and strategic planning requirements for these councils. Congress could consider altering reporting and strategic planning requirements for interagency councils to improve control, leverage, and continuity between presidential administrations. This could include requiring councils to submit plans or reports to Congress and OMB to lead the chief officer councils. Congress could potentially require OMB to submit an overall plan for leading interagency chief officer councils, enhancing transparency and accountability to Congress. However, this may limit the President's discretion and increase costs for the councils or OMB."
