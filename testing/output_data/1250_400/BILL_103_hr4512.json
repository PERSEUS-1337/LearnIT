    "content": "The \"Welfare to Work Act of 1994\" may be cited as the short title. The Congress acknowledges the importance of transitioning individuals from welfare to work. The Congress recognizes the need to create entry-level jobs for welfare recipients to transition to permanent employment, emphasizing the value of work experience in the private sector. A one-year tax credit is proposed to incentivize businesses to hire AFDC recipients and break the cycle of welfare dependency. To break the cycle of welfare dependency, a one-year tax credit should be given to businesses for hiring AFDC recipients, leading to permanent employment and ending AFDC eligibility. A one-year tax credit is proposed for businesses hiring AFDC recipients to promote permanent employment and end AFDC eligibility. This involves amending the Internal Revenue Code to include a refundable credit for hiring AFDC recipients. The proposal includes a tax credit for businesses hiring AFDC recipients, allowing a credit against the tax imposed for the taxable year based on qualified first-year wages. The 1-year period for qualified wages can be reduced by prior service periods with other employers. Qualified wages are those paid to former AFDC recipients. Wages are defined as per section 51(d). A qualified former AFDC recipient is certified by a designated local agency. The term 'qualified former AFDC recipient' refers to an individual certified by a local agency as a family member receiving benefits under a State plan before employment, with wages making the family ineligible for benefits. No credit is allowed for wages paid to a qualified former AFDC recipient replacing a satisfactory employee. Special rules from section 51 apply to this provision. Technical amendments are also included. The text discusses rules and technical amendments related to wages paid to a qualified former AFDC recipient replacing a terminated employee. Special rules from section 51 apply, and technical amendments are made to certain sections of the Code. The text discusses amendments related to the employment of AFDC recipients and overpayments of tax. The amendments apply to individuals starting work after the enactment of the Act."
