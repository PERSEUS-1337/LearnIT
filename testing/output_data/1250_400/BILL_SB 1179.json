Chapter 5.5 is added to the Health and Safety Code, defining interment rights. An interment right does not include disinterment without consent from the cemetery district and specific family members. The chapter does not restrict the removal of remains within the same cemetery or by order of the court, coroner, or health department. The cemetery district must maintain records of removal of remains, including details such as date, name, age, cemetery, and reinterment information. The person making the removal must provide a complete record to the cemetery district. An interment right grants a transferable property interest to the owner listed in the cemetery district records. The owner can designate who can be interred in the plot and must designate a successor owner at the time of purchase. The owner of an interment right can designate who may be interred in the plot and must designate a successor owner at the time of purchase. If the owner dies without a valid disposition, the interment right passes according to intestate succession laws. When transferring ownership rights or making an interment in a public cemetery district based on a sworn affidavit, the district and its employees are not liable unless they had actual knowledge of false information. The successor owner of an interment right must sign an affidavit declaring their entitlement, efforts to find other claimants, and lack of opposition to their right. The successor owner of an interment right must sign an affidavit declaring their entitlement, efforts to find other claimants, and lack of opposition to their right. Upon the sale of a plot in a cemetery, the district must notify the purchaser of interment rights and the governing policies. Upon the sale of a cemetery plot, the district must inform the buyer in writing about interment rights, ownership succession, and district policies. No reimbursement is required for costs incurred by local agencies or school districts under this act, unless the Commission on State Mandates determines otherwise."
