The conference includes members from the EPA, Coeur d'Alene Indian tribe, and Idaho Department of Environmental Quality. Additionally, steering committees are appointed, and ex officio members are included. The Coeur d'Alene Basin Management Conference establishes advisory committees and includes ex officio members. A pollution prevention, control, and restoration plan must be published within a year, clarifying duties and suggesting a timetable for activities. The Plan developed pursuant to this section shall clarify duties, describe funding methods, incorporate environmental management concepts, and include a strategy for water pollution prevention and control in the Coeur d'Alene Basin. The Plan developed under this section must include a strategy for water pollution prevention and control in the Coeur d'Alene Basin, with public review and approval by the Administrator. Upon approval of the Plan developed for water pollution prevention and control in the Coeur d'Alene Basin, it will be deemed an approved management program and comprehensive conservation plan. Grant assistance may be provided for the development of the Plan, including research, surveys, and technical work. Grants for developing the Plan in the Coeur d'Alene Basin will assist with research, surveys, studies, and technical work. The federal share of grants will not exceed 70% of development costs, with the condition that non-Federal sources provide the remaining share. The Administrator can establish terms and conditions for grant administration. The Coeur d'Alene Basin is defined as the watershed in northern Idaho containing specific water bodies.
