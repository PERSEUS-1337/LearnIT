The proposed Deep Temporal Clustering (DTC) algorithm integrates dimensionality reduction and temporal clustering in an unsupervised manner. It utilizes an autoencoder for dimensionality reduction and a novel temporal clustering layer for cluster assignment. The algorithm optimizes both clustering and dimensionality reduction objectives, with customizable temporal similarity metrics. A visualization method is used to analyze learned features, showing superior performance compared to traditional methods across various domains. The algorithm integrates dimensionality reduction and temporal clustering in an unsupervised manner, outperforming traditional methods in various domains. It focuses on learning complex, high-level structures and features of unlabeled data, filling a gap in unsupervised techniques for time series data. The novel algorithm called deep temporal clustering (DTC) addresses the limitations of standard clustering techniques on time series data by focusing on learning complex structures and features of unlabeled data. This fills a gap in technology for accurate unsupervised learning of time series data in various domains such as financial trading, medical monitoring, and event detection. The deep temporal clustering (DTC) algorithm aims to overcome the limitations of standard clustering techniques on time series data by transforming the data into a low dimensional latent space using a deep autoencoder network. The algorithm disentangles data manifolds by learning informative features on all time scales through a three-level approach involving a CNN and a BI-LSTM. The proposed three-level approach in the DTC algorithm uses a CNN to learn short-time-scale waveforms, a BI-LSTM to capture temporal connections across all time scales, and non-parametric clustering to identify spatio-temporal dimensions in unlabeled data. This approach effectively untangles data manifolds without losing temporal information, leading to high performance on various datasets without needing parameter adjustments. Additionally, DTC offers a unique feature to visualize cluster-assignment activations over time, enabling event localization in unlabeled time series data. The DTC algorithm utilizes a three-level approach with a CNN, BI-LSTM, and non-parametric clustering for temporal clustering. It achieves high performance on different datasets without parameter adjustments and offers a unique feature to visualize cluster-assignment activations over time. The end-to-end deep learning algorithm formulated in this study focuses on achieving meaningful temporal clustering through effective latent representation and integrated similarity metric optimization. The study emphasizes the importance of effective latent representation and integrated similarity metric for high clustering accuracy. The end-to-end optimization of the network for reconstruction and clustering loss outperforms cases where these objectives are optimized separately. DTC algorithm surpasses k-Shape BID15 and hierarchical clustering with complete linkage on real-world time series datasets. Existing research in temporal clustering methods focuses on dimensionality reduction and similarity metric selection, with some solutions using application-dependent reduction methods. Some approaches for temporal clustering involve dimensionality reduction methods like adaptive piecewise constant approximation and nonnegative matrix factorization. However, these methods may lead to the loss of long-range temporal correlations and relevant features. Another approach focuses on creating a suitable similarity measure between time series by considering features like complexity, correlation, and time warping. Incorporating these similarity measures into traditional clustering algorithms can significantly impact the results. Recent research has shown that selecting an effective latent space for time series data clustering is crucial. While some methods focus on similarity metrics, others use dimensionality reduction techniques. However, existing approaches lack a general methodology for choosing the optimal latent space. Jointly optimizing a stacked autoencoder for dimensionality reduction and a k-means objective has shown promise for static data clustering, but is not well-suited for time series data. Recent research has shown the importance of selecting an effective latent space for time series data clustering. A proposed method involves using a temporal autoencoder (TAE) to encode the input signal into a latent space, followed by a BI-LSTM for clustering. The effective latent representation is crucial for temporal clustering, and the network architecture includes a 1D convolution layer for this purpose. The network architecture includes a 1D convolution layer for extracting short-term features, followed by a Bidirectional LSTM for obtaining the latent representation. The clustering layer assigns the latent representation to clusters, enabling effective temporal clustering. The network architecture utilizes a Bidirectional LSTM to learn temporal changes in both directions and collapse input sequences into a smaller latent space. The clustering layer assigns the latent representation to clusters, driven by minimization of mean square error for sequence reconstruction and clustering metric optimization for distinct spatio-temporal behavior. The clustering metric optimization in the network modifies weights in the BI-LSTM and CNN to separate input sequences into distinct clusters based on high-level features. This end-to-end optimization efficiently extracts spatio-temporal features for clustering, unlike traditional approaches that only focus on reconstruction or separation. The approach focuses on end-to-end optimization for clustering high-dimensional input dynamics, emphasizing the use of temporal continuity to extract informative features. The traditional methods of dimensionality reduction and clustering separately result in poor performance compared to the proposed approach. Our approach utilizes temporal continuity of spatio-temporal data to extract informative features in the latent representation of the BI-LSTM. The temporal clustering layer initializes centroids using latent signals and performs hierarchical clustering to obtain clusters. An unsupervised algorithm is then used to train the layer by computing assignment probabilities and updating centroids based on a loss function. The temporal clustering layer utilizes an unsupervised algorithm to compute assignment probabilities and update centroids based on a loss function. It involves computing distances from centroids using a similarity metric and normalizing them into probability assignments using a Student's t distribution kernel. The probability assignment of a latent signal belonging to a cluster is determined by the probability of input i belonging to cluster j. The study explores unsupervised temporal clustering using a similarity metric to compute distances from centroids and assign probabilities to latent signals. The Complexity Invariant Similarity (CID) metric, proposed by BID2, corrects the euclidean distance with complexity estimation factors for time series x and y. The Complexity Invariant Similarity (CID) metric by BID2 computes similarity based on euclidean distance corrected by complexity estimation factors for time series x and y. It considers complexity differences between series to determine distance, with the distance being euclidean if both sequences have the same complexity. Additionally, Correlation based Similarity (COR) by BID8 uses pearsons correlation to compute similarities between latent representations z i and centroids w j. Auto Correlation based Similarity (ACF) by BID7 computes similarity using autocorrelation coefficients between z i and w j. In this study, the COR is computed using pearson's correlation to determine similarities between latent representations z i and centroids w j. Auto Correlation based Similarity (ACF) calculates similarity using autocorrelation coefficients between z i and w j, followed by weighted euclidean distance. The objective is to minimize KL divergence loss between q ij and target distribution p ij, with emphasis on strengthening high confidence predictions and normalizing losses. This is achieved through batch-wise joint optimization of clustering and auto. Using the target distribution, the KL divergence loss is computed for joint optimization of clustering and autoencoder. Effective initialization of cluster centroids is crucial, achieved by pretraining autoencoder parameters and initializing centroids through hierarchical clustering. Autoencoder weights and cluster centers are updated using backpropagation mini-batch SGD, with the target distribution also updated during each iteration. Similar approaches have been used in previous studies. The text discusses the initialization of cluster centroids through hierarchical clustering, updating autoencoder weights and cluster centers using backpropagation mini-batch SGD, and updating the target distribution during each iteration. This approach aims to prevent problematic solutions and converge at a suitable representation to minimize clustering and MSE loss. Additionally, a heatmap-generating network is used to localize main data features for classification. The text discusses the use of a heatmap-generating network to localize main data features for classification. The network utilizes cluster labels from a DTC network to generate heatmaps showing relevant parts of inputs. Implementation was done using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras on Nvidia GTX 1080Ti. The performance of the DTC algorithm was evaluated on various real-world datasets. The text discusses the use of a heatmap-generating network to localize main data features for classification. It evaluates the performance of a DTC algorithm on real-world datasets and spacecraft magnetometer data from the NASA MMS Mission for automated detection of flux transfer events. The text discusses the automated detection of spacecraft crossings of flux transfer events (FTEs) in a turbulent medium using a DTC algorithm. The algorithm is compared against hierarchical clustering and k-Shape, a temporal clustering algorithm. Four similarity metrics are considered in the experiments, and expert labels are used to measure model performance as a classifier using ROC analysis. The text discusses the evaluation of a DTC algorithm for detecting spacecraft crossings of FTEs in a turbulent medium. Different similarity metrics are used, and expert labels are employed for model performance evaluation using ROC analysis. The training pipeline is unsupervised, with evaluation metrics including ROC and AUC. Parameter optimization is not feasible in unsupervised clustering, and common parameters are used for DTC. The network architecture includes convolution and Bi-LSTM layers with specific filter sizes and pooling sizes for faster experimentation. Autoencoder network is pre-trained using the Adam optimizer over 10 epochs. The latent representation size is kept under 100 for faster experimentation. The deconvolutional layer has a kernel size of 10 and weights are initialized with a zero-mean Gaussian distribution. The autoencoder network is pre-trained using the Adam optimizer over 10 epochs. Temporal clustering layer centroids are initialized using hierarchical clustering. The deep architecture is jointly trained for clustering and autoencoder loss until convergence. Mini-batch size is set to 64 with a learning rate of 0.1. Results of DTC for three time series from the MMS dataset are shown in FIG1, with activation maps correlating well with event signatures. The baseline algorithms used are parameter free. Results of DTC for three distinct time series from the MMS dataset are shown in FIG1. Activation map profiles correlate well with the location of the bipolar signatures of the events. Joint training of reconstruction loss and clustering loss yields superior performance compared to disjoint training. Direct comparison between joint end-to-end training and disjoint training on the MMS dataset results in an average AUC of 0.93. The study compared joint end-to-end training of the DTC with disjoint training on the MMS dataset, showing an average AUC of 0.93 for joint training and 0.88 for disjoint training. Results also demonstrated that DTC outperformed baseline clustering techniques across various datasets and metrics. Additionally, ROC comparisons illustrated the robustness and superior performance of DTC over existing techniques. The study shows that DTC is robust and outperforms existing techniques in unsupervised learning of patterns in temporal sequences, event detection, and clustering. Results indicate high agreement between unsupervised clustering and human-labeled categories, suggesting effective dimensionality reduction. The approach is promising for real-world applications and can be generalized to multichannel spatio-temporal input. The approach of dimensionality reduction from inputs with complex temporal structure to a one or few-dimensional space spanned by cluster centroids shows promise for real-world applications. Generalization to multichannel spatio-temporal input is straightforward and has been carried out successfully."
