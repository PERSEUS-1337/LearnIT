    "content": "The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is a regional free trade agreement among 12 Pacific-facing nations, pending congressional approval. It aims to liberalize trade in goods and services, including agricultural products, potentially benefiting U.S. food and agricultural exports. Foreign demand for U.S. food and fiber contributes to higher commodity prices and farm income, with positive effects extending to rural communities. Foreign demand for U.S. food and agricultural products, such as wheat, rice, soybeans, cotton, almonds, pecans, pistachios, and walnuts, contributes to higher commodity prices and farm income. This positive impact extends to rural communities, farm input industries, commodity processors, and food manufacturers with a stake in foreign markets. Rising farm productivity and market-oriented U.S. farm policies have led to increased interest in liberalizing agricultural trade among TPP countries. Negotiations to liberalize agricultural trade among TPP countries have garnered high interest from U.S. agriculture and food industry. TPP countries are significant for U.S. farm and food trade, with potential market access improvements for U.S. products. The trade deal could enhance U.S. competitiveness in TPP markets while also increasing competition in U.S. product markets. The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) issued a report on the economic impact of the agreement on the U.S. economy and specific industry sectors in May 2016. The TPP trade deal could enhance U.S. competitiveness in TPP markets and increase competition in U.S. product markets. The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) issued a report on the economic impact of the agreement on the U.S. economy and specific industry sectors in May 2016. Key considerations for U.S. food and agriculture in the TPP agreement are highlighted, along with projected effects on U.S. food and agriculture based on analysis by ITC and the American Farm Bureau Federation. Selected provisions beyond market access are also summarized. The TPP trade deal could enhance U.S. competitiveness in TPP markets and increase competition in U.S. product markets. The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) issued a report on the economic impact of the agreement on the U.S. economy and specific industry sectors in May 2016. Key considerations for U.S. food and agriculture in the TPP agreement are highlighted, along with projected effects on U.S. food and agriculture based on analysis by ITC and the American Farm Bureau Federation. The agreement lacks free trade agreements with five TPP countries, including Japan, Vietnam, and Malaysia, which offer potential for boosting U.S. farm and food exports. The three countries in focus, Malaysia, Japan, and Vietnam, have high agricultural tariffs compared to the United States, presenting an opportunity for increased U.S. farm and food exports through lower tariffs under the TPP agreement. Japan stands out as a key market due to its protected agricultural sector and large population, while Vietnam shows potential for significant future growth with its fast-growing economy and large population. Vietnam and Japan are key markets in the TPP for U.S. farm and food products. Vietnam, with its fast-growing economy and large population, offers significant growth potential. However, U.S. rice growers are concerned about potential competition from Vietnam in Japan and Mexico. Access to markets in Canada and Mexico under NAFTA would also be available to more competitors as tariffs are lowered within the TPP zone. Expansion opportunities for U.S. beef, pork, and dairy products in Japan, Canada, and Vietnam will be phased in over time. The potential loss of U.S. rice exports to Mexico as tariffs are lowered under TPP could impact Japan. Key export expansion opportunities for U.S. food and agricultural interests in beef, pork, and dairy products to Japan, Canada, and Vietnam will be phased in over time. Safeguard measures in place for certain products in specific countries could affect imports. Failure to implement the TPP agreement could give competitors an edge over U.S. exports. If the United States does not implement the TPP agreement, competitors could gain an edge over U.S. exports, especially in Japan. Australia already benefits from preferential tariff rates on beef exports to Japan, putting U.S. beef at a disadvantage. The European Union is also negotiating FTAs that could enhance its competitive position in various markets. The TPP does not address domestic subsidy regimes that distort trade. The TPP agreement, similar to other FTAs, does not address domestic subsidy regimes that distort trade. A report by the ITC in May 2016 concluded that TPP would benefit U.S. agriculture by eliminating tariffs and expanding markets. The report projected that U.S. agricultural exports would increase by $7.2 billion (2.6%) in year 15 (2032) with TPP. The ITC report projects that under the TPP agreement, U.S. agricultural exports would increase by $7.2 billion in year 15 (2032). Key results include higher exports of dairy products, processed foods, and beef, while imports of processed foods, beef, and dairy products would also increase. The gains are primarily attributed to greater market access in Japan. The ITC report projects that under the TPP agreement, U.S. agricultural exports would increase by $7.2 billion in year 15 (2032), primarily from greater market access in Japan. The American Farm Bureau Federation supports TPP, estimating a boost of $4.4 billion in U.S. farm income annually compared to a scenario without TPP. Support for TPP in the food and agriculture sector is broad-based but not universal. The TPP agreement would affect market access for agricultural commodities and food products. Japan, the largest U.S. export market for beef, would reduce tariffs on beef products under the agreement. The TPP agreement would lower tariffs on beef and pork products for Japan and the United States. Japan would reduce tariffs on beef from 38.5% to 9% over 16 years and on pork from 4.3% to 2.2% over nine years. The United States would eliminate tariffs on beef and pork products within 15 years. The TPP agreement includes reductions in tariffs on pork and poultry products. Japan's duty on pork cuts would decrease to 2.2% over nine years, with a special safeguard in place. Vietnam would eliminate tariffs on pork within 10 years, while the United States would immediately eliminate most tariffs. Canada would gradually increase access to its poultry and egg markets over five years through new duty-free quotas. Under the TPP agreement, quotas for poultry products like eggs, chicken, turkey, and broiler hatching eggs would increase gradually over 19 years. Vietnamese tariffs on poultry would be eliminated in 13 years, while U.S. tariffs would be removed in 10 years. Canada would allow incremental additional access to its dairy markets, amounting to 3.25% of its output for 2016, phased in over five years with moderate annual increases thereafter. Canada would allow incremental additional access to its dairy markets, amounting to about 0.3% of current U.S. milk production, open to all TPP countries. TRQs for dairy products would be increased over 14 to 19 years and then fixed, with in-quota products entering duty-free. Japan and the United States would also eliminate tariffs on dairy imports over time. The U.S.-Australia FTA would transfer to perpetual TRQs. New U.S. TRQs for Canadian dairy products would gradually increase each year until year 19, plateauing at that point. The individual TRQs provided for Canadian dairy products include various items such as cheese, milk powder, yogurt, and butter. Japan would establish a new CSQ for U.S. corn and potato starch, increasing over time. Vietnam and Malaysia would eliminate tariffs on certain products within a few years. Japan and Vietnam would eliminate tariffs on soybean products, with different timelines for each. Japan, Malaysia, Vietnam, and the U.S. are making changes to tariffs on agricultural products. Malaysia and Vietnam would eliminate tariffs on corn and soybean products within a few years. Japan would lower tariffs on soybean meal and oil, establish a new quota for U.S. wheat, and reduce tariffs on U.S. corn and potato starch. The U.S. would see reductions in tariffs on Malaysian soybean and corn imports. Japan would establish new duty-free quotas for U.S. wheat and processed wheat products, with progressive reductions in tariffs over several years. Vietnam and Malaysia would eliminate tariffs on certain agricultural products within a specified timeframe. U.S. tariffs on Malaysian imports would also be reduced gradually. Japan would establish new duty-free quotas for U.S. barley, barley products, and rice, with progressive reductions in tariffs over several years. The quotas for barley would expand over time, while the rice quota would increase to 70,000 tons in year 13. U.S. tariffs on these products would be eliminated once the agreement enters into force. The U.S. rice industry would receive a new duty-free quota in Japan, starting at 50,000 tons and increasing to 70,000 tons in year 13. Japan would also allow more domestic entities to participate in tenders for rice imports. U.S. tariffs on rice products would be eliminated within 15 years. Vietnam's tariffs on cotton would be removed in four years. Japan would immediately eliminate tariffs on certain tree nuts. U.S. tariffs on cotton and nuts would be eliminated within specific timeframes under trade agreements with Japan and Vietnam. Japan would immediately remove tariffs on certain tree nuts, including almonds, walnuts, and pecans. Additionally, Japan would gradually reduce tariffs on oranges over six to eight years, extending the lower tariff season. The higher tariff period for citrus fruits in Japan would be shortened to December through March, with a safeguard for seven years. Tariffs on grapefruit, orange juice, and grapefruit juice would be phased out over six to eight years. Non-citrus fruits like fresh apples, cherries, grapes, and raisins would see immediate or gradual tariff reductions over the next five to ten years. The tariff reductions under the agreement include halving the tariff on fresh cherries upon entry into force and eliminating it over five years. Tariffs on fresh grapes, raisins, apricots, peaches, nectarines, plums, strawberries, raspberries, cranberries, kiwifruit, and avocados would be eliminated immediately or gradually. Vietnam and Malaysia would also reduce tariffs on various fruits over a period of time. Additionally, the United States would expand access to its sugar market by establishing new TRQs. The United States would expand access to its sugar market by establishing new TRQs for sugar and sugar-containing products totaling 86,300 tons annually. Australia and Canada would immediately receive new duty-free quotas totaling 65,000 tons and 19,200 tons per year, respectively. Japan would provide new TRQs to expand access to its market for sugar and sweetener-related processed products. Japan, the United States, Malaysia, and Vietnam have agreed to eliminate tariffs on various sweetener and tobacco products over different timeframes. Japan will provide new TRQs to expand market access for sugar and sweetener-related products, while the US will eliminate tariffs on tobacco within 10 years. Malaysia will eliminate tariffs on tobacco over 16 years, and Vietnam will gradually reduce tariffs on tobacco products over various timelines. A controversy has arisen over a provision in the agreement regarding investor state dispute protections. The TPP agreement includes the elimination of tariffs on various sweetener and tobacco products over different timeframes. There is a controversy over a provision that allows countries to deny protections under ISDS to tobacco manufacturers for claims related to tobacco control measures. The agreement also addresses market access for farm commodity groups and includes a timetable for tariff elimination on food and agricultural products in specific TPP markets. The TPP agreement outlines tariff elimination for food and agricultural products, with a focus on trade-related measures beyond tariffs and TRQs. Provisions cover areas such as sanitary and phytosanitary measures, technical barriers to trade, and biotechnology, benefiting U.S. agriculture. Rules of origin, SPS, agricultural biotechnology, GIs, export programs, and TBT are addressed in the agreement to ensure only TPP-origin goods receive preferential tariff rates and TRQs. The TPP agreement includes rules of origin, SPS, agricultural biotechnology, GIs, export programs, and TBT to determine TPP-origin goods eligible for preferential tariff rates and TRQs. Criteria for determining TPP origin include products grown, raised, or obtained in TPP countries, with exceptions for non-TPP content up to 10% of the transactional value. The TPP agreement includes rules of origin for goods, with a de minimis provision allowing non-TPP content up to 10% of the transactional value. Exceptions to this rule include certain agricultural products like dairy, edible oil-bearing crops, citrus juices, and non-TPP fruits used in production. Tariff rates have decreased for food and agricultural products, making non-tariff barriers more prominent in trade. The TPP agreement addresses non-tariff barriers in trade, specifically focusing on sanitary and phytosanitary measures (SPS) related to food safety, plant pests, and animal diseases. It goes beyond the WTO SPS agreement by including obligations such as risk assessment, transparency, and public comment on SPS measures. The agreement also establishes an SPS committee composed of TPP member representatives. The TPP agreement establishes an SPS committee of member representatives, requires SPS measures to be based on international standards or scientific evidence, and allows for public comment. It also mandates rapid notification of restricted shipments and outlines a dispute resolution process. Additionally, the agreement promotes transparency on laws related to biotechnology products and encourages information sharing on low-level presence of biotech material in food. The TPP agreement includes provisions on transparency and notification of national laws regarding agricultural biotechnology products. It establishes a working group on agricultural biotechnology and emphasizes the importance of information sharing to minimize disruptions to trade. Parties are not required to change their existing laws on biotechnology. Geographical Indications (GIs) are also addressed to protect the quality and reputation of products from specific regions. The TPP agreement addresses regulations and policies affecting trade in biotech products, emphasizing transparency and notification of national laws. Geographical Indications (GIs) protect the quality and reputation of products from specific regions, such as Parmesan cheese and Champagne. GIs have become controversial in international trade due to conflicting views on their protection. The TPP agreement addresses regulations on Geographical Indications (GIs), which protect product quality and reputation from specific regions. GIs can be controversial in international trade, with differing views on their protection. GIs can be considered generic or protected names, with examples like \"feta\" being protected in the EU but generic in the US. The agreement obligates members to recognize GIs transparently and provides a process for canceling GI protection. Interested parties can object to a GI's recognition for reasons like potential confusion with trademarks or existing applications. The TPP agreement addresses regulations on Geographical Indications (GIs), protecting product quality and reputation from specific regions. Reasons for opposing a GI include potential confusion with trademarks, pending applications, or if the term is a customary name in the country. TPP members are not required to recognize a GI if it is identical to a grape variety's name in their territory. Criteria for determining a customary common name include usage in dictionaries, newspapers, websites, and trade references. The agreement also allows interested parties to comment on and oppose the recognition of GIs from other international agreements involving TPP members. The TPP agreement addresses regulations on Geographical Indications (GIs), protecting product quality and reputation from specific regions. Members are to provide information on GIs from other agreements and allow comments. The agreement commits to eliminating export subsidies and encourages cooperation on export credits. It also discourages restrictions on food and agricultural exports. The TPP agreement aims to develop multilateral disciplines around export credits, credit guarantees, and insurance programs. It also discourages restrictions on food and agricultural exports, limiting such restrictions to 6 months and requiring consultation for restrictions lasting more than 12 months. Additionally, the agreement includes parameters for labeling and certification of wines and distilled spirits to facilitate trade. The TPP agreement includes provisions for labeling and certification of wines and distilled spirits, establishing parameters for information on labels and common definitions. It also addresses proprietary formulas for prepackaged foods and food additives, ensuring confidentiality and protection of commercial interests. Additionally, it encourages exchange of information on organic products among TPP members. The TPP agreement includes provisions for labeling and certification of wines and distilled spirits, as well as addressing proprietary formulas for prepackaged foods and food additives to protect commercial interests. It also encourages exchange of information on organic products among TPP members. Numerous food and agricultural organizations have expressed their support for the TPP agreement. Numerous food and agricultural organizations and commodity groups have expressed support for the TPP agreement since its issuance on November 5, 2015. These include the American Farm Bureau Federation, American Feed Industry Association, American Soybean Association, National Cattlemen's Beef Association, and others. Agricultural Technical Advisory Committees (ATACs) also provided input on the agreement. Several agricultural organizations and commodity groups, including the National Pork Producers Council, the Sweetener Users Association, the United Fresh Produce Association, and others, expressed support for the TPP agreement. Agricultural Technical Advisory Committees (ATACs) provided input to the President, the U.S. Trade Representative, and Congress on the completed TPP agreement. The ATAC for Trade in Fruits and Vegetables endorsed the TPP as beneficial for wine grape, nut, fruit, and vegetable growers. The ATAC for Trade in Sweeteners and Sweetener Products unanimously viewed the TPP agreement as meeting Congress' negotiating objectives under TPA (P.L. 114-26). The Pecan Growers Council, Texas Citrus Mutual, Washington State Potato Commission, and Western Growers, among others, expressed views on the TPP agreement. The ATAC for Trade in Sweeteners and Sweetener Products praised the agreement for meeting negotiating objectives but did not endorse it outright. Criticisms included dairy product TRQs from Canada and Japan and a product-specific exception for tobacco products. Groups opposing TPP include the Burley Tobacco Growers Cooperative Association, the National Farmers Union, R-CALF USA, and the U.S. Rice Producers. The UFCW and other groups oppose the TPP agreement due to concerns about lack of enforcement against currency manipulation and potential job loss. Despite some agricultural interest groups not taking a stance, trade ministers from 12 countries signed the agreement on February 4, 2016. Congress would need to pass implementing legislation for the agreement to enter into force. Trade ministers from 12 countries signed the TPP agreement on February 4, 2016. Congress would need to pass implementing legislation for the agreement to enter into force, with no time limit for action until legislation is introduced. Congress would then have up to 90 days to vote on the bill without amendments."
