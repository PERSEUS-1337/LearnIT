    "content": "The National Security Agency (NSA) conducted a secret Terrorist Surveillance Program (TSP), sparking a national debate on its legality under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). The program involved warrantless surveillance of international communications involving individuals believed to be associated with al Qaeda. The Bush Administration defended the program citing constitutional and statutory support. Senator Mitch McConnell introduced the Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006 as a standalone bill, along with the Terrorist Tracking, Identification and Prosecution Act of 2006. Senator Mitch McConnell introduced the Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006, along with other bills in the 109th and 110th Congress, addressing electronic surveillance programs for detecting and preventing terrorist threats. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act provides a framework for electronic surveillance to acquire foreign intelligence information. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) of 1978 provides a framework for electronic surveillance to acquire foreign intelligence information, including the use of surveillance tools like pen registers and trap and trace devices. The Bush Administration highlighted the limitations of FISA in combating terrorism due to lack of speed and agility. Attorney General Gonzales informed the Senate Judiciary Committee about FISC orders authorizing the targeting of international communications involving suspected members of terrorist organizations like al Qaeda. General Gonzales informed the Senate Judiciary Committee that FISC orders issued on January 10, 2007, authorized the government to target international communications involving suspected members of terrorist organizations like al Qaeda. All surveillance previously conducted under the TSP will now require FISC approval, and the President has decided not to reauthorize the TSP when the current authorization expires. The NSA program has faced legal and constitutional challenges. General Gonzales informed the Senate Judiciary Committee that FISC orders authorized targeting international communications involving suspected terrorists. The NSA program has faced legal challenges, with a court ruling it unconstitutional and enjoining the Terrorist Surveillance Program. The decision is currently under appeal. The decision to enjoin the Terrorist Surveillance Program has been appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. The appeal was stayed on October 4, 2006. Measures are being taken to address electronic surveillance programs under a new Title VII of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. The measures proposed would amend provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) related to electronic surveillance programs, including warrantless surveillance, Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court orders, liability for aiding in surveillance, and congressional oversight. Changes would also be made to definitions, criminal provisions, and provisions addressing weapons of mass destruction and international movements of surveillance targets. The Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006 proposes amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) related to electronic surveillance programs. It creates a new Title VII in FISA for electronic surveillance programs with a focus on gathering foreign intelligence information and protecting against international terrorism. The act allows for flexibility in naming targets and immediate surveillance after suspect activity is detected. The proposed amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) under the Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006 aim to establish electronic surveillance programs for gathering foreign intelligence information and combating international terrorism. The new Section 702(a) of FISA would grant jurisdiction to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to review, authorize, and reauthorize these programs. Initial authorizations can last up to 90 days, with reauthorizations determined by the FISC. If an application is denied, the Attorney General can submit new applications or appeal the decision. The Attorney General can seek reauthorization for electronic surveillance programs for up to 90 days. If denied, they can submit new applications or appeal to the FIS Court of Review. Surveillance under Title VII of FISA must be discontinued if criteria for electronic surveillance under Section 104 of Title I of FISA are met, unless certain conditions are fulfilled. The Attorney General can seek reauthorization for electronic surveillance programs for up to 90 days under Title VII of FISA. If denied, new applications can be submitted or appealed to the FIS Court of Review. Surveillance must be discontinued if criteria for electronic surveillance under Section 104 of Title I of FISA are met, unless certain conditions are fulfilled. New bills also authorize the transfer of cases involving challenges to the legality of classified communications intelligence activity related to a foreign threat to the FIS Court of Review. The Attorney General can seek reauthorization for electronic surveillance programs under FISA. If denied, new applications can be submitted or appealed to the FIS Court of Review. New bills authorize the transfer of cases involving challenges to classified communications intelligence activity to the FIS Court of Review. The FISC has jurisdiction to determine standing and legality of programs under proposed subsection 702(b)(2) of FISA. Any disclosure of national security information in a criminal proceeding would be governed by the Classified Information Procedures Act. Decisions of the FISC can be reviewed by the FIS Court of Review and the U.S. Supreme Court. Under proposed subsections 702(b)(1) and (2) of FISA, decisions of the FISC would be subject to review by the FIS Court of Review and the U.S. Supreme Court. The FISC or originating court may dismiss challenges to electronic surveillance programs, with litigation privileges preserved. A new Section 703 of FISA outlines requirements for approval of such programs, with the FISC authorized to request additional information from the Attorney General. Subsection 704 addresses necessary findings and contents. Subsection 704 of FISA establishes the necessary findings and contents for an ex parte FISC order approving an electronic surveillance program. The court must ensure that the program is consistent with the U.S. Constitution and consider specific factors in assessing its constitutionality. Additionally, new Section 705 of FISA addresses congressional oversight, requiring the Attorney General to submit classified reports every 180 days to the congressional intelligence committees. Sec. 705 of FISA mandates the Attorney General to provide classified reports every 180 days to congressional intelligence committees regarding activities under authorized electronic surveillance programs. Amendments in Sec. 8 of S. 3931 make changes to FISA, including repealing sections allowing the President to authorize surveillance without a court order. Sec. 8(a) of S. 3931 and Sec. 208(a) of S. 3929 repeal Sections 111, 309, and 404 of FISA, allowing the President to authorize surveillance without a court order for up to 15 days after a declaration of war. Current law prohibits interception of communications, with exceptions for official electronic surveillance authorized by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The proposed amendment allows officers, employees, or agents of the United States to conduct electronic surveillance in the course of their official duties under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. This would not be considered unlawful under certain provisions, including the exclusivity provision in current law. The proposed amendment allows US government officials to conduct electronic surveillance under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, excluding it from the exclusivity provision in current law. The proposed amendment allows US government officials to conduct electronic surveillance under FISA, excluding it from the exclusivity provision in current law. Amendments to FISA address criminal sanctions for unauthorized electronic surveillance and disclosure of information obtained through such surveillance. The proposed amendment increases penalties for unauthorized electronic surveillance and disclosure of information obtained through such surveillance, including fines up to $100,000 and imprisonment. The proposed amendment under S. 3931 and S. 3929 increases penalties for unauthorized electronic surveillance, including fines up to $100,000 and imprisonment for up to 15 years. Amendments to FISA definitions are also included. The proposed amendment under S. 3931 and S. 3929 increases penalties for unauthorized electronic surveillance, including fines up to $100,000 and imprisonment for up to 15 years. It also includes amendments to FISA definitions, such as redefining \"electronic surveillance\" to include specific criteria for acquiring information and the contents of communications. The proposed amendment under S. 3931 and S. 3929 increases penalties for unauthorized electronic surveillance, including fines up to $100,000 and imprisonment for up to 15 years. It also includes amendments to FISA definitions, such as redefining \"electronic surveillance\" to include specific criteria for acquiring information and the contents of communications. The surveillance involves the intentional acquisition of communication contents under circumstances where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy and a warrant would be required for law enforcement purposes. Minimization procedures are in place to limit the acquisition and retention of non-publicly available information regarding U.S. persons acquired during electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes. The current procedures allow for the retention and dissemination of evidence of criminal activity acquired during electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes. Nonpublicly available information not related to foreign intelligence cannot be disseminated in a way that identifies a US person without their consent, unless necessary to understand foreign intelligence information. Minimization procedures also apply to electronic surveillance without a court order, ensuring that communication contents involving a US person are not disclosed, disseminated, or retained for longer than 72 hours without a court order. Minimization procedures under FISA require that no contents of any communication involving a US person be disclosed, disseminated, or retained for longer than 72 hours without a court order, unless there is a threat of harm. Proposed changes would limit retention to 7 days unless authorized by a court order or the Attorney General. Proposed changes to FISA would require that no contents of any communication involving a US person be disclosed, disseminated, or retained for longer than 7 days without a court order, unless there is a threat of harm. This includes new definitions for \"contents\" in communications. The definition of \"contents\" in FISA would be updated to include information about the substance of a communication, excluding certain types of information. Electronic surveillance without a court order would be expanded to include acquiring the contents of communications of foreign powers or agents of foreign powers. The amendment to FISA would expand electronic surveillance to include acquiring the contents of communications of foreign powers or agents of foreign powers, removing the requirement for the Attorney General to certify no substantial likelihood of acquiring U.S. person communications. Compliance and reporting procedures remain in place under the amended language. Under the amended FISA language, electronic surveillance must comply with the Attorney General's certification and minimization procedures. The Attorney General is required to report compliance assessments to congressional intelligence committees. If surveillance targets an agent of a foreign power, the report must include justification for this belief. The Attorney General must submit the certification to the FISC under seal, unless certain criteria are met. Additionally, the Attorney General can direct common carriers to assist with authorized electronic surveillance. The current Sec.102(a)(4), 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(a)(4), allows the Attorney General to direct common carriers to assist with electronic surveillance while maintaining secrecy and minimizing interference. The proposed FISA amendment lacks this provision but introduces new authority for the President to authorize foreign intelligence acquisition for up to one year. The proposed FISA amendment introduces new authority for the President, through the Attorney General, to authorize the acquisition of foreign intelligence information for up to one year concerning individuals outside the United States, under certain conditions. The proposed FISA amendment introduces new authority for the President, through the Attorney General, to authorize the acquisition of foreign intelligence information for up to one year concerning individuals outside the United States. The certification by the Attorney General must meet specific criteria, including the use of minimization procedures and reporting assessments to congressional intelligence committees. Compliance with the certification and minimization procedures is required, with the Attorney General authorized to direct the furnishing of information and facilities for such acquisitions. The proposed FISA amendment grants the President, through the Attorney General, authority to acquire foreign intelligence information for up to one year on individuals outside the US. The Attorney General can direct a specified person to provide necessary information, facilities, and assistance while maintaining secrecy. Non-compliance can lead to FISC intervention and contempt of court charges. Compensation for aid provided is required under the new subsection of FISA. The Attorney General can direct a specified person to provide aid at the prevailing rate, with non-compliance leading to FISC intervention and contempt of court charges. A person receiving such a directive can challenge its legality by filing a petition with the FISC judges, who must review it within 24 hours. If deemed frivolous, the petition is denied, otherwise, a determination is made with reasons provided. A petition to modify or set aside a directive must be reviewed by the assigned judge within 72 hours. If the directive is found to be unlawful, it may be granted. Otherwise, the judge must affirm it and order compliance. Review of FISC decisions can be sought within seven days, with the option to petition the U.S. Supreme Court for further review. The FIS Court of Review must make a decision on a directive within seven days of the FISC decision, providing written reasons. Review decisions can be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. Judicial proceedings under Section 102 of FISA must be conducted promptly and maintained securely. Classified information in government submissions can be reviewed by the court privately. Proposed subsections of FISA aim to ensure petitions are filed under seal, allow for ex parte and in camera review of classified information by the court, preclude cause of action against providers for assisting the Government, and outline procedures for the lawful use and disclosure of information acquired under Attorney General authorization. Under Section 102 of FISA, information acquired may be used or disclosed by federal officers only for lawful purposes. Proposed subsections of FISA provide procedures for the use or disclosure of such information in federal or state proceedings. Additionally, no privileged communication obtained under Section 102 shall lose its privileged character. Proposed subsections 102(m) and (n) of FISA outline procedures for using or disclosing information acquired under Section 102 in federal or state proceedings. The government must notify the aggrieved person and the court before introducing the information as evidence. Similarly, a state or political subdivision must follow similar procedures for using or disclosing the information. Under proposed subsection 102(n) of FISA, a state or political subdivision must notify the aggrieved person, the court, and the U.S. Attorney General before using or disclosing information obtained from a Section 102 acquisition in any trial or proceeding. The aggrieved person can move to suppress the evidence if it was unlawfully acquired or not in conformity with an order. An aggrieved person can move to suppress evidence obtained from a Section 102 acquisition if it was unlawfully acquired or not in conformity with an order. The Attorney General can file an affidavit under oath to prevent disclosure if it would harm national security. The U.S. district court can review materials related to a Section 102 acquisition in camera and determine if it was lawfully conducted. Disclosure to the aggrieved person is allowed only if necessary for the case. The U.S. district court may review materials related to a Section 102 acquisition in camera and ex parte. Disclosure to the aggrieved person is allowed only if necessary for an accurate determination of legality. If the court finds the acquisition was not lawfully conducted, unlawfully obtained evidence would be suppressed. If lawfully conducted, the court would deny the aggrieved person's motion, except for required discovery or disclosure. Orders related to Section 102 acquisitions would be binding. Proposed subsection 102(r) of FISA allows federal officers to consult with law enforcement personnel to coordinate efforts in investigating or protecting against various threats posed by foreign powers or their agents. Coordination does not affect certifications. Proposed subsection 102(r) of FISA allows federal officers to coordinate with law enforcement to investigate threats from foreign powers or their agents. Directives and orders under Section 102 must be retained for 10 years. Amendments authorize the Chief Justice to designate FISC judges and provide authority for FISC orders under Title I of FISA with presidential approval. A new subsection 103(g) would be added to FISA, providing authority for FISC orders under Title I with presidential approval. Amendments to Sec. 104 of FISA include replacing current subsections with new ones. Applications for electronic surveillance under FISA must contain a certification of meeting certain requirements. The certification for court-authorized electronic surveillance under FISA would now be made by the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs or an executive branch official authorized by the President. Subsection 104(b) of FISA deals with excluding certain information from surveillance applications targeting foreign powers. The curr_chunk discusses the requirements for an application for a FISC order authorizing electronic surveillance on a foreign power, including the need for a statement on physical entry, surveillance techniques, and information on U.S. persons. It also mentions proposed changes to FISA sections and the process for the Attorney General to review surveillance requests. The curr_chunk discusses amendments to FISA sections 104 and 105, including expanding the list of officials who can request surveillance review and changes to the process for FISC judges to approve electronic surveillance orders. The curr_chunk discusses proposed changes to FISA sections 104 and 105, including modifications to the process for approving electronic surveillance orders. Proposed changes to FISA sections 104 and 105 include deleting current requirements for specifying surveillance devices and information exclusion in electronic surveillance orders. The amendment would now require each order to specify the type of electronic surveillance involved, including the need for physical entry. The proposed changes to FISA sections 104 and 105 involve specifying the type of electronic surveillance required, including the need for physical entry. Extensions of surveillance orders can be granted on the same basis as the original order, with exceptions for certain targeted groups. The proposed changes to FISA sections 104 and 105 involve specifying the type of electronic surveillance required, including the need for physical entry. Extensions of surveillance orders can be granted on the same basis as the original order, with exceptions for certain targeted groups. An extension of an order under FISA for surveillance targeted against a foreign agent may be granted for up to one year if certain conditions are met. The current subsection 105(f) of FISA allows for emergency authorization of electronic surveillance without a court order for up to 72 hours by the Attorney General in certain circumstances. Surveillance must be terminated when the information is acquired, if a court order is denied, or at the end of the 72 hours. The current subsection 105(f) of FISA allows for emergency authorization of electronic surveillance without a court order for up to 72 hours by the Attorney General. Surveillance must be terminated when the information is acquired, if a court order is denied, or at the end of the 72 hours. The new language would grant such authority to an executive branch officer appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. The new language would grant authority to an executive branch officer appointed by the President with Senate approval to conduct emergency electronic surveillance. The Attorney General must be informed, and a FISC judge must be notified as soon as possible within seven days after authorization. The new provision allows an executive branch officer appointed by the President to conduct emergency electronic surveillance. An application must be made to a FISC judge within seven days after authorization, replacing the previous 72-hour limit. The restrictions on disclosure and use of information remain the same. The revised provision allows an executive branch officer appointed by the President to conduct emergency electronic surveillance, with restrictions on disclosure and use of information. Modifications to FISA also include limitations of liability for those assisting in electronic surveillance or physical search. The revised provision in FISA allows emergency electronic surveillance by an executive branch officer appointed by the President, with restrictions on disclosure and use of information. It also includes limitations of liability for those assisting in electronic surveillance or physical search. Sec. 106 of FISA limits the use of information regarding unconsenting U.S. persons acquired from electronic surveillance. It includes notification requirements and allows an aggrieved person to move to suppress unlawfully acquired information. Sec. 9(g) of S. 3931 modifies the destruction of unintentionally acquired information, requiring the destruction of contents if both sender and recipients are in the U.S. and there is a reasonable expectation of privacy. The provision in subsection 106(i) of FISA, as amended by Sec. 209(g)(1)(B) of S. 3886 and Sec. 9(g)(1)(B) of S. 2453, is unclear regarding the destruction of contents acquired from electronic surveillance involving U.S. persons with a reasonable expectation of privacy. The provision in subsection 106(i) of FISA is unclear regarding the destruction of contents acquired from electronic surveillance involving U.S. persons with a reasonable expectation of privacy. The language needs clarification to specify the circumstances in which the contents should be destroyed, particularly if they contain significant foreign intelligence information or indicate a threat of harm. The Attorney General may determine to not destroy unintentionally acquired communication contents if they contain foreign intelligence information or indicate a threat of harm. Amendments are made to FISA sections regarding oversight and document management systems. The congressional oversight provisions of FISA are being amended to require a feasibility study for a secure document management system for electronic surveillance applications. Amendments to Title I of FISA are also being made. The amendments to Title I of FISA include adding new categories of persons who would be deemed \"agents of a foreign power\" under FISA, such as those involved in the development or proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The amendments to FISA include new categories of persons who would be considered \"agents of a foreign power,\" such as those engaging in sabotage, international terrorism, or the development of weapons of mass destruction. The amendments to FISA would define an \"agent of a foreign power\" to include individuals involved in the development or proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, such as destructive devices, toxic chemicals, biological agents, or radiation-emitting weapons. The proposed amendments to FISA would expand the definition of an \"agent of a foreign power\" to include individuals involved in the development or proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, such as radiation-emitting weapons. Additionally, the amendments would extend the duration of FISC orders authorizing electronic surveillance and physical searches to address international movements of targets. The proposed amendments to FISA would extend the authorized period of surveillance for physical searches even if the target is outside the United States, unless a motion to terminate the order is granted by the court. Amendments would also include changes to the table of contents of FISA, replacing current sections with new ones and creating a new Title VII."
