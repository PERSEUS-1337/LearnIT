    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Local Energy Supply and Resiliency Act of 2013\". Congress finds that a significant amount of energy in the United States is wasted as heat from power plants and other facilities. This waste heat can be recovered and used for heating, cooling, or electricity generation. Utilizing local renewable energy resources can enhance energy reliability and resiliency in the country. Renewable energy resources in communities in the United States can meet local energy needs, strengthen energy reliability, reduce reliance on fossil fuels, and create jobs. District energy systems offer opportunities to utilize waste heat and renewable resources effectively. District energy systems increase energy supply resiliency, keep energy dollars in local economies, tap waste heat and renewable energy resources, provide infrastructure for combined heat and power systems, serve various institutions and areas, help reduce peak power demand, and address power transmission constraints. The Act aims to promote the use of waste heat and renewable thermal energy to reduce fossil fuel consumption. Strategies include shifting power demand, generating power near load centers, and utilizing district energy systems. Technical assistance is often needed to overcome barriers, and a lack of capital funding hinders the implementation of local waste heat and renewable energy resources. The Act aims to encourage the use of waste heat and renewable thermal energy to reduce fossil fuel consumption, enhance energy supply resiliency, reduce air pollution, strengthen industrial competitiveness, and retain energy dollars in local economies. It also aims to facilitate the implementation of local energy infrastructure through technical assistance and low-cost financing. The Act aims to encourage the use of waste heat and renewable thermal energy to reduce fossil fuel consumption, enhance energy supply resiliency, reduce air pollution, strengthen industrial competitiveness, and retain energy dollars in local economies. It also aims to facilitate the implementation of local energy infrastructure through technical assistance and low-cost financing. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines terms such as \"combined heat and power system,\" \"district energy system,\" and \"Loan Guarantee Program\" to promote the use of waste heat and renewable thermal energy. It aims to support local energy infrastructure projects through technical assistance and low-cost financing. The Loan Guarantee Program, established under section 5, supports local energy infrastructure projects that recover energy from waste or renewable sources, use combined heat and power systems, distribute electricity in microgrids, store thermal energy, or transfer thermal energy via district energy systems. A microgrid is a controllable entity that can connect and disconnect from the grid. A microgrid is a group of interconnected loads and distributed energy resources that can operate independently or connect to the main grid. Renewable energy resources include biomass, geothermal energy, municipal solid waste, and solar energy. The term \"renewable thermal energy\" refers to heating or cooling energy derived from renewable sources, natural cooling sources, or other renewable thermal energy sources as determined by the Secretary of Energy. The term \"thermal energy\" includes heating energy in the form of hot water or steam for space heating, domestic hot water, or process heat, as well as cooling energy in the form of chilled water. Thermal energy includes heating energy for space heating, domestic hot water, or process heat, and cooling energy for air conditioning or process cooling. Waste energy refers to energy contained in exhaust gases, hot liquids, or industrial tail gas that would otherwise be wasted. The curr_chunk discusses the types of waste energy that qualify for consideration, including gas from industrial processes, waste gas, pressure drops in gas systems, condenser water, and other forms of waste energy as determined by the Secretary. It also specifies that this waste energy must not be currently used in existing facilities or conventionally used in new facilities. The technical assistance program outlined in Section 4 focuses on qualifying types of waste energy, such as gas from industrial processes, waste gas, pressure drops in gas systems, and condenser water, as determined by the Secretary. This waste energy should not be currently utilized in existing facilities or conventionally used in new facilities. The Secretary will establish a program to provide technical assistance for identifying, evaluating, planning, and designing local energy infrastructure. This assistance includes opportunities for waste energy or renewable resources, technical and economic assessments, utility interconnection, contract negotiations, permitting, marketing, business planning, and engineering design. Information dissemination is also included in the program. The program established by the Secretary provides technical assistance for identifying, evaluating, planning, and designing local energy infrastructure. This includes waste energy or renewable resources, assessments, utility interconnection, contract negotiations, permitting, marketing, business planning, and engineering design. Information dissemination is also part of the program, with grants covering costs for initial assessments and feasibility studies. Eligible entities can receive assistance, including nonprofits and for-profit organizations. The Secretary may award grants to eligible entities for various costs related to local energy infrastructure, including initial assessments, feasibility studies, guidance on overcoming barriers, and detailed engineering. Eligible entities must submit applications for technical assistance in a competitive process outlined by the Secretary. The Secretary may require applications for technical assistance in a competitive process, prioritizing projects that maximize fossil fuel elimination, enhance energy reliability, minimize environmental impact, promote renewable energy, and boost industrial competitiveness. The Secretary shall adopt rules and procedures for the administration of the program established under this section within 180 days of enactment. $150,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2014 through 2018 to carry out this section. SEC. 1706 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 introduces the Local Energy Infrastructure Loan Guarantee Program. $150,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2014 through 2018 to support this program. SEC. 1706 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 introduces the Local Energy Infrastructure Loan Guarantee Program, allowing the Secretary to provide guarantees for commercial or innovative projects defined as 'local energy infrastructure'. $4 billion is reserved for loan guarantees under this program, with unobligated funds from section 1703 to be used whenever possible. SEC. 6 amends the definition of investment area in the Community Development Banking and Financial Institutions Act of 1994 to include local energy infrastructure projects as defined in the Local Energy Supply and Resiliency Act of 2013."
