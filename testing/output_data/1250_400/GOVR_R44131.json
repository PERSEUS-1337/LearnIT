Congressional actions have been proposed to resolve these issues and move the program forward. Research into unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs) began in 1999 with separate projects by the Navy and the Air Force in collaboration with DARPA. In 1999, the Navy and DARPA started research on unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs). The Navy's UCAV, known as N-UCAV, was designed for reconnaissance missions in protected airspace to identify targets for manned aircraft. Northrop Grumman built a single X-47A air vehicle for testing under the N-UCAV program. In December 2002, the OSD mandated the Navy and Air Force to merge their UCAV efforts into a joint program to achieve synergy. The N-UCAV program began in 1999 with the Navy and DARPA. In 2003, the Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems (J-UCAS) program was created to demonstrate the feasibility of high-performance unmanned air vehicles for various missions. The focus was on operating in denied enemy territory. The J-UCAS program focused on deep, denied enemy territory operations and survivability. In 2006, it was terminated, leading to the development of the Navy's N-UCAS program for persistent surveillance and strike capabilities in high-threat areas. The UCAS-D program was initiated in 2006 to demonstrate technical feasibility. The Navy's N-UCAS program, following J-UCAS, aimed to provide persistent surveillance and strike capabilities in high-threat areas. The UCAS-D program demonstrated the technical feasibility of operating unmanned air combat systems from an aircraft carrier. The Navy invested over $1.4 billion in UCAS-D, leading to the development of the UCLASS program to address a capability gap in sea-based surveillance and enhance operational capabilities in contested environments. The UCLASS program was developed by the Navy to address a capability gap in sea-based surveillance and enhance operational capabilities in contested environments. The requirements for UCLASS were altered in 2012 to heavily favor permissive airspace intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities, which appeared to be budget-driven. The JROC revised the UCLASS requirements in 2012, favoring permissive airspace ISR capabilities due to budget constraints. The Navy emphasized affordability and adaptability, redefining the scope of the program to support various missions. The JROC prioritized affordability in a December 2012 memorandum. The Office of the Secretary of Defense emphasized affordability as the top priority for the UCLASS program in a December 2012 memorandum. The Capability Development Document set a Key Performance Parameter for the air vehicles' cost not to exceed $150 million for one 600 nautical mile orbit. The Navy issued a draft request for proposals in April 2014, focusing on affordability, timely fielding, and endurance for the UCLASS system. The UCLASS program, as outlined by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and Chief of Naval Research RADM Mathias Winter, aims to provide two intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance orbits over uncontested airspace with a light strike capability. The design allows for growth to operate in contested environments, with the ultimate goal of an autonomous aircraft capable of precision strike in such environments. The UCLASS program aims to provide intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities with the ability to operate in contested environments. Delays in procurement have been experienced due to changes in requirements, with the award of the air system contract now expected in fiscal year 2017, a delay of around 3 years. The Navy has decided to review its airborne surveillance systems and carrier air wing's future, leading to schedule adjustments. The air system contract award is now expected in fiscal year 2017, delayed by around 3 years. Early operational capability for a UCLASS system on an aircraft carrier is now expected in fiscal year 2022, delayed by around 2 years. Further delays may occur due to evolving requirements and changes in DOD priorities."
