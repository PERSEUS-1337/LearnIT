    "content": "Each year, Congress funds the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to renew over 2.1 million Section 8 vouchers, which are rental subsidies for low-income families in the private market. The vouchers cover the difference between rent and the tenant's contribution (30% of adjusted income). The program is federally funded but administered locally by public housing authorities. In recent years, Congress has made changes to the Section 8 voucher renewal funding formula, leading to funding uncertainty for many Public Housing Authorities (PHAs). This has prompted pressure on Congress to consider permanent funding reform legislation. The changes started in FY2003, moving away from funding based on previous year's costs to a new formula. Each PHA was given a reserve for unexpected cost increases. The voucher program funding for Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) was based on their previous year's average per-voucher cost adjusted for inflation. Despite receiving full funding, PHAs struggled to lease all authorized vouchers, with national utilization rates below 95%. PHAs often had excess funds in their budgets and rarely needed to dip into their reserves, allowing HUD to recapture excess funds at the end of the year. HUD and PHAs had more money in their budgets than needed, rarely dipping into reserves. HUD recaptured excess funds at year-end. Funding for Section 8 vouchers was based on actual costs plus inflation. PHAs could use excess funds for new vouchers through maximized leasing. Congress provided more funds than needed, recapturing unused funds the following year. In FY2003, Congress changed PHAs funding to limit recaptures. In FY2003, Congress changed the funding for PHAs to limit recaptures of unspent funds and provide more accurate funding levels based on actual voucher usage. HUD was directed to fund PHAs based on their average annual per-voucher cost from the previous year, increased by inflation, and multiplied by the number of vouchers they could reasonably lease. This change reduced the amount of appropriations needed for the program. In FY2003, Congress changed funding for PHAs to base budgets on utilization rates and costs reported on year-end statements. HUD implemented this provision to renew contracts based on unit months under lease and actual cost data. Based on HUD guidance, renewal calculations for PHAs in FY2003 were based on unit months under lease and actual cost data. Funding increments were generally renewed for three months, allowing for more accurate funding calculations. Congress also established a Central Reserve fund to replenish PHA reserves in case of increased costs. The FY2004 appropriations law continued the direction of the FY2003 law by instructing HUD to fund PHAs based on actual voucher utilization, rather than the total number of vouchers authorized. Restrictions were also placed on maximized leasing, preventing PHAs from supporting more vouchers than they were authorized to lease in a year. This caused challenges for over-leased PHAs, forcing them to limit reissuing vouchers to maintain authorized leasing levels. The FY2004 appropriations law continued the trend from FY2003, directing HUD to fund PHAs based on actual voucher utilization and restricting maximized leasing. Concerns about cost increases led to expectations for the Secretary to control costs by renewing expiring contracts based on utilization. The FY2004 appropriations law directed HUD to fund PHAs based on actual voucher utilization and restricted maximized leasing. The Secretary was expected to control costs by renewing expiring contracts based on utilization, including changes in the use of the Central Reserve fund. The FY2004 appropriations law directed HUD to fund PHAs based on actual voucher utilization and restricted maximized leasing. The Secretary could use Central Reserve funds only to replenish reserves depleted because of increased utilization, not increased costs. HUD issued a notice implementing the FY2004 appropriations law, stating that PHAs' budgets would be based on their utilization rates and costs as reported on their end-of-the-year statements. PHAs could appeal to the Secretary only if they could document that rental costs in their areas had risen higher than expected. The notice issued by HUD in August 2003 required PHAs to base their budgets on end-of-the-year statements, adjusted by the AAF. PHAs could appeal if rental costs had risen higher than the inflation factor. HUD granted appeals to 380 agencies in 2004, distributing $160 million from the Central Reserve. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act further moved towards budget-based funding for PHAs. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act directed HUD to fund PHAs based on voucher costs and utilization rates from May-July 2004 plus the AAF, adjusted for new tenant protection vouchers. If data was unavailable, funding was based on February-April 2004 data or the most recent year-end financial statement. If funding was insufficient, budgets were prorated, and PHAs were expected to manage their programs within their budgets for CY2005. HUD was to provide flexibility for agencies to adjust payment standards and policies as needed. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act directed HUD to fund PHAs based on voucher costs and utilization rates from May-July 2004 plus the AAF, adjusted for new tenant protection vouchers. PHAs were expected to manage their voucher programs within their budgets for CY2005, with reduced reserves and no Central Reserve provided. The act also changed the funding cycle for PHAs to a calendar year basis, resulting in one-time budget authority savings. HUD published guidance on these provisions in December 2004. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act directed HUD to fund PHAs based on voucher costs and utilization rates from May-July 2004 plus the AAF, adjusted for new tenant protection vouchers. PHAs had to adjust their budgeting to a calendar-year cycle, with guidance published by HUD in December 2004. Agencies received preliminary budget levels on December 17, 2004, with a deadline to report data errors. Appeals were limited to data errors only, with final calculations and proration factors published on January 21, 2005. Agencies were funded at 4.03% less than their actual cost and utilization levels from May-July 2004, plus the 2005 AAF, due to insufficient funding from Congress. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act directed HUD to fund PHAs based on voucher costs and utilization rates from May-July 2004 plus the AAF, adjusted for new tenant protection vouchers. Agencies were funded at just under 96% of their actual cost and utilization levels due to insufficient funding from Congress. HUD provided administrative options to PHAs to lower costs in 2005, including lowering payment standards, reducing utility assistance, and monitoring income eligibility more strictly. The FY2006 HUD Appropriations Act (P.L. 109-115) provided renewal funding to PHAs based on CY2005 eligibility, adjusted for inflation and additional vouchers. The Act also allowed for budget adjustments for agencies with low leasing or increased costs. HUD retained the prohibition on maximized leasing in FY2006. The FY2006 HUD Appropriations Act provided funding to PHAs based on CY2005 eligibility, with adjustments for inflation and additional vouchers. Agencies could request budget adjustments for low leasing or increased costs. HUD retained the prohibition on maximized leasing in FY2006. The changes enacted in FY2005 and FY2006 incentivized PHAs to reduce costs, leading to a decline in average annual per voucher costs from 2004 to 2005 and a further decrease through September 2006. Utilization also decreased from a peak of over 98% in 2004 to around 90%. The FY2006 HUD Appropriations Act incentivized PHAs to reduce costs, leading to a decline in average annual per voucher costs from 2004 to 2005 and a further decrease through September 2006. Utilization also decreased, with nearly 100,000 fewer households receiving assistance in 2006 compared to 2004. PHAs accumulated reserve funds, with unspent balances averaging 10% of their budget authority from January 2005 to September 2006. Budget utilization dropped nationally from over 98% in 2003 and 2004 to under 92% in 2006. The debate in FY2007 continued between a \"budget-based\" and \"unit-based\" funding formula for PHAs. In FY2007, the debate continued between a budget-based and unit-based funding formula for PHAs. President Bush requested a budget-based formula for the voucher program, but Congress rejected this and adopted a formula based on how much funding PHAs were using. Some PHAs had excess funding they were not permitted to use, leading to a formula change in the final FY2007 appropriations law. In FY2007, Congress rejected President Bush's budget-based formula for PHAs and adopted a formula based on how much funding PHAs were using. PHAs with excess funding were not permitted to serve additional families from their waiting lists. The final FY2007 appropriations law included a formula based on PHAs' leasing and cost data from the most recent 12 months, adjusted for various factors, and prorated to fit within the amount appropriated. The law also established a central reserve fund for adjustments due to unforeseen circumstances or formula shifts that could result in a loss of voucher units. The FY2007 appropriations law established a reserve fund for adjustments for PHAs experiencing significant changes in renewal costs or voucher funding. P.L. 110-28 later amended the formula to provide exceptions for certain PHAs, including those affected by Hurricane Katrina and those under receivership. The FY2007 formula change for Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) was based on their usage in FY2006 rather than the amount they received. PHAs with higher costs and utilization rates did better under the new formula, while those with lower costs did worse. Funding was sufficient for all PHAs to serve at least the same number of families as before. The FY2007 formula combined unit-based and budget-based elements. The FY2007 formula for Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) was a combination of unit-based and budget-based elements. It provided funding based on usage in FY2006, ensuring agencies could serve the same number of families or more within their caps. President Bush's FY2008 budget proposed a similar \"budget-based\" formula, adjusting funding based on eligibility in 2007 and other program costs. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 110-161) adopted a cost and utilization-based funding formula for Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) similar to FY2007. It funded agencies based on leasing and costs in the prior calendar year, adjusted for the AAF, FSS deposits, tenant protection vouchers, and project-based commitments. It also provided a central reserve fund for adjustments and an alternative formula for specific categories of agencies. The FY2008 Act included a rescission that reduced PHAs' funding levels by the amount of unusable reserves exceeding 7% of their total received in FY2007, totaling $723 million in rescinded renewal funding. This allowed Congress to free up unusable reserves for new allocations. The FY2008 Act rescinded $723 million in renewal funding to PHAs, freeing up unusable reserves for new allocations. President Bush requested a budget-based funding formula in FY2009, but Congress rejected it, opting for a hybrid, cost, and utilization-based formula for PHA funding. The omnibus funding bill directed HUD to fund PHAs based on a hybrid, cost, and utilization-based formula adopted in FY2008. PHAs were allocated funding based on leased vouchers and costs from FY2008, adjusted for inflation. The allocation was prorated based on HUD's estimate of Net Restricted Assets, with an offset of $750 million rescinded. PHAs were expected to supplement their funding with unused NRA and there was a $100 million renewal set-aside for adjustments in certain circumstances. HUD based CY2009 allocations on utilization and cost data from FY2008. HUD allocated funding to Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) for CY2009 based on utilization and cost data from FY2008. However, some PHAs faced funding shortfalls due to inaccurately reported data or changes in leasing conditions. Approximately 15% of PHAs administering the voucher program experienced insufficient funding. HUD provided additional assistance through a $100 million renewal set-aside and $30 million in administrative fees. HUD estimated that 15% of PHAs administering the voucher program faced funding shortfalls in CY2009. To address this issue, HUD provided additional funding through a $100 million renewal set-aside and $30 million in administrative fees. Congress also enacted legislation allowing HUD to access up to $200 million to prevent PHAs from terminating assistance to families. In response to concerns about families losing assistance, Congress enacted legislation allowing HUD to access up to $200 million in additional funding to prevent PHAs from terminating assistance. The policy change increased the set-aside renewal funding provided to HUD in FY2009 and expanded its purposes. The Obama Administration's FY2010 budget requested a funding formula similar to previous years, with the authority to offset agencies' budgets for excess reserves and reallocate funding to high-performing or needy agencies. The budget also requested lifting the prohibition on over-leasing for PHAs. The FY2010 funding law adopted a funding formula based on FY2009 cost and leasing data, adjusted for inflation. It did not provide the Secretary with the authority to offset agency budgets based on reserves or lift the prohibition on over-leasing. Unlike FY2008 and FY2009, the FY2010 allocation formula included no offset for unspent agency reserves. Congress directed HUD to allocate Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher renewal funding to PHAs based on their costs and utilization in FY2011 and FY2012. In FY2011 and FY2012, Congress directed HUD to allocate Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher renewal funding to PHAs based on their costs and utilization. The FY2011 law (P.L. 112-10) had no offset from PHA reserves, while the FY2012 law (P.L. 112-55) included a $650 million rescission offset from PHAs with reserves above a certain level. PHAs experienced changes in serving families and spending federal funding following formula changes between FY2003 and FY2006. The recent hybrid cost and utilization-based funding model has impacted PHAs' utilization patterns. Since the change to a hybrid cost and utilization-based funding model in FY2007, Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) have seen an increase in funding utilization from 91% in 2006 to 95% by the end of 2009. By 2009, PHAs were serving over 150,000 more families than in 2006, surpassing the previous high point in 2003. Reserves accumulated during budget-based formula days in 2005 and 2006 were spent down due to rescissions in FY2008 and FY2009. Per voucher costs began rising in CY2007 and were expected to continue increasing in CY2012. Congressional members have introduced voucher reform legislation in recent years. Per voucher costs rose in CY2007 and were expected to continue increasing in CY2012. Congressional members have introduced voucher reform legislation in recent years, but Appropriations Committees have the authority to override any new funding formula. Prior to FY2003, the Section 8 voucher program was funded like an entitlement program, limiting Congress's ability to control funding without reducing the number of vouchers. Prior to FY2003, the Section 8 voucher program was funded like an entitlement program, limiting Congress's ability to control funding without reducing the number of vouchers. In response to concerns about inefficient funding allocations and rising costs, Congress enacted funding changes starting in FY2003, converting the program's funding structure to a fixed sum of money annually. This gave Congress greater control over the budget, but many Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) argued it made the program more difficult to administer due to limited control over costs. Many Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) faced challenges with the Section 8 voucher program after funding changes in FY2003. The program's budget was converted to a fixed sum of money annually, giving Congress more control but limiting PHAs' control over costs. PHAs made adjustments such as lowering payment standards and selecting higher-income families to manage subsidy costs. Some landlords chose to no longer participate in the program due to reduced rents, leading to PHAs intentionally reducing their utilization rates. Many Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) faced challenges with the Section 8 voucher program after funding changes in FY2003. PHAs had the option of selecting higher-income families to lower subsidy costs, but were still required to target 75% of vouchers to low-income families. Some PHAs intentionally reduced their utilization rates to save money, leading to fewer households receiving vouchers in FY2005. Data from HUD showed that voucher costs leveled off and utilization rates declined from 2005 to 2006. According to CRS analysis of HUD data, average voucher costs declined by around 1.5% and average utilization declined by over 2% from 2005 to 2006. Some agencies had funds they were not permitted to spend, leading to controversy among low-income housing advocates and PHA industry groups. Calls were made for a return to an actual-cost and unit-based funding formula. The changes enacted through FY2006 were controversial with low-income housing advocates and PHA industry groups. Advocates called for a return to an actual-cost and unit-based formula, while PHA groups expressed difficulties with the current formula. The FY2007 funding bill reversed recent trends by enacting a voucher renewal funding formula similar to the original one. PHAs were funded based on the previous year's usage, resulting in some agencies receiving less funding in FY2007. However, funding was sufficient to serve all families and additional ones, as long as they were not overleasing. The FY2008 and FY2009 formulas closely followed the FY2007 formula, with reductions for agencies with excess reserve funding. The funding formulas for Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) from FY2008 to FY2011 closely followed the FY2007 formula, with adjustments for agencies with excess reserve funding. In FY2012, agency reserves were used to offset renewal costs. The shift to a cost and utilization-based model incentivized PHAs to increase utilization, leading to rising costs and utilization. This could pressure policymakers to find ways to contain program costs. PHAs have an incentive to increase utilization and spend all funding, leading to rising costs. This could pressure policymakers to find ways to contain program costs while maintaining service levels to families. Voucher reform legislation aims to maximize families served but may not cap future cost growth."
