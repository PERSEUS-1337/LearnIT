    "content": "The EPA believes there should be a higher rate of NSR permits for new or expanded facilities. The CAA requires preconstruction review and permits for major modifications or new sources of air pollution. States with EPA-approved SIPs must approve new construction or modifications to ensure compliance with NAAQS and PSD regulations. The NSR process is triggered for any new source potentially emitting 100 tons annually. The New Source Review (NSR) process is triggered for new sources potentially emitting 100 tons annually of any criteria air pollutant. NSR requirements depend on whether the sources are subject to Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) or non-attainment provisions. PSD sources must install Best Available Control Technology (BACT), while non-attainment sources must install Lowest Achievable Emission Rate (LAER) and obtain offsets. Both BACT and LAER must be at least as stringent as federal standards. The New Source Review (NSR) process requires new sources emitting 100 tons annually of any criteria air pollutant to comply with either Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) or non-attainment provisions. PSD sources must use Best Available Control Technology (BACT), while non-attainment sources must use Lowest Achievable Emission Rate (LAER) and obtain offsets. Both BACT and LAER must meet or exceed federal standards. Despite the broad coverage of NSR, few preconstruction permits have been issued to coal-fired power plants. The lack of permits is not surprising given the steady capacity of coal-fired electric generating facilities in the US. Emissions trends for electric utilities show a generally static situation with NOx emissions from coal-fired facilities remaining constant. Emissions trends for electric utilities indicate a generally static situation with NOx emissions from coal-fired facilities remaining constant. However, there was a significant drop in SO2 emissions in 1995 due to the acid rain control program under title IV of the 1990 CAA Amendments. This program required power plants to reduce emissions, resulting in a notable decrease in SO2 emissions. Despite these reductions, some of the gains have been offset by increases in emissions from other sources. The acid rain control program under title IV of the 1990 CAA Amendments led to a reduction in SO2 emissions from power plants, decreasing from 10 million tons in 1990 to 5.3 million tons in 1995. However, while there was a 4.7 million ton reduction in SO2 emissions by 1995, overall emissions only decreased by about 3.6 million tons. Similarly, a 0.4 million ton reduction in NOx emissions by 1996 was offset by an overall reduction of only about 0.1 million tons. This slippage is attributed to the continuing operation of existing coal-fired facilities, despite a lack of new plant construction. The increase in coal-fired electricity generation and related coal consumption over the past decade is due to utility efforts to optimize performance of existing facilities. Contrary to historical expectations, coal-fired capacity utilization has increased, and unit efficiency has not decreased. This suggests a fundamental change in the economics of plant maintenance, allowing utilities to invest more in maintaining their coal-fired capacity. The EPA lawsuits question the sustainability of these efforts. The economics of plant maintenance for coal-fired facilities have changed, allowing utilities to invest more in maintaining capacity. EPA lawsuits question whether this maintenance constitutes \"routine maintenance\" or a \"major modification\" under the CAA. The issue is likely to intensify with the restructuring of the electric utility industry. Many utilities avoid using the term \"life extension\" for spending on old power plants due to the 1970 Clean Air Act. The electric utility industry is facing challenges with plant maintenance and spending on old power plants due to the 1970 Clean Air Act. Regulatory activities related to electricity generation and air quality are increasing, with a focus on emissions control and compliance. Regulatory activities related to electricity generation and air quality include the Ozone Transport Rule, Section 126 Petitions, Regional Haze Rule, new NAAQS for Fine Particulates, revised Ozone NAAQS, and NSPS for NOx for electric utilities. NSR enforcement is a primary tool for enforcing existing laws and regulations, separate from regulatory development activities. EPA's enforcement actions under NSR are not linked to the regulatory initiatives mentioned earlier. The EPA's enforcement actions under NSR are separate from regulatory development activities related to electricity generation and air quality. NSR enforcement allows EPA to impose remedial actions on coal-fired utilities, including monetary penalties and the installation of control devices like flue-gas desulfurization units and selective catalytic reduction units to reduce emissions of SO2 and NOx. The EPA recently promulgated a new NOx NSPS for new utility boilers, which could require existing boilers to install SCR units for compliance. These controls could lead to substantial reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions, equivalent to taking 26 million cars off the road and reducing acid rain by 15%. The focus on NSR reflects a belief that continuing operation of aging coal-fired plants is a future trend under electric utility restructuring. The focus on NSR reflects the belief that aging coal-fired plants will continue operating under electric utility restructuring. Extending the life of existing coal-fired capacity is cost-effective and a trend in the industry for almost two decades. EPA has started enforcing NSR on existing coal-fired electric generating facilities. The EPA has been enforcing NSR on existing coal-fired electric generating facilities since October 1988. The primary difficulty with NSR has been defining a major modification, with the CAA first using the term \"modification\" in the 1970 CAA Amendments. EPA defined modification as any physical or operational change resulting in an increase in the maximum hourly emission rate of any controlled air pollutant. The EPA defined modification as any physical or operational change that increases the emission of air pollutants from a stationary source. The definition evolved over time, with different thresholds for NSPS and NSR programs. For NSR, a significant increase in emissions is defined in terms of tons per year emitted by a major source, with thresholds set at 40 tons for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Enforcement of these thresholds has been challenging. In the late 1980s, EPA faced challenges in enforcing thresholds for emissions increases in major sources under the NSR program. Life extension efforts by utilities often did not exceed the 40-ton threshold for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, as they mainly focused on improving unit availability and reliability without increasing capacity or emission rates. However, the issue arose when EPA decided to enforce NSR against facilities undergoing life extension activities, leading to questions about measuring emission changes and establishing baselines. In the late 1980s, EPA faced challenges in enforcing thresholds for emissions increases in major sources under the NSR program. Life extension efforts by utilities often focused on improving unit availability and reliability without increasing capacity or emission rates. EPA ruled that a life extension project by Wisconsin Electric Power Company met the trigger for NSR due to potential increased emissions after the project compared to actual emissions before. The new \"test\" compares a facility's actual emissions before modification with projected actual emissions after modification to determine NSR applicability. The current NSR regulations for utility plants require comparing a facility's actual emissions before a modification with its projected actual emissions after the modification. EPA excludes routine maintenance, repair, and replacement from being considered a modification. Utilities have adjusted their life extension efforts to fit into routine maintenance schedules, using terms like capital improvement and performance improvement instead of \"life extension.\" Utilities have adjusted their life extension efforts to fit into routine maintenance schedules, using terms like capital improvement and performance improvement instead of \"life extension.\" The distinction between \"modification\" and \"routine maintenance\" is effectively blurred by integrating life extension efforts into facilities' operation and maintenance schedules. The Justice Department's lawsuits aim to enforce New Source Review requirements of the Clean Air Act for coal-fired capacity by investor-owned utilities. EPA has issued regulations to address instances where changing utility strategies for managing existing facilities trigger the applicability of rules. EPA is enforcing New Source Review requirements of the Clean Air Act for coal-fired capacity by investor-owned utilities. The agency has issued a Compliance Order regarding modifications by the Tennessee Valley Authority's coal-fired power plants. Tables identify facilities violating NSR requirements, seeking injunctive relief and civil penalties. The Justice Department/EPA may modify complaints and issue additional ones as investigations progress. Each complaint seeks penalties of up to $25,000 per day of violation. The Justice Department/EPA is enforcing New Source Review requirements of the Clean Air Act for coal-fired capacity by investor-owned utilities. Complaints may be modified and additional ones issued as investigations progress. Each complaint seeks penalties of up to $25,000 per day of violation, with injunctive relief requiring compliance with all CAA requirements and remedying past NSR violations. TVA's compliance order includes developing a schedule for meeting requirements, auditing coal-fired power plants for NSR compliance, and retiring SO2 allowances for reductions resulting from compliance. Industry response focuses on an exemption for \"routine maintenance\" under NSR regulations. The industry's response to EPA's enforcement action on NSR compliance focuses on an exemption for \"routine maintenance.\" They argue that activities triggering NSR violations were previously accepted by EPA and are necessary for plant operation. The industry argues that activities triggering NSR violations are necessary for plant operation, akin to routine maintenance. They believe that applying NSR to sources under the cap will lead to increased pollution elsewhere at a higher cost. The EPA Administrator claims that controlling emissions from these plants could result in significant reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. The EPA Administrator states that controlling emissions from plants could lead to an 85 to 95 percent reduction in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. This would result in reductions of 1.87 million tons of SO2 and 0.63 million tons of NOx. Despite the potential for substantial emission reductions, the complexity of the Clean Air Act may impact the effectiveness of the NSR action. The Clean Air Act is a complex legislation with different reduction requirements for SO2 emissions. Title IV limits total SO2 emissions from utilities to 8.9 million tons, enforced through tonnage limitations and emission offset requirements. Emissions allowances are allocated to existing facilities based on preset and historical data, allowing for trading or banking for future use. Title IV of the Clean Air Act created an emissions allowance system for SO2. Allowances are authorized to emit a ton of SO2 and can be used at the allocated plant, traded, or banked. The program has 100% compliance but does not integrate well with the NSR program. NSR focuses on modifications and BACT installation, while Title IV aims to reduce aggregate SO2 emissions with flexibility for compliance strategies. Compliance with the cap is the key criterion for Title IV. The NSR program enforces compliance with individual plant standards through BACT installation. Title IV allows utilities flexibility in reducing aggregate SO2 emissions. The current SO2 NSPS requires a 70%-90% reduction in emissions, but Title IV allocations for existing coal-fired facilities are less stringent. Facilities installing BACT under NSR may \"overcontrol\" SO2 under Title IV, leading to excess allowances for sale. This could potentially nullify reductions achieved through NSR enforcement if allowances are sold to non-NSR covered facilities. Title IV does not adjust allowance allocations based on NSR enforcement. The interaction of NSR enforcement with title IV could potentially nullify reductions achieved through NSR if excess allowances are sold to non-NSR covered facilities. Title IV does not adjust allowance allocations based on NSR enforcement, creating a potential \"allowance trap\" that would require changes to the law or voluntary surrender of excess allowances by utilities. The situation with potential NOx reduction is complex due to the interaction of NSR and the NOx NSPS, which historically has not reflected cutting-edge technology development. The NOx NSPS historically did not reflect cutting-edge technology until a new standard was set in 1998. The standard for coal-fired facilities was 0.6/0.5 lb. of NOx per million Btu of heat input, but in 1998, a new standard of 0.15 lb. of NOx per million Btu was established. However, this new standard was challenged in court, leading to uncertainty for modified coal-fired sources. The 1998 NOx NSPS set a new standard for coal-fired facilities at 0.15 lb. of NOx per million Btu, but its implementation for modified sources is uncertain due to a court challenge. The interaction between NSR, title IV, and the 1979 NSPS further complicates the situation, leading to confusion regarding emission reduction requirements. The EPA's NSR requirements aim to reduce emissions by enforcing emission rates for existing facilities, regardless of modifications. Some coal-fired facilities have stricter controls since 1995 than the existing NSPS. BACT determinations from 1991-1995 show a range of permitted emission rates, making it difficult to project NOx reduction from EPA's NSR action. EPA believes some sources are evading requirements, but the actual impact remains uncertain. EPA is enforcing NSR requirements to reduce emissions, but the effectiveness of this action is questioned. Some argue that costly litigation may not result in actual emission reductions. Alternative methods like title IV of the Clean Air Act have been more successful in reducing emissions from existing utility plants. Title IV of the Clean Air Act, enacted in 1990, has been more successful in reducing SO2 emissions from existing utility plants compared to NSR provisions. The \"cap and trade\" program under title IV had 100% compliance, while NSR compliance has been questioned. One alternative is to lower the cap on emissions in title IV to further reduce SO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants. One alternative to reduce SO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants is to lower the cap on emissions in title IV. This would achieve similar emission reductions as existing power plants meeting the 1978 NSPS, with some flexibility for utilities. Implementing a new \"cap and trade\" program for NOx could also eliminate uncertainties in EPA initiatives regarding NOx emissions. EPA is encouraging states to consider regional cap and trade programs for implementation. A new \"cap and trade\" program for NOx could eliminate uncertainties in EPA initiatives regarding NOx emissions. EPA is urging states to consider regional cap and trade programs for implementation, which may require new legislation or extraordinary cooperation between affected states. Other regulatory initiatives at EPA are also aimed at reducing SO2 and/or NOx emissions in the future. The EPA is considering alternatives to the NSR program, such as focusing on reducing SO2 and NOx emissions through other regulatory initiatives. These initiatives include the OTR and Section 126 petitions, as well as regulations like the fine particulate NAAQS and regional haze rule. Implementing controls on pollutants like mercury and carbon dioxide from coal-fired power plants could also help reduce emissions. One alternative to NSR is to control pollutants like mercury and carbon dioxide from coal-fired power plants, which could also reduce emissions of SO2 and NOx. Currently, CO2 is not considered an air pollutant under the CAA, and regulating mercury emissions has been slow. EPA argues it has authority to regulate CO2, but this is controversial. Another option is to reform NSR by redefining \"modification\" based on plant age, not physical changes. For example, any electric utility facility 40 years or older could be considered a modification. One reform proposal for NSR is to define \"modification\" based on plant age, not physical changes. This could simplify the NSR trigger but would require legislative action. Another reform idea is the \"Clean Unit Exclusion,\" which would exempt units with state-of-the-art pollution control technology from NSR rules. This proposal defines a \"clean unit\" as one with BACT or LAER installed within the last 10 years. The EPA is considering a \"Clean Unit Exclusion\" proposal to exempt units with state-of-the-art pollution control technology from NSR rules. This proposal defines a \"clean unit\" as one that has installed BACT or LAER within the last 10 years. The EPA is also exploring cap and trade programs as an alternative to NSR, arguing that it provides the same environmental protection at a lower cost and with greater benefits. The debate on NSR has focused on \"grandfathered\" power plants, with concerns about the need for legislative action and the outcome of litigation. The debate on NSR has focused on \"grandfathered\" power plants, with concerns about the loophole that allows older coal-burning plants to emit more pollution than new plants. The term \"grandfathered powerplant\" is often used in discussions on emissions from existing power plants. Many older power plants, built in the mid-20th century, continue to operate without environmental controls. The term \"grandfathered powerplant\" is commonly used in debates on emissions, referring to plants exempt from certain Clean Air Act regulations. These regulations, known as New Source Performance Standards, require new sources to use the best emission reduction technology. Currently, NSPS regulations cover sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter emissions from power plants. \"Grandfathered\" typically applies to coal-fired plants built before these regulations were implemented. The term \"grandfathered\" refers to older power plants exempt from certain Clean Air Act regulations, specifically the NSPS regulations for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter emissions. However, the term becomes ambiguous or meaningless for pollutants like carbon dioxide and mercury that are not covered by NSPS regulations. EPA is required to review NSPS every eight years, potentially increasing stringency for covered pollutants. The term \"grandfathered\" is ambiguous for pollutants like carbon dioxide and mercury as they are not covered by NSPS regulations. EPA reviews NSPS every eight years, potentially increasing stringency for covered pollutants. Title IV of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments changed regulations for existing power plants regarding SO2 and NOx emissions. Some existing power plants were required to meet more stringent standards than NSPS requirements. The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments changed regulations for existing power plants regarding SO2 and NOx emissions. Some existing power plants had to meet more stringent standards than NSPS requirements, regardless of age or grandfathered status. The focus of debate on \"grandfathered\" power plants should consider fuel source for NOx emissions and the title IV emissions cap for SO2 emissions. Age was a factor in allocating emission credits for SO2, but not based on NSPS compliance. The focus of debate on \"grandfathered\" power plants should consider the title IV emissions cap for SO2 emissions and age as a factor in allocating emission credits. Shrinking the current cap on SO2 and implementing a cap on NOx emissions from electric generating facilities are logical approaches to reducing emissions. EPA favors state-by-state emissions caps to address transported pollution programs in the Northeast. The WEPCO decision sparked public debate and congressional oversight. The EPA favors state-by-state emissions caps to address transported pollution programs in the Northeast. The WEPCO decision sparked public debate and congressional oversight on interpretations of CAA provisions regarding modifications of existing sources. New legislation may be needed to bring consistency to NSR provisions and update the Clean Air Act's approach to regulating the electric utility industry's environmental impact."
