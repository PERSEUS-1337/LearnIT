    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Commission on Probabilistic Methods Act\". The Congress recognizes the wide applicability of probabilistic methods in improving efficiency and reducing overdesign in government programs. Integration of these methods in business practices has saved billions of dollars for companies. Federal use of probabilistic methods lags behind industry, but they hold promise for better understanding of safety and environmental risks. Proper application can lead to more business-friendly regulations and reduce costs associated with overdesign. The Department of Transportation could benefit from using probabilistic methods to quantify uncertainties and improve reliability. The Department of Transportation could benefit from using probabilistic methods to quantify uncertainties and improve reliability in transportation systems, which could also benefit other Federal agencies. The Administrator of the Research and Special Programs Administration of the Department of Transportation will establish the Commission on Probabilistic Methods to improve reliability in transportation systems. The Commission on Probabilistic Methods will identify how these methods can enhance the Department of Transportation, assess their impact on ROI and public safety, evaluate technology state, establish uncertainty quantification models, recommend practical techniques, suggest technology development areas, propose implementation guidelines, set reliability levels for safety, recommend safety test guidelines, and advise on creating necessary databases. The Commission on Probabilistic Methods will recommend guidelines for implementation, set reliability levels for public safety, advise on safety tests, create required databases, expedite technology transfer, identify barriers to use, make recommendations for program use, institutionalize values, and suggest pilot projects for evaluation. SEC. 5. MEMBERSHIP. The Commission shall consist of 19 members including a chairperson with engineering society experience, representatives from higher education, government, industry, labor, environmental community, and public interest.
