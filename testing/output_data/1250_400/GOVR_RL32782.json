    "content": "In February 2002, the Bush Administration proposed the \"Clear Skies\" plan to address emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, and carbon dioxide. The plan involved emission caps on electric utility emissions implemented through a tradeable allowance program. The proposal was introduced in the 108th Congress as H.R. 999 and S. 485, and a modified version was introduced in the 109th Congress as S. 131 by Senator Inhofe. The focus of debate has been on the cap-and-trade implementation scheme, with the EPA stating it would deliver guaranteed emissions reductions at a lower cost compared to command and control measures. The Administration's Clear Skies proposal focuses on cap-and-trade implementation for emissions reductions of SO2, NOx, and mercury. EPA has already used a regional cap-and-trade program to control NOx emissions and proposed similar regulations for SO2 and NOx reductions. The proposal also includes provisions to alter existing sections of the Clean Air Act. The Clear Skies proposal aims to implement cap-and-trade for reducing SO2, NOx, and mercury emissions. It includes provisions to modify existing sections of the Clean Air Act, with the belief that certain regulations are no longer necessary. EPA Administrator Whitman suggested that various regulations could be eliminated and combined into a simplified process under new legislation. The Clear Skies proposal aims to simplify regulations under new legislation, potentially eliminating various aspects of the Clean Air Act. This includes combining multiple regulations into one process for utilities, impacting electric generating units and industrial sources. The proposed changes would affect Title I of the Clean Air Act, with distinctions based on factors like location, facility age, and fuel type. The Clean Air Act proposed changes under Clear Skies would impact Title I, with distinctions based on location, facility age, and fuel type. The Act established National Ambient Air Quality Standards in 1970 to protect air quality. The Clean Air Act of 1970 established National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) to protect air quality by setting limits on specified pollutants and emission standards for new facilities. NAAQS are federally enforceable with states responsible for implementing through State Implementation Plans (SIPs). EPA periodically reviews NAAQS to ensure public health protection. The 1970 Clean Air Act established NAAQS and NSPS to regulate air quality. States implement NAAQS through SIPs, focusing on reducing emissions to meet standards. LAER technology is required for new sources in nonattainment areas, while existing sources must install RACT. NSPS sets emission limits for new facilities. The Clean Air Act also established New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for emission limitations on new stationary sources. NSPS for fossil fuel-fired electric generating facilities include limits for SO2, NOx, and PM10. The Act addresses interstate pollution through mechanisms like the NOx SIP Call, which controls NOx emissions from multiple states and the District of Columbia. Under the Clean Air Act, mechanisms like the NOx SIP Call control emissions from multiple states to address interstate pollution. Existing sources in nonattainment areas must meet NAAQS controls determined by the state, while major new sources are subject to NSPS requirements. The Clean Air Act includes mechanisms like the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program, which focuses on controlling ambient concentrations of pollutants in clean air areas. New sources in PSD areas must undergo preconstruction review and install Best Available Control Technology (BACT) as the minimum requirement. States can reclassify areas to allow for different levels of pollution degradation. The Clean Air Act's PSD program regulates pollution levels in clean air areas, allowing reclassification to permit varying levels of degradation. New sources in PSD areas undergo preconstruction review and must use Best Available Control Technology (BACT). States can reclassify areas to allow different pollution levels. The Clean Air Act's program focuses on preventing and remedying visibility impairment in national parks and wilderness areas caused by manmade air pollution. It requires sources built between 1962 and 1977 to install Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) and imposes stringent controls on pollutants like sulfates, organic matter, and nitrates. Additionally, the Act establishes a federal regulatory program for hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) such as mercury, with Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards for major sources. The Clean Air Act focuses on preventing visibility impairment in national parks caused by air pollution. It requires sources to install Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) and controls pollutants like sulfates and nitrates. The Act also regulates hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) such as mercury through Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards. Electric utilities have special treatment under Section 112, with regulations addressing residual risks from HAPs after MACT implementation. EPA must find regulation necessary for electric generating units before issuing MACT standards. EPA proposed a cap-and-trade program as an alternative approach in 2004. The EPA proposed a cap-and-trade program in 2004 as an alternative approach to MACT standards for electric generating units. States can implement more stringent standards for hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) than federal ones. Clear Skies would introduce new authorities and programs, including national cap-and-trade programs for utility emissions of NOx and mercury. Table 2 summarizes the current requirements for fossil fuel-fired electric generating facilities under Section 112. Clear Skies would make significant changes, including the establishment of national cap-and-trade programs for utility emissions of NOx and mercury, extension of the Title IV cap-and-trade program for SO2, and removal of certain authorities related to hazardous air pollutants. Additional authorities would include cap-and-trade programs for SO2, NOx, and Hg, statutory national emission standards for new electric generating units, and the option for sources in other industries to opt into the cap-and-trade program. Clear Skies proposes significant changes including national cap-and-trade programs for utility emissions of NOx and mercury, extension of the Title IV cap-and-trade program for SO2, and removal of certain authorities related to hazardous air pollutants. Additional changes include cap-and-trade programs for SO2, NOx, and Hg, statutory national emission standards for new electric generating units, and the option for sources in other industries to opt into the cap-and-trade program. Key authorities removed or limited include provisions for major sources, changes to hazardous air pollutant provisions, establishment of a moratorium on petitions to control interstate air pollution, reduction of noncompliance penalties under the new SO2 cap-and-trade program, preemption of state requirements for NOx and mercury, and elimination of New Source Review for modifications of major sources. Clear Skies proposes significant changes including national cap-and-trade programs for utility emissions of NOx and mercury, extension of the Title IV cap-and-trade program for SO2, removal of certain authorities related to hazardous air pollutants, and establishment of a moratorium on petitions to control interstate air pollution. Other changes include reduction of noncompliance penalties under the new SO2 cap-and-trade program, preemption of state requirements for NOx and mercury, elimination of New Source Review for modifications of major sources, and various other regulatory adjustments. Clear Skies proposes a cap-and-trade program for SO2, NOx, and mercury emissions, with phased caps and trading programs for flexibility. Phase 1 sets caps for EGUs, while Phase 2 caps would take effect in 2018. Allowance trading program provisions are similar to existing programs. The Clear Skies proposal includes caps for emissions of SO2, NOx, and mercury, with Phase 2 caps set for 2018. Allowances would be allocated based on historic fuel usage, with adjustments for factors like fuel type. New and reconstructed EGUs would have statutory standards for emissions, which are more stringent than current standards. The Clear Skies proposal includes statutory standards for emissions of SO2, NOx, and Hg from new and reconstructed EGUs, which are generally more stringent than current NSPS. The standards would be reviewed and revised every eight years. Additionally, non-utility sources could opt into the Cap-and-Trade Program. The National Emission Standards are reviewed every eight years, similar to existing NSPS. S. 131 allows non-utility units to opt into the cap-and-trade program, with alternative methods for determining allowances based on emissions. Units opting in receive allocations for SO2, NOx, and Hg emissions. Compliance deadlines for hazardous air pollutants are exempt for units in the program. The ClearSkies program allows units to opt into a cap-and-trade program, exempting them from compliance deadlines for hazardous air pollutants under certain regulations. Opt-in units would also be exempt from being considered major sources for 20 years. ClearSkies program exempts opt-in units from certain requirements if pollution control equipment is properly operated. It establishes a \"transitional area\" category instead of nonattainment designations for areas meeting new standards by 2015. This change extends deadlines for reaching attainment and removes statutory requirements for nonattainment areas until after 2017. The Clear Skies program exempts affected units from major source requirements under Parts C and D of the Clean Air Act for 20 years after enactment, unless located within 50 km of Class I areas. This exemption includes NSR, BART, and BACT requirements. Clear Skies exempts affected units from major source requirements under the Clean Air Act for 20 years, unless within 50 km of Class I areas. It also revises Section 112 to exclude regulation of hazardous air pollutants from electric utility steam generating units. Clear Skies would revise Section 112 of the Clean Air Act to preclude regulation of hazardous air pollutants emitted by electric utility steam generating units, except for non-mercury pollutants based on public health concerns. Any controls imposed would need to be supported by a peer-reviewed study and could not take effect before January 1, 2018. Units opting into the cap-and-trade program would be exempt from compliance deadlines for hazardous air pollutant regulations. Clear Skies would establish a moratorium on Section 126 petitions under the Clean Air Act, with more stringent requirements for acceptance after the moratorium. This would impact the ability of downwind states to petition for control of interstate air pollution from affected units. The amendment to Section 126 of the Clean Air Act would restrict the Administrator from requiring submission of State Implementation Plans (SIPs) with effective dates before December 31, 2014. The Administrator must consider emissions reductions needed for nonattainment areas when reviewing petitions under Section 126. Additionally, the Administrator must ensure that emission reductions from affected units are cost-effective compared to other sources in upwind areas. The Clear Skies proposal aims to reduce penalties for noncompliance with sulfur dioxide cap-and-trade programs starting in 2008. The current penalties of $2,000 per ton of excess emissions would be fixed without inflation adjustments, potentially lowering the costs for noncompliance. Section 406 of the bill proposes to reduce penalties for noncompliance with sulfur dioxide cap-and-trade programs by fixing the penalty at $2,000 per ton without inflation adjustments, potentially lowering costs for noncompliance. Additionally, the bill limits states from interfering with the transfer, sale, or purchase of allowances, allowing increased emissions in jurisdictions with less stringent regulations. The Clear Skies bill proposes to limit states from interfering with the transfer, sale, or purchase of allowances, potentially allowing increased emissions in jurisdictions with less stringent regulations. It also eliminates New Source Review for Modifications of EGUs for 20 years, establishing National Emission Standards for new EGUs but not for modified units unless they are reconstructed beyond a certain threshold. The Clear Skies bill eliminates New Source Review for Modifications of EGUs for 20 years, setting a threshold for reconstruction of units to determine applicability of National Emission Standards. BART requirements for major sources operating between 1962 and 1977 are also eliminated, exempting EGUs and opt-in facilities. The Clear Skies bill eliminates BART requirements for major sources operating between 1962 and 1977, exempting EGUs and opt-in facilities. It also specifies that affected units within 50 km of a Class I area would remain subject to PSD requirements. Under the PSD program, Class II areas are permitted to increase ambient concentrations of SO2, NOx, and PM within statutory limits. The Clear Skies bill exempts affected units in Class II areas from offsetting emissions to maintain air quality within specified limits. It also extends deadlines for ozone and PM2.5 standards, creating a new transitional area classification for areas expected to meet standards by December 2015. The Clear Skies bill introduces a new transitional area classification for areas expected to meet air quality standards by December 2015. Transitional areas would not face penalties until 2015 and would be exempt from certain statutory requirements. If an area fails to meet the standards by 2017, it would be designated nonattainment and required to implement controls to reach attainment by 2022. The Clean Air Act's Subpart 2 requirements for ozone nonattainment areas may be eliminated under the Clear Skies bill, allowing areas to qualify as \"transitional\" and potentially roll back statutory requirements if they can demonstrate attainment by 2015. Additionally, the bill proposes the elimination of conformity requirements for ozone and PM 2.5 nonattainment areas. The Clear Skies bill proposes to reclassify ozone and PM 2.5 nonattainment areas as \"transitional,\" potentially allowing them to roll back statutory requirements if they demonstrate attainment by 2015. This would eliminate conformity requirements for these areas until 2018, affecting federally funded projects. The bill also includes structural changes for electric generating units and industrial sources under Title I. The proposed Clear Skies legislation includes significant structural changes for electric generating units (EGUs) and industrial sources under Title I. These changes eliminate location as a variable for controlling EGUs, regardless of whether they are in attainment or nonattainment areas. This would also impact the allowance system and states' ability to set stringent rules on EGUs in nonattainment areas. The proposed Clear Skies legislation would eliminate states' ability to set stringent rules on EGUs in nonattainment areas and restrict trading by EGUs within those areas. Additionally, the state's enforcement mechanism, NSR, would be eliminated for EGUs covered by Clear Skies. This would impact the ability of states to achieve attainment goals and control emissions effectively. Clear Skies legislation aims to create allowances for utilities to sell to upwind utilities, restrict state's ability to set stringent rules on EGUs in nonattainment areas, and establish transitional areas to avoid additional controls. It also aims to protect Class I areas within 50 km. Clear Skies legislation aims to create allowances for utilities to sell to upwind utilities, restrict state's ability to set stringent rules on EGUs in nonattainment areas, establish transitional areas to avoid additional controls, and protect Class I areas within 50 km. The legislation addresses the controversy over EGU age and aims to reduce the disparity between new and existing sources by setting up allowance reserves. Clear Skies aims to reduce the disparity between new and existing sources by setting up allowance reserves. Existing sources would have an advantage over new facilities under the allocation formulas. Table 4 provides an overview of the regulation of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants under Clear Skies. Under Clear Skies, regulations for mercury and other hazardous air pollutants would change for Electric Generating Units (EGUs) and industrial sources opting into the cap-and-trade program. Unit-specific standards would no longer apply, making it harder to address areas with high mercury concentrations. States setting stricter standards would not have full control, as allowance trading could still occur. The Administrator would still have authority to address non-mercury HAPs from EGUs under certain conditions. The state legislation regulating mercury would allow utilities to sell additional allowances to upwind utilities not covered by the state's regulations. The Administrator retains authority to address non-mercury HAPs from EGUs under strict conditions, including a peer-reviewed study on public health concerns. Former Administrator Whitman highlighted the central issue of Clear Skies' interaction with the Clean Air Act. Clear Skies will not meet the 8-hour ozone NAAQS or fine particulate NAAQS within current compliance deadlines. EPA's analysis shows that some nonattainment areas will require additional measures. Clear Skies will not achieve the 8-hour ozone NAAQS or fine particulate NAAQS within current compliance deadlines. Some nonattainment areas will need additional controls and time to reach attainment. The opt-in provision of Clear Skies is unclear, potentially limiting state and local authorities' options to achieve NAAQS attainment. Mercury contamination remains a concern, with Clear Skies proposing modest controls on mercury from electric utilities. Clear Skies proposes modest controls on mercury from electric utilities, which could limit state options to reduce mercury emissions. Compliance deadlines under Clear Skies may be extended, impacting air quality standards attainment. Compliance deadlines may be extended under Clear Skies, impacting air quality standards attainment. Early reductions in a cap-and-trade program may lead to increased emissions later on, complicating compliance strategies for state and local authorities."
